Little did you know as you woke up this morning that from now on you'd be living two lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour day began as any school other day. Reluctantly crawling out of bed and slowly getting dressed before rushing through breakfast and running off to catch and, like most days, miss the bus. You then started your long walk to school. Along the way your best friend since elementary school, Morgan Neeps joined you in your voyage. You were then passed by your older sister Katrina in her Baby Blue sports car as she made her way off to University.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you approach your school you see the soccer team practising in the field across the street. Your eyes follow Melanie Trenton, captain of your school team as well as Student Council President. Having had a crush on her as long as you could remember, you were often embarrassingly shy and clumsy in her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the school you are joined by childhood friend Halima Mussari as she gets off her bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as your classes go, nothing exciting happens. At lunch you, Morgan and Halima go to your favorite spot, an exterior balcony overlooking the school's courtyard. The three of you had never seen anyone else up there and so you had sorta claimed it as your own little spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way home on the bus you wind up sitting beside Jackie Torrent, Head Cheerleader and daughter of Millionaire Joe Torrent, owner of Torrentine Petroleum Industries. She spends the entire trip texting someone on her cell phone. On the radio you hear the music of Andrea Oldgoods, a country music star Halima is a fan of. Across the aisle you see someone reading a magazine with the picture of Carmen Mermarck, a local athlete, on its cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get home you find a package on the doorstep. Taking it inside you see that it is another album by Li Noshi, an Asian artist who your sister is a big fan of. You then settle down to do your homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner you go to your room to play a video game. Through the wall you hear Your Mom talking about a south american singer who seems to be doing quite well for themselves recently. After playing your game for a while you go to have a shower and are about to go to bed when you notice a story on the news program your dad is watching about a famous diplomat who had just returned home to London after a visit to Moscow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drift off to sleep you think vaguely about Rita Beaufield, one of the top developpers on a new video game that was due to come out early next year. You had seen her photo in one of the magazines Morgan had shown you today at lunch time. Closing your eyes you are shocked when you open them up again only to find yourself in the body and room of...</span></div></div>",

One because she ate to much the night before and she had a WEAK stomach. Two, you where your sister, your hot sister, well, other people said she was hot, but you never bothered; but you where your sister! Three, being a girl was so very uncomfortable. You had breasts, which moved every time you moved, and they added to much weight to your chest. Your bladder is further down, and it had nothing to, filter it, if you were. For all you know you have a vagina, but you couldn't feel it.  You could not run around felling like this. You bounce a little, trying to shake it off,  but that is a mistake because you get grossed out by her beasts bouncing, which is grosser actually feeling them. You decide to get dressed for her, considering you have to go to school for her. You shuffle through her stuff, which seems so wrong to you, till you find a bra. You walk over to the miror and you feel quesy, but you had to do this, her breasts where getting anoying. You remove her thin blue top, and her breasts were revealed. Truly, they were good breasts, so you are not totally grossed out. You brush her blond hair out of the way for the fifty time, and it really gets on your nerves. You put the cups on her breasts and hoop some straps around your shoulders and turn around to fasten the back, but that takes a long time. \"Why can't these things have instructions?\" you whisper under your breath. Once you finish up you have to work on putting some of the straps in the right place. To decide if you did well you bounce a little, and the bra dose give leverage, but it dosn't give the the full affect. <br>\r\nYou shuffle through the cabinets again till you find what you've been looking for, a spagettie strap. Thank god it is a lot easier than than the bra. You bounce a little again. It isn't the best leverage ever, but it works. You shuffle through her closet till a black, wordless t-shirt. You couldn't go to school like this. But you wern't done yet. You go to her pants side and after what you just went through, this would be easy. You find her panties and stair at them. You would have to wear these! They looked like torture to wear. You set them on her bed and you take her pants off. You look down on her bare legs, and for a split second you have the smallest idea of doing something, but you brush it off. You put the panties up and have the hardest job of getting them smooth without putting your hands between her legs. </span></div></div>",

This took way longer than you thought. For a second you have the bad though of her taking a shower, but then you remember she showers at night. You get up and continue dressing. You get on what you gess is an over shirt, and it is green. You go over to the the vest side, and you find a brown leather vest, and you find that it looks better open. You walk over to her miror and smile, for a boy you did really good. You walk over to the bathroom to see if you needed make up, and you do. You work for a good thirty minuets on getting make up on, which knowing your sisters style isn't that hard. You then turn to the difficult task of doing her blond hair. You decide to keep it simple and add no acsesoies. You take to the task of brushing her hair, and to get it as smooth as she usually did you had whole hour of your time out, You head out to break feast where you have.</span></div></div>",

You walk over to the bathroom to see if you needed make up, and you do. You work for a good thirty minutes on getting make up on, which knowing your sisters style isn't that hard. You then turn to the difficult task of doing her blond hair. You decide to keep it simple and add no accessories. You take to the task of brushing her hair, and to get it as smooth as she usually did you had devoted a good 20 to 30 minutes of your time.

So that would mean....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to take a shower as well.\" You finish your sentence. That would be logical of course. It's only bugging you that you were about to see one of your best friend's body like that. Well it was something you would need to do, or else showering would be impossible. But there is also a small part inside of you that is excited to look at her naked body like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly decide to continue your business. You open a drawer from a wardrobe and pick up a bra and panties to wear. You remember your sister also changing her underwear each morning so you guess Halima does too. You then walk out onto the hallway, luckily everyone seems to be downstairs already. You make your way to the bathroom and lock the door behind you. You walk over to the bathroom mirror. \"I'm not sure if you can hear this Halima, but I need to shower as you and I need to see your body to do that. I'm sorry for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then grab the pajama pants and pull them down together with the panties Halima was wearing this morning. You then swallow hard and pull the pajama top over your head and quickly face the shower. Not wanting to look downward yet, you step inside the shower cabin and put the shower on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot water appears from the shower head and as it touches your skin you notice your skin is much more sensitive. You could stand here for hours just enjoying it, but you realize you have to get to school. You wonder where to start with the top or the bottom?</span></div></div>",

Wouldn't she get it cold that way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that the moment comes you feared, Halima's torso. It's not like you are not curious about your friend's chest but it's awkward. You know Halima would never wanted to become more than friends with you and you had the same opinion about that. But still you felt yourself getting excited at the fact that you would look at your first real breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you swallow hard as there they are, her budding breasts. You smile a little inwards, Halima's chest isn't that big but the size of her breasts suit her physique. You gently touch a breasts and are immediately amazed by the softness of it, it feels like you're holding a marshmallow. Nice! You think as you continue squeezing your breasts. It's only that when you realize your lower body feels odd that you probably went too far. The pleasant feeling fades away and now you feel rather embarrassed. You quickly wash the rest of your body and clean the soap off. You then turn the shower off and step outside and clean yourself with a towel, a bit cautious around your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then pick up the panties and put them on, they feel comfortable as they cover your ass. But then you stand there with the bra in your hand. You're not sure if you have enough time to put it on. Perhaps you could just walk around without a bra?</span></div></div>",

Seeing as how Halima would want you to scrub her body thoroughly you decide to go through with it. You move your hands beneath the vagina and you slowly scrub around making sure to clean it. Problem is though that Halima's body seems to be sensitive around her vagina, it begins throbbing more and more and Halima's body wants to let it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I promised myself not to do it. You think as your hand moves around your vagina, the throbbing is becoming unbearable. Halima's body really needs it, you apologize beforehand to Halima for not being able to control yourself. You wished you had begun with your breasts, maybe then things wouldn't happen like this. Your finger traces around Halima's vagina not being able to withstand it anymore. With a small moan you make your finger enter your vagina. You make your finger rubbing the inside of your vagina while your other hand is frantically grabbing your breasts. You don't know why but your moans are getting louder and you can't help yourself but feel amazing when you get your orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the orgasm is finally done your senses return to you, knowing what you did to yourself. You're terribly ashamed of yourself not knowing what to say to Halima when you would see her. You used her body to satisfy your pleasures, you feel like the worst friend. Though a little voice tells you that this was the best orgasm you ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly wash away the juices left by the orgasm and leave the shower. You then put on the panties quickly, but then you're halted when you hold up the bra. You're not actually sure how to put it on. And you're not even sure how long it would take you. Reminding yourself you're running late, you wonder whether you should just leave the bra off then. The thought about it makes your nipples a little harder.</span></div></div>",

You hold the bra in your hand and try to put it on. After trying for several times you manage to put it on. Proud of yourself you squeeze your breasts for a last time before returning to Halima's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you she has already put ready what she was going to wear today, jeans and a white button up t-shirt. Familiar it is to you as you remember Halima wearing it before you entered her body. Weird. You think as you put your clothes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then go downstairs where you see the rest of the family sitting already. You eat your cereal quiet as you don't want the rest of the family to find out their daughter is now replaced by their daughter's friend. Strangely you can hear some of the talking between Halima's parents even if they don't speak English with each other. That's really weird. You then grab Halima's backpack and go outside. You see the bus in the distance, you could catch a ride with it. But Halima usually goes to school on her bike, which could be interesting too. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Disoriented from the loud bass tones thrumming and vibrating off the granite bathroom countertop, you numbly reach for the paper towel dispenser. The young woman who you recognize as Linda, your next door neighbour, matches your movements. You stare back at her as she wipes off some leftover vomit still dangling to her silky, black hair. Her face looks a reddish flush... eyes are a beautiful green... cute little upturned nose... plump lips hanging open in confusion as she stares right back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it finally clicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the mirror... that's you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can scream, another girl Linda's age bursts into the restroom. \"There you are, Linda! We were looking everywhere for you! Yikes, you don't look so good.\" You steady yourself against her shoulder as you realize Linda is wearing a pair of impossibly high heels. Aside from being probably lights-out drunk, you were in no condition to walk wearing those stilts of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huhhh? Where... where am I?\" You groan, feeling the club music pounding against your pretty little head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, did you really drink that much? Come on, we're waiting for you outside!\" The girl said.  She propped open the door and you staggered into a hallway lined with glitter and lit with flashy neon lights. You gripped onto a nearby handrail and staggered down the hallway, seeing blurs of other twenty-somethings pass you by.  The girl from the bathroom saying something to you over the dance music. The lights opening up into a multicolored swirl as you can't seem to focus on any one thing. Walking out to what appeared like a large ballroom and being embraced by a clique of other slutty dressed girls who were laughing at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you almost fell over on this girl's damn heels and started to loosen your feet free of them, sitting down on a cushioney chair and feeling two alien jiggles on your chest. Then the lights started to mix again and the music boomed and the drinks were passed around on a tray but you've never drank before and not especially in front of these sexy looking girls. Girls who looked old enough to be Katrina's friends and go to the local university so yet how did you end up here again? And... and... why do you have these big boobs and this long hair covering your eyes? Wait. Where did that girl say you were again? The girls are all laughing and having so much fun and your face is numb and tingly and... and everything fades to black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a strange dream,</i> you think. <i>Must have been something from dinner the night before.</i> Thoughts blurry... you must have dreamed you were in a club or something. There were girls dancing around you, some guys came around and bought you all drinks, the music was so loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and squint. Oh God... your head. Your... everywhere. It feels like you fought against a rip tide, with ocean waves dragging you against the undertow and beneath the water repeatedly. Your head is swimming and the daylight pouring through the windows is very very bright. It is definitely morning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're laying on a couch with your head propped up against a feathery pink pillow, underneath a warm blanket. You feel weakened and would have chalked it up to the dizzy feeling you think might be a hangover, but as you toss aside the blanket and raise yourself to a sitting position, you see the same astonishing sight as last night. The same large boobs pressed inside a form-fitting backless dress hugging your body down to the thighs. Pink nail polish coating the tips of your fingers and toes alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess it wasn't a dream</i>. The dull ache in your feet serving as a real reminder of what... of <i>who </i>you've become. Somehow you got back to Linda's house from the bar from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've become that neighbor chick.\" You speak aloud, hearing Linda's airy female voice escape your lips. Sounding way different from the deep voice you've grown accustomed to. You press a hand to your neck and feel smoothness where your Adam's apple should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of feeling... you roam southward and squeeze your new boobs in each hand, moving underneath the bra and fondling them curiously while circling the tips of your new nipples with your fingers. An unexpected pleasant sensation as you pressed your palms up against them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too fricking strange!\" You exclaim aloud. <i>I need to get out of this dress into something more comfortable</i>. Woozily standing up and brushing more dark hair out of your face. You realize you can really only manage a feminine mincing with the short strides allowed by this tight dress, hips pitching and ass wiggling at each step, feeling absolutely ridiculous as you trudge over to what appears to be her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping off the dress, you look in the mirror once again. The disheveled, frightened face of Linda Burns staring back at you. If you're in Linda's body right now, living her life... then where is she right now? Your heart skips a beat. Could she be in your body right now? Living your life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the closest pieces of clothing you can find, strewn on the floor next to the bed. A cotton sorority t-shirt that fits snugly over your new chest, and a pair of shorts that slide up your hairless legs and conform to the shape of your ass and hips. Linda possessing a very womanly figure indeed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering your bearings, you fill a glass of water in the kitchen and relieve your cotton-dry mouth. Despite being neighbours since she moved in and started attending university, you don't know much about her. Being a high school student, your social circles don't overlap with hers. Overhearing once that she is studying theatre and that your best friend Morgan Neeps has a crush on her, about as infatuated about her as you are with Melanie Trenton it seems like. But that's about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is Linda Burns? Nobody else is around, so you explore her house. Still feeling exhausted and hung over, you rummage through her refrigerator and settle on some leftovers before plopping on the couch and turning on the TV. Considering whether you should check her cell phone for the messages occasionally pinging on there, but seeing as they're not from anyone you recognize you let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours go by. You bite the bullet and grudgingly use Linda's toilet, missing how simple it is to 'point and aim'. Feeling thoroughly embarrassed at having to sit down but what else can you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough it's evening again, and you're flicking through Linda's phone at pictures of her friends, the university campus, recognizing one or two girls from the club in those pictures. They sent Linda several texts today, wondering if she's OK and if she's feeling better and if she's gotten over somebody named Darren. Finally you decide to send a few messages back without too much substance, just enough to let them know you had fun and are taking it easy today. You politely turn down an invitation to go out partying again since it's Friday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... <i>Friday </i>night? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the calendar and sure enough... it's Friday. But didn't you spend that day going to school and hanging out with your friends as you... Jacob Wermer? The sluggishness in your mind hasn't completely ebbed and you'd rather not worry over details like that. Not as important as finding out why you've become this girl and how to turn everything back to normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall asleep once again and sleep soundly for the rest of the night. Tomorrow.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sound of its skipping along the surface pierces through the stillness of the early summer morning. Ripples spread out from the spot where the stone finally sinks beneath the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you stop doing that??\" Whispers Halima Mussari, your other good friend. Not taking her eyes off the bobber floating close by the ripples' epicenter. Her fishing reel clasped tightly in her hands. \"You'll scare the fish away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Hallie, I bet even the fish aren't up yet. It's so early,\" Morgan yawns lazily, scratching his belly and taking a swig of energy drink. \"Jacob, you mind getting a lure out for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" You reply, reaching into the tackle box and handing your longtime friend a sparkling, metallic minnow-shaped lure. It's only a 45-minute drive out of town and into the mountains, the lake, hidden away from those who aren't aware of its scenic beauty. The way the sun breaks over the mountain's crest, spilling out a thousand shades of pink and red. Sunrise at exactly 6:47 am. Large broad leaf trees carpeting the mountain and surrounding watershed. Even the birds are quiet and still. A few weeks ago the frost subsided and it was warm enough to go fishing again -- a fun activity the three of you would do together in the summertime when you could. When Halima wasn't traveling back to see family in Kuwait and when Morgan wasn't busy working as a server at one of the local diners back in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that boat on the docks over there? We need to get one of those. Everyone knows the biggest fish are in the center of the lake, not waiting for us here along the shoreline.\" Says Halima. \"You can work a third job, right Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost splurts out his energy drink. \"Yeah right! And why am I the only one saving up for a boat? How about you two pitch in for a change? It's a miracle I can find a way to get Saturdays off, otherwise I've got no free time including school. You heard that my boss is trying to get me to work graveyard shifts too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard it... sucks to suck!\" Chirps Halima. \"School's over soon anyways, then we've got the whole summer until college. That should be enough time to, like, rent a boat for at least a week right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Captain Jake, what do you think?\" ... \"Hello! Earth to Jacob, do you read buddy?\" ... \"What's up, man? That dream from last night still eating you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Having spent the morning walk into the forest describing your strange, seemingly fantastical out-of-body experience as your neighbour Linda Burns. Halima and Morgan not knowing what to make of it, aside from simply calling it a dream. A whacked out, super detailed dream, but a dream nonetheless. Not real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reminds me of that old Chinese man Zhuangzi,\" recalls Halima. \"You remember English class the other day? The man who dreamed he was a butterfly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's a weird idea,\" comments Morgan. \"If we're all like the dream versions of someone or something else. Like that movie <i>Inception</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never saw that movie.\" You reply. \"Any good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shrugs, taking another stone and tossing it into the lake. A fat thunk sounding as it smacks the water, almost paralleling the sound of Halima backhanding Morgan for being dense enough to do that again. \"Hey! Take it easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an idiot.\" She grumbles, reeling in her line and realizing that a fish had already taken the bait. Nothing but a clean hook remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be an idiot, but at least I'm smarter than a fish!\" Morgan laughs before jumping up, scurrying into the trees as Halima chases after him with her walking stick she found in the forest. \"Get back here Neepwad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those guys...\" You chuckle to yourself, setting down your rod and checking your cell phone, surprised that you still had good reception way out here. Seeing several missed calls from an unknown number. \"Scammers... even Saturdays aren't off limits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat number even sent you a text message! You open up the message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Who is this? Are you Jacob?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumbing over to the Delete button, you then proceed to block the number and enjoy your fishing trip undisturbed. Not giving the random number a second thought for the rest of the morning and afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan drops you off at your house later that afternoon and you wave him goodbye. Carrying your fishing pole, backpack, and a small cooler in hand, you say hello to your mother and sister before heading to the backyard to start cleaning some trout for dinner. It was a good haul -- fried fillets for everyone tonight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile running water from a garden hose over the insides, your Mom steps onto the back patio and calls out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earlier today one of the neighbours stopped by asking about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt, not taking your attention off the trout. That is, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's that cute young woman next door... what's her name again? Linda. I think that's it. She wanted to see you when you got back from your fishing trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat. Why now, of all times, would she want to talk to you? Unless... no... it's just a coincidence. \"Okay, thanks Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina doesn't come out for dinner, instead primping and preening herself to go out that night with friends from university. Sealing herself in the washroom, blow drying her hair and listening to hip hop music to get ready. Your Dad comes home after running a few errands, and your Mom does the job of battering and frying the fish along with throwing together several other side dishes. She comments on your nice tan from spending the day at the lake, while your Dad pops open a beer and watches the game on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity getting the better of you, you're about to go next door and see what Linda wanted from you... but you hear the doorbell ring first! Opening the door you see none other than the young 21-year-old herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's wearing flip flops, sweatpants, a long-sleeved top that clearly strains against her sizeable boobs (not that you were trying to stare), and her hair is tied back in a ponytail. She looks a bit out of sorts, and you can see a bit of old makeup on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... this is too freaky.\" She croaks, staring you up and down. Giving you quite an eyeful which makes you feel more than a little uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, can I help you? Did you want to talk to me?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs your hand and pulls you off the doorstep. \"You! You're Jacob... right?\" You nod. She continues, \"Oh my God, it's just like she said! I can't believe this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe what??\" You frown uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, OK? Promise I'll explain everything, but if my parents overhear us they'll think I'm crazy.\" She says, dragging you with her as she pads over to her house and lets you inside. You wonder why she would be concerned about her parents listening in... didn't she move in with her boyfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter her home and are instantly hit with an odd sense of familiarity. Like you've been here before. Some of the items on her coffee table striking you as very familiar indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda, meanwhile, paces back and forth in the living room excitedly. \"Okay, let's see. What was it she said to me again? Dammit! I don't think I've got much time.\" Finally turning to you, she says, \"Jacob, can I get you something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of politeness, and wisely deciding to humour her to an extent, you ask for some tea. The answer pleasing her a great deal for some reason. She heats up some water while talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea how this happened, but I know you'll end up believing what I have to say. You remember the 'dream' you had the other night, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the sofa, you feel a chill run down your spine. How did she know about that??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a few strange dreams last night... yes...\" You answer vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head and smiles. \"You don't have to play coy with me, Jacob. I know everything. Right now, you think that seeing life from the point of view of Linda Burns was just a dream. But you'll find out that it was real.\" Referring to herself in the third person, she adds, \"For some reason, after I went to sleep I woke up again as this woman! Complete with a set of tits and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as she crudely bounces her boobs up and down, obviously not restrained by a bra. \"You wanna give them a feel?\" She asks, which you politely decline. Not sure whether to continue listening to her story or to call the funny farm and ending it right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you the tea and explains hurriedly. \"I tried to contact you earlier today but you wouldn't respond. I should have known better, since I didn't answer when she called me the first time either. Anyway, I don't have much time before Mom wonders where you've went and finds out you've come over to Linda's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen!\" She says, more hurried now. \"I know you probably won't believe this, but when you wake up again, you'll become me, Linda Burns. Just like the night before. I don't know why this is happening, but I lived your life already today and I know what's going to happen before you go to bed tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" You ask, certain that your neighbour is definitely off her meds or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later tonight, Halima is going to call you about a fishing lure she left in your backpack today. She'll want you to give it back to her on Monday at school. I promise you this will happen, just wait and see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ushers you out the door where, sure enough, your Mom is wondering where you've went. You're trying to make sense of Linda's story. Could she be telling the truth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have yet to recieve a phone call, and your starting to think that girl Linda was a freak. After you get out of the shower you brush your teeth and walk to your bedroom to see your phone is ringing. With the towel still wrapped around your waist and water dripping down your head, your heart stops for a minute as you begin to freak out. You hesitate but eventually pick up the phone and its Halima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jacob?\" You hear from the other end of the line hearing Halima's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...yes hello Halima! Whats going on?\" You say as you are feeling weird on what is about to happen next <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you hear the word backpack coming out of her mouth over the phone you rush to your backpack that was next to your bed and open it quickly before she finishes the sentence to find the fishing lure. You take a deep breath and finally answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fishing lure? Yeah I have it in my backpack, I can give it back to you on Monday?\" You say with confidence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Jacob? Reading my mind perfectly, thank you! Goodnight and I will see you on Monday.\" Halima says as she hangs up the phone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is racing to fast you need to go to bed and think this over. After a long day of fishing and being wet all day you couldn't wait to change into your comfortable fleece pajama pants and go to bed. As you change and now all you relaxed you lock your door, turn the lights off and lay under the covers as your mind continues to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright this is not a dream, this is reality. I was really in Linda's body yesterday and she was in mine. How did this happen? Will it happen again? What's causing it? None of this makes sense!</i> You think to yourself as a million other thoughts pop into your head until you reach midnight. You just had enough and closed your eyes and fell asleep. Once the clock struck midnight you felt someone grabbing you from the back and trying to drag you as your body wasn't moving. You are trying to drag yourself down to your body but the force is just to strong. You are floating as you brace through your window and see a figure coming towards you. You try to move but you are scared you're about to crash through another window assuming its Linda's as you see a female body sleeping in bed. As you float through the window you feel that same pulling feeling into Linda's body as everything goes to black...</span></div></div>",

This can't be, Linda was right yesterday. We are not going crazy, we really switched bodies!</i> as you think to yourself. You don't want to get up as your not only still in shock but just so tired for some reason as you notice it's a little past nine thirty in the morning.

You brush your teeth, still shocked at the reflection in the mirror. Looking down you saw you needed to change out of the pajamas you were currently in.

You decided on a simple set of black underwear, some skinny jeans, and a tank top, and left for the park.</span></div></div>",

Your and Linda's house might be so short of a walk but walking to this park felt like it took forever. As you finally arrive to the park as you quickly spot a middle aged women walking around then your old body sitting at one of the benches looking at your phone to check the time. You take a deep breath and walk over to Linda as you see dark clouds in the distances. You notice she is still wearing the same pajama outfit you wore to bed last night as you take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on Linda?\" You smile as Linda turns around with a big smile on her face. \"About time you came! ....Wow I'm shocked you actually got ready. It's supposed to rain all day and as you can tell I don't care how I am dressed because I am super tired. Thanks I guess for trying? But you can get comfortable if you want once you get back to my house....well yours for now. <i>Stupid Jacob....extra work for no reason!</i> you think to yourself as you quickly answer back to Linda. \"Linda you do realize no one is home at both of our houses right?

You both enter the house as both of you take your shoes off, you lock the door behind you and head upstairs to Linda's room. Not even half way up the stairs and you begin to strip down as you take your shirt off. \"Woah sexy! Not even in my room and you're showing off my body!\" Linda says as you both laugh it off as you enter her room. <i>Was she joking around? Was she just hitting on her own body? Is she falling in love with my personality?

It's not like I've ever seen my body naked before, this body-swapping experience maybe a little weird but lets go! Are you going to change or not?\" You smile as you shake your head but yet feeling a little uncomfortable just wearing her panties.

You crawl over to Linda's bed as you just lay down and put the covers over you as Linda in your body is not far behind you as she lays right next to you wearing the same fleece pajamas you wore to bed last night. \"Is this weird to you?\" Linda says as you lock each other in the eyes then look up at the ceiling only hearing the heavy rain outside in the complete darkness. \"No I kind of like it actually, keeps the mood calm as we figure out this swappy situation! So the other night when you were at the bar. What was the last thing you remembered in your body?\" You say as Linda tries to think back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I am being honest with myself Linda is kind of cute, hot even.

You're in an unfamiliar bed, with the sheets poofed up above your chest for some reason. You throw them off and stand up, coming to terms immediately with the female body now meeting your view. The same large breasts bouncing unrestrained within a cotton sorority tee that leaves your midriff exposed, along with a pair of athletic shorts fit snugly over your toned legs. Legs that, while sinewy and smooth to the touch, show a little bit of stubble appearing and in need of a shave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've become Linda... again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smartphone keeps ringing, as apparently someone is trying to call her. You swipe the phone with a manicured finger and nervously place it on speaker mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\" Again, the syrupy sweet voice flows out of your new mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda, where are you? Your shift began ten minutes ago!!!\" Bellows a man on the other end of the line, her boss maybe? He adds, \"You better get here ASAP, this is the last time I'm covering for you.\" Maybe not her boss, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-okay, sorry.\" You reply, trying to think of a decent excuse for not showing up at her workplace, wherever that is. \"I don't really feel like myself this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighed, \"You're not hung over again, are you??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Um... I hit my head the other day,\" You lie, \"And I can't remember certain things. Where do... where do I work again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence on the other end of the line. You know how ridiculous it sounds, but at least it's more believable than 'I'm Linda's next-door neighbour and I've taken control of her body and life for some reason,' and you'd rather not get her in trouble with her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear some mumbling in the background, finally he responds, \"... histrionics, can't deal with this shit. Okay, you work at the Smoothie Spot near campus, remember? Now get over here and help me deal with the Saturday morning rush. See ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you remember now. Having seen Linda wearing the pink and green apron bearing the corporation's symbol as she entered or exited her house on occasion. She's some kind of barista or something. You frantically search through her closet and find the uniform along with a matching cap. Digging a scrunchie out of her drawers and tying her black hair back into a ponytail, doing a quick check in the bathroom mirror before splashing her face with water and rinsing her mouth with some mouthwash. Not having enough time to take a shower or eat breakfast. You toss on a pair of Linda's jeans and struggle to fit them around your waist and hips, as if they are designed to be as tight as possible. Finishing the ensemble with her Converse sneakers, you then grab the keys to her junky, sun-faded car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore getting into her car, you look out her bedroom window facing your house. Wondering what your old body is up to right now, you dial your old phone number. It rings a few times and you dial again, frustrated that nobody is picking up. So finally you send him a quick message. If Linda's living your life right now, she's probably equally as confused as you are... although she hasn't tried contacting you yet for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Who is this? Are you Jacob?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell... might as well head over there yourself before covering Linda's shift at the cafe. You ring the front doorbell and glance at your smartphone as you count the number of minutes you're going to be late for her shift. Finally the door opens, it's your Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Linda!\" She greets you warmly, having liked her almost like a second daughter (after Katrina of course). Going so far as to invite Linda and her boyfriend over for dinner during the holidays the first year they moved in. Noticing the uniform, she adds, \"Can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I need to talk to Jacob about something. It's kind of important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcern forms in her face, as your Mom says, \"Certainly, but Jacob went out fishing with his friends earlier this morning. He won't be back until later this evening. You can come back around then if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her politely and hop in Linda's car to go to work. All the while perplexed beyond belief. <i>Why would she go fishing with my own friends after I just did that??</i> It just didn't make sense. First of all, Morgan only had enough free time to go fishing on Saturdays. She might go with Halima, which would explain how she might have put your friend up to calling you last night about the fishing lure in your backpack. But everything today seemed too familiar... like a huge case of <i>deja vu</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at Smoothie Spot, you stuff Linda's purse and valuables in a locker in the employees' lounge before tying your apron and taking a spot at a register. Thankfully not a total rookie at basic retail service, having spent the prior summer at a similar job and rekindling all the same soul-crushing feelings you thought you left behind. The aroma of baked sweets and roasted coffee beans mitigating the whole 'cog in the machine' feeling creeping up on you after the third hour of monotonous work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancisco, the guy who woke you up this morning, turns out to be pretty agreeable. At least when he isn't staring at your breasts, as it seems not even the loose-fitting apron can conceal those beauties. Choosing to think that the customers placing their orders are simply staring at your flowery name tag fastened onto your chest. He works the other register next to you and carries on conversation between customer orders. Like Linda's friends at the night club, he too expresses his sympathies over some guy named Darren. Mentioning that Linda was much better off without him. You decide to play along and not inquire further about whoever he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, you play the role of bubbly barista girl fairly well. No serious slip ups, with nobody suspecting that some teenage boy is actually impersonating the 21 year old's body and life. You clock out later in the afternoon and drive home, again trying to contact your old phone number without success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a bag of chips and crash on Linda's couch. You had been standing up for hours and your feet are killing you. Not to mention the sensation of bra straps digging in to your shoulders as you readjust them for the umpteenth time. Your lower back aching from the weight of lugging those jugs around all day... wondering how such well-endowed women could stand it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention how hungry you feel, wolfing down a scone and a banana during your 30-minute lunch break at work. Gathered behind the cafe, next to the dumpsters, along with several other female employees on their lunch breaks too. One of them offered you a cigarette, which you politely declined. If Linda smokes, you don't feel any of her cravings at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging out of her uniform into a sensible pair of flip flops, sweat pants, and a long-sleeved top, you gaze out the window again, watching Morgan's car drop your old body off in front of your house. You see him carrying your fishing pole, backpack, and small cooler into the house before hearing him turning on the garden hose in the backyard. You hear him interacting with your family in the same way you might do so. Certainly Linda wouldn't act so comfortably around your family like that. What's going on here??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait until their dinner is over before heading next door. Linda's heart fluttering in your chest. <i>What am I supposed to say?</i> Not that you have much time to think about it. A split second after ringing the doorbell, your old body appears in front of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your old body towers over you, as you stare up at him from the doorway. He's dressed in the same jeans and plaid button-up shirt you were wearing yesterday. You notice him obviously staring down at your cleavage. As he tries to tear his attention away from your globes, the realization hits you all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person, standing in front of you now... is <i>you</i>! You from yesterday! Only... it's not yesterday... you're living a <b><i>double life</i></b> as Linda Burns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... this is too freaky,\" You croak in a feminine lilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, can I help you? Did you want to talk to me?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab his hand and pull him off the doorstep. \"You! You're Jacob... right?\" He nods. You continue, \"Oh my God! It's just like she said! I can't believe this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe what?\" He frowns uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, OK? Promise I'll explain everything, but if my parents overhear us they'll think I'm crazy.\" You drag him with you towards Linda's house, letting him inside. Racking your brain, you try to remember the conversation you had with 'Linda' when you were in your own body. If everything so far has happened already, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's see.\" You ponder, \"What was it she said to me again? Dammit! I don't think I've got much time.\" Recalling the answer you originally gave, you ask him, \"Jacob, can I get you something to drink?\" <i>If he says tea</i>, you think to yourself, <i>then things are happening just as she said</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have some tea, please.\" He replies. You try to suppress a laugh... you knew it! You go heat up some water and explain, \"I have no idea how this happened, but I know you'll end up believing what I have to say. You remember the 'dream' you had the other night, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can sense his discomfort at the question. He sits on the sofa and answers, \"I had a few strange dreams last night... yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and smile. \"You don't have to play coy with me, Jacob. I know everything. Right now, you think that seeing life from the point of view of Linda Burns was just a dream. But you'll find out that it was real.\" You add, \"For some reason, after I went to sleep I woke up again as this woman! Complete with a set of tits and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo drive the point home, you consider doing something the real Linda Burns would never do. Something so provocative that it would have to give 'Jacob' second thoughts about the seemingly unbalanced young woman babbling in front of him in her own house. You grab your boobs with both hands, kneading and bouncing them up and down. Ignoring the oddly pleasurable sensation and declaring, \"You wanna give them a feel??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blanches at the idea, transfixed on you with mouth agape. The tea kettle is whistling now, so you take it off the range and pour your old body a cup of tea, passing it to him on a saucer.  As he gingerly blows on the piping hot tea, you explain, \"I tried to contact you earlier today but you wouldn't respond. I should have known better, since I didn't answer when she called me the first time either. Anyway, I don't have much time before Mom wonders where you've went and finds out you've come over to Linda's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words spill out of your mouth so quickly that he just blinks and says, \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen!\" You says frustrated at how dense you seem to be. \"I know you probably won't believe this, but when you wake up again, you'll become me, Linda Burns. Just like the night before. I don't know why this is happening, but I lived your life already today and I know what's going to happen before you go to bed tonight.\" You figure you'll call yourself Linda for now, since 'Jacob' will discover soon enough what's going on... just like you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later tonight, Halima is going to call you about a fishing lure she left in your backpack today. She'll want you to give it back to her on Monday at school. I promise you this will happen, just wait and see!\" You exclaim. Glancing out the window, you notice your Mom peering out the front door of your old house, no doubt wondering where the two of you went. It had been only about 15 minutes, but you see her making her way over to Linda's house. Time's up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the mostly unfinished tea on the table, you usher your old body out the front door, assured that he should get the same phone call from Halima that you did as well. Regretting that you initially thought this was crazy... but what about living the same day over again as some hot girl-next-door isn't totally crazy??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecounting what happened... this whole double life business started on Friday. As Jacob Wermer you went to school first, and then woke up drunk and hung over as Linda Burns on the same day. On Saturday, you went fishing as Jacob and then woke up again as Linda working her shift. You spent both days as Jacob first and then Linda second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral questions remain unanswered, as you brush your pearly white teeth using Linda's toothbrush, staring into the bathroom mirror. If this continues, will you spend the day as Jacob first and then Linda? When does the switch actually happen? Do you have to be asleep for the switch to happen or is it based on a specific time? Do the two timelines have to be the same or is it pure coincidence? Also, what happened to the real Linda Burns? If you are living both lives, then where is she right now? How long will this happen, and how is something like this even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go on and on. But you're tired after a long day of work, and you can feel sleep crawling over you. As you lay in bed, you wish you had talked to Linda more to learn about her life. Realising that, despite being neighbours, you don't really know anything about her. You close your eyes and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you go to sleep as them, you are back in your original life. When occupying the other body you are living through the same day you just experienced in your body. (if a day has not occurred before you go to sleep again, another change does not occur until a day has passed.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Jacob Wermerand you are 18 years old with al older sister Katrina, your best friends Halima Mussari and Morgan Neeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasic Rules:<br>\r\n1. Don't kill the main character in either life<br>\r\n2. No personality changes<br>\r\n3. Keep events chronologically consistent. (If something happens in the 1st life, it can't be stopped from happening in the 2nd life)<br>\r\n4. Don't end the story<br>\r\n5. You can only speak languages whatever body you are in is able to speak (not all choices will be able to speak english)<br>\r\n6. They only get 2 'lives' to live<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add chapters, characters and as always... HAVE FUN!</td>",
