Keeping a radio nearby them and send all information about the lands, ores, living being and climate to the station on Earth while building a settlement and waiting for more humans to join them in order to take control of the new world and eventualy getting back home with a good pay... or just disapearing/dying leaving nothing behind you but several costs payed by the spatial agency to your relatives if you got any...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince such a job was a chance to get fame and escape from poverty, you obviously joined a crew to explore one of these planets, and your planet wasn't the best choice : Therianthriopia, a planet where the three previous expeditions failed, vanishing without leaving any signal behind.<br>\r\nYou knew that your chances wasn't high to succeed... but you were not alone to think that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround you is a crew composed by about ten persons but no time to know each other, you had to join your cryogenic chamber and wait for the moment you'll wake up when it will finaly land on the planet. But before going to sleep, you had to scan to the machine your crew member card.</span></div></div>",

Mankind has spent almost all minerals on Earth and aimed all its hope above the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joined a crew to explore new worlds to serve the governement and hope to escape poverty, but the planet chosen for your mission was the dreadful \"Therianthriopia\", known to be the one from no one ever come back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fate that you may eventualy escape... or not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------ <b>RULES AND UNIVERSE</b> ------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStick to the following rules and your post won't be edited or deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>General rules :</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Try to type at least more than five lines for each chapter unless it's a choice chapter.<br>\r\n2) Do not abuse choices chapters if it's not necessary.<br>\r\n3) Always try to make the main character behaving in a realistic way. (for example, be at least surprised the first time you meet a furry).<br>\r\n4) To have a novel more uniform and immersive, use a <b>Second Person Point of View</b> in your narration.<br>\r\n5) Take care on the spelling. I won't bother you that much with it but at least try to write properly.<br>\r\n6) Once you have chosen your character, the crash or whatever that makes you stuck on the planet <b>MUST</b> happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Universe information :</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Living in Earth is hard but your character is not obliged to hate his previous life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Anthros' sizes can be different from humans but <b>do not</b> populate the planet with oversized giant furries. I could accept their world to be populated by one or two giant living in a lair but this one should not be as tall as a mountain and should be obviously feared by other anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You can meet humans from previous expedition who could have survived or their equipements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Your character <b>can be armed</b> since this planet could be dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>Death is allowed</b> and end the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>Magic is tolerated </b>but should be not overused, especially when it comes to shrink or transform people ! If such thing happen it should be a way to change back in order to feed the quest instead of blocking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sex and love stories <b>are allowed</b>. Just don't make it too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>You can obviously escape</b> but don't make it happening too early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You can't play as an Anthro unless something changed you for a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Furries' plans to human are up to you. You can decide if they enslave, kill, torture, love or idolize humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Furries can speak the main character's language or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Furries' technology will depend on your choices during the story.</td>",
