I sat up in my hay lined and fur padded bed to look out into the storm. Through my bedside window, I could see the wind and rain battering the limbs of the surrounding trees. It almost seemed that the trees were in battle with and unseen foe... <br>\r\nIn my awe brought on by the scene outside, I failed to notice that my creaked open and a the warm glow of a candle seeped through the crack. It wasn't until the warm glow reflect off of the window caught my eye between flashes of lightning that I turn to see the gentle, feminine features illuminated by the single flame at the tip of a candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mateneal...\" She cooed softly. \"What has you up at this hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply looked back out the window, silently showing her the culprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The storm? Nothing to be worried about, little one...\" She began, sitting down on my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on telling me that the storm was one of the balancing forces of our world and that the thunder was the clashing of arms belonging to the good and evil spirits and the lightning was the sparks from the clashing. I somehow <i>knew</i> that to be true...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at her comforting face, knowing not to question my mother's wisdom. We turned at watched the storm from my bed, listening to the thunder as I imagined the battle before us.

Mother quickly went on to pick me up and opened a small trapdoor that led to a small store hidden at the end of my bed. \"Go, Mateneal.\" She ordered as she sat me on the top step. \"Be quiet, little cub...\" She whispered. I simply gave a worried nod and stepped down the steps quietly, believing that my mother would follow behind. Before I could react properly, my mother shut the door and left me alone with rays of of faint light trickling through small cracks in the floor. I could see my mother step over to the the closet and hid herself among the clothes and shut the door. Just after the click of the door latch, the door leading from the living room was kicked in. I could see the vague details of a burly man... A bare forearm tattooed with a black dragon coiled around it and a heavy goatee covering his lower half of his face. He slowly walked with a limp as he surveyed the room for anything worth taking. My mother, uncomfortably resting inside the closet, shifted around slightly until a small creak of a floorboard could be heard by me. The man immediately turned his head to the closet before an evil smile slowly crept across his face. He stepped over with nearly painfully slow footsteps, making both me and my mother fear that he found either of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly reached for the doorknob...</span></div></div>",

Alberich was a big man, muscular and dressed in the typical <i>accoutrements</i> of a warrior, which is what he was. On his right arm, he carried a round shield, and over his left shoulder he carried a somewhat implausibly large warhammer, his weapon of choice. On his back, he carried a pack contianing some food and his few meagre pseronsal possessions The only other distinctive thing about him was the peculiar wire framework attached to the front of his helmet, which fixed two round, curved pieces of glass in place in front of his eyes. These were his <i>eyeglasses</i>, a relatively recent invention which helped mightily to compensate for the myopia which had inspired his nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe literal crossroads that Alberich stood at was a sign that read, \"Bahn\", with an arrow pointing to the left, and \"Re'Bahn\", with an arrow pointing to the right. Alberich knew that this was what the sign said, as, unlike the vast majority of the warriors that he knew, he actually <i>could</i> read, the result of a childhood mis-spent actually listening to his teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason he was at this literal crossroads resulted from the figurative crossroads he also found himself at.  He had until recently been in the service of Vrot the Remarkably Unpleasant, King of Snaelgaard, who had recently been removed from his throne in a manner that was, ironically enough, remarkably unpleasant.  Somewhat unsurprisingly, persons who had been members of Vrot's personal guard - as Alberich had - had found themselves generally unpopular in the wake of their former master's overthrow, even Alberich, who prided himself on the fact that he had never done any atrocities, and had, in fact, almost never killed anyone who wasn't trying to kill him.  Anyway, Alberich had found it expeditious to seek employment elsewhere, in something of a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, here he found himself. To the left was the road to Bahn, ruled by King Spessnaack the Short-Tempered, who was said to pay well, but to also be quick to have people executed if he thought that they might be even remotely considering looking at him funny.  To the right was Re'Bahn, ruled by Spessnaack's second cousin, Queen Safiyerra the Virtuous, who was said not to pay so well, but whose personal executioner was said to cry himself to sleep at night because the Queen gave him so little to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Alberich decided to go to...</span></div></div>",
