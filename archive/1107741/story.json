Her rational thought, though, screamed at her consciousness, telling her to run away before it was too late. A long sliver of drool dripped from her gaping mouth, a sign of longing. Jill, however, shook her head free of her animalistic control and sprinted out of the room, afraid of both what would happen if she ate that food and what the virus would do should she eat it. Her strength, however, was failing quickly, her stomach yowling at her for sustenance. Dropping to the floor, Jill gasped and moaned as her muscles contorted and weakened, the cells being starved to death because of the virus's influence. She flopped on her back, wheezing as she wasted away, knowing that soon, her insides would turn to dust and her body would decay...like everything else. But, she noticed something on the left side of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...vending machine?\" she questioned herself, looking at the stereotypical black machine with a glass front. Picking herself up, but feeling sick and frail, Jill managed to slip a dollar into the machine and hit F5, a 20-pack of sticky buns. Mind in a raving state, she didn't notice this not-so-subtle oddity, instead grabbing the package from the machine and tearing it open ravenously. The thick, unusually colored glazing on one of the large buns(an off-color tan) did not deter her, and she dug into one of the hand-sized confections with little concern for the effects of this strange dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sh-sho delishoush! *smack*!\" Jill cried through a mouthful of the fattening-looking treat. What she did NOT notice was that her blue shirt was getting tighter...and tighter...and tighter...and tighter with each passing bite. Her pants were also looking skin tight now, and only into the first pastry. Jill's arms began jiggling a little more as she bit into the sweet treat each time. Cheeks became chubbier as more and more of the glaze spread out onto them. Jill did not notice any of these changes, even as she finished the sticky bun with one last, big mouthful. She burped contentedly, patting her now-skintight shirt where her belly was supposed to be. What her hand met was a soft mass underneath her blue shirt, which startled her. Looking down, Jill could hardly even see over her larger breasts, which obscured the view of her new potbelly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what the-?\" Jill said, stunned at her growth. But it wasn't over. She felt her body seize up, then begin to slowly grow fatter...and fatter...and fatter...</span></div></div>",

Rubbing her hips vigorously, the brunette writhed a bit in pain as the specified body parts began to burn, her skin feeling like it was on fire. Toddling out of the room, trying to pat out fires on her body that weren't there, Jill moaned a little in pain as her shirt tightened over her breasts, and her pants felt like they were constricting her body. Wobbling a bit, she eventually collapsed at the end of the hallway, utterly exhausted as the fires continued to rage under her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...it hurts...\" she moaned, convulsing as another wave of pain hit her. Jill had stumbled into a dead end, the door behind her closing and the passageway sealing off. The only thing left was the stairs...and there were no signs of any bloodstains. Leaning up against the wall, Jill passed out, the pressure from her shirt and her pants as well as the pain finally overcoming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill woke up some time later, moaning. The pain had gone, but her nerves were sore, and she rubbed her thighs gently. \"Oooh...at least it stopped. That had to be the worst thing ever...\" Looking up, she noticed that everything seemed normal, even her body. Her breasts were still a C-cup, and her lower half was still slim and svelt. The swelling must've only been temporary, she assumed, and cracked a slight smile. That was one thing she could count on, at least. Getting up was a little harder than usual, her muscles far more fatigued than she first thought. Jill started down the stairwell, not noticing that in the mirror, her proportions were far more exaggerated than her eyes told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips seemed to be slowly swelling, as well as most of her legs. They had to be at least two, three feet thick! They wobbled slightly, and were slightly squashed against the wall in the hallway. Her rear end had taken a lot of damage too, almost creating a shelf on her backside. Her hips, judging by the size of her legs, had to be around the same width as both her legs combined. As such, she was nearly wide as she was tall. Her breasts, however, did little to alleviate this almost clownish image of the once-thin STARS member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were enormous, at least twice the size of her head if not more. Bouncing up and down softly, their forms had been slowly filled with fat during Jill's unconsciousness, and had swollen to the point of almost ripping her shirt to pieces. It balanced her backside quite well, and allowed her to have complete control over her body. But with every bounce and step, they seemed to gain a few more centimeters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette, however, was completely oblivious to this huge increase in size. Her mind was playing tricks on her; as she continued to swell from the effects of the F-virus needle, she grew more and more fatigued from carrying around her weight, and yet she kept on, not realizing what her exhaustion was from.</span></div></div>",

No fattening blobs, no walking undead or hideous monstrosity roaming the near empty but vastly littered streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but the wind blowing to and from every location...an eerie peace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" exclaimed a random zombie as it was unexpectedly crushed by the fleshy behemoth that had disrupted strangely peaceful atmosphere. The already damned thing couldn't register in it's rotted mind that something like immense was headed toward it and before realizing what had just occurred the zombie found itself underneath a massive shadow! A moment later it was made road-kill by a street spanning fleshy orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncidentally it wasn't the first to experience such a \"death\" and certainly wouldn't be the last. In fact she figured this was about the tenth or so to suffer such a fate, on top of that there was cars that had been squashed into pancakes and the breaking of the pavement with every step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed into her four chins her vast bulk swaying as she did. At roughly two tons of pure walking blubber Claire began to care less and less at what her street-swallowing girth crushed beneath it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being fatten to 4K in weight Claire realized the two blobs were gone but that was only because they were now housed within her and had been digested into a titanic amount of fat. Obviously she had outgrown her attire now only left with a very stretched black bra that only served in covering the tips of her breasts and an equally black and stretched pair of panties that now took more of a thong appearance thanks to Claire's now car-sized butt cheeks nearly swallowing it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts and belly had also taken quite a hit as well. Her amazingly still perky (must be the bra, thought Claire) breasts had shared the same fate as her butt and ballooned to car-size, a quick sense of sudden pride washed over Claire as she realized she no doubt had the world's largest chest. But that came to an end as she later spotted how her belly now extended many feet before and as already stated was the width of an everyday street!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was amazed though how despite being filled up with so much flab her belly did not drag, sure it hung toward her hallway-sized kneecaps but still had no problem moving around. Another realization struck as she came to the conclusion that even though her arms and legs were just like the rest of her immense in size she could still stand and on top of that move around. The blobs must have altered her mobility allowing her to move about even with all the weight she was carrying on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here was Claire at two tons walking, or waddling, aimlessly about town crushing what could be crushed beneath her grand girth. Her mind plagued with numerous thoughts, Sherry, the little girl's safety, the zombie outbreak, how Leon could possibly be doing, those fattening blobs, and on top of that what did she ever do that got her cursed and ultimately resulted in her being the size of a whale!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed again, her body in turn wobbling...again. She was certain today was not turning out how she could have ever imagine it to be like.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blobs lunged at her unexpectedly, throwing the two-ton brunette for a second. Quicker than a flash, they had simply pounced on Claire like rabid beasts. Green and filled with ever-fattening sweets, Claire steeled herself for one hell of a stuffing and opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two slimy blobs burrowed their way past Claire's lips and into her gut, filling only a portion of the vast space that was now her belly. It was the last straw for her body, and the enormous brunette plopped on the ground, her legs giving finally from the added weight. Huffing and puffing a little, Claire smiled weakly as Sherry came over. The blonde girl had a lot of difficulty climbing her friend's soft mass, mainly because every step caused her to sink into Claire's soft, blubbery form. Eventually, she reached Claire's face, which was peeking out from behind chubby cheeks. \"Claire! How did you get so...so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big? Being forcefed by those things that attacked you,\" Claire said jokingly. Although it was the absolute truth, it still cracked a smile on Sherry's face. Settling on one of Claire's gigantic breasts, Sherry grasped the immense woman around her fat neck in what could be considered a hug. \"Anyways, you were lucky you didn't get fattened into absolute oblivion by those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...but if you got so big by eating two of those, won't you grow even larger now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes opened in remembrance. \"Oh yeah...crap. Any second now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was right on the mark. After about three seconds of waiting, the blobs having been fully digested in her massive, blubber-filled belly, her weight began to climb slowly, but surely. Her thighs, already the width of the street or wider, began to blimp up with more fat. The blonde girl felt Claire's body rumble a little as her thighs swelled immensely, becoming fatter and softer than before. They squashed against nearby buildings, then began to fill up as space to fill out became scarce. The black, lacy panties she had on were about to become a pair of what men called 'sexy panties' as her buttcheeks began to fatten again, billowing behind her in giant spheres of fat. Her breasts soon followed afterwards, the car-sized mammaries becoming even more engorged as the blobs' calories stored themselves in Claire's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her belly! Oh, her enormous belly. It crashed through the nearest wall, having built up the pressure so much as to crack the brick. Already extending about ten or fifteen feet in front of her, it soon added another five or six to it with the blobs' mass. It grew upwards if it could, making her breasts sink into it as they grew larger and heavier. Her arms were essentially useless at this point, weighed down with about 200lbs worth of pure fat. Claire moaned as she continued to grow larger, the ordeal slightly painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body continued to swell and swell, billowing about in the small intersection. Her titanic bosom eventually collapsed the walls of two buildings, having become about SUV-size. Enormous, fattened, and incredibly obese thighs spilled out into the side streets and filled them to the max, trapping Claire between the three stores. Her hips and ass only compounded this as her massive cheeks were quashed behind her flabby back, and her hips just exuded more intense pressure on the buildings, preventing her from moving much. Claire's belly rose before her like a leviathan before her, blocking her view of the street a little. Fattened hands grasped at what little she could, trying to soothe her sore body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry came out of a trance, enthralled with staying alive and staying on top of Claire's sea of fat. Shaking her head a little, she glanced at Claire, who had another two chins added to her four. Her face was bright red and she was moaning a little in pain. Numbly, Sherry asked one question: \"How big are you <i>now?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette only moaned a little in response. \"Ugh...I have no idea...taking one heck of a wild guess, I'd say I was about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clare stopped, apologizing under her breath. She couldn't really stay too mad at her; Sherry was only six. She didn't really understand how a woman was about her weight quite yet. Still, it did seem possible. At first she was worried all this fat would make her a prime target for zombies, but at this point trying to fight her would be like if they tried to fight a steamroller with their hands tied behind their backs. Clare felt her confidence swell along with her chest and belly as she drew in breath and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sherry. I think by this point you should hide away somewhere in my bulk. You'll be safe there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, o-okay but...where?\" Sherry stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare paused. Her belly button, which was quite deep like a small cave of sorts, would be a nice place but it would be a long slide for Sherry and a possible short climb for any zombies who sniffed her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in between my breasts? Then I can keep an eye on you and make sure you stay safe.\" Clare said with a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry tried to smile as she found her way in between the bulbous perky boulders of fat atop Clare's chest, snuggling between them and feeling herself reminded of the comfort of her bed at home for a moment. Clare tried hard to move her arms, struggling with the fat pillars that must have been large enough to knock down buildings if she so wished. However, the blobs dissolving inside her stomach seemed to help readjust her insides such as her bone structure, organs and so forth so her body could support her absurd weight without any worry, her right arm slowly shifting forwards, the fatty mass squishing against itself as well as her belly as Clare used her thicker, fatter hand to gently pat Sherry on her blond head. Sherry's face brightened a bit as she snuggled between Clare's boobs like they were some form of massive security blanket made of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another shift of her immense belly, Clare busted down the wall in front of her and waddled her way out her immense form jiggling all over practically as debris fell around her safely. Sherry ducked within the massive, wobbling mounds of alluring flesh as the brick fell around her and caught in some of Clare's folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherry, what do you see around us?\" Clare asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry wondered why she was asking her, when she realized Clare's blubbery neck and grandiose chins made it extremely hard for her to turn her head far enough to even look both sides before crossing a street. Sherry looked around in front of them. No zombies in so far, but a lot of overturned cars as well as some smoke rising from the horizon into the bleak night sky above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing so far.\" Sherry said after her recon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare nodded as best she could stand to, her chins slapping together as well as against her massive blubbery chest, making Sherry cry out as Clare's titanic bosom wobbled wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry!!\" Clare pleaded as she stopped her breasts with her hands and thick arms. Sherry shook off her dizziness and looked up at Clare with a weak smile, only for Clare to smile back and waddle onwards, massive cracks spidering under her thick fat feet as she proceeded down the road.</span></div></div>",

There was all that rolling fat given off by her belly, the massive round spheres serving as her breasts and she could barely make out the mountainous mass behind Clare that served as her rear end along with flared hips and thick fatty pillars which served as her legs. It wasn't exactly a bad looking sight to behold, especially in comparison to the death and desolation of what was Raccoon City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Which is why I'm here. Now if you know of anyone named Chris or...maybe if you ran into someone named Leon...\" Clare continued, wrapping her explanation up. Ada had zoned out, only recently snapping back as she tried to look up where she could make out Clare's fat face above her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I did run into Leon a bit earlier. Gave him a bit of a hand at the Police Station, but no more then that. I have my own reasons why I'm here anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where did Leon go next, can you tell me that much?\" Clare pressed, eager to make sure her companion in this hellish scape was safe and sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno where he went but...I may have an idea.\" Ada shifted her stance, crossing her arms as she thought for a moment.</span></div></div>",

She thought back to Claire's outrageous form all that shapely blubber she couldn't wrap her mind around how such a thing had happened, why the young woman didn't seem to be flipping out of her damn mind, or how Claire was somehow still alive surely that much weight should have crushed her insides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again there were hordes of undead and who the hell knows what else roaming the dying city so perhaps a living blob girl wasn't too much out of the question. That said she about to comment on where she believed the rookie cop had gone to when the trio were all startled by a strange inhuman sound!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda readying her pistol while Sherry literally dove back into the comforting area of Claire's ballooning breasts neither were familiar with what was coming but Claire was and after what had already occurred this was the last thing she was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\" questioned Ada as another of those strangely fattening blobs, much larger then those from before, reared it's \"head\" from around a corner a block or two down the road. Sherry having taken a quick look cried out in horror before sinking back into the safety of Claire's incredible cleavage, the little girl shivering in terror causing the brunette's massive chest to jiggle relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fear I already know the answer but is that...thing responsible for your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! I've...had a few actually.\" Claire stated as plainly as she could and she didn't have to outright see Ada's face to make out her questioning expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly she wanted to pointed out that she did it for Sherry but right now really wasn't the time to go into deep conversation. Those things were deceptively fast and she already knew what they were capable of and there was no way she was letting Sherry get exposed to that sort of change. However there was now Ada to consider as the woman was currently aiming her weapon at the monstrous blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't! Shooting it will just waste your ammo. We have to move now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda ignored the realization that someone as enormous as Claire was ordering for a hasty retreat, just how was someone like her going to get away in time? Of course she was reminded that she had a child with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing mentally once again Ada found herself in the position of helping out someone despite her instincts telling her to simply leave them to their fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go then! Get yourself and the girl out of here. I'll find a way to deal with this monstrosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way Claire respected Ada's decision, hell if she were in that same position she would have done the same, but she also knew how easy it was for those things to overwhelm their opponent and she couldn't bare to think of another woman falling to the same fate as her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the earlier warning Ada opened fire on the blob clearly with the intend of drawing it's attention to her and leaving the others out of it. The blob easily angered proceeded to surprise Ada with the high speed it showcased despite the eclipsing mass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it even though Ada was standing firm Claire knew that if she was going to make any sort of move it had to be now!</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, Clare was unable to pick up her bigger, bulkier legs and move them in time as the blob seemed to rear its way towards her. However, it was given pause as its form rippled from a few more shots echoing out from Ada's gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you son of a bitch! I'm right here!\" Ada taunted, drawing the blob's attention. Quick as lightning, the blob stretched itself out and gave chase. Ada backed away and tried to run, but the sentient mass flowed and chased after her, trapping her legs within its gelatinous mass. Ada struggled to pull her legs out, but it was in vain as the blob \"looked\" at her. She felt time slow for a moment before she found herself forced to swallow up the blob as it traveled down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda gripped her abdomen as her belly swelled out with lard and cellulite at an alarming rate. Her breasts ballooned out in size under her dress, which seemed to warp to fit her growing bulk even as her bra seemed to be giving out underneath and digging into her deepening back fat. Ada's legs became very plump and thick as they grew and grew, the fat turning them into fleshy tree trunks in terms of their size as they swelled up. Her feet plumped up inside of her heels, which caused them to feel painfully forced in before she tried to see if she couldn't slide them out before any permanent damage was done. Ada sighed with relief as she felt her feet slide out thanks to the gooey coating of the blob, wiggling her plump toes as they were freed from the confines of her own footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda's relief was, however, also part of the lethargy brought about from her forced feeding by the blob. Her body grew further into obesity in terms of bulk as she felt the blob was not even halfway done forcing itself down inside of her. Ada could feel a pressure in her belly from how full she was, coupled with a mix of euphoria brought about by the blob to make her relax and give in to the feeding. Her belly started to reach closer and closer to the pavement as her tremendous bosom continued toe expand, pressing against her developing third chin as her rear and wide hips could not be fully contained by her dress, showing off part of her wide flanks and the risque black lace panties she wore underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRPPP!!\" Ada felt a large belch pass her lips, allowing the pressure and trapped air in her belly from her feeding to escape. Ada sat atop her billowing buttocks in a daze, a sort of partial feeding coma as she mindlessly rubbed at her billowing belly. The Asian woman's body had billowed forth into the range of 2,500lbs, making her as much a blob as Clare, if only on a comparatively smaller scale. She didn't know weather it was the effects of the euphoria induced by the blob or some delusion she was having in her daze but...something about feeling this full and having this much of a bountiful body had an uncanny allure to it. With half closed eyes, Ada looked up, witnessing a silhouette approaching.</span></div></div>",

That said while Sherry was safe for the moment she still felt concern for Leon, he was a fellow survivor and he was out there alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought over the young man's possible predicament Ada was busy regathering herself still tremendous frustrated with herself and the forced fattening. She had gotten careless and she was better then that...but at least it had just puffed her up instead of outright ending her life, then again with this new mass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nARGH! Frustration boiling within her she still had enough sense to know that Claire was right they had to move, as best they could anyway, and to do that she had to get off her ballooned butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet much like Claire when the young woman had been fattened to hell Ada too struggled in finding her footing. She was far too proud to admit that her rear and belly were possibly too heavy to lift off the ground on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's having a hard time getting up.\" Sherry pointed out as she popped out from within Claire's canyon of cleavage. The brunette agreed with a quick nod, thankfully the action wasn't enough to cause her grand girth to jiggle like no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on let me help you up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I had ordered you to leave with the girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was rather surprised when Ada had seemingly out of nowhere snapped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay one) I don't take orders from you, two) I don't leave anyone behind understand, and three) now more then ever we need to help each other out...if we don't we die in this hell hole of a city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire explained choosing to ignore the slight glare being shot in her direction. Ada was clearly in no mood for a lecture even if the much bigger woman was correct in some ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on just take my hand.\" Claire stated as she offered a pudgy limb out in Ada's direction. Unsurprisingly however Ada instantly shot the help down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that wasn't very nice!\" Sherry pointed out having popped up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl wasted no time diving back into the safety of Claire's bust after the fierce glare she had received from Ada. Claire doing her best to calm Sherry before turning her attention back towards Ada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered her help again only to be shot down, again and so it went with Claire desperately trying assist while Ada was clearly not having any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dammit why is this woman so freaking stubborn! We don't have time for this.' thought the blob of a brunette who seem to be stuck in a power struggle with the, as pointed out, stubborn Asian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't require your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I do not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the dark atmosphere of their current location it was rather comical to hear the two tremendous women arguing back and forth as if they were both back in same grade school as Sherry, who understandably decided to stay completely out of the verbal battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit release me!\" Ada yelled as she pulled away her thick meaty arm with all her might desperate to break free from Claire's strong grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Now will you stop being so damn stubborn!\" Claire yelled right back her face flush from anger as she pulled with all of her remaining strength. Strength that took Ada by surprise as it was far too much for the woman to combat against and at last their struggle came to close...however it was not without consequence as Claire too had underestimated her own strength and as she pulled Ada off the ground she also pulled her straight towards her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two feminine blobs collided into one another their bodies jiggling like vats of jello as they crumbled to the floor in a fatty heap, unaware if they had set off a mild quake due to their combined five tons of girth crashing into the earth's surface...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later Claire felt herself begin to gain consciousness trying to remember what had just happened, luckily it appeared as if her enormous flab had shield her from injury for that she was thankful...what she wasn't thankful for was what she came to notice laying right on top of her...it was Ada!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed in flushed surprise just as the \"smaller\" woman's head began to clear up as well. While she didn't let out a yell Claire did notice a faint blush cross Ada's puffy cheeks clearly flustered the woman let out a slight sigh as she turned away attempting to hide her expression from Claire's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess she has a soft side after all.' thought Claire amusingly the two of them staying as they were for some time more neither sure as to what to say to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sherry deep within Claire's wondrous breasts wondered what had just happened and what on earth was keeping her from being like a gopher and popping out from her hidey hole, it seem to her that something was weighting down on Claire and keeping the girl in the massive mounds. Luckily and despite the sea of fat surrounding her a decent amount of air was still able to sneak though ensuring she wouldn't suffocate, at least for the time being anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Claire the brunette was just about to ask Ada if she could please get off of her, remembering that Sherry was still housed in her breasts, when Ada suddenly interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet. I hear something...we're about to have company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great that's just what they needed more problems and admittedly it still amazed Claire how outside of her initial reaction Ada seem to be taking the whole piled-on-top-of-one-another rather well, or maybe she just had a good poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she too soon heard what the other woman had and now more then ever did she need Ada to get off as she laid eyes on...</span></div></div>",

Not only were there at least a dozen of the things, there was a thirteenth, the unluckily numbered one absolutely massive in comparison with multiple tentacles springing from its form as it waved them about. Ada wondered if it was a trend many of Umbrella's monsters happened to have tentacles of some kind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we keep...\" Clare's voice died out as she realized it was painfully obvious with how big they were, the two women would stand out as easy targets from a distance. At the least, her blubber provided such size and thick fleshy armor she was almost undaunted by zombies now, but these blobs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing I need is more fat...\" Ada sighed aloud to herself. She wasn't even sure how, but her body like Clare was altered so she could still move, at least, but all this massive fat on her ass, her blobby, bulbous belly, these massive fatty pillars that were her arms and legs, her massive boobs-okay that last one was kind of alright. But aside from that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this time we run for sure!\" Ada cried out. Despite her size and how awkward it felt to move her legs, the blubber woman was still able to waddle at a good speed, her size helping to cover the gap and allow for greater distance as she followed behind Clare, who seemed to be moving much faster thanks to her being better accommodated with her own massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blobs charged forth, the leader showing a bit of tact by guiding each one with its tendrils, as if it were giving hand signals as it stood back and watched the two women wobble as they tried to waddle away, watching the lazy movements of their backsides. A pair of sunglasses that was somehow inside the blob's form floated up to the area that may have been where it would have had eyes, if it actually had them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda was panting and sweating as she tried to keep herself balanced while going as fast as possible, stumbling around a corner just as a blob charged for her, causing the sentient mass to slam into the side of a bus so hard that it splattered against it and all over the pavement around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what....*huff* what the hell do these...*Haah* *Hahh* blobs want to make us so fat for?!\" Ada bemoaned. She still wasn't wholly over the loss of her figure yet. On the other hand, she felt a strange urging in the back of her mind, memories of the euphoria and pleasure that came from swallowing that first blob. Ada felt her breathing become more ragged as her pupils dilated and she felt a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian woman shook her head back and forth, her chins swaying as she did. Now wasn't the time for that! At best, she needed to see if Clare, Sherry and her couldn't find shelter before she and Redfield covered the whole city in their fat...</span></div></div>",

She was just about to warn Ada that one of the jelly beasts was catching up to her when she noticed the plus ton woman cut, well more like stumble, around a corner the bull-like rush of the blob appearing to be be it's own undoing as it spattered onto an abandon bus spraying chunks of it's force all across the automobile and the area nearby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry sighed hoping that would mark the end of one less monster to deal with...unfortunately the poor girl was wrong as the supposed fallen beast began to retake it's original shape as it regenerated together piece by piece!

Sherry's told me of a warehouse up ahead...hopefully we can lose them by diving in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry seem to notice that despite her becoming more adjusted to her grand size Claire couldn't continue on indefinitely. Her breathing was increasing at a rapid pace and she could already see the flushed expression along with the beads of sweat flying in multiple directions. Her enormous guardian was tiring, she assumed so was Ada who had even less time to adjust to her weight, they needed to get in there now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for the hurried up trio they were able to outrun their pursuers, at least to the possible entry point anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherry hunny get the door! Quickly there's no time!\" ordered Claire as she and Ada served as look-outs, both still semi-exhausted from the rush from moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl did as told sliding down Claire's vast bosom and belly then ran the rest of the way she made it to the entrance a few seconds later but soon a new problem arose, the door that had been slid shut refused to open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as she might, especially given that she was still a child, Sherry simply could not get the door to allow any sort of entry into the building! Precious time was burning away as were arms from all the force of strength she was using, strength that at her young age her body simply didn't have enough of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted she called out to Claire informing her of their new problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great just what we needed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In ways expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere the bloated ladies respectful responses. To make matters worse they could still hear the sounds of the blob pack closing in on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.

We're getting in there one way or another!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry again did as told as Claire requested for Ada's assistance, for once the Asian woman didn't argue as she waddled on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have any sort of plan best to make use of it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire purposely ignored the usual snark-filled tone instead explaining that together they should be able to lift the door off the ground. Ada seem to agree as the two heavy-set ladies got into position counting down before they started to lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rolling door was being amazingly difficult even for the two of them, although neither had yet to fully recover from earlier, their faces flushing over as drops of sweat ran down their vast forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it seem they had reached their breaking point the door finally gave up much to their silent rejoicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherry get in now! Don't worry we'll be right in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an understanding nod the little girl made her way inside waiting for the two blobby women to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then instructed for Ada to enter while she held the door open. She was unsure if the woman would protest again but it seemed she'd never get to know as they overheard the sound of the blob pack getting even closer. If Ada was indeed correct they were about to swarmed by them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling rather humiliated due to it taking a bit of squeezing to get through, warning the child and bigger brunette to not allow a single laugh to escape their lips, Ada at last got through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime however was running short as the pack had finally spotted them, more so Claire's grand form, the woman could almost feel that glasses-wearing blob from before leering at her gigantic backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Redfield get in here, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda's outburst serving to clear and refocus her thoughts, the blobs were coming and she was officially out of time so Claire did the only thing she could think of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make way I'm coming in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two of them out of the way Claire surprised both Ada and Sherry by literally rolling herself inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had picked up from Ada's attempt that simply walking in would be troublesome, if not impossible due to her greater size, so why not act like a soccer ball sailing into a goalie's net. Not the most respectable entrances but at least she was inside with Ada and Sherry and that's all that really mattered at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards they allowed the door to shut behind them if they had struggled to get in hopefully that meant it would keep those monster blobs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly exhausted from the entire ordeal Claire and Ada sat down, the ground rumbling a tad bit as they did so simultaneously, Sherry volunteering to be something of a lookout for the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but stay close sweetie I don't want you wandering off again.\" Claire stated with a smile at the little girl's sudden act of bravery.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to sit down, but with her size and her massive rear, she would need Clare to lift her up off the floor again after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda blushed at the thought. She was still a bit hung up on when she and Clare collided into each other, 10,500 combined pounds of blubber hitting the pavement hard. She was surprised the two of them didn't fall down into a sewer from that impact and she was able to see an impression of Clare's massive, peach like ass embedded into the tarmac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda only felt her blush strengthen. Why in the hell did she bother to notice the shape of Clare's ass, especially after they almost got hounded down by a pack of those blobs! This wasn't the time for crap like that, she needed to think for now. It seemed she wouldn't be able to find Birkin's research and honestly...after all she had gone through so far she was ready to just give up and run off. To hell with all this double agent crap, she just wanted to get her advance and kick back somewhere like Rio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda looked over with her steely eyes as Clare looked down at Sherry. The little girl groaned as she pulled at the latch on a large storage container, yanking it open as multiple prepackaged foods poured out, almost covering the poor girl in a gastronomical avalanche had she not stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we at least have food for as long as we hole up here...and there's water pumps in here if we get thirsty.\" Clare observed as she surveyed the warehouse floor, which was sort of like a small living room for someone of her proportions, as well as significantly less head room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense but...still pretty full after swallowing a massive blob not five minutes ago...\" Ada snarked as she glared up at Clare's fat face with a vacant and unamused stare, which looked sort of like a puffy, oblong pumpkin, even more so as the ponytailed brunette puffed up her cheeks. Sherry, having not eaten in a little while, tore open a package of chocolate chip cookies and started to dig in happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare laughed a bit and even Ada couldn't help but looses up a bit and even smile as she watched Sherry, in spite of all the hell she went through, lighten the mood almost instantly. She was still a child, through and through. However, she still likely lost her parents and on top of that, she would probably need serious therapy after all was said and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda frowned as she found herself thinking a bit too much maybe about the logic of the moment, but mostly at the thought Sherry was very likely orphaned. Clare was busy making small talk with Sherry to lighten the mood as neither noticed Ada's mind wandering as she looked down at her body. Maybe once she was out of here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare looked over at Ada, her mouth stained a bit with crumbs from potato chips Sherry had shared with her. Now that she had time to think, she found her mind wandering as she found herself staring at her bulbous body. The look of her fat flowing even in the dim light of the...wait, what was she thinking?! Maybe she was still a bit tipsy from being fed so much blob, yeah that was it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry herself stole a glance at the shutter door to the warehouse, which stood in firmly for now, but what if the blobs came again? They were quite quiet for now when they seemed to come at the three of them so aggressively earlier, it was weird. The actual peace they had for now felt bittersweet as they relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...why have they been so quiet?\" Sherry spoke up nervously as she voiced her concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare and Ada looked at each other before staring at the door as well. They had to admit, Sherry had a point. On top of how single-minded the blobs seemed to be in fattening up the two women, that one leader blob seemed much more intelligent. And those sunglasses must have meant it was much more annoying than the others or at least a huge douche. Seriously, who wore sunglasses at night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if one breaks down I guess I could eat it...\" Ada said, groaning afterwards. \"I mean they aren't killing us...just making us fat and annoying the crap out of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare was about to object, but then she realized...Ada had a point! These things didn't hurt them, kill them, they were <i>less</i> threatening then the run of the mill zombies, even! if one did slither in somehow, all either of the mammoth beauties had to do was swallow up the gelatinous beast and that would be it. Sure, they'd be tons heavier but still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was only a minor problem though. There was still mutants, zombies and lord knows what else out there! They needed a plan, a way to get out of here and find any survivors they could...</span></div></div>",

She silently watched Claire make her way over toward the \"smaller\" woman the massive brunette pulling out a box of a cupcakes from within one of her folds of fat as a gift offering of sorts. Ada merely staring at her as if she were half-crazed while Claire sighed as she shot her an amusing yet awkward grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusy with her snack Sherry couldn't quite make out the conversation the two were having with one another but it sounded to her as if Claire was pressing on Ada to eat something so she'd get her strength back while Ada repeated that she was still quite full not to mention that Claire had literally pull the tasty treats out of her multi-ton bulk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way it amused Sherry to see the two ladies argue with one another seeing as it served as a way to lighten the mood somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she popped another cookie into her mouth Sherry was rather surprised at the speed-eating but she assumed it was due to the whole \"trying to stay alive\" factor from the past few hours. That said she still thought over the pack of blobs that were seemingly determined to hunt them all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda had brought up a good point that if any of the monstrosities got in either she or Claire could simply devour the blob whole but Sherry had seen first hand what eating one too many of those things could do to someone's figure. Claire bloated to an inhuman amount while Ada roughly over a ton with just one blob entering her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed that eating them really was the only option the ladies has as she recalled that one blob that had healed itself right up after it had splattered all across the pavement during their chase from earlier. She still hadn't told Claire or Ada about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished up the box Sherry placed it safely aside and was just about to tell the massive ladies about what she had seen earlier when her hearing picked up on a faint dripping. Was one of the pumps leaking? The place did seem to be abandoned in a hurry given the amount of food left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over at Claire and Ada, it seem to her that her enormous guardian had at last gotten Ada to eat a cupcake or two, and decided not to bother them it was just a minor leak after all so following the sound it didn't take long for her to come across the source...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out it wasn't any of the pumps leaking this seem to be coming from one of the vents high above on the ceiling. A gooey substance staining the warehouse floor that looked oddly familiar but the lack of proper lighting made it a tad bit difficult for the girl to know for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to reach for the sizable puddle when she heard a yell come from Ada nearly frightening the hell out of her in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from that kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen still Sherry was surprised when she felt herself be lifted off the ground and into one of Ada's thick comfy arms! The woman had amazed the child, Claire, and even herself with her stunning speed. She honestly hadn't expected to move that fast and that quickly what with a literal ton of blubber weighting her down but she had and for that all three ladies were thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment later Sherry realized she had been standing right on a danger zone as one of the blobs from earlier came crashing down from the ceiling the trio surprised at the monster's durability to withstand such a fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...waaaahhhh!\" Sherry squealed like the child she rightfully was as the sound of multiple air-vents broke apart signaling that the blobs had found a way inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified at the situation suddenly going sideways Ada instructed for Sherry to calm herself until she could get her back to Claire. It came as something of a surprise to her that she was willing to do whatever need be to keep Sherry from becoming a victim to this gelatinous fattening creatures. She'd deny it later but maybe she was developing a soft side for the innocent little girl in her arms.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire backed away, trying her best to make sure the three blobs in front of her didn't trap her in a corner. The last thing she needed was her thick, rolling back stuck against a wall while she was being force fattened. On the other side of the warehouse, Ada could only look on along with Sherry, still clutched in her puffy arms like a teeny tiny doll as a fourth blob blocked them off from going to help their ally, forming its mass into long gelatinous, tentacle-like arms. The shutter door was still closed tight and while Ada considered ramming it down with her blubbery mass, she shook her head. If it were that easy, the blobs could have done the same thing, couldn't they? Or were they choosing to be crafty, here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she could, Ada would not deny this: She owed Claire one for helping her and allowing her to tag along and escape the whole of the horde. The blob slithered forwards, reaching towards Ada's body with it's long arms stretching out like rubber as it seemed to try and snatch Sherry! The little blond girl screeched in fear before she felt herself suddenly plunged in between the deep, uncannily soft safety of Ada's cleavage, between her hefty, plush breasts, before the black haired woman grabbed at the blob's arm and pulled it forward, a defiant and fiery gaze in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone.\" Ada said with tranquil fury as she opened her mouth wide, the blob burbling inside, a sign of fear perhaps as it was forcefully plunged into Ada's mouth and down her throat. Ada slurped up the massive blob of slime, gulping it down as the massive being passed her lips, her body billowing forth with new flab and lard. Sherry popped up once more like a gopher as she watched Ada slurp and suck up more of the slimy blob, her form pouring out and covering the floor. The other three blobs stopped and looked at Ada, bubbling inside like the first one, another sign of fear it certainly seemed. Claire herself was impressed at the gusto Ada showed to willingly suck up one of those blobs. Whatever she was focused on originally, it looked like for her, protecting Sherry came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda softly cooed as her hands pressed against her billowing belly. She felt embarrassed that even when feeding on these things willingly, they possessed something inside that caused a euphoric rush of pleasure inside of her. She was lucky Sherry was too young to know about this sort of thing, as she merely though Ada was getting fired up over being victorious over her opponent as she sucked up what was left all at once, her body surging outwards even faster with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire tried to use this chance while the other three blobs weren't looking to find some way out or something to use, when one of her fat-swollen feet stumbled over some canisters. The brunette rolled one out in front of her so she could see past her grand form what it was and her eyes widened with hope when she read the label; \"Liquid Nitrogen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRRRPP!!\" A raucous and uncouth belch passed Ada's lips after swallowing up that huge blob. Her form quivered, the newly added bulk, Ada's weight climbing up to a very hearty 4,800lbs. She glared at the massive blobs, who seemed to shake almost in fear, causing Ada to smirk and give a confident snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I'm not running from any one of you. Sorry boys, but I feel like you wore out your welcome.\" Ada wiped her mouth with the back of her hand as she slowly lumbered towards the blobs, as they almost seemed to recede a bit out of fear before Claire suddenly screamed, \"SURPRISE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ada looked up, Clare threw three cansiters of Liquid Nitrogen, one in each blob. Next, as quick as she could manage, she reached into one of her upper folds and pulled out her pistol, which she had deemed useless until this point, and shot through the blobs at each canister. Their contents released within each blob, slowly but surely freezing each one in place like living ice sculptures as they were frozen solid before they could try and counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda sighed, feeling herself relax as Sherry climbed her way out from her protector's cleavage slowly. Claire waddled around the new ice sculptures sitting in front of them as she smirked at Ada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta admit, that was pretty badass of you.\" Claire chuckled, the mountainous brunette quivering slighly from her own laughter. Ada allowed a single light chuckle to escape her own lips as she looked up at Clare, finding eye contact easier thanks to the added bulk she had obtained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could say the same for you, after that stunt.\" Ada mused as she waddled over, tapping her thick, cuddly fingers against one of the frozen blobs. It was firm, but not frozen solid, kind of like a literal popsicle. Still feeling a sort of lingering pleasure sensation after gulping down that last blob, the black haired woman could also feel an urge to eat these three as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we may as well break them if they're frozen like this. Better then leaving then to thaw.\" Clare muttered as she thought aloud to herself, looking around for a sledgehammer or something she could use, when she nearly smacked herself as she remembered she was over four tons of pure fat which could allow her to easily crush these frozen monsters right here, right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Grrrwwwwll~*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...On the other hand, it was only natural that a big girl like Claire would have a big appetite...</span></div></div>",

Was she really ready to add even more record-breaking weight onto herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach seemingly answering for her as she felt a deep rumble build from within and exit outward, her numerous folds better resembling waves out in the ocean as her tremendous form shook from the hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed from her body's antics Claire decided she had to eat otherwise her belly wasn't going to give her any piece of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay despite what I said earlier...maybe just maybe we just up and eat them all together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence surrounded the lady trio, Sherry slightly confused as to why Claire would want to eat more of those things, Ada inwardly agreeing with the brunette's decision her own stomach while silent craved for more of those fattening blobs, while Claire wished this awkward moment could just end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be best, after all we don't know if they can properly heal from any sort of injuries.\" stated Ada, poker-face as ever, and much to Claire's silent rejoice now that the awkwardness from before had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...actually...\" Sherry politely interrupted pausing for a second until Claire told her it was perfectly okay for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to say how she had seen first-hand how the blobs could heal themselves, Ada surprised she had missed that moment entirely. Obviously this served as a sure sign that only one course of action was remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese three Popsicle blobs needed to be munched on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherry I don't want you being exposed to any of these things so you leave the eating to me and Ada.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire sighed as she looked at the three blobs frozen in place. She prodded at one with one of her fat-swollen hands, her index finger sinking just a tad into the firm surface of the frozen blob. It felt like the ice in a popsicle, if only just a tad squishier. Out of curiosity, the bulbous brunette even took a lick along the surface. A strong, sweet flavor stuck at her tongue, setting off her taste buds as a nigh unrecognizable amount of weight was added to Claire's already mammoth form. To Ada and Sherry's surprise, Claire suddenly yanked off one of the arms on the frozen blob, shocking Ada and her little blond companion as Claire smiled and cooed like a child, treating the appendage as if it literally was just a simple popsicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How in the hell does she stay so upbeat...?</i> Ada wondered inwardly, still sweating a little. She turned her attention away from Claire, who happily enjoyed her blob-sicle as the Asian woman realized the other two blobs were up for grabs. She considered just splitting them, but there was still pangs of pleasure and gratification from the last blob she ate and nearly doubling in weight seemed to almost double her appetite as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling over to another blob, which was closest to the wall, Ada leaned over onto it, stifling a sharp moan as she felt her grand flowing bulk press against the cool surface and took an impressive bite out of the frozen creature. She wondered if, now that it was frozen, whatever chemicals caused a pleasure rush in her would be stifled, so she wouldn't have to worry about any more euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda felt herself give in, moaning softly as she just ate more of the frozen blob in front of her. While Claire was playfully enjoying her own, Ada greedily munched down hers, the rush of endorphins and other \"feel good\" chemicals in her brain encouraging more wanton gluttony. Ada mowed down more, her body filling out further as her flowing blubber only piled on and caused her to grow at an impressive rate. Sherry had to scoot back to get away from Ada's bubbling butt as her back folds further developed, the thick puffy masses of her arms and legs only growing thicker as her blobby belly spread out and her wondrous breasts billowed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda's cheeks flushed as she realized what she was doing, but she couldn't rightly help herself. She looked over at Claire, still basically having fun with her blob as she had taken to sculpting what was left and playing with it before taking bites out of it. The brunette was dangerously close to the ceiling thanks to her bulk; anymore and she would either get dangerously cramped or bust down the ceiling as she and Ada together filled a majority of the warehouse floor with their bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I should take that last one for myself then...</i> Ada queried, justifying her gluttonous greed as she looked over at the blob, but not before she found a hard time of taking her flushed face off Claire's ponderous form... Afterwards, the hungry black haired woman reached over, taking massive bites out of the other blob as she felt the soft, juicy icy being pass her lips, the sweet flavor more succulent then any fruits she had ever tasted as she shoveled and gulped down more frozen blob. Her body poured out, causing her to begin squishing up against Claire with her oozing bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stopped dead after finally finishing her blob, licking some of its cool juices from her adorably plumped lips as she witnessed Ada taking huge bites out of the last blob! She couldn't believe it as Ada climbed higher, starting to closer match Claire's own grand weight as she grew outwards and upwards, her face bright red for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ada, what are you doing?\" As long as the blobs were disposed of, that was fine, but Claire wondered why in the world Ada was acting like a woman possessed, throwing away her calm demeanor and poker face for an expression of utmost pleasure. Ada ignored her, purring as she finished her blob and licked her lips clean, placing her fatty hands against her massive belly as she rubbed the colossal, flowing mass, her arms pressing against her thick sides as her wonderfully shaped breasts wobbled as they rose and fell with her rapt breathing, heaving in an oddly suggestive manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire herself felt rather estranged by the sight, blushing as she wondered what the hell was wrong with Ada? Was there some effect to eating so many of these blobs? It seemed so as Ada turned her half-closed eyes onto Claire's form. Ada herself had blown up to a good 9,750 lbs, matching Claire's 10,870lbs bulk closer than before as she looked at Claire's puffy face, Ada finding herself admiring Claire's huge form, her massive belly and her plump assets, so much so her breathing picked up, becoming heavier as Claire looked on, trying to smile as the brunette backed away slowly and tried not to bang her head on one of the pipes snaking along the ceiling. At the least, Claire was thankful as she looked over and saw Sherry was taking a nap on top of some tarps so there was no way she could be seeing this...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't that Claire was unnerved that Ada seem to be eying her up and down almost in seductive fashion, she was well aware of the curves she possessed although was never one to purposely flaunt them, instead what weird out the five-ton brunette was the clear change in attitude. Was this really a subconscious act or was it something in the blobs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have the answer her thoughts interrupted as Claire felt her massive rear rub up against a side wall, same for her equally massive back, she had accidentally pinned herself into a corner and given how much mass the two of them were in possession of Claire found that it would be rather difficult to escape the tremendous-sized Asian woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ADA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire called out one last time just as the woman's pillar of an arm nearly snaked it's way onto her breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what...Redfield?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pudgy hand coming just short of the bigger woman's bust yet on complete accident Ada unaware of her previous actions would push said hand forward just enough to touch the edge of Claire's right breast! Understandably Claire went rather wide-eyed while Ada's mindset seem to snap back into place the moment she realized what she had just done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Claire felt a streak of heat run from cheek to cheek as Ada removed her hand a look of embarrassment and slight annoyance as she refused to look the bigger woman in the eye. The two stood silent for a moment, Ada seemingly attempting to gather herself and her words while Claire peaked back at Sherry still thankful that the child was ever fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...apologizes for earlier. You must understand this really isn't an easy thing for me to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the brunette understood completely Ada much like herself was a woman who was strong and proud, perhaps too proud that admitting to any sort of mistake was a difficult concept for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright...it's been a long day.\" Claire mentioned with something of a smile surprising Ada with a quick tap on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you can reach that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course now that she was back to her senses the raven-haired woman's usual behavior returned all the same, even if secretly she was surprisingly fine with the reassuring move made by Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're so huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ladies suddenly heard Sherry calling out to them with a clear joyful tone. Guess she was finally awake from her brief nap after all it had been a long day for the child as well and a good deal of Claire was still thankful Sherry hadn't seen anything that had just occurred moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the little girl was right the two of them had blown up to an incredible degree nearly ten whole tons of pure hefty flab when combined together the warehouse a lot less spacious then it first was upon their arrival. Not to mention having become gigantic to the point where they were nearly reaching the tips of the ceiling that once stood so high above either woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry was indeed right and that brought out a realization to Claire's mind.

There wasn't any particular way other then the metal shutter doors, which looked to be made of reinforced steel and the walls were made of concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you did break down that wall when you saves me.\" Sherry said to Claire as she looked up at the bulbous brunette. That was true, but that wall was made of brick and it seemed as if it had been worn down by a combination of time and whatever monstrosities may have been trying to bust it down on their own strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why didn't the blobs bust their way in? Were the walls and doors too strong?\" Ada asked the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have been the case, but on the other hand perhaps they wanted to play it smart, ambush the girls and get at them. ...What were they trying to do anyway aside from make them fatter. The more Claire and Ada thought about it, the less scary these blobs seemed in the grand scope of things, fattening the two up to absurd lengths and keeping them perfectly healthy and able to move and function. In fact, Ada actually felt a bit <i>more</i> hale and hearty after swallowing that first blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems our best bet would be trying to bust down one of the walls.\" Ada thought aloud, looking over at the wall behind her and Claire. \"We could probably bust it down if we press our combined weight against it as best we can or we could try ramming it right out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing against it could knock the wall over and while ramming it would be faster, there was always the possibility they could attract more attention, bring forth more monsters and zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll push it down then. Ada, you take that side, I'll take this one.\" Claire pointed to the designated area and Ada nodded. The two women leaned against the wall closest to them as best they could, their blubbery bulk squishing against the wall as even the fat pouring off their blobby sides squished into each other's own grand form as they continued. Clare's breasts squished back against all of her chins as she sweat and Ada's too as her belly's globular apron almost tripped her as she dug her fat-swollen feet into the floor as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall creaked as dust fell off from it shifting, the two women huffing and panting as they continued to groan and push, wondering if concrete was supposed to be this sturdy. It didn't take much longer, thankfully, as massive gaps fell in front of them, just large enough to give each woman head room and with appropriate width as the wall collapsed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was thankful as she looked through the gaping hole that it didn't lead to an alleyway because if it did, that would have been a sharp kick to the jaw on top of her fatigue. Ada felt a bit proud of her effort inside as she wiped the sweat from her brow with her puffy forearm, making a motion with her plump hand to beacon Sherry over to her side as the little, innocent blond girl used the raven-haired blob's fat like a rock wall to scale her downy soft blubber all the way to the comfort of her bosom, as usual as Sherry nestled herself in between the safety of Ada's quivering, jiggly and soft breasts. She was still a big groggy, feeling the softness of Ada's flesh work some sort of magic on her mind as she felt an urge to drift back into a nap. Ada smiled as she looked down at Sherry's drowsy face, eyes half closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's move, Claire.\" Ada said in a hushed, gentle voice that contained a hint of maternal instinct to it. Claire nodded, her chins wobbling along with the scarcely visible neck that was now mostly coated in thick fat, colliding with her massive bust and causing it to jiggle and wobble slightly as she overlooked the factor that Ada had started to use her first name. Overlooked, but not to say she didn't notice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire smiled as she sneaked a peek and caught Ada on occasion glancing toward her enormous bosom where Sherry was currently napping within. She couldn't quite put her finger on it but something had changed with Ada and she wasn't referring to the sensual act from earlier no this is a completely different vibe one that seem to be born from the surprising desire to protect Sherry at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because of Sherry's young age? She wasn't sure but maybe despite the cold exterior Ada was just like her a woman who didn't have any kids but still possessed the strong maternal instincts to protect any child they came across...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire continued to smile glad that the raven-haired woman couldn't make out her amused expression after all it seemed to her that only just now was Ada possibly warming up to her (and obviously Sherry) no need to turn things in reverse now. Especially since they were still trapped in this hellhole of a city and Claire was still rather concerned for Leon's safety, where ever the rookie cop maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note Claire felt the need to pause their progress for a moment. The two blob ladies attempting to make their way through the city streets as carefully as they could despite their ample girth practically swallowing the entirety of an everyday street...any bigger and they'd for sure start rubbing up against any buildings in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was just about to ask Ada if they should go looking for Leon when the raven-haired blob woman caught sight of something in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be still\" Ada commanded, her eyes squinting as she attempted to get a view the field of fat surrounding her puffed face not necessarily helping either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire asked what it was she saw Ada raised a thick hand giving her a sign to remain silent. It wasn't like before where she was poking away at the titanic brunette with her usual attitude this was different and Claire could easily see that within the woman's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a blob...about two blocks from here\" she paused to make sure she was right, \"it hasn't noticed us perhaps because we're too far\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or because we're beginning to look a lot like it's kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a terrible joke but Claire still found herself mildly chuckling much to Ada's eye-roll, honestly it really was as if they were opposites of one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes there's that too\" Ada said with a smile despite the need to slap one of those adorably puffy cheeks of the brunette who seem to be grinning rather confidentially due to Ada agreeing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point being that where there's one what remains of the pack from earlier may not be too far behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a very good point those things seem to be adapting to moving not to mention attacking as a pack. If this one was passing by did that mean others were near by?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Claire asked not wanting to jump the gun just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We move back around the corner using the building as cover. If there are others around here they certainly aren't in the direction we just came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good plan, too bad we don't know where that thing is going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can look for you, Claire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither woman had expected Sherry to suggest what she just had that and they were still under the belief the girl was fast asleep Ada standing somewhat surprised when Sherry had popped up from deep in her breasts like a cute gopher exiting it's hole in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs brave as she was obviously trying to be Claire didn't exactly agree with the idea of Sherry going off on her own but the girl insisted she'd be fine and careful not to mention she had her two \"big buddies\" to come to her rescue if things did go south. Ada fighting off the sudden blush while Claire giggled in embarrassment although they were hoping it wouldn't have to come to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo reluctantly it was decided that Sherry being the smallest would sneak a peek to see where the blob was headed, her equally blob-like guardians staying behind watching her every move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the child didn't seem to run into any sort of problems as she sneaked and crawled her way through the baron city street eventually making it to the intersection the blob passed by. Sherry doing her best to make sure she wasn't spotted as she peeked on over from the side of a building hoping to catch sight of the gelatinous creature and where ever it was that it was heading to... </span></div></div>",

Not only were they becoming intelligent enough to form pack mentalities, ambush prey and even comprehend emotions like fear, they were even somehow communicating and collaborating among themselves. Much like the many monsters Umbrella had sought to create, these blobs were able to adapt and evolve at an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader blob, who not only wore its douchy black shades over it's \"eyes\" but had now suddenly found a sort of king's cape, making the blob look like even more of an egotistical ass. It seemed to be using its tentacles like how a person would use their hands for sign language, along with its tendril-like arms that added a sort of body language that Sherry could barely make out. Or at least try to make out. Something about taking something and pushing it somewhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she noticed one blob step forward, bubbling inside in a manner that seemed to suggest fury with the leader as it shook and wobbled violently, some form of protest perhaps? The other blobs slowly moved away in fear, making Sherry cautious as for what to expect, when she suddenly saw the massive leader blob grab the deviating smaller blob in its tentacles and pull it in, instantly consuming the traitor and adding its mass onto the alpha blob's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other blobs seemed to nervously wobble and burble inside at the sight of what was an execution to them while the massive leader raised all its tentacles at once, scaring its subjects off along the four winds. It seemed that there was some form of plan among their ranks, whatever it is. It may have had something to do with Claire and Ada, given how much effort they made to fatten the two of her protectors up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry crawled back around to where Claire and Ada were waiting close by, Ada keeping a sharp lookout while Claire was the one to wait for Sherry's return, picking the miniscule blond girl up in her giant puffy arms when she came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two intently stared and listened to all Sherry could tell them. Even with her young, inexperienced perspective on things, the info she had for them was in no way lost on their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're organizing themselves more like an army even? Damn Umbrella sure did a good job of making evolving monsters. Too bad this was the result.\" Ada deadpanned, scowling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it, I barely saw any zombies around lately...Did they get consumed by the blobs?\" Claire wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they try to fatten us up to seemingly no end and they act as Zombie Janitors? heh, I guess it's hit and miss with those blobs, huh?\" Ada mused with a bit of snark, which was rare but not wholly unlike her as she brushed a hand through her raven hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, all those blobs out there on the city...we'll definitely have to move carefully.\" Claire said as she cradled Sherry protectively in her massive arms, Sherry cuddling her face into the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda turned to face the two, as she had decided to come up with some ideas of her own, the Asian woman decided the three of them should...</span></div></div>",

Overhearing Claire call out to her, concern in her tone, Ada pushed pushed those disturbing thoughts aside instead she decided it was best they take another route more specifically one that took them back toward the police station.

On the other hand, the station looked rather busted up. There was a puddle of blood Claire was thankful Sherry couldn't see, even if there was a chance she had seen worse. There was also a smashed window to the side and Ada could swear the floor was cratered and scorched like someone tried to use a rocket launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyone even in here? It feels deserted...\" Claire thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does everywhere else in this dark pit. In fact, I wonder what's going to happen. This whole thing...still feels surreal, like one of those situations that's essentially a nightmare where you feel like you can't wake up from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire mentally made note of Ada's different speaking voice. She had a different composure to her, given she was starting to slowly confess her inner thoughts as well as the emotion she hid behind her mask of a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get out of here. All of us. We just have to watch ourselves.\" Claire said, once again trying to be encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda hid a faint smile by turning her head, her breasts wobbling slightly from the movement of her impressively thick chin against her massive chest as she simply tried to focus more on the task at hand as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we can't find a door, we'll just bust our way in. Besides, we could just use all this fat to keep Leon, if he's in there, from being squashed under the debris.\" Ada observed with cold logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do you have a better idea? And are you really in a place to judge after already knocking a couple walls down on our own?\" Ada sharply interrupted before Claire could rebute her observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had to admit defeat.

Or as best they could manage with the two of them being around 10,000 pounds each, a little over for Claire, a little under for Ada. But regardless, neither of the two wanted to risk falling victim to whatever else this blob was capable of given it's advancement compared to its kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Ada was still keen on the reactions caused in her brain by by sucking up the blobs, the memory of her pleasure trip induced by slurping up the creatures making the raven-haired woman's pupils dilate a bit as she tried not to drool too much from the guilty pleasure she remembered garnering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the two grand ladies took small, conservative steps to create as little sound as possible even considering how much their vast forms jostled and jiggled from the absurd fat content piled onto them. Claire actually had to use her hands to keep her boobs from bouncing and jiggling too much out of fear Sherry would be flung out or at least stirred up into a rather uncomfortable dizzy spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda silently praised her luck that the blob leader had not awakened yet. She wondered if it was asleep perhaps? Not that there was any way to tell as the giant mass of mutant jelly just sat in place to such a degree of perfect stillness it was actually kind of creepy. Not to mention, Ada was suspicious that it could just be a ruse, that soon their luck would turn and they'd be found out. Ada prayed there wasn't as such a thing as being fattened up to oblivion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual however, Claire was focusing more on the positives. With the leader gone, the other blobs would be aimless and panicked, maybe even so scared they wouldn't attack anyone. On the other hand, the eerie absence of zombies did seem to be their doing, since she couldn't think of much else. Maybe the stragglers could be tamed or- nevermind, that sounded kind of stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Leader Blob continued to remain still, even as Ada and Claire were so close to it they were sure that the two of them could easily eat him up and finish him off, leaving the rest of Raccoon City that much easier of a burden for them to explore.</span></div></div>",

Not only was this new menace larger then the leader it was many many times larger then either Claire or Ada! The damn thing's width alone so vast it was practically rubbing up against a pair of buildings on opposite ends of the street while on height the eclipsing doughy mass outdid the ladies by several feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thing really was enormous, hell it was easier to label it as gigantic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a long time the two supremely fatten ladies could feel a sense of fear creep back into their beings from the astounding sight in front and all around them.

Ada threw her pistol back inside the folds of her blubber, deeming it useless as always against these creatures. They were surrounded on all sides and not much of a way to run through the mob, especially with both the huge leader and the even more massive gelatinous blob behind him that seemed to be eager  to force its way down the two ladies' throats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we could just eat them all? We'd probably be fat enough to cover the whole city but...there's less of a chance it'll end with us dying.\" Claire suggested as she frantically fished through her fat rolls, wondering if she had some convenient item stashed between her folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda shuddered at the thought. On the one hand, that made her wonder how it would feel for her to actually do that, making her figure by this point she was essentially going through the same mentality as a drug addict who was just starting out but on the other hand having that much jelly forcing its way inside of her made her fear for the possibility of suffocation or even possibly exploding somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Claire...\" Sherry muttered in fear as she shivvered within the brunette's massive bosom, which was seeming less and less like a safe area for the poor child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get out of here alive. Don't think otherwise or you just may jinx us.\" Ada spoke up. While her tone had its usual coolness to it, it lacked any form of bitter or cynical undertone. Indeed, it actually had a warmer quality to it and not just from what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wondered why the blobs hadn't just jumped them and overwhelmed them as she frantically continued to search inside of her copious folds of fat like coat pockets as she hoped desperately for something that could help her out of this situation, when she felt her thick, fattened up hand grasp something that felt like a metal canister of some kind. Pulling it free, Claire saw it was indeed some sort of canister, painted blue with a pin in the top...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A flash grenade! This is perfect!</i> Claire beamed inside, allowing a cheeky grin to form on her fat face. Seeing the grenade in her hands, Ada shielded her eyes with her fat pillars she used as her arms as Claire threw the grenade. Adding insult to injury, the ordinance lodged inside of the jelly like material of the leader blob, who panicked for a moment before a violent flash of light broke out. The blobs frantically and almost fearfully wailed and hollered as they reeled. Even with no eyes, the presence of bright, sudden light was very unpleasant to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot missing out on this chance, Claire barreled her way through a couple minor blobs in her way, even squishing some of the more miniscule ones under the soles of her fattened feet as Ada waddled behind as deftly as she could manage, the two stomping out of sight before the blobs regained their sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader blob growled and howled angrily as it violently thrashed its tentacles around, smashing against the walls of some nearby buildings and even into some of the other blobs who were unlucky enough to be near his display of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Ada panted as they found themselves around what was once the shopping district, standing outside of the old mall which was now looking worse for wear given the scattered trash and debris around, but compared to other buildings in Raccoon City, it didn't look so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...where did you pick up that flash grenade?\" Ada asked, a bit mesmerized by the luck Claire seemed to posses, more so seeing it before her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it got caught in my fat somehow. I found some other stuff inside here too like some assorted herbs...some ammo...a crank, some emblems...ooh, a Gameboy Color! Score!\" Claire chirped as she found the electronic device stashed in the left folds of her belly. Maybe once she somehow adapted back to normal life, she would look into those new \"Pokemon\" games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( Friendly Reminder: Resident Evil 1-3 takes place in 1998 )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we put enough distance between us and them?\" Sherry asked, still nervous and admittedly shaken up from Claire's massive breasts bouncing around so much.</span></div></div>",

The two of them needed rest anyhow so might as well take advantage of their possible good fortune...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after having forced not to mention squeezing through one of the entrances the blubbery ladies found themselves in a short hallway leading to what was apparently the food court. It was all but abandon however much like the rest of the mall at least from what they could tell. Not wanting to risk her safety Claire instructed Sherry to remain hidden inside the haven of the brunette's bountiful breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the little girl soon popped her head out when the enormous woman's belly grumbled with pains of hunger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your belly's trying to tell you something, Claire.\" Sherry stated with an amusing and equally adorable expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true she nor Ada had eaten in a while not to mention with their recent getaway it was little wonder that they were hungry...well actually she was she wasn't sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda shot a glare that seem to read of \"not a word\" as she overheard the other woman's globe of a belly growl in hunger.

She carted out serving trays of ice cream and whole boxes of chocolate chip cookies. The two fed on sweet ice cream and cookies as Sherry delivered it, feeling relief at having something to fill the burning pits in their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies quivered and rippled slightly with each swallowed mouthful of food as more delicate pounds were added upon their bodies almost instantly, anything eaten going directly to calories and thus, more body fat.

Just a slight mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she had to keep herself and her emotions in control if they were going to continue survive and as she watched the child happily play with handfuls of Claire's soft blubber she figured now was as best a time to excuse herself and scope out any other available shop. After all there had to be something around here other then sweets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps thanks to a bit of luck or maybe her companions were far too busy in their own little world neither suspected that she had made her leave, quite amazing really given her sizable girth. Nonetheless she continued to glance around as she made her way, literally bumping not to mention pushing aside anything not bolted down, further into a deeper section of the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually to her honest surprise she came across a burger joint obviously abandoned yet not without complete power she assumed any visible lights the \"small\" group had come across were being powered by an emergency generator so it didn't surprise her to see a flicker or two of light come from the fast food place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hefty belly grumbling almost in a way to remind her that she had momentarily given up on the sweets yet still desired some sort of nourishment so with an audible sigh, her vast form jiggling like no tomorrow, she wobbled her way on over once again her hopes of losing any of this incredible weight of hers fading as her belly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I heard you the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored the sense of lunacy born from arguing with her own dome of a stomach instead concentrating on reaching the front counter just a few more steps to go until...at last she reached her destination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could spot the kitchen not too far off behind the counter and registers no doubt the storage room was somewhere further in the background.

So it will be back.\" Jill stated her tone dipped in seriousness very fitting an officer such as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have to reunite with my other companions.\" Ada responded her own vocal tone matching that of the brunette's her hunger from before seemingly disappearing at least for the time being anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed you stated you had a child with you rest assured I won't let any harm come to her. By the way I didn't catch your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I didn't exactly throw it. It's Ada Wong just so you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive woman responded with some of her typical behavior a way of lightening the mood as well as being rather surprised at how calm the brunette was handling the sight of her. It was almost as if she wasn't the size of a pack of elephants to Jill or maybe Valentine just had one hell of a poker face much like herself from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well met then, Ada.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was brief but she was fast enough to catch the flash of a smile on the smaller woman's lips. It was hard to say but perhaps Jill was just happy to have some human company regardless of size.</span></div></div>",

She smiled a bit herself as she looked down, pondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you been keeping yourself away from the blobs anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luck, I suppose.\" Jill answered earnestly. \"Plus I can't afford to let myself get slowed by anything with that thing chasing me. I need to be ready no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you did succumb to a fattening, you could use your new massive ass to defend yourself.\" Ada teased in a rare show of humor. Jill herself was a bit bemused, smirking at the comment, but mostly because of just how ridiculous that sounded. Fending off a genetically engineered monster by slamming into it with a big fat ass...then again, she could say for sure that stranger things had happened. She remembered walking into the RCPD and finding a few cops who had been zombified during a surprise party and were <i>still</i> shuffling about in a conga line. Even in death, those souls truly knew how to party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was interrupted by a low rumbling sound echoing through the spacious mall. Jill snapped to attention, looking around quickly as she held fast onto her gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Ada asked. She knew it couldn't have been her even if she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that doesn't bode well...\" Jill responded as she looked around. The mall was still somewhat dark inside, making it a bit hard to see in the distance. Soon, stomping sounds accompanied the low rumble, leaving Jill suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn...did he find me again?</i> She thought.<i> I could try to lose him in here. I have a feel for the layout of the building and I could lure him away from Ada's company. He wants me, so I don't have to worry about risking the life of that child.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda fished through the folds of her belly, finding her pistol stuffed somewhere in the upper shelves. She may have put on several tons within the course of this night, but as long as she could manage to aim past her immense bosom, she would have no trouble giving Jill supporting fire.</span></div></div>",

Forever<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda on the other hand was happy knowing that even with such gluttony to go with their girth, she and Clare could still set limits on how much they ate. For a while, she actually feared the blobs would turn them into mindless eating machines...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Clare, your headache needs to clear up fast.\" Ada said stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whaaat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to keep mpving, else we'll get caught easier.

There was nothing little anymore about the younger lady Redfield and as much as she hoped to never become another victim of those fattening blobs she also hoped that somehow Claire and Ada could after this nightmare was over shed off the literal tonnage forced upon them on this night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire...may I?\" Jill asked curious if she could refer to the massive brunette by her first name rather then her last, Claire agreed to the request her chins almost comically colliding with her stunning bust. Much like before when she had gotten a better glance at the highly fattened women Jill realized vow that any complaints she may have made in the past about her rather sizable breasts in the past was nothing to what Claire had to deal with now. It was almost amazing to think she a full-grown woman could stuff herself inside such a storage of cleavage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last thought nearly rocked her world so she rightfully placed aside and focused on learning what was bothering Claire although it didn't take her much to guess what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire I'm sure Chris is fine. Your brother is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of working with. He will survive this and you'll see him again, you just wait and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob-like brunette seem to understand as she nodded yet again triggering the same reaction from her doughy form just as before. Jill was able to ignore the sight as best she could the second time around though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good because if we're going to survive ourselves we need you completely focused. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh but the truth often is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully Claire did in fact understand the meaning behind the smaller woman's words, words that dripped in such a serious tone there was no mistake Jill was an expert at her craft much like her own brother and perhaps a skilled leader was something their makeshift group needed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent then we shouldn't waste any more time. The last thing we need is to be found out by not only those crazed fattening blobs but as well by the bio-beast chasing our newest companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda brought up some good points the blobs were seemingly obsessed with making them bigger and bigger and she sure as hell didn't like the sound of whatever it was that was chasing Jill around. She hoped it would stay as far away from them as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever something or rather someone soon came to mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" questioned Jill understandably unfamiliar with the name brought up in a rush by Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's...a friend and a fellow survivor! We can't leave him to die in this city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One you don't know if he's even alive anymore two did you forget that we need to get out of this place as soon as possible.\" Ada stated coldly as she cut right into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has to be...I just know it. He's alive and we can't leave him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going back will slow down and set back our own escape. In situations like this you have to accept there will be casualties you can't save everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to save everyone, I'm trying to save Leon! I told you already Ada I don't leave people behind if they can be saved then I'm going to save them with or without you! It's something I learned from Chris and I know damn well he'd do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill could easily make out that things were going sideways quickly perhaps she should step in but not before she felt Sherry pull at her skirt. She slapped one a reassuring smile to ease the little girl's nerves muttering that everything would be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That selfless nature of yours is going to be the end of us!\" Ada yelled in her cold tone as she shot a finger out in Claire's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand how it can be seen as an injustice to help people in need. I thought you had changed and by traveling with me and Sherry had seen that the world doesn't need to revolve around number one or the darkest of outcomes.\" Claire argued hoping she could talk some sense into the disagreeing woman before the conversation completely got out of hand.</span></div></div>",

You win again.\" She said in a calm tone, which surprised Clare a bit. \"If you want to risk us all for his sake, that's fine. I want to believe he can take care of himself, but maybe he can appreciate an extra hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare was a bit surprised to hear that. At first she thought Ada had fallen back on her previous, callous nature, but it seemed she was simply being optimistic in her own way, believing Leon could make his own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and...I would have preferred seeing us all safe as soon as possible.\" Ada admitted, albeit in an oddly bashful manner. If Clare and Sherry didn't know any better, they'd think she was blushing. Clare was just happy that the ice queen Ada seemed to be had defrosted so effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only problem is figuring out where he could be. We scoped out the whole city and who knows, maybe he's looking for us too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point. As far as any one of them knew, he had already passed through sections of the city just moments after they had fled from their fattening predators. Even with the extra back up from Jill, this meant an extra experimental bio-weapon ready to ruin their day along with the alpha blob who probably had Ada's name on top of its list of priority targets after her previous stunts and her botched attack against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now would be a good time to scope out the city for him.\" Clare thought aloud. \"With the zombies cleaned up for the most part, as far as I can tell, only blobs should be left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the monster chasing our new friend.\" Stated Ada. Jill turned her head to the side and coughed. Sherry, however, just stood by Clare's side, her little hand grasped against her fatty digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, with all this body fat we're kind of invincible, right?\" Ada said to Sherry with a smile. \"With all we've done so far, maybe all we need to do is knock over a few cars by belly slamming into them and we could all get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The young girl asked enthusiastically, a bright glimmer of hope in her big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Ada assured her. Come hell or high water, she was making damn sure this kid had a future and one that would be worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill sighed as she smiled up at the two, waddling forwards a bit. \"I have a supplies kit that I could grab real quick before we go, with ammo and medicine stored in an atache case. Just wait outside and I'll meet you all there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda and Clare nodded, the former picking Sherry up and letting her climb into the doughy, soft protection of her cleavage, Ada's boobs trembling and wobbling from side to side as the little blond girl wriggled her way inside their protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later, as Ada and Clare nervously scanned the area while waiting, Jill waddled her way back out, carrying the silvery Atache case she talked about. Ada gulped nervously as she watched the woman's breasts bounce and her ass wobble and sway, feeling her heart beat a bit faster. Internally, she chalked it up to anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...our best bet is to scope the outer parameter of the city. By now, Leon would probably have tried to escape and make a way past all the wreckage and desolation.\" Jill analyzed as she slung the case over her meaty left shoulder with a black velcro sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right. Come on, let's hurry and find him!\" Clare stated as she waddled forth before the other two smaller women eagerly. Ada moved slowly, looking down in her boobs to make sure Sherry was alright, noticing the little girl gently curled up between her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You seem to really like kids.\" Jill stated as she looked up at the puffy face of the Asian woman, who merely turned to her cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be right if I wasn't worried for her in this situation.\" Ada stated, a half-truth really. She was worried for Sherry out of conscience, but she had become more involved. She had taken time to talk with her and interact with her...she pitied the child, wondering what sort of life she would have once she was placed in an adoptive home. Or...maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssooo, uhh...\" Jill was trying to ask something, but her tone was more casual, like she was trying to ask Ada a personal question. The massive Ms. Wong raised an eyebrow as she looked down at the vivacious Valentine, unable to keep her eyes from focusing on her bouncy bosom and butt as she waddled by her side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You, uhh...wanna grab a coffee when this is over?\" She asked, clearing her throat with a visible blush on her face, her dark, short hair casting a shade over her eyes. Maybe it was her heart beating or maybe it was the roaring fire all around her thanks to the city's desolation at the hands of a horde of the undead, brought back thanks to a poorly managed genetic experiment by a corrupt corporation, but something about being around Jill set a certain fire alight in her heart...</span></div></div>",

It pleased her to hear such a casual conversation she recalled Chris stating it was always best for team members to speak with one another whenever possible, a way of keeping one's mind clear and away from distractions or fears. She was rightfully worried about him but as Jill had stated the man was no fool he'd survive she just had to make sure she did as well...she could explain the tremendous weight gain later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she glanced over at Ada, Sherry resting comfortably in the woman's vast bosom, Claire was thankful their spat from earlier had reached a peaceful end. Again she remembered her brother stating that working together with someone didn't always mean you agree with them hundred percent of the time. Ada didn't appear to be a people person at least prior to this night but somehow this entire ordeal was shoving a bit of humanity into the raven-haired woman. Claire amusingly imagined Ada's heart growing three sizes bigger like that green guy at the end of the Christmas special she and Chris would watch as kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever just as she was about to burst out laughing the window to nearby shop practically exploded as the Alpha Blob from before emerged clearly enraged that the two tremendous ladies had gotten away from the blob pack earlier.

She couldn't afford to be fatten to high heaven despite Ada's remark earlier that she could use possibly used her potentially big fat butt to squash the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever being the only one of average weight Jill made a silent vow if things truly went south she'd be the one to get Sherry to safety.

In her mind Jill feared the worse, that monstrous beast had at last found her once again and to make matters worse her mere presence was now putting a child in danger but she'd be damned if she was going to let that monster steal that little girl's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's him. Take the girl find your friend and go. Leave that thing to me, I'm the one he's after anyway.\" Jill stated in a commanding tone hoping Ada wouldn't put up some kind of argument. However before the much bigger woman could response she overheard a rather familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are, Sherry! Did you find Ada?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Claire's! But if that was the brunette calling out to Sherry then what on earth had made that powerful rumbling? The answer was soon revealed as the mall seemingly shook two more thunderous times and before Ada and Jill stood without question the largest woman on the entire planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was gigantic! So enormous and blubbery her fat was literally pouring into hallway a flood of creamy flesh burying the entire hallway in the brunette's flab. Her legs so thick and overblown with fat it was difficult to tell whether or not Claire was standing or sitting. Her butt filling up so much room behind her she could feel the abandon stores struggle to refuse her big fat butt entry as the far edges of each cheek pressed against them. Her breasts already massive in the past had blown up even fatter, a bust so enormous Ada could not stop herself from wondering if even someone of her own impressive girth could conceal herself within that sea of cleavage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired woman felt a flush come over as she decided to look away and avert her eyes from the gigantic brunette while Sherry happily poked away at the field of a belly that belong to Claire. The girl didn't seem to as alarmed as Ada and Jill instead giggling as her tiny fingers sunk into the fat and folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire is that you?\" Ada asked still amazed that her companion and fellow survivor had grown to such a ridiculous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! It's all me, well even more of me anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the brunette chuckle mildly before sighing deeply, made more obvious as her bulk shook like a vat of jello. Claire then went on to explain how she had gotten hungry while waiting for Ada and before she knew it she was stuffing herself silly with anything she could get a hold of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part sounded a bit odd to Ada and she made a mental note to ask her what she meant by that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello there.\" Claire stated having taken notice of Jill standing next to the now much smaller blob of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly Jill took a while to response to the towering brunette she had come across and even combated against some things that were much larger then her but Claire was something else completely. This was a woman that had blown up so comically in weight she was almost the size of a house or maybe she was Jill honestly couldn't say. That said she took a moment to compose herself even if in the back of her head she couldn't shake the feeling that she felt like the size of an ant in comparison to the gigantic human blob of woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jill Valentine pleasure to meet you Claire.\" Jill stated with a smile as it suddenly came to her that this was her old partner Chris' little sister...well his sister anyway seeing as \"little\" was now completely out of the question.</span></div></div>",

Her blue tube-top struggling against the out pour of a several feet of blubber and folds that made up her sphere of a belly, a black skirt straining to contain her tremendous set of thighs alongside the thicken waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms still quite usable despite becoming sacks of fat as she placed her pistol away into her sea of cleavage. If there was one thing Ada had noted was that most of the weight had settled on the breast and butt area giving JIll one hell of an hourglass figure! Massive meaty breasts many times the size of the brunette's plumped face Ada almost wondered if she could lose a hand in there not to mention the tremendous almost hypnotic shelf of a backside Valentine was guilty of sporting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that eye catching girth and she had to be only around a thousand or so Ada didn't want to imagine what Jill would look like if she were of near or equal weight to her and Claire.

However, it seemed that with Jill's smaller form and shared plight of hunger, Ada had found the solution to her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Ms. Valentine.\" Ada started as cooly as she could manage. \"There should be a backup generator inside that would allow us to cook the food stored in that restaurant. Only problem is, I can't fit inside, which leaves it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it. I'll...pop something in the deep-fryer and hope that keeps us occupied.\" Jill huffed, about as hesitant as Ada must have to rely on greasy, fatty fast food for sustenance when they were already defying physics with their grand weight. Ada felt her heart race as she watched the gelatenous mounds of Clare's ass lazily wobble from side to side, the massive mounds of flesh lazily clapping against each other under the meager coverage of Jill's black shorts. Ada gulped as her face blushed red, wonder just what had been happening to her lately. First, those couple times she squished against Clare and now this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the smell of food cooking and frying and grilling kept these musings at bay as Ada hummed in delight at the smell of food wafting towards her nostrils. In only minutes, thanks to fast food restaurant's styles of cooking. In only minutes, Jill was carrying out sandwiches, french fries and grilled burgers for her and Ada to gorge on. Ada tried to just eat slowly, but her tastebuds were becoming more sensitive over time, making the simple meal taste irresistible to her pallet. Add up her gluttonous appetite due to her immense size and the asian woman was almost unable to keep herself from binging on armloads of food at once. But she at least did so neatly, grabbing napkins to wipe her mouth and making sure not to get any grease of bits of food falling onto her blubbery body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, and I thought my appetite was going nuts...\" Jill muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I blame those damn blobs. The bigger I get, the hungrier I get...and I dunno why, but everything just tastes so damn good, it's insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the purpose of those blobs could be, though...I don't see how they fit in the scheme of Umbrella's BOW program...\" Jill pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they're unfortunate by-products like the zombies...who knows?\" Ada shrugged as she stuffed her mouth with some burgers, feeling her form swell delicately with extra body fat. \"Mmm...feels like that did it...\" Ada purred as she placed a cuddly hand on her avalanche of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, cuz I think we cleaned the whole place out...\" Jill said with a blush as she noticed an additional wobble to her prestigious fat hourglass form after eating her fill, a petite burp passing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope at this rate, we don't wind up eating all of Raccoon City.\" Ada said with evident sarcasm as she turned around.

I'm not leaving you, Ada. We are getting out alive together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things won't kill just fatten to high hell. You have that girl in your protection you don't get the option of sacrificing yourself you get her out of here and to safety. That's an order, Redfield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M. NOT. GOING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefying to the end Claire had little time, nor did she expect, the right hand slugging her across her puffed cheeks! The blow so astounding strong it caused the blob of a brunette to reel backwards stumping into a nearby abandon building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry squealing in terror as her protector rattled and rolled eventually coming to stop and the last thing the dazed brunette saw was Ada locking inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ada!\" She yelled nearly over her own flab and feet desperate to make it toward the doorway but she'd never make it as the massive Asian went ahead with the act of locking her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ada! Don't do this, dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire screamed at the top of her lungs as she brought her pudgy fists upon the door's solid surface, she wasn't sure what Ada had done to keep her but she knew the blasted thing wasn't budging. She couldn't give up however she had to get out of this dimly-lit place and save that beyond stubborn woman from sacrificing herself to all those blobs!</span></div></div>",

For she had just remembered how much she had swelled in size after munching on a couple of blobs to save Sherry, she was already over four tons of blubber and unlike Ada having stayed away from downing anymore of the blobs recently kept away any sort of pleasurable sensations from surging through her enormous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she were to eat now who knows how greater in size she'd become so no despite her belly's earlier protest she had to push the thought of feasting on the frozen fattening \"treats\" out of her head entirely. Her dome of a belly already in her hands Claire figured she'd at least tell Sherry and her fellow fatten companion about her plan to smash the blobs to bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ada, Sherry, I was thinking over what I said earlier and I really believe smashing them is the best idea, we can't afford to put on any more weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda also felt the need to object to that last part, the euphoric high from before still lingering in the back of her head. Especially since it seemed that she was all but ready the trio of blobs even before Claire had literally put them on ice. Even now the urge had never truly left...but if Redfield destroyed them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's wise?\" she questioned remaining as stoic as possible, which for her wasn't exactly difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. We leave them as they are the ice will eventually melt thawing them out and we'll have to deal with them all over again sometime down the road. Might as well silence them now while we have the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda had to admit Claire made for a solid argument and one she would have agreed upon if that damn urge to eat the frozen trio wasn't still poking away at her subconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're certain crushing them will in fact destroy these creatures completely?\" Ada questioned not only curious of the response but also to keep Claire from going through with her plan if at least for a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With any luck, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that the gigantic brunette was ready for action as she responded with a positive smile. Ada would have to make her move now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't her...rather it was Sherry who had just inadvertently helped out Ada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Sherry? What's wrong?\" Claire asked clearly concerned that the child may have spotted more of the bulbous beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to finally tell you that even when these things get all smashed up they still fix themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry went on to explain, as best she could, the incident with Ada earlier when one of the blobs collided with an automobile destroying itself in the process yet regenerating a few seconds later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire found the revelation rather surprising as did Ada who shockingly hadn't even notice such a thing occur, of course this played right into her hands since it was a sure sign that the blobs needed to be eaten if they were going to rid themselves of them completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill despite Sherry's observation Claire held strong to her belief that it was best to destroy the still frozen trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we crush 'em down so small they can't trigger any sort of healing factor.\" Claire stated firmly gripping onto her tremendous belly ready to use it as a wrecking ball of sorts. Ada watching in silence, no clear expression visible on her now fatter puffier face.</span></div></div>",

A few more rounds would then make impact with the strange monster and cause it to refocus on it's attacker rather then continue fattening Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it's hold finally broken Claire collapses to the street pavement, coughing and gagging the young woman being thoroughly exhausted from the whole ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the hell away from her!\" called out a rough male voice and while Claire was still \"out of it\" somewhere in the back part of her mind a ping went off and reminded her that she had in fact heard that man's voice before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gunshot went off but this one was obviously much stronger then before, so much so that the blob creature growled in what seem to be actual pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shot and another growl. From her collapsed position on the ground Claire watched the monster growl a third time before oozing it's way back down into the sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the crisis avoided Claire was finally able to get a good look at her savor. Turns out it was blonde cop she had met before, Leon S. Kennedy she believed his name was. Leon with a look of concern ran up to her once he figured the coast was clear of any danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached Claire caught sight of his surprised expression. She wasn't entirely sure if it was because he was actually surprised to see her again, if it was because of her sudden weight gain (which must be somewhere around 300 pounds or so), or maybe it was both reasons? She didn't know nor did Claire actually care right now she was just glad to be rescued from that...thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly she took the hand offered to her by Leon. The young man was by no means a weakling but Claire was still able to make out a slight grunt leave his lips as he assisted her now hefty body off the ground, after all lifting up a 300 pound woman off the floor with a single hand was a pretty brave if not impulsive move to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Claire decided to extend out one of her own arms to help out Leon, who instantly took it, and with his help the fatten young woman was finally back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" cried out Claire as she did her best to get used to her new size and stabilize her footing. Suddenly she felt a soft squeeze on both her shoulders. Leon had caught her just before she could accidentally tilt over and crash to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was sure she was on good footing Leon released his hold on her, and luckily for Claire didn't notice the slight blush that had appeared on her new puffy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" he asked her straight-out causing Claire to blink in confusion for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah...thanks, Leon. You saved my...butt...heh back there.\" glancing back at her much larger butt and hip region Claire could feel her blush returning but did her best to suppress it by changing the topic subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before anything else just how did you get that thing away from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shotgun. At close range...\" Leon paused as he lifted the gun of ground (he had placed it down momentarily to help up Claire), \"a shot from these can take out damn near anything. Even that slimy creature that attacked you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded and mentally sighed as she felt her double chin wobble slightly. It's going to take months to rid herself of all this fat and even then she made still retain some of it she thought in frustration. But if there was one sliver lining it was that Leon didn't seem too affected by her new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe he just has a good poker face?' she wondered. Regardless she decided to tell him about her search for Sherry. Perhaps Leon had seen her somewhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately it didn't work out that way but the young man was willing to help out Claire look for the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began their search together.</span></div></div>",

She didn't even feel any pain from sharp edges from shelves jabbing into a side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next change resulted in Claire no longer needing her mouth in order to feed herself. She could consume anything edible using any part of her body that touched the food in question, much like a blob would \"eat\" in science fiction movies. This change naturally caused Claire to grow even fatter as she put it to good use by eating all of the food crushed underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then sniffed the air, she could swear that something sweet was close by. She then sniffed a part of her body and found out that this \"something\" was her! The sweat that used to cover her entire body and aid in her movement had turned into something almost like the icing that the blobs used for their movement, the last of the new changes. A taste test confirmed this, but it didn't make her any larger, much to her disappointment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, it can't be that easy. But time to move out, I'm wasting away sitting here. What was wrong with me? I'm not a freak, I'm perfect. Little on the thin side though.\" said Claire hoping to find more food and fast. She left the store, spilling out of both the display window and the front door to carry out with her new mission.</span></div></div>",

It's howl was followed by three more zombies, marching right behind the leader. They must have just been standing in the store when they saw Claire, the equal to several slow-moving buffets to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thought about what to do with them. After all, she hadn't seen any zombies ever since her run-in with the blobs. Normally, she would have just outran them or shot them with her handgun. But now, she doesn't have a gun, much less arms to use one or legs to run away from them. She does however, now have a a body that can lift heavy objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the first zombie was about to take a bite out of her \"back\", she put her body to good use. A tentacle extended out to grab the zombie and hold it up in the air by it's legs before doing the same with the other three zombies. She grunted with effort as she tossed three of them back into the hardware store. She stretched out her head to see if they would be getting back up and saw that they were now pinned down under a fallen shelf and wouldn't be getting back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention now turned to the remaining zombie hoisted up in the air, pathetically clawing at Claire. She thought about giving it the same treatment as it's fellow walking dead, but then she winced from a large hunger pain. Claire knew she needed to eat and the only thing remotely edible was the zombie. She extended another tentacle to grab the zombie's jaw to keep it's mouth closed so it won't bite her and moved it to her body, intent on absorbing it for substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she rationalized, the blobs had to be something made with the T-Virus. What more harm could one zombie do? Plus, she was a bit curious to what they tasted like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the deed was done, it turns out that they tasted awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleah! I feel like throwing up! Never going to try that again\" she said with a sour look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she suffered through a short transformation. Her body turned into the same shade of yellow as the blobs, as well as becoming transparent. The clothes that the zombie was wearing before Claire ate and digested it could be seen floating inside her body. The finale began when Claire's hair started falling out in clumps as her head, the only thing left mostly untouched by all of the changes, sunk into the rest of herself. Before, it looked like just a human's head sitting on a big blob of fat. Now, the only thing that could lead people to recognize her, back when she was a human, is her face which could stretch out or even be moved from one spot of her body to another with a single thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire examined herself and was disappointed. \"Damn, didn't get any bigger\" she complained. \"Oh well, back to finding some decent food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The doors were wide open so that saved her the trouble to smash them down with her bulk. However, she was far too big to fit all of her body inside the diner so she resorted to only sending a part of her inside. She squeezed in, going in face first and taking up the entire double door frame of the diner to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much in terms of food on the tables inside. Most of it was half or almost eaten, either by patrons when the outbreak hit or by scavengers that tried to find a safehouse. But whatever was left, Claire helped herself to, sticking out tendrils to grab anything. A half-eaten hamburger here, a melted bowl of ice cream there, all of it was snatched up and sucked into her body where it was instantly digested. Nothing tasted great, but Claire was content as the vile taste of the undead went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she heard a pot falling to the ground in the kitchen and squeezed on through the wooden saloon-like doors to see who or what was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second she poked out of the doors, a bullet hit her right where her temple would have been if she was still human. But the bullet just went right through her and hit the wall with a SPLAT following it, a piece of Claire's tissue when the bullet came out the other end with Claire feeling no ill effects, just annoyance as she shifted her face to see who would dare shoot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shooter turned out to be a young, thin asian woman in a red dress, matching high heels and her black hair trimmed short. She was a bit shocked that her handgun didn't even give this monster that came out of nowhere a scratch as well as seeing that it had the face of a barely recognizable human girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..you must be that woman, Ada Wong that Leon told me about\" said Claire, with a hint of frustration in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you?!\" shouted Ada who then fired at Claire several times before Claire reached out with a tentacle, grabbed the handgun and threw it back towards the rest of her waiting outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough of that.\" said Claire with a satisfied sigh before continuing. \"Anyway, I don't know if Leon ever told you about me, but I'm Claire Redfield. Though I guess I made..a couple of changes last time I saw him. Changes for the better, I think.\" purred Claire, feeling a bit of pleasure as she thought about all of the transformations she had been subject to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda's jaw dropped at the idea of anyone thinking that turning into something like THAT could be enjoyable and said so. \"Better?! Look at yourself! All I see is just a big fat freak's neck!\" shouted Ada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proved to be a mistake as Claire quivered with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freak?! A skinny little thing like you wouldn't understand what it's like to be something fantastic like this! But..maybe I'll show you!\" roared Claire as she lunged at Ada while more of her 3,000 pound self squeezed inside the diner to try to cut Ada off from any escape routes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Claire, despite her size, was quick enough to reach the only other exit. A large tentacle lashed out of the sea to grab Ada by the waist so she can't run away, despite all of her struggles to break free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's face appeared in the large mass blocking the exit and smiled. \"Nice try.

When Ada opened her mouth to scream in pain, she only got a split-second of sound out before she was being force-fed a part of Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMPH...Mmph....Mmmmm.\" The noises Ada tried making started with ones of resistance but became ones of delight as she tasted the sweet ooze comprised of the young Redfield girl filling her up. The results started to appear in seconds as Ada grew heavier, her dress being strained to the limits with fat until it eventually exploded into pieces, leaving her in just her bra and panties which were also on their last legs. Ada's face grew a second and then a third chin underneath her original one. While Ada's breasts and butt doubled in size, it was her stomach that was the biggest part of her, surging forward a foot ahead of the rest of her with stretch marks appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was enjoying all of this.

I'm not a fan of adding on to the story with just choices but this way, someone else can write their own take whenever they want to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo sum up, here are the stages that Claire underwent, though she can keep changing with the right stimulus (i.e. when a writer feels like it.) It's also up to whoever wants to pick this up if Ada retains her full mental functions or if her mind was altered into a simple feeding frenzy or to enjoy being transformed like that or do something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStage 1: After the initial fattening, the victim's lower half changes to become one lump of flesh. Since the legs are gone, locomotion is made possible by dragging themselves across the ground. The rest of the body is left perfectly human aside from the extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStage 2: The upper body of the victim changes to match the lower body, losing the use of their arms. The neck is also lost and the face grows a bit wider. As manipulating objects the way a human would, it becomes second nature (or it is quickly learned) for the victim to stretch out parts of their own body to grab objects. The subject also starts sweating constantly to the point where they are always coated with it and it is intended to provide lubrication for movement. It is unknown if it can cause other people to become infected upon ingestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStage 3: The changes are not as grand as the previous two stages, but the victim no longer is restricted to ingesting food through their mouths, able to take any organic material and consume it at will if any part of their body touches said material. Digestion usually occurs instantly. The other change is the sweat that Phase 2 subjects emit changes to the sweet smelling and tasting slime a complete blob (usually the ones that infect the victim in the first place) secrete. If the new Phase 3 subject tries tasting the slime, they do not suffer any ill effects but as with the Phase 2 sweat, it is unknown if pure humans will be affected by it. The rest of the body is left unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, stage 4: The subject suffers rapid hair loss as their heads lose the shape and bone structure of a human, opting to become one with the rest of the blob. The eyes, nose and mouth can be moved all over the body at a single thought (an example would be one eye at the back of the subject and one at the front.) Also, the body changes color to become the same yellow color as the complete blobs while becoming transparent, allowing anyone to see the contents inside the subject before they are digested. Despite the lack of any human organs, the subject is able to experience the same feelings, senses and thoughts as they did before the infection started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, sorry for pausing  the story but it never hurts to get more than just two options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyway, what stage did Ada reach when it was all said and done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young asian certainly isn't going anywhere while being plumped up with ooze, her eyes flickering with euphoria. Pieces of her black bra and panties were lying on the ground around her, giving up the ghost many pounds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ada reached 600 pounds, Claire started slowing down the flow then disconnected the tentacle from the rest of her, allowing Ada to gulp the last bit down and subsequently hit the ground on her cushioned ass, the rapid weight gain being too much strain for her swollen legs. If Ada looked down, all she would see is a pair of breasts that were bigger than her head resting on a gigantic stomach that covered her crotch and pushed her legs as wide as they could possibly move, though it started shrinking a bit due to Ada's body digesting the last pieces of Claire to add a few extra inches elsewhere. The increased fat in her butt caused her to be a good half of a foot taller than when she normally sat down. The three chins on her face gained another companion and her cheeks puffed up with fat so much that they pushed her eyelids closer, obscuring her vision slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda was still trying to come out of her feeding-induced haze, moaning and trying to rub her belly with her inflated digits when the second half of her metamorphosis began. Her legs melded into the bottom half of her stomach while the top half of Ada's body lurched forward to move into it's new center of gravity. Soon, her entire lower half became just a large hunk of soft, smooth fat with the top half of her stomach and her breasts resting on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gave a wide and sultry smile as she leaned in and stroked Ada's chin with a small tendril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you like it, my cute little blob?

This was fantastic news to Claire and Ada, who couldn't wait to tear into everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd tear into everything, they did. Ada, being the one woman who couldn't stretch herself into the freezer, shuffled her way inside before Claire, her naked flesh shivering as she came into contact with the still-cold freezer floor and her nipples on her gigantic breasts becoming erect.

Ada looked at Claire, sensing something is wrong but she was distracted by feeling strange herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda felt an odd sensation in her hands and arms so she tried to raise them up to see what was the problem, but she couldn't seem to lift them at all but as soon as she looked down, she figured out why. Her arms were pressed against the sides of her body and were fusing together as her shoulders were losing any definition they had left after Ada gained all of her weight, being sucked into her body. She cried out in dismay as she also saw that her breasts looked like they were shrinking, but like her shoulders, they were being sucked in to make her upper body as shapeless as the rest of her. The remnants of Ada's neck was also absorbed, causing her head to lower slightly. Finally, Ada broke out in a sweat that covered her body, despite the cool air inside the freezer, that washed off the last parts of the ice cream on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, why did I have to lose my wondrous breasts? And can you explain all of the sweating, Claire?\" grumbled Ada, but she didn't hear any answer from Claire. \"...Claire?\" asked Ada again before turning to her companion and gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ada simply progressed to the next stage of blob-dom, Claire reached the final stage, where various desserts were all over her body! Parts of her yellow flesh were poking out through the cracks as well as underneath all of the sweets. As mysterious as the sudden appearance of all of that food, Ada was more concerned about her new partner in growth still not answering her. She looked a bit closer, stretching her neck out absentmindedly and saw that Claire's eyes and mouth were visible in between a cake and some donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire? Answer me!

Though a little bit cramped.\" Indeed she was, for outside of the freezer where Ada was resting, the much larger Claire filled up every square inch of the diner with 4 feet spilling out of the doorways and windows. \"Let me fix that.\" she continued before grunting with effort as she started pushing her mass outward, applying more pressure to the walls that are confining her until large cracks formed and eventually, most of the building broke away to release over two tons of mutant flesh from it's concrete cage. \"Much better.\" said Claire, sighing with relief as she shifts her bulk around to make room for Ada to shuffle out of the freezer to get a better look at how much Claire had changed. Ada just looked up in awe at how Claire towered over her, an impressive 12 feet compared to her mere 5 feet before she shifted her gaze all around at the various food stuck to Claire's body. Ada wanted to just start grabbing at them all and devour them but she held back, thinking that it might hurt Claire or in the very least, piss her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, on the other hand wasn't interested in eating any more food, at least the kind that humans eat.

But\u2026 she is so small compared to me\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAda,\u201d Claire realizes the final transformation has made her voice deeper. \u201cWow, I sound like Jabba and Ursula from that mermaid movie,\u201d She says to herself \u201cwhy don\u2019t you help yourself to some of this food in here, you need to fatten up my dear. Grooow, let yourself go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Claire finishes her sentence Ada is over to the pile of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you grab things with out food? Oh!\u201d her tentacles sprout out and start tearing open all the boxes and crates of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Bief  the *Munch* waif whaf\u2019s wiff your *Belch* voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk with your mouth full, Ada.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with your voice, Claire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. My new transformation made me new made me more monstrous? I don\u2019t know? Who knows? What do I look like, a scientists?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLess talking more eating, the bigger you get the sooner I get to eat yo\u2026 Yogurt! Eat yogurt? Frozen yogurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, after many minutes of goring Ada was running low on food. And though Ada was larger than before, she was only about a foot taller and maybe weighed maybe a few hundred pounds over a ton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Damn,\u2019 Claire thought, \u2018still not big enough to eat. Maybe one of my babies can help.\u2019 <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWith Claire\u2019s new transformation Claire develops the power to make smaller duplicates of herself, but these would be only mindless drones eating and searching for a host to transform into a slimy blob creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then slits off one of her \u201cbabies\u201d to help Ada transform into the third stage of blob-dom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little blob slinks its way into a drum of ice-cream to wait for its turn to be eaten. Ada is starting to snap out of her trance like daze and truly realize what she has become<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat the hells happened to me?! I\u2019m a shapeless fucking blob of jello and I\u2019m sitting here stuffing my face!I\u2019m a MONSTER A HIDEOUS MONSTER!!\u201d Ada started to sob. But unfortunately for Ada the monstrous hunger was too much to resist. Ada grabs the drum of ice-cream but conflicting thoughts try to resist her monstrous instincts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m strong I can resist this. I\u2019m the top assassin in my league and I have an iron will. NO! EAT! GROW! FOOD! That\u2019s all I need! No! I must resist! ICE-CREAM! I love ice-cream!\u201d Ada can\u2019t help herself and dumps the entire drum of ice-cream in her mouth along with the blob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda feels a weird rumbling in side of her and a slight stomach ache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, that ice-cream must have been spoiled. Coz I feel sick. I feel\u2026.\u201d Little did Ada know that the little blobs had altering her brain like Claire before her to give her a pure basic instinct for survival, hunger and the want no need to grow and eat! \u201cGreat! I don\u2019t know why I ever doubted myself before. Eating a growing is what life is all about! Survival! Immortality! Humanity is overrated I the living amoeba-blob is the superior being! Why ever since I was a little girl always wanted to be a monster like in those cheesy sci-fi movies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda suddenly smelt a familiar sweetness like from Claire. Why it was Ada! Her body\u2019s slime was making the sweet smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow this is awesome! Huh, what\u2019s that sound?\u201d Ada looked down and saw her massive body was dissolving what\u2019s left of the food and leaving only behind metal drums and boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. I\u2019m all out of food. I NEED MORE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh! Excellent. Soon Ada\u2019s transformation will be complete and I can eat her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClaire! Lets go find somemore food I\u2019m fucking STARVING HERE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood my little blob,\u201d Despite Ada\u2019s transformation Claire still dwarfed Ada by several feet and even square feet. \u201cSoon you will be a mighty Blob Queen like myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire destroyed what was left of the diner to go and search for more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many blocks of wandering Claire and Ada find no food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Damn nothing,\u2019 Claire thought to herself, \u2018I must\u2019ve eaten all the food in a two mile radius.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Claire, I\u2019m not goin\u2019 to grow by sitting here! Let\u2019s find FOOOD!!\u201d Ada moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was trying to think back to her days when she was human. She was trying to remember, \u201cThere was a field\u2026a field something\u2026 a field\u2026trip! A field trip! When I was a human larva creature\u2026 a grrl, when I was a little grrl! The Candy factory!\u201d<br>\r\nClaire in her new monster form couldn\u2019t remember where the candy factory was located because of the new blob instincts clouding her mind, but her blob instincts do lead her to large sources of nutrients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way, Ada!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many minutes of oozing around they made it to the giant Raccoon City\u2019s candy factory. Lil\u2019 Bandit Candy Factory to be precise with a cute little cartooned raccoon burglar as the mascot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHere we are, my pet, the candy factory.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smashed through the front door and much of the wall and found the gift shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat up Ada.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda could hardly contain herself as her multiple tentacles grab all the food she could. Ada still ate with here mouth but her body was still dissolving food that her giant body touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Soon she\u2019ll be fat enough to eat and I will be queen! Queen Claire! No! Blob Queen Claire! Like that damned leach queen.\u201d Claire muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ada\u2019s gorging she found herself finished with all the food in the gift store. Fortunately Ada\u2019s blob instincts tell her there is raw material and unprocessed candy down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFOOD!\u201d Ada bellowed, as Ada oozed down the hall with Claire following behind. All this plotting was making Claire hungry too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blobs found tons of unprocessed candy to gorge on, along with hundreds of barrels of sugar and artificial flavoring. Claire and Ada slit up to different rooms to continue there feasting but Ada found a room with a zombified employee shambling around the abandoned room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I guess he counts as food,\u2019 Ada thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the zombie was head over heals inside of Ada\u2019s enormous mouth. Inside of Ada\u2019s transparent slimy body could the zombie be seen dissolving, Ada\u2019s body in the meantime was turing yellow like the blobs and Claire. After the zombie was completely dissolved, Ada\u2019s body shifted only leaving its clothes and shoes left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAugh! That was awful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ingesting the zombie Ada felt a familiar gurgling in her body. Ada looked onto a reflective steal surface to see her enormous face to see that her hair was falling out in clumps and even dissolving into her body. Her head moved deeper into her body as her face stretched and became less human her nose turned into two slits like Claire\u2019s. The only thing to tell Ada and Claire apart was about 10 feet to Claire\u2019s impressive 15 feet to be precise and about a ton lighter and that Ada\u2019s Asian eyes from her Chinese heritage remained untouched by the transformation. In fact Ada found that she could move her eyes all around her body like will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh. Cool.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda went to find Claire to show her the good news but when Claire saw what happened she was a little peeved to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! I am the Queen of the Blobs ME!! I won\u2019t be upstaged a little grunt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire lunged at Ada only Ada\u2026      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The larger blob came at her too fast for the less experienced Ada to move out of the way and before she knew it, Claire started to engulf her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-NO! STOP!\" screamed Ada as Claire absorbed her, savoring the \"flavor\" of Claire's current meal. It was like the ultimate feast to Claire which was made better when Ada stopped screaming. But minutes later, it was over and Claire sighed both in pleasure and disappointment that she had something so delicious yet over too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I guess I can make another one like her when I get hungry...Wait, I'm full?!\" said Claire, realizing that that ever since her initial transformation, she was always hungry until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, I wond-\" Claire started to ponder before groaning in pain and thrashing tentacles about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this pain?! ARGH!\" cried Claire, trying to see what is happening to her, but she can't focus enough to move her eyes to see anything. What was happening was that her flesh started to bubble and shift to a more liquid consistency until Claire couldn't move. But she was still aware of her existence and she could feel herself moving somewhere. The last thing Claire thought of before blacking out was that she felt metal holes as she moved and realized that she was going down into a drain, down a part of Raccoon City's sewers where water was moving at a steady flow out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it for Claire, this was when the United States government launched it's nuclear attack on Raccoon City to prevent the infection from spreading further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Claire knew, she woke up in the middle of a lake away from Raccoon City, though she was smaller than before. In fact, she was back to almost her ordinary self except her legs were still an unshapely mass. This proved to be unhelpful as Claire struggled to pull herself to shore but then her legs shifted back to original form and she quickly pulled herself out of the lake, confused on what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about how she missed being a blob when she started to expand to her second stage of transformation, then back to her human form. Claire smiled as she realized that she had total control over her appearance now. She could masquerade as a human to move all over the world only showing what she considers her true form to the next person to receive her gift...or become her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, she needed to get to some place with people. She grimaced at the thought of walking about as a naked, skinny girl but she knew that people are more willing to pick up someone like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started walking along a highway, she hoped someone would stop soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she was starting to get hungry again.</span></div></div>",

Ada threw Claire through a wall causing the side of the building to collapse. Claire oozed up and saw a hoard of zombies shambling about. Even though Claire hated there taste maybe they\u2019ll make her grow more. Claire enveloped them and she got larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hey they don\u2019t taste as bad anymore,\u2019 Claire thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda saw what happened and consumed the rest of the snacks. Claire and Ada were both on a rampage as they searched for more and more food to make them grow. As Claire soon found a grocery store and devoured all that was inside. Ada found a hoard of zombies and monsters and ate them all. After searching and searching Ada and Claire were both a 50 feet tall and 100 feet wide! Crashing into buildings these giants were caughted in the pitch of battle. Buildings collapsed under the two massive blob girls weight as they tumbled around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019LL EAT YOU WHOLE!!!\u201dAda bellowed as she lunged at Claire. Suddenly something odd happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both suck! There bodies were merging together to form one giant blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH NO! WHATS HAPPENING!!\u201d They screamed.

She know knew that Claire was herself again...well so to speak anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire!\" Breaking into a dash Sherry ran up to her friend before hugging as much of the pink-colored mass that Claire had become. At first Claire was scared that Sherry would be sucked into her immense girth but it seemed that she had gain that sort of ability so the little girl could hug her as much as she wished. Sherry also didn't seem to mind being covered in the sweat that Claire's body was giving out and that gave her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess she's just caught up in the moment and doesn't realize it.' She thought amusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside Claire was now coming to grasps with what had occurred to her, no longer human in fact it seem that only her head was the sole human portion remaining that and of course her mind that for the moment had been released from the blob's influence. Sherry had reminded her who she was and no way could she in her right mind devour Sherry, the thought actually made Claire physically sick which caused her form to shake for a moment alarming young Sherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, are you okay?\" Wide-eyed Sherry had caught what she had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I know you're not okay okay, but um...\" the girl stumbled with her words fearing that she had just insulted her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay, Sherry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the control she had over her body Claire used a part of herself to lift Sherry closer to where her face was located. Almost instantly Sherry crawled over and hugged Claire's head as well as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherry\" mumbled Claire as she felt the tears from the little girl make contact with her. Sherry was simply happy to be reunited with her despite how she currently looked. Claire was worried the girl would see her as monster even after she snapped out of her feeding spree but that wasn't the case and maybe that was the sort of thing that Claire desperately needed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, hunny. I may look a bit strange right now but I promise you I'm me and I'll protect you.\" Claire stated, Sherry nodding in the process.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts, straining her outfit, had grown to a massive size, the size of yoga balls, yet still soft and bouncy. Her large buttcheeks, which were also pushing her pants to the limit, were the size of beyond overinflated yoga balls, their blubbery masses jiggling every time she moved and treatening to tear her pants to shreds. As her weight cleared 730, she fell flat on her large ass, sighed, and licked her fingers clean of the sweet slime from the blob, which was no more. She rubbed her massive gut, groaning in pleasure and a sugar stupor. She then burped a little, and giggled. She sank into her soft hips, which now were wider than a doorway by a huge margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So delicious...\"she cooed, and rubbed her massive gut. \"But I can't shake the feeling I'm on some sort of mission...\" Then it hit her.

She reloaded it again, knowing it was no use because of its pathetic stopping power. Her consience told her that something bad was up ahead on the next turn. She continued, back against a wall, her footsteps making no noise even with her extra weight. She peeked around the corner, and gasped a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least ten of the sweet, crawling bakeries were trawling around on the pathway, leaving trails of candied ooze on the ground. Not one of them noticed the big beautiful brunette turn the corner, her belly swaying a little as she did. All seemed to move to a collective place. One appeared from an alleyway, right in front of Claire. Before Claire could react, the blob leapt toward her mouth, forcing it open and pouring itself inside. Claire, for some reason, slurped it up greedily, unaware of her action. She waddled down the street a little less cautiously, rubbing her even larger belly. The blobs suddenly flinch, causing Claire to stop in her tracks, bracing for the punishment. But they didn't move toward her. Instead, she heard a voice, the first human voice she heard in quite awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh DAMMIT, GET OFF!\" a male voice shrieked. Two gunshots rang out, followed by more cursing, a few scuffling sounds, and a figure being tossed from an alley by a jelly tentacle. \"WHOOOAAAAHHH-!\" the figure managed to get out before being slammed into a pole. Six of the unearthly delights surrounded it, a few tentacles reaching out slightly. \"You sick bastards! DIE!\" the person screamed, slugging all six with a hail of bullets. But one recovered fastest, and slung a sweet appendage around the boy, it seems, right around the neck. He reached up, trying to pull it off, but couldn't. The blob then slung him around like a ragdoll, slamming his head into solid concrete and asphalt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, no! I have to do something!' Claire thought frantically. She went through the options in her head. The only two she could think of, for reasons unknown, was to eat the blobs, and grow even larger(how the thought appeased her!) or fire her gun and drive them away. She held her pudgy face in thought, yes, wanting to grow larger, but a part of her mind told her no, she musn't. Sherry was on the line.</span></div></div>",

She latched onto one, and began slurping it up, holding it tightly so it wouldn't escape. It almost squealed in pain, it seemed, as the massive girl fed on it. The less there was of the small ooze, the more there was of Claire. Eventually she had finished the first and moved on towards the second, doing the same thing and giggling a little as her body grew outwards. She finished it, and chomped down on the third one, chewing it fast and gulping it down like water. It squirmed and squirmed, but couldn't get out of her grip. She tore chunks off a fourth, and devoured it as well. The remaining two were sucked down together, having jumped into their attacker's mouth to try and stop her. However, she expected that, and allowed them to, her body swelling even more. Her top was stretching immensely now, and wasn't going to break. Neither was her bottom, which had expanded to fit her. She sat down, creating a small tremor, her weight already 1050 from all six. She giggled again and again, sinking into her massive hips and rubbing her enormous belly. Her thighs, now completely redwood-sized, held up her engorged tummy as she rubbed it. Claire's breasts looked as big around as C-5 tires, resting lightly on her tummy. She burped a petite one, and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee hee! Excuse me!\" she laughed as her body shook from her chuckles, which gave her intense pleasure. She groaned a little in ecstasy from feeling her now even larger body. She then looked over to the boy she saved,who looked to be eighteen, and smiled as he got up. \"Did you have a nice nap?\" Claire joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, very funny. I have an immense migraine and your laughing isn't making it better,\" he grunted as he stood up, albeit a little woozy. \"But thanks for trying to liven up the dead mood, Miss...?\" he said, a little unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire. Claire Redfield,\" she said proudly. But he wasn't looking at her. He was looking over her large form, taking in her features, and had his mouth hanging open at the sight of her cute pudgy face.\"I-I'm Cirrus. Cirrus Ragnair. Thanks for h-h-helping, Claire,\" he stammered, overtaken by her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no problem, but first, you gotta do me a favor...\" she grinned.</span></div></div>",

Then he lowered them, carefully, as not to hurt her. Cirrus then began kneading her soft tummy, rubbing it in graceful circles, his hands never leaving it. He was blushing fiercely, his face almost entirely red, and Claire suppressed giggles over his nervousness. But all the while, it soothed her swollen paunch and gave her comfort. Cirrus was also liking this, and also glad not another nightmare came to devour him. He felt the pounds her belly had, even putting his head to it, the low groans of her stomach almost tantalizing. When he was almost done, Claire played a trick on him, and glomped Cirrus, pushing his face deep in her cleavage. He thrashed a bit, and she laughed out loud, because of how much it tickled her and the fact that his golden hair(which looks like Naruto's) kept brushing against her chin, throwing her body into quaking fits. He finally managed to break free, his face right in front of Claire's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" he asked, althhough a big smile on his face betrays his feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I thought you might like it,\" was Claire's simple answer. Cirrus rubbed her big breasts with his hands, his blue eyes full of joy from being able to touch her like that. \"Quit IT! That tickles!\" Claire chuckled, and kissed him on his cheek. They both blushed furiously and Cirrus got off, afraid of offending her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cirrus, can you help me up?\" she asked. Her body was now too large for her to lift up off the ground on her own. \"Ok, just hold on,\" he said, and he wrapped his arms around hers, and pulled up with a mighty heave. He brought up Claire with ease, to her surprise, and steadied her, keeping her on balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said, \"But now I've got another favor to ask. Can you help me find my friend?\" Cirrus nodded, and the two started down the foggy road, Claire's gelatinous rear swaying all the way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wind blew through the empty streets, causing a chill to scurry over Claire's back. She couldn't shake the feeling something was horribly wrong. Cirrus had his magnums drawn, the silvery ebony and ivory casting glints into the darkness. He had given Claire an odd weapon, one that had a top-release handle and a normal trigger. It also had a large barrel exit point, and it was stout. Nevertheless, she gripped it tightly, her pudgy hands turning white from the pressure put on it. The warehouse was just up ahead, and the two-man party was feeling very uneasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, do you get the feeling we're being followed?\" Cirrus asked, turning his head back, trying to see an invisible threat. \"Yes...like a feeling that something dreadful's coming, and you can't stop it,\" she whispered, her cute pudgy face lined with worry. The complex was up ahead, but it felt like a mile down the foggy path. They reached the storage building, slowly unlocked it, and stepped inside. It wasn't dark, nor was it brightly lit. Some of the lights were on, but dying. Pools of blood were every where,<br>\r\nand bullets and other weapons littered the ground. A piercing scream of terror came off to their right, with Claire, who recognized the voice, ran toward the origins of the scream, her body jiggling madly from her fast takeoff. Cirrus followed suit, his intuition unsure of what to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHERRY!\" Claire yelled as she turned a corner around some crates. The poor girl was huddled in a corner, a licker creeping toward her, front hands out in a gesture of reaching, its tongue flailing madly. Cirrus ran up, just in time as the creature of Hellspawn was about to have Sherry in its grasp. He rammed it, sending it flying into the wall, hissing and spitting. He pumped ten rounds into it before he was sure it was dead. The brunette, however, was waddling toward Sherry, the terrified girl shrinking back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Sherry. We killed it. Come now, let's get out of here,\" she called to her. The frightened girl then took one look at her, remembered her face, and threw herself, sobbing, into Claire's soft embrace and cleavage. Sherry's tears ran hot and thick down her pretty features, staining her eyes and cheeks red. It also left a stain on Claire's leather vest. But she didn't care; she at least knew Sherry was safe. They let go, and Sherry looked up and down her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire...how did you get so...huge?\" Sherry asked, befuddled by her friend's transformation. Claire patted her belly, and smiled. \"I had a \"few\" treats along the way,\" she laughed, and Sherry laughed too. But Cirrus wasn't laughing; he was looking through a small gap between boxes and eyeing someone or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha looking at?\" Sherry asked, surprised that Claire managed to find someone still alive. She sized him up, but when she got to his hands, which held his magnums, she shivered, as if she knew they had more power than what they looked like. They frightened her. But he replied in gentle and kind tones, putting her at ease. \"An enemy, possibly, in a gray trenchcoat. He's thick, kinda grayish, and doesn't seem to be breathing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, and the two looked to her. \"We need to get out...now. He's trying to kill me.\" Claire waddled toward her and embraced her, with Sherry sinking into her warm fat. All 1050 pounds of it. Sherry snuggled closer and hugged her belly tight, almost digging a niche for herself. She desperately needed protection. Claire understood that and so did Cirrus. They embraced the young girl, holding her for an entire 2 minutes. Then they split, the task at hand needing to be addressed. The odd being was still shuffling, its heavy footsteps thudding on the dry floor. Claire's body swayed intensely as she moved forward to get a better look. Her fat-laden arms, though so smooth and perfect, held Sherry tightly, her thick hands grasping her tightly. Her massive hips brushed the other crates and the shelves lightly; as they were almost as wide as two doorways. Her belly, almost 4 feet out, was squishing against the young girl and some of the other items on the dusty shelves. Her breasts, although quite large, didn't prevent her vision, for that she was thankful. Her cute, pudgy face was screwed up in concentration, trying to discern how much of a threat the being was. Cirrus had reloaded both his magnums and had turned the safety off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black flightsuit he wore and the gloves blended in with the shadows, his eyes only shining orbs of blue. He mouthed to them \"Let's leave. There's a door behind you. Be careful. I'll go out last so I can help you if you get stuck.\" The two girls nodded and opened the door, the hinges making no sound. Sherry went first, then Claire. But just as Claire was almost through, her titanic ass got caught. Cirrus saw, and crept toward her, then braced his hands to push her through. She wiggled intensively as he sank his hands into her soft butt. She slid out without a sound, and they raced away. Cirrus followed suit, locking behind him and welding the door shut with his right arm, which was, unbeknownst to Claire, was prosthetic. He chased after his big, lovable brunette and her charge, leaving behind the demented warehouse. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The empty streets gave no resistance to the trio as they continued onward to the town center. Surprisingly, no zombies or other Hellspawn had appeared. Cirrus was now officially concerned. By now something should've attacked them. Sherry and Claire were also getting tired. Their heavy breathing was loud; too loud. He stopped, and they caught their breath. Claire was breathing the hardest, with her added weight creating more work for her system. Sherry was also quite tired; she was a little girl after all. He lowered his goggles and scanned the surrounding buildings, looking for any without infection or dead occupying them. He also checked to be sure there were no connecting systems that could end up setting a trap for them. Only one of the 16 he saw fit the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two want to get a night's sleep?\" he asked gently. Claire stood up and Sherry nodded. He then walked toward the empty safehouse, beckoning them to follow. They did with eagerness, glad to get a chance to rest. He unlocked the door, and slid inside. Claire almost got stuck again, thanks to her massive body, but she didn't care. They were safe for the moment.  Claire undid the gun strap, laying the nitrogen extinguisher down on the couch. She tried to sit down on it, but the couch gave a loud creak and snapped. All she did was giggle, and then laugh again as the fall sent waves rippling in her fat. Sherry looked at her curiously, then at Cirrus, who had conjured an odd lantern, which cast light like a lamp. It glowed a bluish white, but soft enough not to be seen from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, can you move the table? I want to set up a bed area right there. The bed, I doubt, could hold your body,\" Cirrus asked, smiling all the while. She snickered again, moving the table with a bit of effort, her 1100-pound body swaying as she did. He looked her up and down as she did this, marvelling at how her fat was so smooth and flowed into the right places. He wanted to kiss that pudgy face, get lost in that huge amount of cleavage, or snuggle in her belly. She also got his feelings as she caught his eye, and let her hips shake some more. Cirrus had brought down the blankets, and set up the bed already, and had it waiting. Claire slid into it with grace, despite her enormity. Cirrus then laid down, and Sherry followed, laying on Claire's big tummy, resting her head on one of her breasts. Claire giggled as Cirrus followed cuit, and she suddenly had an urge to eat more, to be larger than this, to be able to have them both lay on her belly and snuggle up to her. Her buttcheeks provided a perfect cushion, as did her 3-foot thick legs. Her arms, thick with fat, were draped over Cirrus's and Sherry's shoulders, holding them close. Her face, only adorned by large, rosy cheeks and a double-chin barely formed, smiled as she thought of the life Cirrus and her could have. She brought the covers up to her chin, covered the others, and fell into a sweet blissful sleep, filled with erotic dreams of slurping on massive blobs, growing even larger, as Cirrus rubbed her massive tummy. She knew she loved growin larger, and feeling more of her fat. She had a grin of stupor on her face as she sank deeper into her sleep and dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*0129453 Candid Soryo Nuka 77549. What? Oei...She's alright, as is Sherry. Can you drop us some support? 099. 341287889. Gaia Aero Bytra. Rendevous at Delta Six Six, point North*. Town Center....got it. Cut out and maintain Radio Silence N.A.S. FEAR,\" she heard Cirrus's voice say. She cracked an eye, to see the morning light. Sherry was still sound asleep on her bosom, her chest rising up and down slowly. She sat up and cradled her, letting Sherry share her warmth in the morning chill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Claire. We've got support. They should be here soon. But, only if the mutant crows don't get to them first. Ah, and I wanted to give you something...\" he said, shifting through a buch of sheets near the closet. He pulled out a pair of Aurotian SMG-43's, which were compact, solid black with red stripes down the center, held fifty rounds per clip, and were unjammable. She held them with such care, she almost cried. Cirrus had given her a gift, even though they had only been together a day at the most. He had also pulled out something else: a container of yellowish green liquid. She squealed with glee at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked, even though she knew. \"It's a chamber full of a blob I caught earlier, f-for you, c-c-Claire,\" he stuttered, and he handed it to her. She smiled, popped the cap, and swigged down the entire thing. All of a sudden, she felt an erotic sensation, she felt so warm. She began to grow larger, her body swelling every second, her hips becoming as wide as two doorways put together. Her big butterball of a belly spilled outwards a bit more, her ass also growing larger, their blubbery masses grwoing to be over 3 feet around. Her monstrous belly was extended about four feet out, rolling over her thighs, now thicker than ever, about 5 feet in diameter. Her face didn't gain any fat, however, as her arms bloated a little more. She smiled as she saw her gigantic breasts grow even larger, almost spilling out the still-growing top. She held out her arms for Cirrus to bring her up, holding tightly onto Sherry with her left arm, even as her weight surpassed 1500 pounds. She smiled again, and squeezed Cirrus tightly, who gave her a kiss on her plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we ready to go?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, and they packed up their things and left for the town square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note: Aurotian sky-speak. Means \"All right, so we have a rendevous point? Good, I think we all need your help. Yes, Got it. See you there.\"</span></div></div>",

From what I've learned in past excursions, shorter paths are cause for more danger. This way, it almost ensures our safety,\" Cirrus called into a com link placed in his ear.  Claire waddled beside him, cradling the still-sleeping Sherry. She had one of her SMG's donned, with Cirrus holding an assault rifle. Her eyes followed him, and her body followed suit as he rounded a corner. She felt warm, even in the chilly air, thanks to all her blubber. Sherry was snuggled up close, her form sharing Claire's body heat. Her thighs rubbed together, their perfectly formed masses shapely and sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Ah, understood Savior-1. We'll adjust our course accordingly,&gt;&gt; they replied, cutting off. As they proceeded, several Leech forms nad Cerberus dogs appeared, taking them by surprise. Muzzles flashed as Cirrus and Claire let off streams of flying death, striking three Cerberi and shredding them to pieces. The others leapt at Cirrus, and bit down on his right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cirrus!\" Claire called in worry, until she realized they couldn't bite down. \"Not so great, eh Fido?\" he grinned, and took out his sliverish magnum, and expended the clip, all rounds killing the demon dogs' nerve centers. Claire, however, was desperately trying to fend off the masses of leeches attacking her and Sherry. 'Screw my arm's disguise, I have to save them-!' he thought furiously, and pulled up his right sleeve, revealing a white hand, red and blue forearm, and a white upper arm. It crackled intensely with blue shots of minute lightning, his fist outlined by the rays of light emanating from the enclosed space within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUCK!\" he shouted, and Claire followed, tucking into a crouch position right as a huge stream of superheated plasma roared overhead, ripping apart the leeches and vaporizing the masses. It died down, the air popping a little from the intense heat and electrical discharge. She looked up, and saw that Cirrus was panting, holding his right arm, revealed to her as a prosthetic. She then realized her fired off the blast as she saw little minute sparks crackling around his hand. He caught her face, almost like a look of fear, and turned away, hurt written all over his face. Claire waddled towards him, and gently gave him a hug. He shrugged her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want someone broken like me?\" he asked, wanting to know for sure what she thought. \"I don't care. Cirrus, after you saved Sherry, I knew you loved me. And I love you, too. Nothing can come between us,\" she said. Cirrus smiled and began walking, guns drawn, and Claire took his hand in hers and walked beside him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;This is Golden Sun, Cirrus. Do you copy? I repeat, do you copy?&gt;&gt; the transport craft relayed. \"Yeah, I copy,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;You're almost there. ETA 2 minutes.&gt;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Hey Claire, at least we won't be alone in this nightmare,\" he said to her, unaware they were listening. Claire broke into a fit of giggles as he spoke, the pilot of the Orca eavesdropping. Two other guys looked up, almost irritatedly, at the sound of her laughter. The craft, whose back ramp lowered, hovered over the area where the trio awaited, Three Aurotian soldiers, clad in black and gray armor, jumped from the back of the ship, a small Stormrunner falling behind them. But, just as the ATV left the ramp, huge mutant crows attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Aw, dammit! Mayday, mayday, this is Orca-6, codename Golden Sun, requesting support! Huge, mutant avians are assaulting my craft! One has broken in, and is tearing up the hold!&gt;&gt; the pilot called desperately into the radio. The Orca shuddered, left, then right, with sounds of battle coming from inside and the outside being assaulted by the infected crows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Dang it! Open fire on the crows!\" one of teh droptroopers shouted, unshouldering a Vulcan and opening up on the enemies surrounding the transport. Cirrus supported him, relaying backfire across the ship's surface. But, it was too late; the Orca fell toward Raccoon Woods, engines smoking, with pilot and crew still inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Claire said, then broke into silent tears...</span></div></div>",

I wonder if that one was just...Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire perked up as three blobs came around a nearby corner. Her mouth watered, despite their comparatively small size to the blob she had just eaten. She grunted, stood back up, and started to waddle as though she were unaware of their presence. She squealed in joy as the sweet things took her bait. As they neared her, she struck. Diving down, she managed to snag one blob and stuff it into her mouth. Sweet pastry cream squirted on her lips and shirt, but most made it into her mouth. The other two blobs seemed to recoil, but they were too slow. Claire slurped up the one she had bitten into, then crawled surprisingly quickly over to the other two, shoving them both whole into her mouth. Various cookies and pastries flew from the blobs as Claire stuffed them both into her maw, the doughy treats flying into her now equally doughy cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Urp!* \"Oh...dear god...that was wonderful...much better than that giant one!\" she moaned, picking small treats from her cleavage with her chubby fingers. \"I really prefer feeding myself to being fed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her slow, ponderous way to her feet, Claire smiled as her belly flopped even lower. Her top was tearing a bit, revealing a cavern of cleavage caused by her giant, jiggly breasts fighting for room. Her chins still rested on a small cushion caused by their competition for room. Rubbing her now absolutely enormous belly, she wound up cooing to the doughy mass. After a few moments, she turned her attention to her expansive hips, rear, and thighs. Her hips had blown out even more than her belly, creating a set that would have a hard time fitting through even double doors, let alone a single. Her rear had grown on par with her hips; a pair of lovely cheeks, each as big as a yoga ball inflated to bursting point. A tear had formed in the seat of her pants as well, revealing her now thong-like panties. Of course, her rear wasn't the only feature worth her attention. Her thighs bowed out hugely, now resembling a fairly mature oak in width. They now rubbed no matter how she shuffled her legs, so she did enjoy the sensation almost perpetually. Amazingly, the addictive chemical seemed to be doing her some good, as she retained all of her mobility, despite the hindrance of her thunderous thighs and flabby, doughy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so BIG! I can't believe it! And if there are even more blobs...I can get even bigger! I've gotta get looking!\" she cried, waddling her now 950 lb. bulk along. The rips in her pants and shirt slowly grew as her flabby assets jiggled, but they held firm against her overwhelmingly womanly curves.</span></div></div>",

The shirt and pants she had grabbed were holding sturdy, and looked as if they had grown along with her. A good thing, too, as her hips could dismantle any couch, and her breasts were easily beyond any scale of measurement. Her full, soft, flabby breasts simply sagged over the sides of her titanic belly, and jiggled with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...so absolutely wonderful...and I think...I'm actually full! Good thing too...but...Thiel? I could use some help getting up...\" she said, her multiple chins jiggling.

It was pitch-dark inside, with no lights on, something that they knew should've given away danger. But it seemed to be the only place free of evil creatures, for it seemed untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! We finally made it!\" Thiel said excitedly, pushing open the doors slowly.

The licker screamed in pain as the rounds pierced its head, small flecks of blood leaking from the bullet holes. But that wasn't all.

The man reached up onto the flight mask, clipped it off, and slid the helmet off in the same motion. A blond mane of wild hair broke free, held up into messy spikes by a pair of goggles. Several scars lanced over his eyes and the bottom right of his cheek. Bright blue eyes shone in the dim light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name...is Cirrus Ragnair. Now come on inside. It's not safe out there anymore. Not since that disease wiped out almost all human life. Now only a few humans remain, along with other things,\" Cirrus said, gesturing them to go inside. They complied, and the lights flickered on, revealing shelves upon shelves of weaponry. And on the floor rested three, motionless, sweet, candy blobs. Just like those Claire had devoured earlier. She squealed in happiness, and began waddling toward the sweet, mobile confections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to eat all of them. Two are for my family...where ever they are in this insane city. They are apologies....for failing them.\" Claire stopped, and looked at him as he sat down.

She grabbed the blob, and stuffed it into her mouth, noticing how much different flavor it had. It was twice as sweet as the others, and seemed to be even more fattening, for it added a further five hundred pounds of beautiful fat to her frame, causing her to giggle as she grew even fatter, her belly expanding further over her thickening thighs. Her breasts squeezed her top further, becoming larger than extra-large beachballs, with her arms pillowing with layers of fat. Thiel had to hold his nose to prevent extreme blood loss as he stared at his goddess. Claire burped a little, giggled again, then settled into her soft form.

Thiel himself sat there, stunned by the word from the pilot who had ripped open a licker's head with his bare hands. But then, something unexpected happened. Claire stood up, albeit shakily, then waddled over toward the hunched form of Cirrus, and engulfed him in an enormous hug, holding his face in her cleavage. Thiel, still stunned, felt his jaw drop when he saw this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire! What are you doing? We hardly know 'em and yet... you're giving him a hug? What's with that?\" Thiel half-shouted, half-asked. Claire looked at him woefully, then motioned toward Cirrus, who had gripped her form tightly, tears of depression dripping on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i will kill them all....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will kill them all... all Umbrella Corporation's employees, monsters, EVERYTHING. They took from me my family, and now....I'LL ERASE THEM FROM HISTORY.\" On that note, he removed himself with a slight bow and strode over to the stairs, where he proceeded to walk up to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's fat belly shook as she sat down again, breaking a bit of the floor with her enormous mass. She rubbed her eyes, then looked at Thiel.</span></div></div>",

Claire was lying on her side, motioning for Thiel to snuggle next to her. The seduction worked, and Thiel rubbed right underneath Claire's enormous breasts, snuggling into her massive belly. Claire bent over as best as she could, and kissed Thiel's cheek, which immediately turned cherry red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Thiel,\" Claire said, before laying her head down on an oddly comfortable sandbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Claire...\" He had fallen asleep ten seconds before Claire said that, and was sleeptalking as he clutched at her belly fat.

Thiel looked up to see that the lights were off, and it was morning. He saw Cirrus sitting on a makeshift bench, sparks flying from a metal container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Thiel moved slowly, trying not to wake the still sleeping Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Cirrus grunted, looking at Thiel as if he had intruded on \"his\" time. \"Oh, I 'm building a machine drone, equipped with a minigun I found, along with smoke launchers, to aid us. Claire is a little slow, in speed, and she'll need more protection than just you. You're not that intimidating, so I built this little guy to combat entire ARMIES of zombies and demonic things to protect our small squad.

Picking up on the minute whirs and clicks, he smiled and nodded. A bit more firepower would be useful. Walking back to Claire, Thiel sprang back as a spray of fire lanced over Claire's sleeping form, then swept to him. Flipping back over the counter, he flipped the Colt over the top and let a pair of shots out. A sudden silence filled the air as he popped his head back over the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Cirrus? I'd say you need to work a few bugs out.

But, Theil wanted to prove himself, as he said, so he just figured TRIAL BY FIRE. It's not his fault. Be more specific. I haven't finished hooking up the rest of his AI chips yet.\" Cirrus wiped his face of grease, the blackish substance coating most of the lower half and his neck. The robot, whose name was Abram, was busy fiddling around with something internally. Theil looked at him oddly as he continued to shudder apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCirrus cocked an eyebrow at him. \"That? Oh, he's trying to get into walker mode. I installed it as a way of him being extremely mobile, but he's not used to the code yet. Give it a few seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, Abram began shifting, the massive front half of the tank's tread pods coming loose,and slamming onto the ground with elbow-like joints. A hand folded out from a spot underneath the normal treads, one on each arm. The huge minigun rotated slightly, coming to rest on the shoulder of one, the gun being attached to the forearm. The legs folded out next, the other half of the pods breaking into two sections and folding properly by mechanical hydraulics and pneumatic switches to form two large legs, wide-based for good stability. THe entire middle half rotated, the place where Abram's  head was snapped down onto the torso, and part of the lower torso folded down to become the armored skirt. The fully-transformed Abram snapped to attention, giving off a crisp salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? He's all right. Just needed to accept the programming code. SO, what's first on our agenda?\" Cirrus asked, taking a look at a calendar in the corner of the room. The police-themed calendar was scrawled on with all sorts of reminders, warnings, and thing-to-do that Cirrus had put up, to make sure that if he had to stay too long, he stayed on top of things. He ran his finger down to the 12th day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Need to go patrol outside, make sure nothing BIG is coming, set up a perimeter with machine guns in here, start making d-turrets for us. And find transportation. Claire probably can't walk too fast with her beauty.\" Claire giggled at this, and blushed deeply. Theil wrapped his arms around her and planted a small kiss on her cheek, which made her body shake as she giggled again. Cirrus smiled, then felt a stabbing pain as he remembered the task he had yet to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you two, be good! Don't bring a house party in here!\" Cirrus joked as he left, leaving Abram with the two. The couple sat down, Claire's massive rear propping her up about a foot off the ground, her massive cheeks providing a perfect cushion for her and her beau. Abram stood stock still, recording whatever he could, just in case something went wrong. Claire's body elicited a loud rumble as they cuddled, Theil being shaken by the massive action. He looked up and Claire blushed, before turning to Abram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you know if there's any food here?\" Theil asked, before stopping himself. 'It's only a robot, he can't understand me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes there is. Back down the hallway to the right is a large storage room, filled with food for the long stay here. Don't eat it all, please. Cirrus requires a lot more calories than you do for what he does. Be careful. MOst of that is still unexplored, so carry a weapon with you. And a few grenades, just in case.\" Abram lifted a mechanical, black finger toward the gun racks, pointing at a 12-gauge and a small pile of napalm grenades. Theil's mouth dropped to the floor as Abram walked to the door and set up, pulling the minigun to a position he could wield it easily. Theil got up and received the necessary supplies, then began the long trek to the storage room.</span></div></div>",

With the help of my colleagues. They were my path to a Nobel prize, most likely...but now, look at me. Hiding in a bakery. What a world, what a world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made these? You don't work for Umbrella, do you?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umbrella? Do the blobs look like zombies? No, Umbrella can hold its monopoly on the hellish undead, I work for a far more philanthropic corporation, by the name of Raincloud. May it rest in peace...our secret labs underneath this city are now as good as gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the blobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, young woman, it would probably be hard for a person of your attitude and proportions to understand, but there are those in this world who are starving. Many of them, especially, of course, in the war-torn Third World. These blobs, in theory, could feed those starving masses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so a little blob clearly goes a long way, so you could feed alot of people with relatively little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what the hell's the point of making the blobs mobile and aggressive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young woman, you are naive. Amount of food, while an issue, is not the true problem. A huge amount of food is already sent to nations in need. The problem is that those in power steal it and hoard it, and use it to insure that no one disobeys them. You'd salute anybody if it's you're only way of getting fed, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, by making food with a limited mind of its own, it can specifically hunt out and feed itself to those who truly need it, leaving out the murderous middle man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That actually kinda makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. That's why I've spent years working on it, silly girl. And we were nearing completion. But...alas, the president of our company, a brilliant and honorable woman, passed away some months back in a car crash. And she left, for reason beyond my understanding, all control of the company to her 19-year-old daughter, Olivia. And Olivia is a charming, clever young girl, but she's also...well...nutty as a fruitcake. And this morning, she asked to taste one of the blobs. We let her, of course, since she is now our boss, but...well, she liked it altogether too much. She went so mad with her desire to eat more and more of them, that she let them all out of their containment pens, where they proceeded to flood into the rest of the labs, and now, into the city above.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to Olivia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying her feast immensely, I imagine. Last I saw her, she was already obese enough to make you seem like an anorexic pop star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was almost ashamed by the fact that she felt jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how many blobs are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lord! Many. Many, many, many. Even I don't know the exact number. But enough to feed whole nations...or, one very crazy, short-sighted girl named Olivia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said your labs are all destroyed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But...well, before fleeing myself, I copied all data needed to produce more blobs onto this disc...\" he brandished it like a sword \"If I could get out of this city alive, my Nobel Prize could happen anyway. Oh, and I suppose the lives of all those starving people may be at stake as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Thiel looked at each other, then back at the old man.</span></div></div>",

Claire's own metabolism worked against her as it was hijacked by the blob inside of her, turning it into fat to be stored in her body. Her already plumped breasts swelled massively as her jugs ripped her pitifully small shirt apart and eventully snapped apart her bra, lying freely against her now gigantic rolls of fat making up her furry belly, her nipples fattened. Her arms also swelled up as her clumsy hoof hands were made increasingly useless as they swelled with fat. Rolls of flab cascaded down her back down towards her tail, the base of which had even plumped up as the rest of it hung atop of the area that was being hit the hardest by the meat monstrosity: Her ass. Her jeans were literally ripped to shreds as the mammoth, colossal fur covered cheeks freed themselves, growing larger by the second as the calrories of the ooze found their new home, their population explosion causing her underwear to become a makeshift thong, and eventually snap off, flying into the air like a sling. Her ass became so massive she was forced to fall onto the elephantine rump, shaking the alley and sending ripples throughout her lard encased body, her gigantic, fat-filled thunder thighs useless to hold it up anymore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streamed down her rapidly bloating cheeks, her eyes rolling back into her head as the rapid consumption of massive amounts of meat forced her into a lazy daze/coma as juice and globs from the overflow of the thing forcing its way past her lips poured down her multiplying chins and onto her breasts and belly. What seemed like hours passed as her weight soared past the triple digits to over a half ton, and then a ton of girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the last little bit of the blob squirmed its way past her plump, luscious lips with a wet *plop!*, its destiny lying with the rest of its mass, intertwined and a part of Claire as she once again gasped for breath. As said multiple ton cow-girl regained her senses she had to struggle just to see past her swollen cheeks. She let out a dismayed groan as she tried desperately to stand, sobbing as the only feat she managed to accomplish with this effort was a large fart erupting from her humongous rear. The slime squrimed around inside of her, making her behemoth-sized hindquarters jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could have sworn it was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tied to yell, to scream, to howl as much as to find help as to vent her horror and frustration, but all that could get out of the flab of her neck was a dull \"Mooooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there, filling up the width of the alley with her girth, panting heavily just to breath, sweat rolling off of her fur-covered curves. As she continued to struggle in vain to stand, to move. But deep down inside, under all of the layers of beef, Claire knew the horrible truth. The blob had finally won....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it's prize was her.</span></div></div>",

It was a mad creation of super science, and look what it had done to her body: she had turned into a half-cowgirl. So she simply let it run its course. Better this than being completely warped into something hardly human. Tears ran down her cheeks, which were fattening as they did, plumping up quite a bit and adding a nice little bit of pudge to her face. She simply held her engorging gut, feeling the disgusting blob slither its way into her swelling form. It filled her thighs and legs, of which now she noticed her feet had become hooves and her calves slightly coated in a downy fur layer. She placed a hand on her thighs. It sank about two inches into the flesh, then three, then four as her body continued to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When is it going to end...? I don't think my body can hold much more...</i>, Claire thought resignedly, looking at her growing body coming into view at the blob's sides. She must've been well into the 400lb. mark, her face garnering another chin. She turned her head a little and watched her furry cow-tail thicken as fat poured into it as well. Her breasts were about to burst her top, the red biking fabric getting ready to just give up. The red short-shorts that went with it were being ripped to shreds by her growing ass, the black spandex underneath beginning to show her sensual curves in their full glory. Her belly was a gigantic, oblong sphere caused by the blob's internment into her digestive system, making her shirt ride up and become more like a bra even as the red leather began to fail, being pushed to the limit by EE-cup breasts. Her ass was now a pair of giant globes of fat, silky smooth, apparent even through the spandex. Her fattened arms, now large and soft, resembled pillows in their form and with them she covered her growing bust. Her thighs and hips swelled immensely, flaring out about two feet and her thighs being about two feet in diameter. Fattened cankles rubbed together as she sat, not caring anymore about her body's fattening, just wishing it would stop. And eventually it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob slid the final portions of itself down into her body, and she felt the growth subside. Claire stood up and gazed into a pool of water, looking at a reflection that was hers, and yet not so much. Her face had chipmunk cheeks and a second chin, which oddly enough made her face look extraordinarily cute. At least, to her. Getting up, she felt her fattened breasts, marveling in their soft and perky forms, actually admiring her engorged assets. She fondled her soft, enormous ass, reveling in the pleasure it gave her. Her fattened thighs were nice, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it isn't so bad...\" Claire said, picking up her pistol and heading off. For some reason, the cow genes implanted into her mad her a lot faster than usual...another perk. \"This is gonna be fun...\"</span></div></div>",

Yet it was also relentless in its assault, and Claire's handgun did very little to harm the beast, thus as clumsy as it was, it still had way more endurance than the 300 pound girl.

She gasped sharply in pain as she hit the pavement, and all the poor, exhausted girl could do for a moment was lay there on the ground, her belly bobbing as she gasped for air. The blob saw her weakness and took this opportunity to move closer and closer, oozing over to her as if it was savoring its victory. Claire took this time to struggle onto her feet, standing and shaking as her strength faded before she fell to one knee, panting massively, sweat dripping from her body as her heart pounded. She looked up, only to see the blob \"looking\" back, a dripping, meaty tentacle hanging in the air inches before her face like it was gloating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....\" She begged pathetically in between pants, \"Please... no... I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob showed her no mercy, silencing Claire's feeble protest as it forced its meaty tentacle past her open lips, funneling through her mouth and pouring down her throat. Her cheeks bulge as her eyes widen, the slime going down her throat visible as her neck throbs from its movements. The poor redhead's already bloated stomach then begins to swell once more as the meat monster hits it, her belly stretching and stretching outwards as the creature fills it like some kind of balloon, even when it becomes painful for her, it continues. Her eyes roll back in her head as she starts to lose her concentration, the relentless assualt on her body overloading her senses as her pain is relieved, the blob taking control of her motabolism and putting it into high gear. Soon the pressure in her expanding gut is relieved as the horrible creature is digested into fat, and now it is the rest of her body's turn to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire can feel her breasts swelling, her belly softening, and her ass and thighs becoming even bigger and fatter than they were before. She tries to focus, but is quickly losing consciousness as she slowly begins to black out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire couldn't believe just how gigantic she had become. She tried to get a good look at herself, but it was a difficult thing to do since her breasts had grown so large they obstructed her vision of her belly and her legs, and her neck was so full of fat that turning her head from side to side became nearly impossible! The distraught girl lifted a hefty arm, letting out a soft gasp as the fleshy appendage jiggled. She was shocked at how much effort was now required to move even one limb, and wondered if she could ever get on her feet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to try though, so she attempted to stand, but she had trouble at first, it was almost as if she was even bigger than her largest estimate. Eventually Claire shifted her weight so that she could get up, nearly toppling over onto her massively bloated stomach. The corpulent babe clutched her wobbling belly in a chubby hand which sunk into the copious amount of flab. She panted heavily, sweat drenching her just from accomplishing such a small feat as standing, but now she was able to get a decent idea of how big she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to have now been the fattest woman in the entire city, if not the world. Her belly curved before her, sticking out about four or five feet and almost touching the ground. On top of the humongous paunch rested two swollen breasts which tore apart the black skinsuit, exposing generous amounts of cleavage. The only reason they didn't tear the poor top apart was her red vest, which still held the giant orbs together despite their growth. Her arms and legs had become encased in fat, as well as her neck, the rolls of which matched her multiple chins. Her face had also gotten pudgier with cute, puffy cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what am I going to do....\" She puzzled, her hands feeling her extremely curvy frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon traced her thighs, which she could hardly see, but could just barely reach if she lifted her rippling belly. The thickened, trunk-like legs pushed her black shorts up nearly to her crotch, yet her hands continued to wander, now heading to her unbelievably wide hips. Her cheeks reddened as she felt the vastness of her voluptuous asscheeks, each one so big that she was unable to feel her horrendously stretched shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my....\" She said, shocked at its size, then continuing to rub her rump just a bit longer, shivering with pleasure,\"O-Oh my....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped suddenly as she remembered something important, \"Sherry!\" She shouted, a hand rising to cover her heaving breasts as she panted,\"I can't believe I forgot all about her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, it was quite easy to forget anything after a massive blob of meat shoves its way down your throat twice and turns you into an almost immobile blimp, but that didn't occur to Claire. It was probably only her mind trying to distract her so that she didn't realize what had fully occurred and collapsed into a sobbing wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason, she had to get moving and get out of this alley. She tentatively took a single, clumsy step, made difficult not only by her weight, but by the fact that every time she moved, her heavy stomach swayed before her. Also, with more of the meat creature inside of her, Claire noticed that it seemed as if it was moving slightly inside of her bloated body as if the ooze was still alive. Needless to say, the girl pushed this thought to the back of her mind as she took another step forward, and another, and another....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour steps later and she was already beginning to pant and sweat profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.... I must of weigh.. a... a ton...\" She groaned between gasps, wiping the sweat from her brow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her thighs completely covered her shins in thick fat, almost completely encompassing her feet. Bent over, her belly had taken enough weight to just barely graze the ground, while her once C-cup breasts had burst out of her spandex top and were resting on the ground, cold shivers being sent through her fat upper body.

Her tail even became longer, growing more fur on it as her palms grew canine pads and claws shot out the tips of her fingers. Finally her nose started to push forward, Rebecca groaning in pain as it slowly became a snout and her nose turned black, flat, and wet as she watched in horror with crossed eyes.

After all the gaining stopped, poor Rebecca weighed about 415 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted heavily, her tongue hanging out as she looked down against the will of her three chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it wasn't enough that you had to make me a fucking dog!?\" She groaned between breaths, her voice a bit deeper from all the weight, \"You had to make me a COMPLETE LARDASS TOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked angrily off into the woods. She didn't give a damn who she was talking to, she was past being horrified and completely pissed off now.</span></div></div>",

She looks down at them and sees more fat on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breaks the glass out and gets inside. She pulls her vest and pants off becuase they are too tight.

She can't get it in fast enough. That gallon is gone in 2 minutes. Then another, another.

Her face was still her just bigger and it was fusing with her neck. She would have cried but she was so hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 10 minutes she finished all the gallons of ice cream in the front cooler, 30 gallons in all. She gained 400 pounds from this and her body was changing as she made her way to the shakes. She began to suck down all the shake mixes. All this time her body as well as her mind changed. Her legs began to fuse together growing longer too and fatter (Think Jabba the Hut). Her arms got fatter but grew shorter. HEr breasts exploded in size. About 4 feet long, 2 feet wide and were filling with some form of milk, but 100 times more fattening and had the same DNA that was transferd to her from the leech.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thing that called itself Rebecca Chambers crawled toward the open factory, wanting to lay her brood before something killed her. It was simply a matter of survival. But she couldn't shake the feeling she was being watched. The sharp clang of metal on concrete echoed once or twice. Leaves rustled gently as the something whispered past. It had no scent, she could tell, and it was inhuman. Not like her, no. Something made of synthetic flesh and bone. Something artificial. Another whisper of a breeze. Rebecca turned her fattened face towards the sound, but it was gone. The clang of metal on concrete echoed again. Soft sounds of whirring gears and hydraulics caught her attention. She wish she had a weapon that was useful against something like this, but what was it called? What was the blasted thing called?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right. A gun. So far had the virus warped her body and mind. She looked into a pool of water. She was something completely hideous. A gaping mouth, blazing out into the world while the rest of her facial features were indistinguishable. Tears fell down her ugly cheeks at what she had become. Maybe she should just die. She wouldn't be accepted by anyone. She couldn't go back to family if she found them. She was all alone. A big, stupid pink mass of disgusting flesh, warped by science into a creature most horrifying. The tinny of engines made her look up, but it was gone, whatever was there. Her once beautiful body was turned into something like Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars. An ugly, grotesque, slug-like being bent only on instinct, lust, and gluttony. The college girl, the happiest time of her life to go out on a mission, turned into a freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound came again, but this time from the pipe rafters and I-beam ceiling. A young girl's voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Poor little child, thy form and thy warped mind hast made you a shell of thou former self,\"</i> the voice said from up on high. Her ugly face gazed up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you?\" The voice that came out was awful...guttural in sound. What happened to her voice? It was disturbing how much she had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Something you know of, but someONE you know not.\"</i> A sharp <b>THUMP</b> came from a spot about thirty yards away. However, it was in total darkness and even with Rebecca's twisted form she couldn't see who it was. Or rather WHAT for that matter. She slithered over, her form making disgusting squelching sound as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you?\" she asked once more. A reply came swiftly. It was very quiet, like a lost little girl explaining something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just call me Guardian for now, little one.\"</i> A form stepped out of the shadow. It was a robot, it appeared, with smooth, long legs and a short, angular torso. The blocky shoulders gave way to shapely, graceful arms. It had a young girl's head, with grey eyes and a cropped head of black hair. She cradled a giant rifle in one hand. The other had some sort of attachment on it. Something that looked like a missile pack rested behind her right shoulder, and a long, triangular cannon rested behind her left. Her eyes were sad, almost ready to cry. The rifle pulsed deadly energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" Rebecca asked, frightened. Her form quivered. She raised the rifle, the tip glowing a cyan blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The cure to this destabilization of man. Hold still.\"</i> The rifle fired, emitting a pulse of energy so powerful it blazed over Rebecca, knocking her out. Her body sank into itself, repairing her form. Her skin above the slug half returned to normal. The tail smoothed out into a graceful shape instead of the hideous amorphous mass it was before. Her face returned to normal, but it was slightly cherubic, her cheeks a little chubbier. Her lips regained their former shape, and her breasts slowly receded into her chest, reverting back to their normal, slightly fattened, perky selves. Her waist slimmed down, but her hips flared out above the slug half, giving her a fairly decent hourglass. She was back to normal. Or, about as normal as you can get with a half-slug body. She slept peacefully for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = <br>\r\nWhen Rebecca woke up, she was still in the candy factory, but snoozing on something very comfortable. It was very soft and warm. She cuddled up next to it, but then recoiled as she realized that it was her tail. She sat bolt upright. But something was weird. She looked into a pool of water. She was back to normal! Albeit with a little more in the T&amp;A area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...what did that thing shoot me with?\" Rebecca asked. She looked behind her and noticed her tail was definitely longer and more elegant, colored a deep scarlet. It actually felt...right.
