As you sit you see the mermaid, only now righting herself, snatched up head first in the mouth of a large sand shark. It made short work of her as it quickly gulped down her madly swishing tail emptying her into its stomach. A visible squirming bulge was visible from the outside as it slowly glided away with a full stomach. Releasing the octopi version of a sigh you settle back in relief when something catches your eye, a pair of mermaids are entering the cave speaking in fearful sad voices quietly to one another. Getting a better glimpse you see that one of them has pink hair much like the first, though slightly lighter, and an even prettier face. Her chest left much to be desired but her tight little ass was a work of art. The other had sunny blond hair with a cute face, nice rear, and a full rack. They are talking about their friend, mourning that she will soon be soup but what interests you is apparently they did not see you flee into the cave. Now your a decent size but your uncertain whether you can handle both of them, let alone fit them both in your gut. So will you play it safe? Or go for the whole prize?</span></div></div>",

Looking at them you decide to start with the pink haired one, dragging her forward to be grabbed at by your other tentacles, pulling her towards your now open mouth. This seems to break the shock as her now screaming thrashing body frees the others mind, they both start screaming but a lot of the noise is deafened as you shove the first head first into your mouth. You lick at her face and breasts, tasting her tears as you push her further in, slurping at her tail. At this point you realize this will be a challenge, as you are already having a little trouble forcing the first into your stomach. But eventually you force her in, stretched out the length of your body inside. Finally you turn your attention to the other who is pulling at your tentacle trying to free herself. As she notices you are done with her friend and are now giving her your undivided attention she freezes, then she begins sobbing, begging you to spare her and that her friend should feed you for a week alone. But her pleas fall upon deaf ears, as why not feed yourself for two weeks instead of just one. Mermaids were so illogical, you never did quite get them, but you always did love meeting them. Quickly pulling her forward you turn her around so you can eat her tail first, sliding it into your mouth you start your journey upwards, licking wildly across her body as you pulled up around her breasts. His cries were constant and she pulled at the edges of your mouth with her arms before you pushed her the rest of the way in with your tentacles. Finally you slowly started dragging her down your throat, her pretty blond hair dissapearing down your maw after her. You would be seeing that again soon enough you were sure. Their screams echoing inside you really added to the pleasure of the whole event, finally with great effort you forced her in next to her friend.  resting upon the bottom you could actually see their squirming crying outlines pressing outward against your skin. As you lay there for hours watching them writhe in pain as you digested them, constantly undulating to break them down, you enjoyed yourself more than you had for months. Eventually though you finished and expelled their bones and hair into their final resting place in the cave. </span></div></div>",

The first, Seles, had long pink ringlets of hair, violet eyes, an ever smiling face, and a delicate little tail with yellow scales that shined. Ever carefree it had been her idea to play out in the water off shore.The second Mieril, had shoulder length blond hair, blue eyes, a worried face, and a dainty little blue tail. She was always worrying and had tried her best to stop the other two from this idea. The final was Lissii, very naive and viewed Seles as the leader, her long purple hair decorated with shells, and carefree green eyes, and childish face represented her naivety well.

From the outside all that can be seen is her nice little rear and tail wiggling about slapping the seaweed as they are pulled in to join the rest of her in your undulating pink trunk. Little squeals of fear barely able to be heard through it, she is dragged in, and her squirming crying form slowly begins moving down your trunk.

Her wriggling felt so very good, you had never experienced prey like this before. Sure they all fought, but the will to live in these seemed so much stronger, and something about eating them felt oh so deliciously right. Right before Seles broke through the ring of seaweed to your little resting place Lissii's wriggly little form passed beneath the sand. However she still had a few feet before she would be emptied into your stomach. \"Where are you!, i know you're here!\" Seles exclaimed as she broke through the seaweed with a big grin that quickly changed to confusion. Suddenly a sly grin crossed her face, as you just barely hear her whisper \"Think your tricky do ya, well you wont trick me,\" as she slid up next to your trunk, hugging it as she looks around it unwittingly touching the creature that just devoured her nutritious little friend and would soon eat her as well. With a burst of speed she sped toward to the seaweed again for cover from her playful prey, however panicking you struck out like lightning engulfing her up to her hips. Looking behind her in terrified bewilderment, fear dawned on her face.\"WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU! GODS PLEASE DON'T EAT ME!,\" her terrified screams pressed through the water and with a panic stricken face began wildly beating at your trunk as you pressed on until you were below her breasts. Her screaming continued until an angry voice came from the nearby seaweed followed by a petite little face parting it. \"You jerks think you can trick me and make fun of me just because i didn't agree with- ?!\" Her angry tirade was cut off midway as she took in the scene before her, \"Please Mieril, you have to help me, i don't want to die!,\" she yelled at Mieril with tears streaming down her terrified face as you reach her neck and her arms are jerked straight up to better accommodate your mouth.

But growing tired of the charade you open your mouth and chomp down above her head and slowly suck in her arms and pink hair after her. Quickly sucking her halfway down your trunk you make your move for the third, but she's a step ahead of you. Snapping your mouth out toward her she jerks back just out of reach and your mouth closes violently in the water right in front of her, now outside of the ring of seaweed. \"I don't think so, im not as stupid as my former friends.

Then he slowly withdrew himself back into the hole to digest his prim little prize. If you could smile, you would be doing so widely now. You may not have gotten them all, but in end they all were devoured and that is good enough for your pride. Settling back into your usual stance you deposit your appetizer from early into your stomach as she reaches the end of your trunk and passed into your shell. Neither her crying nor her struggling have stopped and it feels magnificent, and you continue pulling Seles down as well, her body nearly under the sand now and begin spraying stomach acids all over Lissii causing her cries to redouble. Purposely taking your time with Seles, you undulate your stomach heavily to digest Lissii who's squirming has been steadily dieing down. Finally as Seles nears your shell you make sure to remind her what she has to look forward to, as you pump the remains of Lissii, hair, bones, byproduct, and those pretty little seashells that had belonged to your brethren up past Seles' now wildly sobbing form and sprayed them out into the ocean. Then depositing her form inside your stomach you once again spray stomach acids and begin the churning as her sobbing screaming wriggling excites you. Spending the next few hours enjoying her you finally finish the process and spray her back out into the ocean.</span></div></div>",

You came from an age of mammoth creatures, monsters that would dwarf even the greatest beasts of this worlds ocean now. This world is dieing, the sea's had once brimmed with life and stretched much greater distance. This ocean was barren in comparison from the one you came from, only the forms of small occasional life flitting through its great expanses, though not quite so large as you remember. The world has changed and it is evidenced by the coast, you are near land when once this had been miles from any continent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you are soon drawn out of your wonder, as your eyes focus on a group of strange creatures just in front of you. They were so odd, their beautiful sleek bodies with their bright fish tails and smooth skinned upper bodies. They had expressive beautiful faces with hair of all colors, lengths, and styles. They had luscious orbs of flesh bouncing in pairs on each of their chests. However another odd thing attracted your gaze, they had firm rounded butts sticking out behind them, and a v in the flesh on the front, almost as if their tail were attempting to split into two with a tight little slit in the flesh between them pronounced ever so slowly by puffy lips. They were so many sizes and seeming types, they had different eyes, and skin color, and hair and scales. Some were as small as a foot in length, others around six or seven. The small ones were much more numerous and they darted about the larger ones as they talked and laughed. There was nothing like them from your time, and you wondered what purpose they served in this one. Luckily for you, you were still buried, with just the orbs of your eyes poking out of the sand and a your jaws hanging open appeared to be nothing more than a cavern amongst all the rocks and sand around you, you were well hidden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it was too as you soon saw, these creatures would have fled at the first sign of you. You were twenty feet long with long unforgiving jaws, bulbous reptilian eyes, and a long triangular head filled with cruel teeth attached to a large body with a stubby tail and 4 long fins that propelled you through the water. You were small for your kind in your age and still growing, you are a monster in this one. What seemed like a small shadow passed over you and for once you felt familiarity as you saw a shark dart down catch one of the smaller mermaids, one with long blond curls, a bouncy pair of breasts, and a pretty and innocent face. She looked up a moment, uncomprehending and still with a fading smile of joy on her face as the shark engulfed her up to her ass. The other mermaids started to scatter as the shark continued swimming, it's dinner's tail wildly flailing outside it's mouth before with a snap it gulped that down too. It quickly darted to snatch up another small mermaid, this one with red hair that hung to her shoulders and and a pretty little face that kept peeking back in terror at the approaching diner after his meal. You felt something else you had not felt for so long at the sight of pretty little butt clenching and unclenching with each wild swish of her tail, arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark closed it's jaws about her right before she entered the safety of a rock cave. You watched the shark leisurely swim toward you, where a group of the little foot long mermaids was madly swimming away. The one in his mouth screamed and pushed pointlessly at the sharks jaws closed about her back and stomach before the shark gulped her down, giving you a view of her crying face at the jaws closed after her. The shark was already on his way toward the other four mermaids, they were delicious looking, and you wanted them, but you had to bide your time. But you understood their purpose now, Food.</span></div></div>",

The next one had light blue hair that was decorated with shells and was hung smoothly out behind her tied near the very end with some seaweed, her breasts bobbed with her movements and she looked scared and sad all at once. The one in front of the rear two kept shouting encouragement back to them, her bright red hair would be an impediment to her, she would stand out like the meal she was for all predators to see. It hung down her back a little and just enough to hang in front of her pretty little breasts, with their rosy pink nipples. The one in the lead seemed in a blind panic, she swam wildly without looking back alternately pulling at the long purple hair that swirled about her face and damning the fact that she hadn't shortened it. Her purple tail thrashed and propelled her onward as she pulled her hair free of her face, green eyes opening wide with realization that safety was near as she saw the thin cave entrance that your slightly ajar jaws provided. The others saw it too and changed course for it. However by now, the shark was close behind and was already opening his jaws to gulp down the sweet treat in the back. The first three reach your mouth and bounce about inside it, unable to stop quickly enough due to their speed. As they all get control of themselves they turn and start screaming at the pink haired one, \"Hurry Perswi, you can make it!

Then with every inch of its body showing terror, you realize it has seen your eye and made the connection with the jaws, and are glad that this creature remembers your kind. Deep in it's brain, its ancestors memories fired through it neural paths, teaching it the horror of what you are. With a dash it bursts away toward the deeper ocean, carrying the fading cries of its dinner with it. You would see them again days later, though you wouldn't know the pile of bones for what they were, nor would you care. As the mermaids huddle near the back of your mouth and whispering soothing words to one another, you slowly close your jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey notice the absence of light instantly, and begin shouting before one, the one who had been shouting words of encouragement if you remembered the voice right, calmed the others. \"Maybe, that dumb old shark just pushed some rocks or mud over the hole or something, maybe we can dig our way out.\" which was instantly met by a fearful voice, \"How Selli? We aren't strong, besides who knows whats in here? What if our digging attracts something from deeper in the cave,\" this one you were pretty sure was the one who had been at the back, you salivate a little at the memory of her breasts jiggling and her tight little cunt squeezing closed with each swish. \"Well what do you think we ought to do, wait her until something finds us? Or wait here until we die?\" This one is definitely the the one who had been in the lead, her haughty demeanor was funny to you as you saw her blind terror from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continue to talk, you decide to interject, \"Oh sweet meats, don't argue I do so prefer my meals to be as sweet in manner as they are in taste.\" At this they all stopped talking, you could feel how tense they were. \"Who said that?!\" it was Perswi, and she sounded terrified despite the attempt at bravery. \"I'm not in the habit of talking with my meals, after all, mannerisms would be wasted since you will be digesting in only a few moments.\" At this you chuckle a little, and for a brief moment light shines in. The mermaids understand at once what they had missed before, as the light outlines your teeth. \"We-were in a mouth!\" you hear the one with the blue hair stutter out. \"Not just any mouth my dear, mine.\" However what happened next surprised you, \"Don't eat us, we can pleasure you.\" the voice of the lead mermaid was quiet but it cut through the fearful mewling of the others like a thunderclap. You remained silent for a moment, \"How little one, you are tiny and I am massive, nor can I promise that I would not be ravenously hungry after such treatment.\" \"With our bodies, with our breasts... with our mouths.\" she replied. </span></div></div>",

Without warning your cock throbs and rockets cum into Perswi, blasting her off the end of your cock and filling the water with massive goblets of semen. The other two hold on tightly until you finish and then swim down and help Perswi, they swim back to the rock they were huddling near, coated in globules of semen. \"Where did Laeris go!\" Selli suddenly shouts, \"Damn her, she used us to escape!\" They look about angrily, as their friend sways only feet from them screaming in the stomach of an ancestor of the lamprey. \"Well then, it seems the deal has been broken, it appears I'll be forced to eat you, so sad.\" You tell them with false sympathy, then snatch up Perswi and Beila, they almost look like fish hanging out of a camens mouth, other than the screaming and the pretty upper bodies, they were nothing more than just fish for your belly, then you gulp them down. As they slide into your stomach, the screaming intensifies and you feel the delightful feeling of them struggling inside your belly to get out.

Let's try another.<br>\r\n{ Candi had kicked away from the others and was about to dive under when She felt a momentary pang and she was underwater. It ws momentary because she was dead in seconds. Mandi and Randi were swimming in the other direction, but Sandi saw her go pop under water. It did not register in her mind and she was about to yell to the other two when this amazing bizarre looking...thing surfaced in front of her. Before her mind could come up with an explanation the...thing opened its maw and rows of sharp teeth tore into her bountiful bosom and pretty freckled face. And she was gone from life and from the surface of the water. }<br>\r\nThis one was just as succulent. The fatty soft fleshy protuberances sticking out of the front of their bodies were especially tasty. You could recall no prey that had similar fins. But no matter, you can contemplate this after you finish off the other two.<br>\r\n{ Mandi and Randi heard the big splash amd turned around in time to see something very large going under the water. It was unlike anything they ever saw. It could only be described as a sea monster. They could not see either of their friends, but did see blood in the water and did not want to find out the hard way what was going on, so they swam furiously towards the boat. }<br>\r\nThey were trying to get away, heading towards some floating thing that was making a strange humming sound. It was not alive and you could not recall anything like this, but this is turning out to be a strange world, and if they are heading towards it it might be w weapon or just sanctuary, either way you can not let them flee. So, you swim with all haste.</span></div></div>",

You aren't very familiar with fur, and don't know what purpose it serves. They have different colored fur, you see. One has black fur, the other has more golden fur. Now that you think about it, the first one you ate also had golden fur, and the second one had red fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two creatures are swimming powerfully, moving quickly through the water. For all their speed, you gain the impression that they aren't naturally water-dwellers, but rather land creatures that spend some of their time in the water. You, however, spend all your time in the water, and are well equipped with a tail and strong fins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou easily overtake the further of the two creatures. You notice they swim with oddly divided fins, two near the front of their bodies, the other two at the back. The back two move in a way you can understand, but they make some strange movements with the front pair. These fins, by the way, are part of the reason you are convinced these creatures aren't naturally water-dwellers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter. You bite the rear fins off the further of the two creatures, swallow, then turn to face the further one, the one with the black fur. It is looking at you, head out of the water, making some sort of strange sound. You don't know if this sound is meant to be any sort of defense, but it has no effect on you. Rearing up, you open your mouth. Bringing your mouth down over the body of the creature you have selected, you bite down. You severe the protuberances at the end of this creature's rear fins. Those fall to the water as you swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you turn to the final creature. It is also making a similar noise to the last one. It has stopped swimming and is looking back at its rear fins where you bit them off. You come in a rush, swallowing the rest of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that all four of these creatures are finished, you briefly investigate the floating thing in the water, making sure there is no food left. There is none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, you swim away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does not take long to realize that you are still very hungry.</span></div></div>",

You've grown massive over the years off the flesh of your favorite prey, North Atlantic Pygmy Mermaids, or feeder fish to most fish and bait shops. Ranging from around one to two and a half feet, these fish are colorful, pretty, and bearing a strikingly similar upper body to those of human girls and women, and most importantly, common and cheap. Arguments over the years toward the morality of using these self aware little morsels as feeding stock for aquariums and privately owned fish had been cropping up for years, but the majority of the populations indifference led to nothing being done. Most of your kind couldn't comfortably manage eating them, but that didn't stop them for the most part. It wasn't uncommon to pass others of your ilk slowly swimming, belly bloated to near bursting. You didn't get to eat yesterday, and you plan on making up for it today. A glint of color near the bottom catches your eye and you swim down to investigate. Getting a little closer you realize it's breakfast, four little mermaids hiding amongst the kelp, stupidly not realizing their bright hair would stick out like a sore thumb to a creature of your impeccable sight. Now how to go about it, you could burst in like lightning and gulp them down as quickly as you can, but you ran the danger of spooking a few into the open, where they could be snatched up by other predators in the area.

The one that had drawn your attention had long platinum blond hair, she was quietly whispering in the ear of a smaller mermaid with her medium length red air floating about her pouting face, blue eyes looking rebellious. She was being scolded by the other two, one large breasted beauty with long black hair and a light yellow skin angrily berating her while the other nodded her agreement with an occasional addition of her own brushing her green hair away from her face, it hung free in the front and tied into a ponytail in the back, she would have blended in with the kelp well if not for her pale skin. Her small breasts bobbed in the current as she moved her arms, you were starting to pick up on their conversation when the red haired one swam out of the kelp, \"Do you see anything out here? It's stupid, we're too afraid of what <i>might</i> be out here to do anything, well looks like-\"  You couldn't afford to risk another predator seeing them, with a burst of speed you had descended on her, mouth gaping. The mermaids only saw a shadow pass over their friend for a brief moment, then both she and the shadow were gone and the panic set in. Swimming around the kelp, the mermaids tail swinging wildly out of your mouth, you watched the others before with a twist of your head and a swish of your tail you slurped her tail down and sent her riding down your gullet screaming to be deposited in your stomach.

She was great while she lasted, but those mermaids expire quick once they hit the tummy. You\u2019re proven wrong, as the flailing meal launches one final internal assault. It feels as if as an explosion has gone off inside of you\u2026 but you feel not pain, but pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The large lump in your stomach slowly reconfigures, moving partially down into your intestines. Without the comforting vibrations from your belly, you suddenly feel skittish about confronting the light. Still wanting another meal, you dart over to a rocky outcropping that\u2019s barely visibly behind the murky dark water it hides from the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You follow the cliff up for about an hour, until the water ends about 100 feet above you. It\u2019s mind-blowing, really. You never knew the water ended. A small part of you wants to adventure beyond your aquatic home, but the cliff, and with it the consolation of darkness, ends here. Besides, something tells you that outside the water lies danger. Seeing as you\u2019re pretty much top of the food chain, and don\u2019t keep in touch with that instinct much, you feel it\u2019s a wise idea to listen to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      So you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      And wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      After a while, some partially digested bones float to the surface above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      And then you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      After a while, you forget exactly what you were waiting for. Goblin sharks are clever, but overall, not the smartest fish in the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Regardless, you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Finally, hearing a voice in the distance, you retreat further into the bleak water, until you\u2019re parallel with the sheer stone wall. The voice is getting louder. It\u2019s low and booming, yet inherently feminine. As it draws closer, you can make out another sound, higher pitched, and definitely belonging to a creature of the female sex. They both emerge from the peak of the cliff, and you remember why you were waiting all this time: Fresh meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       One of the mermaids is the about the same size as your last meal, about 18 inches longer, making her 3\u00bd feet total, and sized conveniently to fill your stomach. Her short purple hair is tied into a bun using seaweed, and her cheerful blue eyes and her flat chest reveal her young age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The other was a giantess mermaid, a mermonster to some, but a mermeal to you all the same. Ignoring the fact that she\u2019s about twice your length and almost as wide as you, the other problem in downing her would be those firm, circular breasts. But oh, the reward you receive  once she was yours. You nibble on a piece of her long, trailing,  scarlet hair and savor the flavor. You could just tug on her hair and bring her down to your level\u2026 but it\u2019s too late now. The mermaids continue lazily swimming and chatting, heading away from you now, giving you a strategic opportunity to attack, as well as a nice view of their rounded hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The two mermaids are laughing, which is the only universally understood language underwater. Fish laugh, believe it or not. Lobsters and crabs kinda do. Even sharks make a low grunt akin to cruel laughter as they sneak up behind a school of unsuspecting mermaids. Which is unfortunate, really, because it allows the mermaids to see the shark tailing them, which in this case, is you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You still have a second to attack. You charge forward, aiming for the larger one, but as you angle yourself upwards, a small, terribly bright orb becomes visible from beyond the water\u2019s end, blinding you. Undeterred, you swim in the direction you had been going previously. You feel soft, creamy skin and salty, hard scales collide with your palate and your jaws instinctively clamp down on the chewy flesh. Both mermaids scream, creating a cacophonous chorus that\u2019s cut short as suddenly, there\u2019s no more water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Even through your scaly eyelids, the horrid light grows brighter. It\u2019s impossible to breathe up here, and it seems as if you\u2019ll be stuck here forever.Fortunately, your belly collides with the water (and the other mermaid) before long. Your lustful hunger overriding any curiosity concerning what the hell just happened, you continue into the dark abyss, screams of agony dimming behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Slowly, your vision returns as you grow accustomed to the steadily growing darkness. Crying silently in your maw, you can now view your prized catch\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, the sand seems to be pulling her in. You\u2019re not sure what it is, but you\u2019re positive somebody just jacked your meal.<br>\r\n      Not being one to give up so quickly after so much work, you latch onto her tail fin and begin swallowing it up. Scales are not the reason anybody eats mermaids, but they don\u2019t taste half bad. Once you lick them clean of the salty residue (and, on dirty mermaids, the occasional barnacle), they prove to be quite sweet. You\u2019d have found their taste similar to that of fruit, had you known what fruit was.<br>\r\n      To your surprise, the tail is quite flexible and folds up quite nicely into your waiting stomach. You manage to work your way up to the fringe of the scales, where her skin begins. Your competitor, still under the sand, has made it up to her feminine mountains, but seems to be stuck. Long red strands of hair are still visible, tickling even your rough skin.<br>\r\n      The merwoman\u2019s hands are searching the sandy ground in panic. After a few moments, she manages to feel out what she\u2019s searching for: solid rock. With an enormous shove and grunt audible even from within the sand, she pushes free, revealing her slime-coated face. It\u2019s thick, oily stuff, and it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to be washed off by salt water any time soon. <br>\r\n      Regardless, the blinded mermaid takes off in a random direction, waving her tail \u2013 the one that\u2019s still in your stomach \u2013 frantically.

It\u2019s really long hair \u2013 you can feel some of it snaking through your intestines already. Swallowing it greedily, the tension causes the behemoth\u2019s upper torso to arch back. You could put a swordfish nose-first against her back, pull her hair back, and make a bow out of her. You plan on making other, more nutritious things out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Even in this backbreaking position, the giantess endures and swims onward. You\u2019re able to use her hair to steer her clear of any dangers. A Mermaid, it seems, although very human in nature, is only as smart as a horse<br>\r\n <br>\r\n       Your stomach gurgles as it works on her thick scales. This churning is shortly accompanied by a painful moan from the mermaid, which shortly crescendos into a low, bellowing scream that could give a blue whale a run for its money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You feel her tail falling apart in your stomach. The mermaid stops swimming now, and begins writhing as the two of you slowly sink back to the ocean floor. Even once you reach rock bottom, she\u2019s still clawing at the ground,  dragging you yard by yard across the ground. After about an hour, what\u2019s left of her beautiful tail has become mushy enough, and even before it\u2019s all arrived in the intestines, you\u2019re swallowing down her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      THIS is why people eat mermaids. Not that you\u2019re an expert, this is only your second taste. But the skin is so smooth and creamy, unlike anything else found underwater. It also goes down nicely, and something about the softness of it just begs to be felt by the esophagus.  And you note that, for the record, the ass was every bit as delicious as you had previously imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You manage to swallow up to her  to her mounds, which now wait inside your maw. Skin won\u2019t take too long to digest, but you still have free time, which you spend manipulating her candy with your tongue. This intrusion stimulates her to one final assault, which involves massaging your stomach with her free hands. Well, she\u2019s actually hitting you with them, but it still feels great. Watching your stomach jiggle entertains you as much as jiggling her yourself does, and little does she know she\u2019s actually speeding up the digestion process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      It\u2019s not so funny when she picks up some rocks and does the same thing. It\u2019s not anything major, but she\u2019s covered your entire body in marks. Your skin is thick and recovers before much (or any) blood is shed, but she\u2019s covering your body in small freckled pocks of pain, and it won\u2019t scab over nicely. You start to wish she\u2019d just bleed to death already, but since all her blood drains into your bloated belly, that won\u2019t happen for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     At long last, as you digest her innards and lungs, the not-so-gentle giant lay still, forever. The rest is easy. You manage to swallow her shoulders with a little munching and compressing. Both of her arms are sucked in, leaving only her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Before you finish her, you lick her face clean of the slime that had covered it all this time. It tasted awful, and you quickly cleansed your pallet with her cheeks, still rosy with fear and fury. Once she was cleaned, her terrified face, frozen for all time, was revealed. Her eyes were wide open, seeming to scream for help, while her mouth was locked in silent prayer. A few final bubbles escaped from her eyes and lazily made their way all the way up to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You were well fed for a month. So well-fed, you couldn\u2019t move. Nothing dared touch you, you were enormous, By the time the nutrients and fats had all been arranged, you were easily three times your previous size. In the meantime, while she digested, you used her leftover hairs as tripwires. Whenever something out in the darkness was caught in one, or started nibbling on it, you reeled them in. Each time, you hoped for another lost mermaid, but was disappointed.<br>\r\n      60 days after your first mermeal, you decide it\u2019s time to go on the prowl again. With your new girth, you can eat small mermaids like krill or popcorn. They still taste the same, but why not challenge yourself more? You\u2019ve heard humans are tasty, and although you\u2019ve never seen one, your good shark buddies have said that they\u2019re all skin and no scales.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pushing with more strength when she resisted he jammed it in and started pumping until bursting into her causing semen to spew out of her mouth and pulled out of her straightening his body as she gasped for air and spat he quickly gulped her down adding a third struggling lump to his length and swam down settling on the bottom to digest his new found meal.
