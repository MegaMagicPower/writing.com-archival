Also...this is definitely for when someone is bored and wants to put something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiary series: During the creation of this interactive story I had created poems based on these characters and their backstories and I have to admit they are pretty good. No I am not going to post those poems, but I am going to flesh out some of these ranked people's backstories and how some of them interact with each other/ what they have to do with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree-world: The world is a large place and all these people are spread out in that large place, waiting for their next opponent. Fact: This was the original story design. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanked-bio: This is the option where you see the bio of the ranked people (And unmentioned others) to see their appearance, battle styles, weaponry, background, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther: More crap to put these guys through<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial fact:  This entire story was actually originally a type of storage system for characters to use...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also, don't go hard into the ground with this stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool drama: This just doesn't apply to high school. Combat schools, fighting schools, etc. Anywhere you can learn something counts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice of life humor: The humor in the everyday lives of certain people in the rankings...which is basically saying \"...What is wrong with your life?\" The spectrum of this is pretty wide, actually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolent: Where something comedic happens from one's violence that makes it memorable...or someone is just violent and something happens...or essentially seeing death scenes that I had once thought of but...yeah you might see some spoilers for certain people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandom f'n shite: No holds barred...just no holds barred...random crap ahoy with no limits!

He placed his bloody clothing in the laundry hamper (Or whatever that thing is called) and took a shower. While he was in there though, he felt something was off, and that was when Katana had appeared out of thin air right in front of him, naked of course. Instead of the surprised sound coming out as most would do, this was an occurrence that happened several times before, in which case he sighed and just said, \u201cKatana, get out\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d She questioned innocently \u201cWe haven\u2019t bathed with each other in a while, and you just got back from another job, also you look very tired\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI know that, also I outgrew that, now get out\u201d Katana stubbornly stood her ground <br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck, do I have to force you?\u201d Katana grabbed something invisible in the air as the lights went out and the sound of blades and chains clanging were heard with the sounds of Kazuya grunting and sounds of surprise. When the lights came back on Kazuya was wrapped in chains and was now laying down in the bathtub \u201cWait, where was this even set at?! How in the world-\u201cKatana got on top of him and their foreheads touched <br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in love, you can do anything\u201d Katana said when her lips were getting near Kazuya\u2019s lips <br>\r\n\u201cWait! Hold-\u201cKatana kissed Kazuya and he had goose bumps from it and he moved a lot to try and get out of it. When Katana stopped kissing, Kazuya immediately said \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cMaking love with my onii-chan\u201d She said cutely with a giggle as she went lower down the body<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa whoa, hold it!\u201d While he was saying that Katana was about to do the unthinkable \"How did it end up like this?! Ah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Different perspective- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men were in Katana\u2019s room which she was currently hugging a full-body pillow, which was custom made to have her big-brother on it, while drooling. One of them was currently touching her head and was having mixed reactions as to what was going on. <br>\r\n\u201cThis is something else\u201d The man said in a shocked tone as katana repeated the words \u2018onii-chan\u2019 several times while she is licking the body pillow\u2026a lot<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bro-con at its finest\u201d The other man said as Katana starting nibbling/ biting the pillow. While the man seeing Katana\u2019s dreams was making faces of shock and disgust, she was now squeezing the pillow harder and was now rubbing it against her crotch. <br>\r\n\u201cHeh, heh, onii-chan is inside me\u201d she said with pleasure and excitement, then she started masturbating and moaning afterwards \u201cHis semen\u2019s inside me\u2026When we have a baby I\u2019ll be closer to him\u201d She was saying with bliss and started drooling. <br>\r\n\u201cCan I quit now? This is too much!\u201d The man asked as he was shaking from his current situation and his face was  that of incredible emotional pain and distress<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t need to know more to get what\u2019s going on\u201d The man said as the other one took his hand of her head which he ended up falling over from the over-whelming scene he saw which the other one had to carry him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was still having the wet dream another person entered the room, Sasha Pajari, an Ex-Russian soldier who loves cute things and one of Katana's friends. She was just watching Katana as she was doing her own thing which not only was she turned on by the actions Katana was doing, but she was also more ecstatic by Katana\u2019s natural cuteness\u2026Well, as cute as you can get in a situation like that. In response she took off her clothing down to her undergarments and attempted to get between Katana and her body pillow, which somehow she managed to pull off without waking her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Katana started licking and nibbling her, she just had goose bumps all over her body and then brought her breasts up to Katana\u2019s mouth and she started to suck and nibble on Sasha's breast. From this, she began to feel ecstasy and was getting wetter as her breast milk was getting drunk by Katana, who was unwittingly enjoying it as in her dream that milk was something else. <br>\r\n\u201cThis is a dream come true\u201d She then began to lower her hand toward Katana\u2019s vagina, which the second she did that Katana made a quiet moaning sound and was biting and sucking on her breast harder. After several minutes she had an orgasm. With her hand covered in Katana\u2019s vaginal juices, she licked it clean, removed her breast from Katana\u2019s mouth, which when she did that Katana still had her mouth open and her tongue was still in a licking movement, and began to French kiss while she still had the juices in her mouth and while Katana still had her own breast milk still in \u201cWhy can\u2019t I have a little sister like her?\u201d Sasha thought again while she masturbated while kissing. She had an orgasm which caused her to faint as the combination of the ecstasy of cuteness and sexual pleasure done her in, while that happened Katana was still in her dreamland doing all kinds of stuff to her big brother which translated to the real world where she did the exact same to Sasha which if she was still awake she would\u2019ve died from blood loss (From nose bleeding, it wasn\u2019t that kinky) Also what happened during that period? Essentially what a lolicon like Amala do to Katana, except that katana did it for her while she was out of commission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning Kazuya had woke up early to get katana to get to school, which the instant he entered the bedroom he was hit with the aftermath scene of Sasha and Katana\u2019s fun time. Dried sticky white stuff all over the place, a musty scent inhabiting every which way, oh and don\u2019t forget the under-dressed Sasha and Katana sleeping in the same bed\u2026\u2019SLEEPING\u2019. Kazuya literally had no words nor expressions to give for the amount of unbelievable crap he saw, or smelled for that matter and this was the guy that assassinates people for a living! But he just simply walked toward the bed, put his mouth near Katana\u2019s ear and whispered, <br>\r\n\u201cKatana, will you marry me?\u201d Then Katana suddenly jumped up from her bed like she was expecting that and was going to hug Kazuya<br>\r\n\u201cYes Onii-chan!\u201d She screamed as Kazuya stepped back to see Katana miss and land onto the floor. She holds her head and was about to perform multiple rolls on the ground to emphasis pain when Kazuya stopped her short by grabbing Katana by the torso and carrying her off. \u201cWhat are you doing onii-chan!?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGetting you dressed for school damn it!\u201d And then back at the bed, Sasha, who seemed to have been forgotten immediately, grabbed the full-body pillow and started to do what Katana did earlier\u2026with a bit of variation. <br>\r\n\u201cKatana\u2026You\u2019ll be mine after I get your big brother to like me\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kazuya had gotten Katana to get to school, he came right back to the room of the unspeakable funtime and had just looked at Sasha for just a second and only thought, \"What the heck is with all the females around me?\" He carefully picked up Sasha and began to dress her up for common decency sake. When he was carrying her out of the room, a certain person saw him carrying Sasha and was not amused. <br>\r\n\"Kazuya, what the heck are you doing with Sasha!\" Kazuya turned around and saw Anna, Swedish hunter that also likes Kazuya..alot. <br>\r\n\"Um, I'm just bring her to her room, what's the problem?\" Anna sniffed the air <br>\r\n\"What the heck did you do to her you backstabbing piece of crap!\" <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I can smell the amount of sexual fluids on her! Did you have sex with her overnight?!\" Kazuya gently placed Sasha onto the ground <br>\r\n\"Look, it's just a misunderstanding, she-\"Anna bought out her bow and explosive arrow and took aim \"Crap\" <br>\r\n\"Give me one reason why I shouldn't blow you up sky high!\" <br>\r\n\"Sasha had sex with my little sister\" Anna lowered her weapon <br>\r\n\"Oh...Well that's believable...Hold on\" Anna went closer to Kazuya and sniffed him \"Hm...I don't smell semen on you\" Kazuya had a pure blank face in response to that. Anna sighed in relief \"At least I know you didn't do anything lewd\" Then suddenly Sasha had partially got up, hugged Kazuya's waist and planted her face into his waist.<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh...Kazuya...\" She said with pleasure and it set off Anna like dynamite. Kazuya immediately made Sasha let go, he brought out his jet-swords and began to ran like the devil as Anna bought out her bow and arrow and started shooting while Kazuya was riding his jet blades <br>\r\n\"KA-ZU-YA!!!!!!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n\"Are you blind woman?! Didn't you just -ARGH!\" Kazuya was caught up in one of the explosions and it woke up half the building. Later on Sasha was left alone to do her own business, which that business was still in her perverted fantasy. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Also before you ask, I actually had this planned out a long time ago, I just forgot to add this in and these schools do impact the story a lot and goes in deeply into the entire story of the battling 101 itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, optional to read as this is literally one gigantic info dump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso these people are battle crazy holy crap and despite having specified schools for beating the living crap out of each other like its a fighting game that is on steroids where people bring swords to dog fights and actually win...These guys actually still learn something so they aren't battle-hungry barbarians that turn into badasses one way or another...well most of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going into school related stuff, there is some things to know. Besides the regular schools, there are 8 major combat schools around the world. One of which is BOC Academy. Which is in America. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOC Academy: The fighting academy where one can easily obtain high learning in certain fields of fighting in such things like swordsmanship, marksmanship, or demolitions. Though this place is known for its efficiency, there is always its reputation of being surprisingly wild which these people would go on war with each other which they end up creating a WWIII simulator. Though, this is surprisingly good for teaching combat as they always get a hands-on example of their certain field, of course they are mostly using wooden blades, blanks, rubber bullets, and other things...MOSTLY. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummary: In terms of an RPG, this academy pretty much assesses you with giving you a class or title of your character and then you either leave the school becoming whatever you desire (Although these guys enforce the living crap out of morals and all things good) You can go to one of the 7 schools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 7 schools refer to the 7 best specialized combat academies in the world in which each specializes in certain fields where you advance your abilities even further. Although you do not have to attend BOC academy, it would be recommended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHighland castle: The highland castle is a academy that is in the Scottish highlands which this is a medieval-style academy which they actually do have proper plumbing and technology so you don't have to worry about that. The specialization in the highlands is essentially blade and shield specialty which gun-blades and gun shields are most definitely enforced here. The size of the highland castle is quite large and although medieval, this is one place that you should not screw with because these guys have some big cannons that are absolutely ridiculous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesert Bunker: An underground  academy in Australia which this place specializes in thermal, desert tactics and survival, scavenging/ Juryrigging, unarmed, and explosives. The desert bunker is a giant series of bunkers connected together through a complex and intricate design of passageways and other things. By the way, it's not claustrophobic in there. This place you shouldn't screw with in the first place mainly because this continent already has about 75% of its indigenous animals that can potentially kill them and the fact that these guys are in Australia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSea Fort: A specially made academy that not only reaches above water, but also connects underwater to the sea ground. This is pretty much close to Antarctica and these people are trained specifically to naval, underwater, and tactical warfare. So essentially, all of these people are mainly a support group, but a quite deadly one at that. One main reason for not fighting these people is the fact that these guys know how to defend their position and will demolish you no matter what the heck you bring (Unless its a nuclear bomb) Also, these guys are also known for research and development which is all confidential under the sea floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying Domain: As it says, it is pretty much a flying island which is only up using some high-end, anti-gravity technology. These people are essentially specialists in, of course, flying tactics, although it may seem simple, these guys are pretty much trained to excel in dog-fights, hit-and-run tactics, search-and-rescue missions, quick evacuations and other things. So basically its another support group, and one that you do not want to fight their army with as they have some big flying death machines. Also this is somewhere above Europe <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen Bastion: Essentially it was originally a giant fortification that was transformed into a combat academy...which this is in Russia. The Frozen Bastion specializes in winter tactics, guns, artillery, and defensive tactics. The only thing I have to say is that these guys are tough, intimidating, and will make you feel the wrath of mother Russia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderground Citadel: A giant underground citadel under south-America , which these people are specialists in stealth, assassination, deception, secrecy, pretty much all behind-the-scene, cloak and dagger stuff. One main reason why you shouldn't mess with these people is that they have eyes and ears everywhere and they can kill you in your sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Temple: In technical terms, this thing actually has 5 branches: Vietnam, China, Japan, korea, and India. But all of them pretty much are the same thing, which all of them specializes in the supernatural, so basically expect people to have some mystical power or be insanely powerful. The fact that the name is dragon temple and where the dragon temple is even at...Yeah that is not going to be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegular schools: They are regular schools which this is basically pointing towards high school...for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of these in mind, you actually can actually just make a comedic school moment without the need of adding characters from the 101 or any stuff. Just add people in and let the good times role. </span></div></div>",

Not only is this place always a complete warzone, but the teachers are doing absolute-\" The microphone of the MC was taken \"Hey! What-\" The person that took it was Jenkins, ranked 101, which basically a guy who is wearing all grey casual with a wooden mask on. <br>\r\n\"Oy', you know that half the stuff you're saying is exaggerated and bullcrap, right?\" <br>\r\n\"But it's true, these people keep fighting each other to death!\" <br>\r\n\"You know that no one has actually died at this school, right? Though it's true this place is a warzone, its a maintained warzone and we are watching. Besides, it's thanksgiving, do something thanksgiving related!\" Jenkins gave the MC her microphone and she got back to speaking <br>\r\n\"Well, now that's it's thanksgiving, the students are going to do their traditional weapon exchange, which means that all of their weapons are replaced with something thanksgiving related...well this is going to be messy and its a good thing the person that cleans all this up is a master at his work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Outside- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basic description of this: People that were melee-based are either using oversized turkey legs or regular sized turkey legs and beating the living crap out of each other, people who uses explosives are using exploding turkey, those with guns are shooting...well I think they're shooting bones, and those people who use heavy-ordinance weaponry are using turkey and big slabs of ham...Yeah it's very messy, chaotic, and the mother of all food fights. Also Jenkins just joined in the fray and is currently knocking students out with half-eaten turkey legs.<br>\r\n\"I wonder who took a bite out of my weapons...\" After he said that he kicked a flying turkey that was going to hit the back of his head. When he turned around he saw the student with the artillery that shot it at him and that guy ran \"Hey, get back here so I can shove this turkey down your throat!\" Jenkins disappeared into a cloud of grey smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Inside- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside is actually normal as students are actually setting up for the thanksgiving event that occurs later in the day. Of course occasionally there is the stray turkey that goes flying through the windows and the student that manages to break through the wall, it was still a lot more peaceful than what was going on outside. The only things that happen in here that were significant are the accidents that occur, like so: <br>\r\nSeveral students were setting up decorations in the hallways when a turkey came flying through the window and hit one of them behind the head, unfortunately that person had EXTREME anger management issues.<br>\r\n\"Damn it, those guys should learn to aim!\" The other people with him tried to stop him by dog piling him, but that didn't do crap as he broke out of the dog pile, launching them all in different directions and he literally ran through the wall to beat the living crap out of the guy that launched the turkey. <br>\r\n\"Well...Everyone is dead\" One of the students said as he fell unconscious <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Cafeteria- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...Surprisingly out of all of the place they could've fought, no one had actually went to a death battling in the cafeteria. Everyone was either talking about the warzone that occurred earlier in the day or the decoration successes and blunders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Gymnasium- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Today we are having exploding turkey dodgeball, you get hit you are out, the team that gets their entire team decimated loses, go! Just don't aim your bombs at the gym teacher unless you want to know what getting hit by a bullet train in Japan feels like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Chemistry- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one dares to even cough in here unless you want the chemistry teacher to literally reduce you to the worthless pile of goo you are...also any weapon used here or anything that goes through the window is turned to either ashes or to their original parts (IE Steel swords becoming steel blocks) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Dorms- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, nothing spectacular here. Just friends in their rooms being friends...And also preventing stray turkey from going through their windows. Which speaking of there is a man on the rooftop with a sniper rifle shooting whatever turkey comes near and shooting warning shots at people who are apart of the turkey wars to not get close within a certain parameter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later in the day- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone that were in the turkey wars are now all pooped and everyone in the school are all eating their thanksgiving dinner at either their families home or are staying here for the finale of the turkey wars. The MC got onto the mike and said <br>\r\n\"Okay everybody! This day has been hectic, but all good things come to an end. Now let's continue on with the Turkey War awards, shall we?\" (Yes you can get awards from the Turkey Wars. Which is not a reason to join the Turkey War for the pure reason that you will forget about it with all the flying food and bones and all of that. And yes there is people keeping track of the chaos and students) Also, we're skipping the awards ceremony and going ahead on the highlights that occurred. Remember that student who tried to hit Jerry Jenkins with flying turkey and that other student that got hit? Well guess who got an award and got tracked down to the ceremony by the beserker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow let's see the finale. All the explosives experts set up firework cannons and fire specialized fireworks which not only were the explosions thanksgiving related, but it didn't smell like sulfur and gunpowder, it was more like the burning smell of turkey... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that marks the end of the Turkey Wars. Now for the next setup that will occur on Christmas eve, oh boy this is going to be madness again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right the clean-up. There is a guy there that had created an army of robots that were made specifically to clean-up and repair things at a effective rate. Just, whatever you do, don't try to fight the robots. Although they make good practice dummies they will wreck you in how large their numbers are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-End- <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is it the repercussions of a gruesome war or is it torture after one faces endless torture after having your own tongue removed? Is it the chance of death in an unknown place or that no one will know nor care if you died? The answer to that is simple, when you taste life, but then taste death in the end\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">-Murphy Mulder </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't remember the last time I have seen the sun...I can't remember the last time I felt something other than pain and misery. All I can hear is the buzzing and clanging of torture devices, the screams of fellow lost souls subjugated on equal or worse terms than me. Everyday I can hear the sounds of war going on, which that alone kept me up endlessly. I can't count the days, weeks, or probably months that I have been trapped in this hell hole. All that time, being shackled down in a dim, dark stone room, one that is filthy with rust and caked blood, the smell of rotten flesh in the air and so is the hint of vomit, poop, and urine. The flies that inhabit my torture chamber are the only company I have, but very deadly company as I feel like something is growing inside of my open wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy tongue was cut off long ago, my torturers at one point stopped interrogating me and just tortured me for their own amusement, those sadistic bastards, whether they wanted me to shut up or just wanted to see me squirm in my own blood and pain, I could figure both. I just wanted this to all end, I just want to die, at this point of time even if I get rescued, I can never forget this place, the amount of trauma I have suffered is something no ordinary man should endure for the rest of their lives...That is if they can get out. From that point, all I can taste is blood and rotting flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith and hope is two things that I have given up many a time ago, as god will not save our souls from the depths of hell itself. Is there really another place after life? Is there heaven...is there hell? After all of this, I just want to rest peacefully...one moment of bliss, no misery, no pain...just somewhere I can see the sky, the sun, feel the wind and smell air that isn't hell. Someone...please...if I die...someone give me a burial that will put my soul at rest...but I know no one will hear this, as I cannot speak and I know that when I die, my body will be cast out as another rotten corpse... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I feel what the brink of death looks like. My vision has darkened, as if it wasn't dark already. I can't feel any pain, I feel nothing but the cold steel of my iron bindings and my prison. For some reason I can't hear the sounds of war that usually reverberate throughout this place nor do I hear the screams of tortured souls that inhabit the devil's den, I know my hearing isn't down yet, but I strike this as odd. As much as I would like to check, I can hardly move that much anymore and I am sure I am going to die soon, yet I am sure I should have died a long time ago...is my will still strong enough to pull through? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing...Nothing...That is all I hear nor I do see the usual torturers...What is going on? When I fell asleep for once in ages I woke up with my chains smashed and the door open. When I first saw it, I thought it was a dream, but even so, even if it was one, I wanted to see the ending of the dream, one that would lead outside into the open air so I can look up at the sky and sun...Even if it is fake, it would make me happy to see it one last time until I die. With whatever strength I had, with what remains of my will, with what kept me alive for all this time, I had managed to move for the first time in ages. I walked through the open door and for once I can see something else than my small, confined room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts time to escape...from this prison of hell itself with what remains of my humanity and my strength. </span></div></div>",

The dim lighting made the atmosphere seem like I was in some sort of horror story, except that this was real life and it was the reality of war. Every step I take echoes throughout the empty prison, no matter where I look, no matter how many doors I open, I cannot find anyone. No prisoners, no guards, nothing, I can only smell blood, rotting flesh, and human waste, and for whatever reason I can smell the aftermath of a warzone. Strangely enough, even with all I have heard over the time of my occupation, I literally cannot find any traces of anyone in this prison, just only the torture tools, but that is all, yet all of this smell remains. Where am I? Where is this place? What is this place? These are all questions that may not get answered, but I have a feeling that I might find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time, I vomit, but this isn't food that I'm upchucking...it's blood...black blood...it might be the lighting, but I don't think blood is supposed to look something like that...What's happening to me? Is this from all the torture I have endured all this time along with the adverse affects done to my body? I need to get out soon, but these corridors just seem to stretch forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo add more suffering, I keep having sharp headaches periodically and my vision had started to fade in and out, I think I might be losing my mind because I could have sworn that I just saw someone moving in the shadows...and I could hear someone's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think, my sanity is going to shatter, from one moment I am in in a stone corridor of a prison, now everything seems to be changing. The corridor seemed to have widened and the area around me seemed to have changed drastically. Now, everything seems to be covered in blood and aged with time, and from what I can see with the wheelchairs and...I think those are called gurney's, I think this is a hospital. I did what I have been doing, just walking forward until I reach something at the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere turned violent the moment that the dim lights had suddenly turned on brightly and the quiet sound that surrounded the area suddenly blasted into screams of pain and the sounds of medical instruments turning on with the gross sounds of flesh and bone being cut off. I started to run for some reason, something about this place is definitely wrong and I didn't even want to know what was going on. While I was running I sudden fell down to the ground and hit the floor with a resonating thud. When I checked to see what happened, I saw that my legs were cut off somehow, though despite that I still couldn't feel anything. While I was looking at my legs, the lights started to flicker and far off in the distance of the corridor a door opened and out came a soldier medic, but many things were off about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from this distance, I could see that he was far from normal as it looked like he was partially blown away by some sort of explosive. When he turned around in my direction, I could see his face fully as I saw that he had a bullet hole through his forehead. In his hands I can see that he had some sort of bloodied, rusted small-blade in his hand. The minute he started walking toward me, was my initiative to run, but even if my legs were gone and this was futile, it was in anyone's to try and avoid death even with the chances little to none. That was when I received a sharp headache and I grabbed my head in response to the pain as I heard voices, <br>\r\n\"Hold his wounds damn it!\" Someone yelled as there was gunfire and sounds of explosives <br>\r\n\"Sergeant, Nate won't stop bleeding!\" Murphy heard his own voice <br>\r\n\"Private Mulder, put him out of his misery!\" His sergeant said <br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n\"No buts! Those are for our boots to shove up those asshole's assholes!\" <br>\r\n\"He's still-\"<br>\r\n\"What did I just say!\" The sound of someone screaming was heard <br>\r\n\"Jackson is down!\" Someone yelled <br>\r\n\"Sergeant, we have to retreat!\" Someone else yelled <br>\r\n\"Mulder!\" The sound of war was coming closer <br>\r\n\"Nate...I'm sorry...I'm...sorry!\" A gunshot was heard. A tear went down my face as he looked back to see that the medic was right behind me. \"Nate...is that you?\" The medic raised his blade over his head <br>\r\n\"I'm a fallen angel\" He droved his blade into my chest and twisted it, causing the sound of flesh and bone to come out. When he forcibly pulled it out, I suddenly felt my heart burn agonizingly, I grabbed my chest in response, but then, the person who I think is Nate, then slashes my arm off and impaled my other one into the ground. Without another word, he grabbed my throat and started to choke me out. The last things I saw was that he mouthed a couple words until my vision went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, I opened my eyes and saw that I was someplace different. Somehow, from the long corridors, I have ended up in some sort of infirmary of some sort, but I could tell I was still not out of my predicament. I got up from my bed and approached the door went I had another sharp headache, <br>\r\n\"I...forgive you\" A voice said as my headache suddenly had gone away. What was that? When I opened the door, I saw a flash of light and saw myself somewhere different from the long, continuous corridor. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While I was still recovering from the white flash of light, a sudden gust of cold wind had sent shivers down my spine, my legs feel like they\u2019re buried, and my entire body feels frozen solid. When my vision had completely cleared up I found myself in the middle of a snow-biome forest which my lower half was half buried into the ground. When I got myself out I was shivering down to the core and I began to walk in a random direction, forcing my legs to move through the snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly nor do I know how I\u2019ve been going at it for this long. I would be dead by now, but at this point anything would be accepted. This cold really would\u2019ve helped my pain awhile back because I literally cannot feel anything, I\u2019m not even sure if my brain is even working and this is all some twisted dream my subconscious decided to create because it hates me as much as I hate myself. When my vision started fading in and out I kept seeing people in winter-camo uniform coming in and out between the fading. They were all translucent or silhouettes with each passing moment, 1 by 1, they would all disappear. The white coat of the land was slowly dotted with the color red as the sky had clearly darkened and had gotten \u2018war somber\u2019 and all around can the echoes and sounds of war could be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around more and see shadows and silhouettes running through the trees while at the same time trees\u2019 were falling left and right and so were people. I began running quickly, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the feeling of fear and anxiety that I shouldn\u2019t be in this place in particular. Thought it should be obvious to anyone with common sense, it wasn\u2019t the battle I feared of, it was those who were in it that I felt afraid of and I don\u2019t know why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI no longer felt cold, just fear and the feeling of being stalked gripping me, I began holding my ears when I started to hear the gross sounds of flesh clashing and slicing flesh and bone. The screams of my allies in pain, agony, or maybe the gurgling of their own blood, I don\u2019t know, I was just afraid of dying that I just run\u2026I really wasn\u2019t cut out for this and yet here I am, being a fool used as cannon fodder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things weren\u2019t any worse I had ran into someone, a person that had definition and wasn\u2019t a silhouette or transparent. What was bad was the fact that he was covered in blood that was frozen over and that he held 2 knives that were pure red with blood stains. What was bad was that he started walking towards me; he didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry because I was frozen with fear, not frostbite. I wanted to run, I really did, but the more time had prolonged the more my vision had became more sinister. All the tree\u2019s had seemed to become more gnarled, the white snow around had turned black or red and the man that was once defined had became a silhouette with the red blood the only color of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly was thinking of going for my gun and shooting myself when my vision was broken by another figure that was defined, I can\u2019t remember who it was, but I had relief to my mind, heart, and soul that person came. He clashed with the other person head on and just yelled, <br>\r\n\u201cRun Murphy run!\u201d He kicked the other person and both were in a stand-off with blades. I could move my legs again and I did what the man told me to, I just ran\u2026I ran\u2026and I ran\u2026Until I realized something. <br>\r\n\u201cThis place\u2026\u201d I remembered now \u201cThis mission\u2026That man\u2026This was the day that\u2026\u201d I looked back and I could still somehow hear the clash of blades that were far off in the distance \u201cNo\u2026I want to run, but that man was\u2026I\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d His words echoed in my ears. I was overflowed with regret and indecisiveness, I didn\u2019t know what I should\u2019ve done on that fateful day, and it was either to run or save my best friend\u2026To live to see another day or a possible death be in vain\u2026Thus on that very moment\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if both of us would fall together in battle\u2026at the very least\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I entered the clearing I saw Tom all kinds of messed up with his arms, legs\u2026heck his entire body looked like he went through a grinder, and the man he fought didn\u2019t even have a single scratch on him. Tom had looked back to see me raise my gun at the enemy. At that one moment in time, everything seemed to have slowed down, I could see my buddy mouth something which I couldn\u2019t hear as I fired my gun\u2026but whatever that man was\u2026he truly was a monster as he just seemingly disappeared into the snow itself as I looked around to see where I went until I felt something being jabbed through my back and out my chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dropped my gun in reaction to the knife going through my chest which immediately came right out and I was slashed across behind me knees and then my back in quick succession, I fell to the ground. Tom yelled in anger as he charged the man only to get easily taken out and he dropped near my position, heck, we were facing each other in our screwed up conditions. <br>\r\n\u201cThe strong protect the weak\u201d The enemy said with a heavy Russian-like accent \u201cThe weak tried to protect the strong\u2026As respect to a brave, maybe loyal fool, I will leave you two alone to speak your prayers to your gods and to each other and may both of your get out of this hell and into heaven\u201d He walked away and us two were left staring at each other with Tom glaring at me with a lot of anger, <br>\r\n\u201cYou idiot! Why didn\u2019t you run like I told you too?!\u201d  He yelled and I chuckled, <br>\r\n\u201cBecause, I wasn\u2019t about to leave my best friend alone to a monster\u201d I smiled at the predicament both of us were in <br>\r\n\u201cShit man, we really are going to die here\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what we signed up for?\u201d I joked half heartedly <br>\r\n\u201cIf I can move my arms I would punch you right now\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cHey Tom, what would be your regret before we go to wherever?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat I didn\u2019t bang your hot sister when I got the chance!\u201d He joked as both of us laughed rather weakly while coughing up blood<br>\r\n\u201cMy regret would\u2019ve been leaving my friends behind whenever I feared something, but this time, I didn\u2019t\u201d He grabbed Tom\u2019s hand \u201cFrom here, from this point, we both fell in battle\u2026at the very least\u2026\u201d There was a bright light before I could even finish \u201cWe died like brothers\u2026\u201d From the light there was darkness, those last words echoed through the dark abyss and then came a white light that had appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up again, but this time instead of an infirmary it was in some sort of bedroom which was like any other. In the bedroom, Tom was standing by the window where he was just looking at the sunny sky while holding a small box in his hand. When I got out of bed I headed toward the door and before I could turn the knob Tom turned his head to the side and only said, <br>\r\n\u201cYou know Murphy, my only regret was not being able to go back alive and give your older sister a ring\u2026but at least you lived, that is all that mattered, whatever would've made her happy would make me happy as well, and so...\u201d He lowered his head and looked out the window again \"I guess it's farewell for now...Murphy, no matter what, hang on to your life, it's precious for everyone\" He slowly faded out of existence as on the windowsill was a open black box with a glistening ring in the sunlight. I approached it and carefully grabbed it, but then it turned into...well I have no idea what happened since it just dematerialized into balls of light that also disappeared soon after. I just went toward the door, ignoring what just happened, opened it and another bright light had engulfed me. Wherever I went to next, I just had to get out...</span></div></div>",

Just because his last name is Mulder doesn\u2019t give you the right to-\u201c <br>\r\n\u201cWell then \u2018Skully\u2019 just stop shooting everyone in the head!\u201d One of the soldiers joked as I tried to figure out what was beyond the windshield which there was nothing but light <br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I questioned as \u2018Skully\u2019 went into the mounted machine gun up top <br>\r\n\u201cWe are reinforcements\u201d Then the driver yelled something incoherent as the light enveloped us all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked again and found myself sitting on some sort of bed as I looked up to a concrete ceiling and that I was wearing a gasmask<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I questioned as I sat up and looked around to where I was, which looked like a prison cell \u201cWhat is this?\u201d When I tried to stand up a pain shot up from my right leg. I looked down to see my pant leg torn and covered with bandages. Then all of a sudden a loud static sound went through my ears and I covered them to no avail of blocking it. All I heard was incoherent screaming, guns firing, and the sounds of something inhumane along with the distinct sound of flesh tearing and bones breaking, something I know far too well. When I uncapped my hands I limped out into the open to get a bearing of my position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I went out, it didn\u2019t seem like I wasn\u2019t in a prison per se, but more like a holding area for people being disruptive as there was just a desk, some decoration, and a steel door. I checked around the area and found it bare of any information of where I could possibly be and I couldn\u2019t find anything as a crutch which was going to be annoying. With this lack of information, something dawned a question on me, <br>\r\n\u201cIf this is all part of my memory, then which mission was this?\u201d When I was approaching the door I was suddenly hit with another auditory memory fragment, <br>\r\n\u201cNo matter what, no matter what you hear, just do not get out of the room, understand?\u201d I leaned upon the door and griped the door knob and thought, <br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, what the hell was this mission again? What was out there? What did I do last time?\u201d Contemplating upon a decision without any type of available information, I just decided to\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he checked the area he saw that he was in the gymnasium and that Jerry was laying down on the closed bleachers, throwing and catching a knife. <br>\r\n\"Well, its good to know that you are in shape and that your reflexes are sharp as ever\" He caught his knife, stood up, and cracked his neck \"Well, with that throwing exercise done, time to do some cardio\" He jumped from the bleachers and when he landed on his feet he moved with great speed and charged at Shizu, who was in a solid stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jerry was almost near Shizu, he shifted his blade in such a position that the light shining on it was magnified, causing a sudden flash of light, blinding Jerry and giving Shizu an opening to attack. When his blade was about to hit Jerry's abdomen, he suddenly jerked away and avoided it. Then the two were locked into a blade fight with 1 Katana against 2 daggers. While both of them were skillfully blocked and parrying each other, Shizu noticed something about Jerry's eye's,<br>\r\n\"You can fight with your eyes closed?\" He questioned as Jenkins broke his defense and managed to stick a knife into his left shoulder. Even with the blade in him, he still continued to fight with his right arm.<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, the thing that will betray you the most is your very own sight...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were still fighting, Shizu suddenly stumbled and felt his vision getting blurry. He dropped his Katana and held his head, trying to figure out what was going on, thankfully Jenkins had temporarily stopped and started to explain what was going on, <br>\r\n\"You know, you are getting off easy...\" Shizu was then on the ground, vomiting and suffering from nausea \"If this were the real me, you would have been killed the minute the match started...Shizu, you are strong, but this path you are about to take is going to kill you, as, not only are there 100 more after me, but you are going to face the other original 9 and then face the 10 who beat the originals\" After he finished vomiting and regained some composure, he reached into his backpack and took out a syringe and injected himself with it \"I admire your persistence and willpower, but that is not all you need. The ability to open your eyes, open your mind, to truly see what is really there in front of you is something\" Shizu got up and picked up his Katana and prepared to fight once more.<br>\r\n\"S-...Jerry, you really stop having long monologues\" <br>\r\n\"And why is that?\" He questioned as he pulled out another dagger that became electrified <br>\r\n\"It can give people time to prepare!\" From a conveniently opened gym door that led to the hallways, Sora was running very quickly with a sword in his mouth and charged at Jenkins, who seemed to have been expected him as he immediately turned and kicked to the side, but not without leaving him open to attack as Shizu moved incredibly fast to manage to cut Jerry's back and then he moved out of the way to regroup with Sora. Though with such a large wound, Jerry did not react to it, but he was impressed enough to clap his hands together <br>\r\n\"Ah, good teamwork, also Shizu, sorry for underestimating you, I didn't think you were able to even move that fast and you even managed to wound me that much which many fail to do, even with a machine-gun or even in a firing squad\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his grey casual outfit and threw it into the air (With wooden mask still on) and what lay under that was that he had many scars, a tactical vest and many ammo-pockets strapped to his legs, <br>\r\n\"Remember how I am known to hold back unless the opponent I have is VERY strong?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes I do\" Shizu replied as both him and Sora prepared for the worst. <br>\r\n\"Well...I'm still holding back\" Suddenly all the pockets that he opened up and, with great dexterity, he pulled out various thrown, bladed weapons and threw a storm of them (Which is no exaggeration) Among the blades were those that were poisoned, electrified, and even exploding and with the giant storm that was headed for them, they did something most people would do.<br>\r\n\"Run unless you want to become a human target dummy!\" Sora yelled as he was well ahead of Shizu, not for being a wolf, but because he was running before Jenkins pulled out his blade storm. Both of them went outside, closed the door, and continued to run as the gymnasium doors exploded and more blades continues to fly after them. Both of them split up again to avoid the blades and instead of them getting hit, it was the fountain that got destroyed and the building opposite of the gymnasium which was going to need serious renovation later. Both of them had regrouped in the middle of the courtyard and looked around to see where Jenkins is, <br>\r\n\"Sora, you smell him?\" Shizu questioned as he pulled another syringe from his bag and injected himself with it <br>\r\n\"I don't smell him anywhere, I don't think-\" Suddenly Jenkins had dropped in between them and fought both with them even though they were opposite sides of each other. Despite this fact, he was still holding his own as his defense was still going strong and he was handling the two of them quite well. <br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Shizu thought \"He is far stronger than I had anticipated, how is this monster of a man originally the 10th strongest?! What's worse is that he is holding back...What can I do?\" That was when Shizu started to have feeling in his left arm again \"I know it's far-fetched, but...\" Suddenly at the right time, both Sora and Shizu had a blade lock on Jenkins, which gave the perfect opening to attack. With great dexterity, Shizu placed his katana in his left hand and pulled the poisoned blade from his shoulder and proceeded to attempt a stab at Jenkins' arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenkins immediately noticed this and he got out of his blade lock on both of them and had kicked the poisoned blade out of Shizu's hand up into the air. As it seemed it was going to be another long blade-fight, Sora had released his blade and bit Jenkins in the leg as Shizu pushed him over. Just as he was about to get up, the knife that was kicked into the air was now being held to his throat by Shizu,<br>\r\n\"Do you surrender Jenkins?\" Jenkins was thinking while staring down at the blade by his throat <br>\r\n\"3 things: I'm tired from throwing all those blades, I think my wound is infected, and I think poison directly applied to my throat is going to suck a lot, so...It appears I lose\" Shizu got off of him. He then offered a hand to assist Jenkins up, but he declined as he got himself up. Both of them shook hands for a fight well-fought <br>\r\n\"Well, congratulations on managing to win against me\" Jenkins said as he probed his wounded back <br>\r\n\"I thank Sora for the win, by the way, thanks buddy\" <br>\r\n\"This guy had an odd taste when I bit him\" Sora replied <br>\r\n\"Well, let's talk the rest while we heal up in the infirmary\" While all 3 were walking towards the medical wing, Jenkins stopped \"Oh and for the finale, say your farewell to the fans\"<br>\r\n\"What fan-\" Then suddenly screams of energy were heard and Shizu looked up to see that there were people on the rooftops and upper-floors of the buildings who seemed to have been watching the entire time \"Wait how long have they been up there?\" <br>\r\n\"Shizu, you really didn't noticed them when the battle started?\" Sora questioned <br>\r\n\"I was too busy fighting the deadliest person that has ever lived to even notice\" <br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">#101: Jerry Jenkins  <br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n#101: Shizu Irie  <br>\r\n\"Wow, didn't expect the grey shadow-killer to lose...well it appears my job is done\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While they were doing that, Shizu and Jenkins were talking and the school went back to its original pace which was the continuous sounds of fighting and mayhem that was occurring outside.<br>\r\n\"Jenkins\" Shizu started \"What are you going to do, now that you are no longer apart of the 101?\"<br>\r\n\"It's just a title\" He replied \"Though it holds some significance, I would still be regarded for my other title and I'm still going to teach\" After he said that a nurse poured some sort of liquid on his back and there was a very distinct sizzling sound and even vapor coming out \"Nurse, I think whatever stuff you put on me was too strong because it feels like someone is burning me alive, I should know\" The nurse excused herself to get something to alleviate the burning sensation as they got back to talking \"So, what are you going to do next?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to continue on forward until I hit a wall...unless that wall has a crack I'll break it down\"<br>\r\n\"Good enough answer\" <br>\r\n\"Jenkins, before I leave, what should I be aware of?\" <br>\r\n\"Besides dying, that some of these people are ridiculously powerful, and some of them are psychotic? Well, I can give you an info dump, would that suffice?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, just as long as it's not long winded like your monologs\" <br>\r\n\"Battling 101 started off as a group of 10 people who were supposed to be the ones sent out to take on forces far greater than any person. After the events that transpired the battling 101 became more of a competition, though the function of a attack force still stands to today. Of the original 10, they essentially became scrub filters so not just anyone could join or get through the rankings easily, though this was set after the competition was over. Want to know more?\"<br>\r\n\"Still long-winded, but good to know...so where in the world is the next guy?\"<br>\r\n\"Wait you didn't even-\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, I am always on the move and I ride a dune buggy\" <br>\r\n\"Why didn't you get an RV?\" <br>\r\n\"...Beside the point\" <br>\r\n\"Wait you had to defeat a high-level courier, didn't those guys give you any kind of instructions or where about of everyone?\" <br>\r\n\"No, that guy just told me to go here and all will be explained later\" <br>\r\n\"Wait who the heck did you-\"<br>\r\n\"Um...that guy was-\" Then suddenly a smoke bomb was detonated and covered the entire room. After the smoke cleared there was a canister on Shizu's lap. When he checked what was inside it was a note that simply said \"I'll just take you there\" \"Well I think that just answered my question\" <br>\r\n\"Well, good luck on your adventure...oh by the way, take this\" He pulled out several green vials \"These will aid you in subduing people who you don't want to kill, I will guess you will use these a lot\" Shizu took them and placed them in his bag <br>\r\n\"Thanks, this will help a lot...oh and by the way, nurse?\" One of the nurses poked their head out between the hospital curtains <br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Am I free to leave now?\" The nurse brought out her clipboard to checked <br>\r\n\"Yeah you are, just as long as you don't do anything extreme...which I'll assume you are going to do anyway\"<br>\r\n\"So\" Jenkins stated \"What about me?\"<br>\r\n\"You are definitely staying here sir\" <br>\r\n\"I'm fine with that\" <br>\r\n\"So, what about Sora?\"<br>\r\n\"The white wolf?...He's just fine, but one of our nurses seemed to have been...attached to him\" <br>\r\n\"Wait, how did that-\" Shizu listened closer to what was going around him and...well <br>\r\n\"Em...Let go of me please!\" Sora screamed as there was some sounds of a struggle <br>\r\n\"Aw, can't you stay a little longer?!\" One of the nurses said in a pleading tone <br>\r\n\"No! I'm fine! Shizu help me out here!\" <br>\r\n\"You know my rule about getting in the way of love!\"<br>\r\n\"Ah! You traitor!\" <br>\r\n\"Not traitor, remember that psycho stalker chick?\" There was a slight awkward silence after that question \"Yeah, not doing that again!\" After that Sora whined as there was a distinct chuckle coming from the nurse on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that moment passed Shizu and Sora were walking out of the combat school in the afternoon <br>\r\n\"Wow, time flies by fast\" Shizu said as he got into the driver seat of his dune buggy <br>\r\n\"Yeah and so does friendship\" Sora said as he got into the back \"So, where are we headed?\" <br>\r\n\"Honestly, I have no clue. I guess we wait until we get information by whatever courier meet's us next\" Suddenly a smoke bomb was detonated \"Well speak of the devil\" After the smoke cleared there was someone standing in front of the dune buggy. The one standing in front of it was a darkened-skinned female with a black tied ponytail wearing brown rugged garb with brown shoes, gloves, cap with goggles on top of it. She also had a black rapier strapped on her left and a brown strapped bag on her right. <br>\r\n\"Yo\" She greeted as she got into the front seat of the dune buggy <br>\r\n\"...Uh\" Shizu said as the woman brought her hand out and Shizu shaked it<br>\r\n\"Name's River, I'm the courier that will guide you to the others\" <br>\r\n\"Okay...So where are we headed?\" <br>\r\n\"Canada\" <br>\r\n\"Canada?\" Shizu was maintaining a calm tone <br>\r\n\"We don't lie about ranked people's location\"<br>\r\n\"Why the heck can't I get the guy over to my location?\" <br>\r\n\"The rules say so\" <br>\r\n\"Ah! So why can't I get a lift over there?\" <br>\r\n\"Eh...You can...but I don't have the clearance for that\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of screwball-\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, but don't worry, there is some good things about winning against a ranked member\" <br>\r\n\"Such as?\"<br>\r\n\"Did you know that if you defeat a ranked member you can actually win an award?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean something like this?\" Shizu pulled the poison vials he got from Jenkins <br>\r\n\"Not what I meant!\" She pulled out some sort of electronic device from her bag, messed with it a little, and showed the screen in front of his face <br>\r\n\"Whoa, that's a lot of money\" <br>\r\n\"Well, you are fighting the stronger fighters in the world, plus that was originally the 10th strongest so the reward is even greater. Oh and for future reference you can't grind money from members weaker than you...Also foreign currency adjustment available\" <br>\r\n\"That's good and all, but besides showing me the amount of money I have, what other purpose was that for?\" <br>\r\n\"To get an RV\" <br>\r\n\"Huh? Why me?\" <br>\r\n\"Because you're the one with the money, I'm the one guiding you, and this dune buggy smells like death rolled over it several times\" <br>\r\n\"Technically death did do that and second and I really don't want to get rid of this dune buggy, it has sentimental value\" <br>\r\n\"Bah, you know that we have a special storage system so we can keep your things so you don't have to get rid of it\" <br>\r\n\"Oh that's good...do you even know where we can procure an RV?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah I do, now lets go, we are burning daylight, let's hit the road swordsman!\" River yelled as Shizu hit the gas and they were riding towards the location of where the RV was...which it just so happened the sun was setting in that direction. <br>\r\n\"What the hell did I get myself into?\" Shizu thought <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the ride to Canada begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*While in the infirmary* <br>\r\n\"Hm...Damn it!\" Jenkins said as a nurse was applying a substance on his back<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I forgot to say something to Shizu, during the rank numbering there were some people who actually forfeited mid-way and that the next person he is about to fight is one of these people\"<br>\r\n\"What is the significance of that?\"<br>\r\n\"The person he is fighting next is a literal powerhouse that defeated 50 of my students in under 5 minutes...\" </span></div></div>",

Currently it was daytime and Shizu was driving with Sora still sleeping and River wide awake and checking something on her cellphone,<br>\r\n\"Hey River\" Shizu said <br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She replied<br>\r\n\"Besides being my guide, why are you tagging along with me? I know there is an ulterior motive besides this\" <br>\r\n\"Well, it is usually a requirement for a ranked member to have at least 1 courier watching them so that when they are defeated it is confirmed, but there are a few exceptions, for example there is a man who can delete a person's memory just by encountering him, another who is living in deep, underground disparity of the aftermath of war, and also these two beings who are in another dimension\"<br>\r\n\"Wait what\"<br>\r\n\"So for those people you need a certain item from them to even pass their rank\"<br>\r\n\"Wait how did you even get those people involved or even recorded if one deletes memories and the others are either living in hell itself or another dimension?!\" <br>\r\n\"There are several ways, one would be our advanced information system and second would be that the memory eraser left his calling card\" <br>\r\n\"So how exactly did they enter?\" <br>\r\n\"Not all of the ranked individuals got through the tournament process, very few were placed in their respected area's based on observations of their power and theoretical battle results\"<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that seem unfair?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, so you want to fight a person that can bend space and time and another who can null all supernatural forces and control nothingness?\" <br>\r\n\"Fair point...How exactly did these people join in the first place?\"<br>\r\n\"It was of their own accord, heck if I know what they were thinking\"<br>\r\n\"By chance can you assist me in battle?<br>\r\n\"Depending on the situation\" <br>\r\n\"Good to know\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the entire trip in a nutshell: Talk, pitstop, random assist missions, and random bandit attacks...Yeah that went well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Several days later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about nighttime when they had reached their destination... <br>\r\n\"We there yet?\" Sora questioned as he was in the front seat with Shizu <br>\r\n\"Well\" Shizu started \"It's snowy, there are pine tree's everywhere, and I think that is the Canadian flag right over there, yeah I'm sure we're there...wait are we?\" <br>\r\n\"Yup, we're definitely here\" River responded as the RV stopped at a caf\u00e9 <br>\r\n\"I think we should take a quick break before we go looking for ranked 100\" As they all got out and entered the caf\u00e9 there weren't that many people, but what was apparent was that these people didn't seem like your average Canadians as most of them had bladed rifles of sorts while others had some assorted weaponry that seemed foreign. What made the atmosphere heavier was that the minute they entered everyone, like any other time someone new enters, they were all staring at the 3 of them. Though it didn't take long for every to go back to what they were doing, it still was tense. When Shizu and River sat down and ordered something hot, Sora got a bone, though normally he would be slightly peeved at that...<br>\r\n\"Maple syrup flavored bone? I'm not complaining\" Funny enough, although the wolf talking was loud and clear no one gave an eye about it which normally they would. While Shizu and River were drinking their coffee and eating misc. food, they decided to chat once more. <br>\r\n\"Not so happy-go-lucky, isn't it?\" Shizu questioned as he took a bite out of his food <br>\r\n\"Considering what happened in this town, I wouldn't be surprised\" <br>\r\n\"Let me here the story, it may give me a bead on who the person I'm fighting is\" <br>\r\n\"You know I could've give you his statistics if you would've asked\" <br>\r\n\"I don't mean how he fights, I meant I would get an idea on how this person works\" <br>\r\n\"Okay...this is what happened in this town...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Abandoned power station- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man wearing full-rubber rain gear was twirling a metal pole around with high amounts of skill and was contemplating his next actions <br>\r\n\"So...after several years someone actually defeated Jerry Jenkins...That man really peeves me off with how much he holds back, but...\" He stopped twirling and stabbed the ground with his pole and a giant flow of electricity coursed through it and suddenly the entire station seemed to be running again with the snow melting around it \"Considering it all, I would love to see how this person fights and see if he is really worthy of being called ranked, and to do that...\" He negated the electrical flow going through his pole and the power station suddenly turned off, but not without water being everywhere \"Let's see how you handle unfair environmental conditions\" A spark of electricity came from this man's head as he walked to the place where he is going to wait. </span></div></div>",

Yes...we all were, we were the people who decided to live our lives differently after that man let us decided to choose our own path\" <br>\r\n\"It's unfortunate that there are some people that are blinded by what is in front of them and let themselves play a ballad that ends abruptly or is played poorly with broken strings\" <br>\r\n\"Indeed...You know, you're aren't half-bad of a person even though this conversation lasted about a minute\" <br>\r\n\"We are both people who can see with our mind, not our sight, and know what is needed and what is not...Well, see you later\" <br>\r\n\"Right after you beat the hero of Canada, drinks are on me\" <br>\r\n\"I don't drink\" After he said that the man chuckled and Shizu drove to the location of the next fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes wandering around in darkness and snow they managed to get to the very sizeable abandoned power station which was right outside of the outskirts of the town. The RV was parked right outside and after an observation it was clear that no one had used it in years as it was worn and torn down with the chain-link fences all smashed to high-heaven, the transformers all appearing to be busted and other metallic things frosted over. But the strange thing is that, despite it being very cold there were traces of snow being recently melted, indicated by the surrounding puddles and dripping icicles. <br>\r\n\"Sora, River, both of you stay here\" Shizu said as he brought out a syringe and inserted it into his arm<br>\r\n\"I can understand River, Shizu, but why me?\" Sora questioned as he ran back inside the RV to get his sword <br>\r\n\"Because, I don't want you getting fried from the inside, also you two, keep an eye out for those gang members, they may arrive\" <br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry about both of us\" River responded \"I'm pretty sure both of us are capable of handling just a few gang remnants\" <br>\r\n\"Don't get cocky now\"<br>\r\n\"Hey I think I should be saying that to you, now don't die on the second person you fight next, you hear!?\" Shizu walked through the broken fence and into the large power station <br>\r\n\"I didn't come here to die\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizu was walking through the maze of a power-station with a high-grade flashlight strapped to his waist and a Katana out and ready just in case. While he was walking he heard the sound of electricity crackling and when he turned around he saw a tall, white man with blonde hair, wearing goggles, a rubber suit that was better suited for rain rather than the cold, with a metal pole and a L-pipe with a valve at the bend strapped to his back, on top of a metal frame. <br>\r\n\"Ah, so you must be the man that defeated Jenkins\" He said as he jumped down onto a giant puddle of water \"Now, let's see if you have what it means to be ranked!\" He removed his gloves and grabbed his metal pole, which became electrified, and he placed it forcibly into the ground and suddenly the entire powerstation seemed to have came to life with the lights also coming back on. \"It wouldn't be fun to fight in the dark, now would it?\" <br>\r\n\"Before we pound each other into electrical ions, what is your purpose?\" Shizu questioned as he got into a fighting stance <br>\r\n\"With what I heard from other's, you can tell or make assumptions based on how people can fight...and so, with that...\" He held the pole in his hands like a sword \"I'll tell you once I have been beaten!\" He charged at Shizu, which when he swung, Shizu dodged it easily and had swung his blade at Leo's legs to get him to hinder him quickly, but that is where he discovers something,<br>\r\n\"My sword didn't even cut through his pants!\" He thought as he retreated as Leo swung again. As he was at a fair-distance away, he heard Leo laugh a little,<br>\r\n\"Surprised? My gear is not only keeping electricity in, but it is also reinforced\" He slung his pole over his shoulder \"Also, a tid-bit, if your sword stabs through my armor, prepare to get shocked by the electricity that literally runs through my veins!\" The second he finished he grabbed his pipe and aimed it at Shizu. Electricity flowed through it quickly as focused orbs of electricity were shot out of it...</span></div></div>",

Though there were a few dry spots, the amount of water far outweighed that and it would be a bad idea to use the metal framing to get an edge on Leo as metal conducts electricity. There was also the dim lighting which using his light refraction would be not be as effective and even if he were to do is successfully, Leo's goggles may just block most of it. The only things going for him were not only his speed, but also... <br>\r\n\"You know you're in a tight spot, eh?\" Leo questioned as he stopped firing and aimed at the ground while adjusting the valve on the pipe \"What are you going to do now?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm going to recklessly attack you until I slash your armor off\" <br>\r\n\"Wait what-\" Shizu charged at Leo with high amounts of speed which didn't surprise Leo much as he fired into the puddle of water, which before he fired Shizu jumped into the air and slashed him across the chest, again didn't even break through it, which made Leo stumble slightly, but before he could recover Shizu kept slashing him quickly, seemingly giving no room to even counter-attack, but then Leo fired his pipe again which was directed at Shizu which at that distance he didn't miss and it made full contact at high power. Shizu was stunned and knocked-back by it which Leo pulled out his pole and started to beat the living crap out of him which the electricity added more internal damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter multiple punishing combo attacks, he slammed Shizu down onto the ground with his pole directly on his chest, which where he had been forced against was the largest concentration of water around the area. He went heavily on the electrical output and a giant release of electricity was unleashed through his pole. The amount of electricity that flowed was so high that the lights were overloaded and the light bulbs exploded and some of the surrounding transformers blew up. After he was finished, Leo was breathing heavily and was checking Shizu's body, which he either assumed he was unconscious or half-dead.<br>\r\n\"Ah, it appears you weren't fit to be ranked in the first place. I despise people who think the battling 101 is a cool trend or game and think it's easy to enter...well it's not\" He slung his pole around his shoulder and was walking away from Shizu \"You know you weren't half-bad, but next time think about your actions before you do something stupid\" Leo checked his gear \"Damn you really banged up my armor\" That was when he heard something behind him. When he looked behind him he saw Shizu getting up \"What?! Impossible! How are you still able to-\" <br>\r\n\"Because\" Shizu stated as he fully got up and pointed his katana at Leo \"Before I got in here I injected myself with two doses of liquid insulation\"<br>\r\n\"Liquid insulation? What the heck is that?\" <br>\r\n\"Liquid insulation, not much know about it, but liquid insulation is a type of chemical one can put into themselves to give them either higher heat resistance or electrical resistance. Thankfully it hardly does any damage to your body, but it is temporary\" <br>\r\n\"So that explains it...Ah ha ha ha ha\" Leo was laughing after that \"Jeez, and here I thought I was facing a weakling, guess I underestimated you...now\" Leo removed his gear and what was remaining was a man wearing nothing but green shorts and a white shirt. Due to the lack of light the only thing that could be seen fully is the constant small electrical discharges around his body and his blue eyes \"Even with your higher electrical resistance, there is a limit!\" Leo pulled out his pole and suddenly a large amount of electricity was unleashed which provided enough light to easily see, also Leo just looked very amazing yet intimidating at the same time. Both of them got into a fighting stance and then charged at each other. When they clashed steel, a giant discharge of electricity was unleashed causing one giant electrical lightshow, which again it looked ridiculously awesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Outside of power station- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several bodies laid out all across the ground as River was stealing their weapons and Sora was looking back at the power station <br>\r\n\"Man, a lot of electricity flowing through that place\" He said as he looked back at River \"Why are you doing that?\"<br>\r\n\"Selling these weapons for a quick buck...or scrapping them for spare parts depending on how much they sell\" <br>\r\n\"I can see logic in that\" That was when, from their point of view, a giant electrical discharge was unleashed and it even reached as far as where they were at \"What in the world?!\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see that Leo removed is limiting gear...well time to prepare a letter of resignation, by an untimely death\" <br>\r\n\"Have faith in Shizu, he doesn't die easily\" <br>\r\n\"Considering he got Leo to remove his gear, I guess so\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Now back inside- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Shizu and Leo were still holding their ground in a weapons lock as electricity continuously flowed everywhere <br>\r\n\"You're a tough one aren't you?\" Leo questioned <br>\r\n\"Well I have to be since it's now more brawns than brains since about half my brain cells got killed\" Shizu responded<br>\r\n\"Ha, laughing in the face of death I see...Let's end this, with this amount of staring you'd think we were on a date\" <br>\r\n\"Agreed\" Shizu broke Leo's defense as both of them were in a giant game of blocking and breaking, with Shizu outclassing Leo in breaking his defense with the amount of times he had cut him. At the final blow, Shizu launched Leo's pole into the air and impaled him through the abdomen where a giant flow of electricity flowed through his blade and electrocuted him far above what his insulation could handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that moment both Shizu and Leo fell to the ground with Leo on his side and Shizu on his back. Both were still conscious and severely injured <br>\r\n\"Congratulations\" Leo said \"You beat me...you are deserving of being ranked\" <br>\r\n\"So Leo...Tell me if I'm right. From what I can see, the reason you fight is to make sure the weak don't try to do what the strong do, am I right?\" <br>\r\n\"Tch, that about sums it up. Although it's good that the weak try to help, but it's the strong that are supposed to help them. For the weak to help would mean the strong aren't strong enough to do anything or that the weak are people with strong will that would fight to the bitter end to reach their goals, which is admirable\" <br>\r\n\"But even so, willpower isn't everything\"<br>\r\n\"You got that right...Hey Shizu\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Why the hell did you impale this sword through me and why didn't you pull it out?\" <br>\r\n\"To defeat you and so that you don't bleed out, which speaking of...\" He got back up and was about to pull the blade out of Leo when someone grabbed his shoulder. He looked behind him and saw that it was the man from the caf\u00e9 <br>\r\n\"Hold on, I got this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Few hours later...At the caf\u00e9, at morning- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Shizu was in the caf\u00e9 speaking to the unnamed man and Leo, Sora and River were in the RV doing their own thing,<br>\r\n\"So you're the courier that watches Leo?\" Shizu questioned the man <br>\r\n\"Yes I am\" He replied <br>\r\n\"So Leo, what are you going to do now?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, Since the 10th barrier is now gone I am going to do my purpose of fighting\" <br>\r\n\"Well that's good...by the way how's your wound?\"<br>\r\n\"Shizu, I'm pretty sure you received more damage than me\" <br>\r\n\"That's true, but I have to be strong enough to get through the rankings so it shouldn't be a problem\" <br>\r\n\"Are you mocking me? Because that was electricity I hit you with, toughness doesn't do crap against that!\" <br>\r\n\"Well, see you later, it was a pleasure fighting you\" When Shizu was walking out the unnamed courier stopped him <br>\r\n\"Hold on, you forgot something\" Shizu turned around and caught a bottle of alcohol \"Didn't I say when you beat Leo, drinks are on me?\" <br>\r\n\"Like I said, I don't drink\" Shizu took the bottle anyway and was about to leave when Leo said something <br>\r\n\"And Shizu...Don't die easily, I don't want to know the person that beat me was weak\" While Shizu was walking toward the RV, he just waved back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the RV, River immediately showed him the next destination, <br>\r\n\"The Mexican border? Are you kidding me?\" <br>\r\n\"Couriers don't lie\" <br>\r\n\"We're in Canada, that's in Mexico, why can't we get an air-lift over there?\" <br>\r\n\"Like I said, I don't have clearance\" Shizu got in the drivers seat and face-palmed onto the car horn \"It's a good thing we traveled many times before...and River\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"When are you going to remove all these guns?\" Shizu refers to the guns on the table and leaning on the walls <br>\r\n\"When I find the right buyer\" <br>\r\n\"You better hope those things don't fall down and discharge...\" Shizu then drove the RV out of town and towards the Mexican border \"This is so tedious...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanked 101: Leo Branchurias <br>\r\nRanked 100: Shizu Irie <br>\r\nRanked 99: Natalie Creshaw <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really do hope that man has the willpower and strength to get through the rankings, if not, I'm going to kick his ass to hell!\" - Leo <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Plus I don't think you can take on some of these individuals by yourself\" <br>\r\n\"That's true...\" <br>\r\n\"By the way, besides reflecting light, what does his blade do?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, in theory, he could possibly reflect lasers, but he never did that since he has never fought anyone with high-tech gear\"<br>\r\n\"Well, in this next fight it is going to be important if he can reflect lasers\" <br>\r\n(Note: To remind everyone, just in case, Sora is a white wolf that can talk...Why? Because why the heck not?) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Riding through Texas- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizu was on the wheel and was commenting on the weather which currently it was raining hard <br>\r\n\"What the heck, wasn't it sunny just now?\" He questioned<br>\r\n\"Well, that's Texas weather for you, if you don't like it just wait 5 minutes\" River replied <br>\r\n*5 minutes later* <br>\r\nThe heavy rained stopped and it was sunny again <br>\r\n\"...I have no comments\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Mexican Border- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bright morning when the RV was going through a train tunnel, which passes through the Mexican border. When it went off the tracks and before it could go off the edge, River urged Shizu to stop and he did. When they all got out, Shizu examined the area and saw much rock cover, high rising rocks that could've been counted as small mountains, and a lot of sand. What was notable was the burn markings on some of the rocks and the remains of people whom of which looked like they were partially melted which their armor didn't seem to do much to whatever hit them.<br>\r\n\"So, is this where ranked 99 is?\" Shizu questioned River pointed in a general direction <br>\r\n\"Over there somewhere\" <br>\r\n\"Not exactly helpful\"<br>\r\n\"I would show you, but I don't want to die early\" <br>\r\n\"Well I think I'll figure it out when I get there, let's go Sora\" Shizu and Sora went down into the rock maze and carefully treaded through it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-On the face of the largest rock mountains-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a white, skinny female wearing red and white boots, skirt and shirt with red hair tied In a skull hairclip sitting in a metal enforced room that had simple furniture with a map on one side and a ladder leading down in the corner. There was also a 'window hole' in the wall where she shoots out and she had a laser sniper rifle right next to her, it looks very metallic and has a nuclear symbol on the hilt. <br>\r\n\"Ah, it's so boring!\" She said as she heard bells ringing, a signal that someone is approaching. She immediately stood up and aimed to look for the intruder and saw Shizu and Sora walking through the rock terrain that was her target practice. \"Ah, that must be ranked 100...They better not die quickly because I want this to last...For some reason it seems appropriate to have a white wolf with him, I guess its hunter's instincts\" Then she fired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back to Sora and Shizu- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were carefully treading the rock terrain, they saw the laser projectile coming and dodged it.<br>\r\n\"Holy crap that laser is fast!\" Sora yelled as both of them went in different directions <br>\r\n\"At least it's better than bullets, in terms of seeing the projectile\" Shizu responded as he hid from cover to cover, moving continuously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-To Natalie (Name of ranked 99)-<br>\r\n\"Oh my, that man is quick...Heh this is going to be interesting!\" Suddenly her rifle began to charge up an attack...Then she fired a giant laser beam that was much faster than the average laser she fires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-River- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was sitting on the edge of the rock face, she had her binoculars out watching the spectacle <br>\r\n\"Getting to her is going to be a hassle, good thing those two are fast or else this would take forever\" Then she looked down at the corpses \"I should probably rob those corpses with whatever gear they have that's not broken\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Shizu poked his head out of his cover to get a bead on where the sniper was, he saw a bright red light from one of the rock mountains in the distance, which was a fair distance, but was still going to be tedious if he were to attack the sniper up close. \"Well now I know where that sniper is...Wait that doesn't-\" The second Natalie fired, Shizu saw a very fast moving, sizable continuous laser coming at him which he quickly rolled out of the way as the laser barely hit him, but with the amount of heat it emitted he was still burned from behind and his cover was completely destroyed. He moved very quickly from cover to cover to avoid the regular laser shots and rested behind a very large rock. \"Damn, where the heck is Sora?\" When he questioned himself he saw that the sniper had changed targets and was aiming at Sora. Well at least he knew where he was. That was when Natalie used her focused laser beam on Sora which to make is worse it was 2 consecutive shots in a row. \"Crap that looks bad, Sora better have avoided that!\" While thinking of an easier way to approach the sniper nest he remembered two things: His light refraction and, in theory, the ability to reflect lasers \"This theory better work or I'll never be able to get near that person with that giant laser of his/her\" He unsheathed his blade and went out of his cover and went into a charging position that ensure he could run while being able to move his blade to reflect projectiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Natalie- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shooting the two consecutive focused lasers, she searched for the wolf and saw that she didn't exactly kill it, but managed to incapacitate it \"Okay, wolf is down, now for...Oh what do we have here?\" She saw the swordsman running towards her position, although he was quite a distance away he was moving at a very fast speed that seemingly broke what a normal person can do \"What the heck is that idiot doing? No matter, you'll end up worser than your wolf friend!\" She fired her rifle several times at him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shizu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" He thought to himself \"If my blade is capable of refracting light with ease and can reflect bullets without even denting, a laser should be of the same principle...I saw the burn markings on those rocks and it seems it would be more effective on flesh if anything, but that is just an assumption\" Then he saw the laser projectiles coming at him. When he got his blade into position of the lasers, he actually managed to deflect the lasers. \"Theory confirmed, this blade can reflect lasers\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Natalie- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the- That guy can reflect lasers?!What-... It's good that I can fight someone like this after such a long time, let's see how you like a double shot of a focused laser!\" She was charging her rifle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shizu- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw the laser charging he thought of this, \"With how long the laser charges and with the distance between us, I need to get rid of the problem of the sniper...I hope this blade can reflect those giant lasers...I'm pretty sure I am being overconfident\" Seconds before the predicted firing time, he used his sword flash and blinded the sniper. With that sudden flash the sniper's aim was thrown off and the laser ended up being shot way behind Shizu and the second one was fired, by luck, directly at Shizu. When he got his blade into position he was suddenly pushed back by the force of the laser and by continuously moving the blade in a certain angle he managed to direct the continuous laser right back at the sniper, partially taking out the rock mountain. But when it ended he hit the ground in pain as his hands and about 50% of his body had been burned by the heat of the laser. While he was on the ground he reached into his bag and brought out a syringe and injected it into himself. \"That was such a bad idea...\" That was when he heard wind blow furiously for a moment and someone was over him, <br>\r\n\"It's a tie\" A female voice said as Shizu blacked out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-in the mountain base- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie and Shizu were lying in separate beds in the same room, both being bandaged from their injuries, but both could still talk. <br>\r\n\"Damn you swordsman, how did you do that?\" Natalie questioned <br>\r\n\"It's called skill and the right equipment\" Shizu replied <br>\r\n\"Also having balls enough to even attempt that!\" <br>\r\n\"That to...\"<br>\r\n\"You know, as much as I hate losing, I can ignore this time since this is the first time someone had did that to me\" <br>\r\n\"Hm...Hey Natalie, mind if I make an assumption?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, we have all the time in the world\" <br>\r\n\"Is the reason you fight, the feel of victory or accomplishment over others so you can feel good about yourself to fill an empty gap that only contains failures?\" <br>\r\n\"Partially, a little of it was for the thrill, but all of that is somehow accurate, how did you figure that out even though we are just talking for the first time?\"<br>\r\n\"The amount of power that weapon of yours have and the fact you said you hate losing, plus the massive disadvantage you had over me\" <br>\r\n\"Even with all that, I lost\" <br>\r\n\"Well, remember that there are people that are good and those who are better, and even those who are weak or have a disadvantage to one who is stronger, but when there is a will, there is a way, just use that will effectively or wait until the strong make a mistake\" <br>\r\n\"Like what you did with that laser?\"<br>\r\n\"No, that was pure theory and overconfidence\" Natalie laughed after hearing that <br>\r\n\"I can't believe I lost to that...Hey Shizu\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"After we recover, mind if we do our battle a different way?\"<br>\r\n\"Rematch?\" <br>\r\n\"No, our battle was a tie, I want to play this out a different way, for both of us to learn\" <br>\r\n\"Okay\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-1 week later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile watching from a security-type room, River, Sora (Who's body is covered in bandages) and another woman who is in desert-type camo was watching a screen that is supposed to observe the rematch between Natalie and Shizu in different conditions. Which by the way, both of them were still wearing bandages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room they are fighting is a circular glass room with very reflective glass angled in different ways. <br>\r\n\"So Natalie, why choose this type of battlefield?\" <br>\r\n\"We fought with me having a distance and range advantage against you yet we still tied. In here it tests one's ability to perception, multi-tasking, and reflexes which I assume is your specialty\" <br>\r\n\"In this place I have the advantage, mind telling me why you did this?\"<br>\r\n\"Victory is much sweeter when the one you are fighting has an advantage over you, that is why\" She then pulled out her weapon which was missing some of its parts. When she pointed the gun at the ceiling she suddenly yelled \"Let's dance!\" And fired many lasers into the glass ceiling which reflected downwards making quite a scary sight <br>\r\n\"Man, everyone here is crazy...\" Shizu said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanked #100: Natalie Creshaw <br>\r\nRanked #99: Shizu Irie <br>\r\nRanked #98: Joseph Steghorn <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After the match was over, Shizu ran over to her and injected something to numb the pain. Although despite being hit with so many lasers, Natalie was still alive and conscious and she said this, \"Don't worry about me, you won, I lost...Besides, the lasers are weaker when in automatic mode...Also, I won't die this easily, not until I am satisfied with myself...and Shizu\" <br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n\"After you become #1, fight me again so the victory would be even sweeter\" <br>\r\n\"Well...I'll do my best to do that\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-And now to the present- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizu sighed, \"There are all kinds of people and it takes all kinds, I wonder what the next person would bring\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The road to California beach- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they are in California, but unfortunately for them there were a bunch of big guys hitting on River and she wasn't amused <br>\r\n\"Come on pretty lady, leave that guy with his dog and be with us\" Was an example of what these guys were saying, up until one of them touched her and the fury of her was unleashed in the scariest way possible. After seeing the unconscious big guys on the ground, Shizu just said <br>\r\n\"I question how you aren't ranked\" and then Sora said <br>\r\n\"Scary...\" While hiding behind Shizu <br>\r\n\"Come on guys, I'm not that scary!\" River said, but then both of them went back inside of the RV which peeved River a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The beach- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"River?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"It's one thing to bring us to the beach to fight...But it's another thing to make me wear only swim trunks!\" Shizu was wearing black swim trunks, but still had his sheathed sword and backpack on him while River was wearing a brown bikini, but still had her strapped bag on and rapier with her <br>\r\n\"We stick out like a sore thumb if we wore our clothing out in this heat on the beach!\" <br>\r\n\"Oh like a white wolf with a sheathed sword strapped on, a man with a sheathed sword and backpack, and a woman with a rapier and strapped bag isn't suspicious already\" <br>\r\n\"Not the point!\" <br>\r\n\"Wait are you sure number 98 is even here or is this an excuse to go swimming?\"<br>\r\n\"Couriers don't lie about ranked people's location!\"<br>\r\n\"Jeez, what is this a beach episode in an anime?\" <br>\r\n\"Nope, needs more fan-service\" She reached into her bag and pulled out pictures of...well if you knew what fan-service meant, you would know what this is <br>\r\n\"When did you-\"<br>\r\n\"Took it while you were out getting swim clothing\" <br>\r\n\"Wait\" Sora said \"I was with you when Shizu went out, went did you take pictures?\" <br>\r\n\"You were busy looking at female canines walking by to notice\" <br>\r\n\"...\" Sora went silent after that <br>\r\n\"I question why you did that, are you going to sell those pictures to fellow couriers who are perverts?\" <br>\r\n\"Maybe...\"<br>\r\n\"You know I can take those words in two ways right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later on - <br>\r\nIn a nutshell, River screwed around, Sora went off to do whatever he did, and Shizu tried to figure out where number 98 was...Which he never got the description of what he looked like. Although he didn't search long he decided to go to a place which wasn't populated with some many people. After going to a certain spot on the beach he spotted someone coming out of the ocean carrying a net full of misc. items. When Shizu went to talk to him he saw that he was about an average-heighted person with a slight build, brown medium-length hair, black eyes and was white. He was also wearing a green and brown military-like uniform with a rebreather. <br>\r\n\"Hey sir, do you happen to know wh-\" The man stopped him talking mid-way<br>\r\n\"Before talking to someone, get to know them first, especially if its only two of us here.

Now\" He walked more inland and reached into the sand and pulled out a flechette gun \"State your specialty and abilities and I'll state mine\"<br>\r\n\"Master swordsman, capable of projectile reflection and light refraction. Also higher movement and reflexes\" <br>\r\n\"Ex-soldier, specialist in underwater combat and close-range combatant.

When they were at a fair distance, Joseph said his final words before fighting \"You ready?\"<br>\r\n\"If I wasn't, I wouldn't be here\" Then both of them dived underwater a fair distance and then the did battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were fighting, Shizu took notes on how Joseph was currently fighting as this was his first time fighting underwater. From what he can see, Joseph has a simple attack pattern yet his movements are incredibly fluid, free, and seemingly unrestrained compared to what people are supposed to be when they are swimming underwater. That would mean that Joseph has a body that is tempered specifically for water combat and one of the advantages he has would be free-movement while the water reduces Shizu's movement speed. For a while now it was a stand-still as Joseph was just shooting and Shizu was blocking, but that was when Joseph pulled out a diving knife and he had charged at high speed at Shizu, which one would argue that he was a speeding bullet, and had knocked him back hard. When Shizu quickly recovered, Joseph had went into for a close-combat blade fight. Shizu was mostly at the defensive as even when he manages to break Joseph's defense, he always manages to avoid him with ease and continue on with a slashing onslaught. Then it got even worse when Joseph pulled back and started doing consecutive diving charges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sora- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was sniffing out Shizu's scent, it had led him to the area of the beach that was pretty much deserted and when he found the backpack and looked out to sea, he just said this, \"Great, he's having a fight out at sea...well I'll wait until he arrives\" Then he wrapped his body around Shizu's backpack and took a nap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-River-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was with 2 fellow couriers, both male, and they were trading, selling, buying photos from each other. <br>\r\n\"So\" One of the couriers say \"For these 3 photos I'll give you 5 of these\" <br>\r\n\"Deal\" River said as she took the photos<br>\r\n\"Hm, for 8 of these photos I'll hand you 4 of these\" The other courier said<br>\r\n\"Hey, that seems to be an unfair exchange\" <br>\r\n\"Quite the contrary, in equivalent exchange it goes like this, these 8 photos total a number of 8 women, these 4 photos total a number of 8 men, you get it?\"<br>\r\n\"You guys and your exchange crap, okay we all good?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep\"<br>\r\n\"Yes we are\" Then all of the couriers finished their deal and went back to whatever they did <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shizu- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it seems like Joseph was winning by a long-shot, something didn't settle right with him, \"Hm, something seems off, this person doesn't seem to be trying as much as I thought he would, but if I continue like this, isn't he going to hit rock bottom?\" When he was charging yet again, he noticed the coral reef at the bottom of them \"What?! Oh crap I screwed up, wait didn't this guy-\" Although you can't see it, Shizu smiled as he used his sword flash to blind Joseph while he was in the middle of his charge. When he got close, Shizu used the momentum of his own attack and threw him down to the corral reef below which knocked him out cold. The match was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shizu was dragging Joseph out, Sora's ears perked up and he came to assist/ ask what happened <br>\r\n\"What happened? Did you win?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm cut up, fully conscious, and I have an unconscious man with me, do the math\" <br>\r\n\"Okay then, congratulations, now if you'll excuse me I'll be doing something\" Sora ran off to do something as Shizu set Joseph down, pulled out a syringe, and inserted it into his neck. After a little bit of time, he regained consciousness. <br>\r\n\"Ah, it appears you have bested me at my own game, well done\"<br>\r\n\"You did well, also\"<br>\r\n\"You observed me that much eh? Being able to figure out the weakness in my attack pattern and was good enough to figure out what your opponent and thinking and catch them while their guard is down...You'll make an excellent...No...You are a true fighter\" <br>\r\n\"By the way, can I say something?\"<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, you earned it\" <br>\r\n\"By how you are an ex-soldier, the way you fight underwater and the items you were carrying beforehand, I'm guessing you are fighting for nothing, maybe the people, but that's not it\"<br>\r\n\"That's right, that's not it at all, the real reason I fight is because when I was younger I didn't make that many friends because if my constant moving and even when I joined the military, I couldn't make friends, well that's mainly because of that incident, but that 's another time. You know how the battling 101 is still considering an attack force? Well, I want to be apart of that, to fight with my comrades in arms, to connect with them, to be with them, to die with them. That is my purpose to fight, so I can feel what a friendship feels like among people that won't go down easily\" <br>\r\n\"Huh, interesting\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry if I droned out for to long\"<br>\r\n\"No, its okay, that story actually coincides with my purpose for fighting\" Shizu brought a hand out \"Joseph Steghorn, it would be a pleasure to fight alongside you in the heat of battle\" <br>\r\n\"When that day comes, it will be a glorious day to die. Shizu Irie\"  Joseph responded as he shaked hands of Shizu. Then they sent each other off with a salute. Shizu picked up his backpack and went back to the RV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the RV he saw River sitting at the table looking at...questionable pictures. She was surprised by Shizu's entrance and accidentally scrambled her pictures which one landed on the floor. Before she could pick it up, Shizu caught it and he looked at the picture with a blank face \"River...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She questioned nervously <br>\r\n\"If I bring a male companion over in this RV, what the heck is going to go through your mind?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Then suddenly Sora came bursting in at that moment, holding something in his mouth  <br>\r\n\"Hey Shizu, guess what?\" <br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n\"You know that guy you fought at the beach?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, I just fought him and got to know him, why? And what's in your mouth?\" Sora dropped the item from his mouth and onto the ground. When he picked it up it was a dog-tag and already he knew what it meant which brought a smile to his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizu was driving while River was checking things on her cellphone <br>\r\n\"How are our funds?\" Shizu questioned<br>\r\n\"It is ridiculously high, I could go stereotypically gold-digger right now and we still have money left\"<br>\r\n\"So, where are we headed next?\"<br>\r\n\"Las Vegas\" Then Shizu suddenly hit the breaks <br>\r\n\"River, you better not gamble there!\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not! Who do you take me for?\" <br>\r\n\"...\" Shizu continued driving toward their next destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanked #99: Joseph Steghorn <br>\r\nRanked #98: Shizu Irie <br>\r\nRanked #97.

Sora began speaking to River, <br>\r\n\"Hey what happened?\" River lowered her head down and tipped her hat down <br>\r\n\"An embarrassing situation...\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of situation?\" <br>\r\n\"He saw something that he shouldn't have\" Then Sora looked at Shizu <br>\r\n\"Shizu you sly dog!\" <br>\r\n\"Hm? What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n\"Did you see River naked while changing or something?\" The reactions of both Shizu and River were pretty much justified <br>\r\n\"What?!\" Shizu questioned <br>\r\n\"No, it was nothing like that!\" River replied <br>\r\n\"With those reactions I would assume you did\" Sora said with a sly grin <br>\r\n\"Quit grinning like that\" Shizu said blankly <br>\r\n\"Why did you even say that?\" River questioned <br>\r\n\"Well, what else would it be\" Suddenly River had an embarrassed face and Shizu's face went blank as nothing else was said on the ride to Vegas. <br>\r\n\"...What did I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Las Vegas motherfu- - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they rode into Las Vegas, it wasn't even 5 minutes in after they stopped to restock on certain supplies where they were ambushed by criminals. Of course they were taken out easily and River looted them for anything valuable which...\"These guys don't have crap on them!\" <br>\r\n\"Well, what did you expect for them to be, walking armories?\" Shizu questioned as he looked around the place \"Quite crowded isn't it?\" <br>\r\n\"If you want to know where your next match, it's at the Luck Roulette casino\" He took in the scenery and just shook his head <br>\r\n\"River\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"You're driving\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Luck Roulette Casino- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking the RV and leaving River behind to defend the vehicle from thieves, Shizu and Sora were about to go through the casino doors when one of the guards approached them, \"Sorry, no animals allowed\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry Sora, rules are rules\" <br>\r\n\"Eh, it's okay, we could've just assumed that\" After he spoke the security guard was baffled, but then a static sound was heard from his ear-piece and someone said something. <br>\r\n\"Hold on...According to my superior, both of you can enter\" Both of the entered the Casino and then asked the employees where their next fight was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Security room- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco Sand (ranked 97, had an average height, slight build, shaved black hair, brown eyes, darkened skin and was wearing a rolled up white long-sleeve T-shirt that was splattered with blood, blue jeans, and leather gloves) Was observing the security camera's and the minute Shizu had gone out of his RV, the camera's had scanned him and had alerted Marco to the appearance of ranked 98. After that he immediately contacted his friend Franco Gambit (Ranked 96, he was tall, slim, had slicked back black hair, moustache, brown eyes, white and dressed like a card dealer with reinforced gloves) \"Franco, ranked #98 has arrived\" <br>\r\n\"Ah, good, I was wondering when he would show up\" <br>\r\n\"Should I let him bring his pet wolf along?\" He questioned as he was looking at the security camera pointed at the entrance <br>\r\n\"Sure, why not, the more the merrier\" After the radio was cut off, Marco connected to the radio channel to the guard at the front <br>\r\n\"Let the wolf through\" After he said that he got up from his chair and unholstered his custom .500 S&amp;W Magnum and spun the barrel a few times before leaving the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Office- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Franco was throwing cards at a target, one of the guards came through the door, <br>\r\n\"Sir, where should we bring our guests?\" <br>\r\n\"Bring them to the revolving game room\" <br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" The guard left as Franco laughed <br>\r\n\"So, the games have begun...Might as well enjoy it while it lasts\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The revolving game room- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizu and Sora were following several guards as they went through restricted doors. When they walked in they found themselves in a dark room and that was when the door behind them was forced shut and a locking sound was heard. <br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" Shizu questioned as a trap-door sound was heard and he Sora make a yelp sound \"Sora? What's happening?\" That was when the sounds of various mechanisms was heard and suddenly a spotlight turned on Shizu's position. <br>\r\n\"Shizu Irie\" A deep voice said \"You have entered the dragon's den, now you shall perish here in this unholy abyss\" <br>\r\n\"What is this an RPG? Turn the lights on!\" Then all the lights turned on and he found himself in a giant, long corridor with Marco Sand standing at the end of the corridor, holding a microphone <br>\r\n\"You aren't any fun aren't you? Well...We checked your abilities and records and we have designed this game room to match your abilities\"<br>\r\n\"And why not fight me directly?\" <br>\r\n\"We are just trying to spice things up because we are bored\" He then stomped on the ground and both of them fell through a trap door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sora- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Shizu was about to fight Marco, he was about to fight Franco. He had ended up on some sort of platform that seemed unstable and on the other side of the platform was Franco, shuffling cards. <br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, Shizu's wolf companion, I just have to say this, don't die to early, I want to savor this battle\" He then threw several cards in the platform ground and the suddenly the entire platform had separated into many platforms of different sizes and then it had started to spin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game of their life had just begun. </span></div></div>",

This is going to be quite a spectacle to watch\" He then knocked on the wall behind him and then suddenly the tiles of the room started to move in a sporadic pattern and turrets came out <br>\r\n\"Oh you have got to be kidding me\" <br>\r\n\"We kid a lot even when it is supposed to be serious, but can you blame us when there is nothing to do around here?\" Then all the turrets shot at different intervals and locked on at Shizu, which he charged at Marco while reflecting and dodging bullets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sora- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his blade in his mouth he was jumping from platform to platform, not only avoiding the cards thrown by Franco (Which by the way were moving fairly quickly) but also watching the floor platforms movement so he doesn't accidentally fall off. When it seemed like he was about to get Franco with his blade he was suddenly knocked back by a giant card that had came between the gaps of the platforms, <br>\r\n\"What the- that is not fair!\" Sora yelled as Franco chuckled <br>\r\n\"Wolf boy, come on it's a casino run by the son of an ex-mafia and a notorious gang/ bandit leader, what the hell did you expect? Also, it's justified seeing as how you got me in movement speed and agility, leg wise that is\" When the card came down, Franco was suddenly gone. When he looked around he saw that he had ended up in the middle of the platform. \"Time to up the ante a little bit\" Then giant cards came up from between the platforms at a seemingly sporadic pattern, but really it was a complex set pattern. <br>\r\n\"Oh now this is going to be annoying!\" Sora yelled as he was attempting to go through the cards in his path, but found that he couldn't cut the cards <br>\r\n\"Nice try, but that ain't working\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shizu- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he swung his blade he discovered that Marco was protected by some sort of clear barrier. The minute he discovered this is continued to move and went to reflecting bullets back at the turrets shooting. <br>\r\n\"Surprised? Well don't be, did you really think that I was not being protected?\" After a little while deflecting bullets back the turrets, he managed to take out all them all out. \"Now, time to up the ante a little bit, shall we?\" He hit the wall behind him with the butt of his magnum and then mechanisms started to move again as some of the tiles that weren't destroyed had unveiled laser guns, which the lasers were continuous. <br>\r\n\"Great...\" Then the lights went out \"Even more perfect!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sora- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, someway, he managed to get through the card trap maze set up by Franco and both of them were in the middle. <br>\r\n\"So, give up?\" Sora questioned <br>\r\n\"No...Not yet\" Then a loud horn sound was heard \"Ah, now for the main event\" <br>\r\n\"Main ev- WAH!\" The platform under them collapsed as both of them fell down to the final game <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shizu- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the laser guns were destroyed and the lights turned on <br>\r\n\"So, why did you let down your barrier?\" <br>\r\n\"Because...the main event is about to start\" <br>\r\n\"Main Event?\" Then a loud horn sound was heard <br>\r\n\"Yes, now this is where the real fun starts\" Then both of them had fell through trap doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The main event- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pitch black as Sora and Shizu got up from their daze <br>\r\n\"Ah, damn those guys\" Shizu said <br>\r\n\"Shizu, that you?\" Sora questioned<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Sora...so how was your match\"<br>\r\n\"Could've been worse\"<br>\r\n\"Mine was a bit disappointing\" Then the lights had turned on and the area they were fighting in was a bit surprising as they were currently on a giant roulette wheel. \"What in the-\" <br>\r\n\"Welcome and hello special guests!\" Franco said as both him and Marco were sitting in the middle of the roulette wheel \"This is our final event which we have been preparing to be our special arena for certain individuals and you, Shizu and...whats-your-name wolf, are our special first stunt people to test the effectiveness of this arena\"<br>\r\n\"So don't die early on, okay?\" Marco had said when both of them had jumped from their high-point and Franco snapped his fingers <br>\r\n\"Let the real games begin!\" Then suddenly the roulette wheel started to spin and a giant ball came flying out of nowhere, becoming one of the many hazards of this special arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-River- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember how River was left behind to protect the RV from thieves? Well, guess how many times some people actually tried to rob the RV...I'll give you a hint. Currently she is sitting on a pile of unconscious people, whether some of them are dead or not is up to you, whistling as several guards from the casino were either staring if they had just got there or recording as they were there early on and recording the onslaught of what happened there, <br>\r\n\"That is one scary woman\" Guard 1 remarked <br>\r\n\"What even happened here?\" Guard 2 questioned <br>\r\n\"Should we call the police or something?\" Guard 3 questioned <br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm standing here recording all the beat-downs that woman gives\" Guard 1 replied. <br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm not even going near her\" Guard 2 said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back to the battle- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, at its core, this entire arena required both skill and luck, enough skill to maintain ones balance and multitask between the opponent and arena, but also luck in which hoping your attack makes contact or hope you don't get hit by the ball. Which speaking of, while Sora was fighting Franco head on and was almost crushed by the ball and Shizu was fighting Marco. Although it seemed like the battle was going to be underwhelming, that was when Marco had retreated down the roulette board and went through one of the holes where the giant ball goes when it stops (Which normally, roulette boards don't have this, but this is only here to make the area more dangerous) <br>\r\n\"Why the heck did that guy do that?\" Shizu questioned as he looked up and saw Marco flying through the air and landing in the middle of the roulette board, <br>\r\n\"Franco! Let's light this party up!\" That was when Franco threw several cards at Marco, which those cards were of a different variations than the standard metal card he uses, and then he got taken out by Sora who had several cards sticking into him. <br>\r\n\"Sora you okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am\" Both of them looked up at Marco and was wondering what he was going to do. That was when he revolved his magnum barrel several times and that was when his magnum started to glow. Then he placed one of the cards in front of the magnum barrel and fired, which unleashed a barrage of lasers at the same time. Both Shizu and Sora dodged successfully as Marco had attached more cards at the front of the barrel and started shooting even more lasers. Although this was all dandy and all, unfortunately this was a case in which it would be very simple to counter him by going through the hole he went through to get up there which someone would catch his attention and block/ deflect all the lasers, which Shizu could also have aimed a laser back at Marco's legs and it would've been all over when he fell down. But that wasn't the case here as, in a struck of bad luck and bad positioning and horrible area mechanics, the ball came down and hit him right in the head and he came crashing down onto the ground below.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Shizu reacted to what happened <br>\r\n\"That was anti-climactic\" <br>\r\n\"This doesn't feel like a win to me, but-\" <br>\r\n\"Winner! Shizu Irie! Congratulations, you became ranked 96!\" Two people, a male and female said at the same time <br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Shizu said \"Where the heck is the exit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 4 of them were in the same room, talking to each other <br>\r\n\"That was a good show there\" Franco said as he shaked hands with Shizu <br>\r\n\"It was interesting, especially the end\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, someone needs to fix that\" Marco replied <br>\r\n\"How did all of that work?\" Sora questioned <br>\r\n\"Money can do anything\" Franco replied as he looked at Shizu, who was thinking of something \"Something on your mind?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm just wondering why both of you fight...\"<br>\r\n\"To avoid any kind of headache, we'll just tell you\" Marco said <br>\r\n\"Our reason is something that is not really that significant as we only joined because we were bored\" Franco said <br>\r\n\"Considering what happened there, I thought so\" <br>\r\n\"Both of us were in a crap-hole before and we built our way up onto a pile of money, but we found life to be kind of bland\" Franco continued \"And so, with the skills we have trained and built up we had joined to feel the rush of fighting and you just gave us that in our games\" <br>\r\n\"For some reason the fight against both of you seemed underwhelming, when was the last time both of you fought?\" Shizu questioned <br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that, both of us had gotten rusty after much time without fighting or training\" <br>\r\n\"Well, may we meet each other in better conditions\" All 4 said their good-byes as Sora and Shizu went outside to see the pile of bodies that River was sitting on and the 4 guards watching it <br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Shizu said <br>\r\n\"About time you got here\" River said \"The locals kept giving me a hard time, also these guys still had nothing good on them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanked #98: Marco Sand <br>\r\nRanked #97: Franco Gambit <br>\r\nRanked #96: Shizu Irie <br>\r\nRanked #95: Markus Desola <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where is the next guy?\" Shizu questioned<br>\r\n\"If I recall, he should be around here somewhere\" <br>\r\n\"Really?

And none of them were fancy, just regular generic wooden chairs and another questionable thing was that some of them were stacked in different ways for whatever reason. Of course there was also many broken chair pieces strewn all over the place. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile he was wandering around the very dim store, he heard someone whistling some sort of tune which he had no idea what it was, and when he followed he had treaded upon an area where there were multiple giant stack of chairs. Due to the fact that the whistling seemed to come from this area, he yelled,<br>\r\n\"Hey, ranked #95, you in here?!\" Then a man lazily called out <br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah I\u2019m here, hi there 96\" Then he just stared up at the ceiling <br>\r\n\"Um...Where the heck are you!?\" Then there was the sound of a chair moving and then suddenly he seemed to have came out of nowhere as he pretty much dropped into Shizu\u2019s point of view. Although the area was still dim he could make out that he had an average height, a slight build, black short hair, brown eyes, darkish skin and was wearing blue cargo pants, black shoes, and a blue and white shirt that looks likes he was ran over with them on. Also he had a green metal foldable chair strapped to his back \"Why does it look like you got ran over?\" <br>\r\n\"Because I was\" he still said lazily \"let's sit down and talk\" He pulled out his green chair, set it up, and then sat on it. Shizu just grabbed a random chair and also sat down \"So, I can see you're a swordsman, but I bet you're wondering what I do\"<br>\r\n\"With the amount if chairs around here, I could take a guess\u201d <br>\r\n\"Well, that guess would be right, my weapon is chairs\"<br>\r\n\"Out of all the stuff you pick, why get chairs?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe I wanted to be different from others, besides,  that is literally the first thing I pick up during bar fights or any fight, unless the chairs are bolted down then I just go with my fists\" <br>\r\n\"Why In the world are there chairs everywhere?\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't collect them, they were already here when I made this my sanctuary, I just stacked these chairs\" <br>\r\n\"So, what is the purpose?\" <br>\r\n\"Specify\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you fight?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBesides being a street fighter as a profession, I am also an entertainer that specializes in balancing and I dabbled with chairs for a bit and you can figure out the rest\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t exactly explain your purpose\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat would be to easy, figure it out after you see how I fight. Oh right, I forgot the formalities, my name is Markus Desola, what\u2019s yours?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cShizu Irie\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOkay Shizu\u201d He stood up and folded his chair \u201cI\u2019ll show you how I\u2019m ranked 95\u201d He swung his chair and in response Shizu unsheathed his sword and blocked his chair \"At least I know that your reflexes are top-notch\" He suddenly dropped the blade-lock and ran into the darkness. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing the edge you have on me would be your ability to see in the dark?\u201d Then the sounds of chairs breaking were heard,<br>\r\n\u201cA bit of a fact, my eyes actually adjusted to the darkness for being in the dark for too long\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhy set up the lanterns?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cFighting a blind person isn\u2019t cool nor fair\u2026Unless they are one of those people who have some super senses, 3rd eye sensory stuff\u201d Then there was a loud creaking sound \u201cAlso\u2026No hard feelings\u201d When Shizu looked around him he saw one of the tower of chairs falling down in his direction.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the battle, the sounds of objects/breaking chairs kept echoing throughout the abandoned store which pretty much removed the option of tracking Markus' movement through sound. Overtime it was a game of avoiding the falling avalanche of chairs and blocked parts of chairs that are thrown at him which by the end of it all of the towers have fallen, leading to many chairs being on the ground, restricting his movement speed, and also a few bruises from being hit in his blind spot. <br>\r\n\"So\" Shizu thought \"Not only is this man quick, but also stealthy and probably strong, from what he said his balance is high-level and coupled with that he has developed night-vision. This man could literally come out of nowhere, I can't use my sword flash and I am a sitting duck...He really thought this out\" He kept turning with his sword in front trying to figure out where he is going to strike next. That was when he saw a chair coming at him and when he sliced it in half he saw that Markus used that as a cover to strike him down. When Shizu tried to counter his attack, Markus had used his chair to break his defense and he quickly unfolded his chair and rammed Shizu down onto the ground with the chair right on top of him. Before he could react, Markus had pulled out two chair legs and started to beat the living crap out of Shizu. Mid-way, Shizu had shoved the chair off of him, but that did not knock Markus off balance as he just jumped off of his chair and slammed both his feet onto Shizu's face and just retreated with his chair in hand. \"Ouch...\" Shizu said blankly as he quickly stood up and scanned the area for his next attack. Then he thought \"I can't believe that this guy is giving me this much trouble, he is a lot better than I thought he was with being both physically able and being able to think out things out...Oh for the love of-!\" While he was thinking of what to do, he just remember something in his backpack. Remember that not only does he have syringes that have different effects, but he also has things from bandages to a flare gun. He reached into his backpack and pulled out a flaregun which he put into his pocket with his hand on it at all times. Then he just waited for the right moment to use it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Markus- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" He thought \"I used some of my tricks already and with how I see it, Shizu isn't going to fall for the same thing twice, and-\" As he was watching him he saw him pull out something from his backpack \"Wait, Shizu had a gun? Huh, I shouldn't be surprised, but I'm still surprised he is actually using one considering my assumption of his character...Well just as long as my chair blocks the bullets, I should be fine\" He all thought while under the impression Shizu is using an actual gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shizu- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still looking around he heard something move and saw that Markus was going for an attack from above. Although it was a sneak attack, Shizu wasn't about to slammed down again by a chair again so he dodged the strike. Immediately afterwards, Markus charged forward, using his chair similar to a shield and both of them clashed with each other. <br>\r\n\"So, why are you being reckless now?\" Shizue questioned as they were still hold each other off <br>\r\n\"Because, I assume that sneak attacks may not work on you anymore, and so\" Suddenly he moved his chair in such away that not only his only defense removed, but somehow he disarmed Shizu...Quote on quote. \"Time to see how your unarmed skill is!\" And then the two started to fist-fight. Also, remember, Shizu has advanced hand-eye coordination and movement speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Markus is very good at fist-fighting with a very good balance of speed and strength, the strength part doesn't matter if it doesn't connect and his speed was not even close to Shizu's speed (But he was still fast) as the fight was pretty much Shizu dodging and blocking all of Markus' attacks and hitting where there was openings. That was when after Markus did a punch that had to much strength with it, Shizu had gone right behind him, put him into a head-lock, and pressed the flare gun right to his head. <br>\r\n\"Surrender Markus, I do not want to fire\" Shizu said blankly as Markus was shaking as, again, he thought the flare gun was an actual gun <br>\r\n\"Ah! I surrender my rank! You win! Even though you might not fire at all, you may choke me out, which do you have any idea how many gangs are around here?!\" He said quickly as Shizu made a confused face <br>\r\n\"...Wait are you-\" Markus suddenly stopped shaking <br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" He elbowed Shizu in his side and immediately got out of his hold. Soon after, before Shizu could recover Markus smashed him down with devastating blows and he seemed to have gotten faster. Shizu attempted to dodge more and counter with his own moves, it just wasn't enough as Markus was following his movements closely and was beating him up even more. That was when Markus had struck him with a particularly heavy blow as Shizu was sent flying through the darkness and into a tower of chairs.<br>\r\n\"Ow\" Shizu said as he rubbed his head as he was getting up from his position and noticed the tower of chairs falling down \"Crap!\" He ran as the chairs fell down violently. Covered in scratches and splinters, Shizu just looked around to see where Markus was \"This guy is stronger than I thought\" <br>\r\n\"A swordsman without a sword is useless\" Markus' voice echoed throughout the empty space \"The same can be said about a gunslinger and an archer, they are useless without their original gear, that is why I am different, I can use anything as a weapon and I use fight without with one with ease, but in this case what's the point of fighting someone you know who is weaker?\" Markus came out of the darkness holding his chair and Shizu's sword \"Here\" He threw and sword and Shizu caught it \"Now, let's see who is stronger, the wild brawler or the disciplined swordsman\" Shizu unsheathed his blade and Markus slammed his chair in front of him, which looks like he was going to charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ran at each other, as if this one move would be the deciding moment. But as they were running at each other, Shizu stopped in his tracks, pulled out his flaregun, which surprisingly wasn't knocked out of his hand when Markus was beating the living crap out of him, and fired a flare through the opening in the chair and hit Markus between the eyes, causing him to drop his chair and grab his face in pain. <br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch this hurts!\" He yelled as Shizu came up right next to him and started beating him up into a pulp with the back of his sword and bottom of his hilt. This continued until Shizu was deemed the winner, which wasn't for quite a while since Markus was apparently made out of iron with how much he was getting beaten up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Outside- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside there were bodies scattered everywhere as River was looting their bodies, Shizu was sitting at the entrance of the building with Markus whose eyes were bandaged <br>\r\n\"Shizu\" Markus said <br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" <br>\r\n\"That wasn't necessary\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that was the only way to beat you at the moment\" <br>\r\n\"You could've shot my hand or leg, but you shot me between the eyes!\" <br>\r\n\"Eh...Don't worry, what I gave you will help\" <br>\r\n\"Bah, you suck, and I hate you\" <br>\r\n\"Hm...Wait weren't you going tell me something after the fight?\" <br>\r\n\"I was?...Well, might as well, okay, although we may all be different, all the fighters are different with their own fighting styles and abilities, there is still the case that some of our weapons seem to repeat a lot which your katana is an example, too many swords, too many guns, I just want to be a lot more different from everyone and I want to be distinct and so I picked the chair, which as you can see, a weird weapon doesn't make it bad\" <br>\r\n\"Considering how much in the beginning you beat the crap out of me and how the battle played out, it was quite interesting and unique in its own way\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks for the compliment, now, I wish you luck on your journey and farewell\" He said as he went through the doors and disappeared into the dark furniture store. Shizu didn't even bother talking to River as he went inside and greeted Sora which didn't even reach his ears as he was fully asleep. He sat down at the table and just contemplated on something, <br>\r\n\"I'm getting close to the original ranked #9...I wonder how that battle is going to play out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanked #96: Markus Desola <br>\r\nRanked #95: Shizu Irie <br>\r\nRanked #94.

But it is possible to skip ahead within the rankings if the person is within your numbering\" <br>\r\n\"Okay then, with that clear, let's get a plane ticket-\"<br>\r\n\"Let's not take a plane, I think it would be better if we should go on a cruise ship\"<br>\r\n\"Does it look like we're going on a vacation somewhere?\" Shizu questioned with a blank face <br>\r\n\"No, but you have basically been fighting non-stop for about a month, maybe more, so you might as well relax, besides, we are not in any hurry, those guys aren't going anywhere, we can definitely afford it (If anything we might as well buy a cruise ship with how we spend the overall funds on supplies and nothing more) and you need to put a damper on your fighting spree because you keep getting more injuries than you can heal!\"<br>\r\n\"My fighting spree? In terms of quantity, you beat me in the leagues\" Then River just death stared him <br>\r\n\"All of those were either nuisances or self-defense, you're the one that keeps hunting down the strongest fighters in the world!\" Then there was a long silence after that and River is still death staring him.<br>\r\n\"You know, I heard somewhere that there's at least a 0.00000000000000000000675% chance that a stare can kill someone and maybe a curse...You just increased that by like 40%, maybe even more if you started cursing\" And then from that comment both of them went into an argument which most of it was irrelevant random stuff and was hilarious. <br>\r\nWhile they were arguing, Sora was thinking of this, <br>\r\n\"Both of them would make one heck of a couple...Just go on the cruise ship ride, make-up, do some romantic plot-line/sub-story, and then drop it like nothing happens in the end...Or do some titanic crap while I'm floating away on an iceberg with penguins and polar bears...Of course this isn't...Wait what do those guys call it...A shonen or something? Well whatever it is, we aren't in one\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Harbor in California- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizu was carrying both his and Rivers luggage as Sora was wearing some canine-sized luggage-thing on him. The RV that they rode in was driving off in good hands of the courier transport team.<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't be surprised that I lost that argument\" Shizu said as he was boarding the ship <br>\r\n\"You know it was common sense to take the ship ride over the plane ride for luxury reasons\" River responded <br>\r\n\"Still, beating me half to death wasn't necessary\" <br>\r\n\"You took on an electrical powerhouse, lasers, multiple slashes and bruises. You were just going to be fine\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A little while later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 were in their designated room which was designed for 2 people and Sora immediately went on top of one of them and laid down. <br>\r\n\"Jeez\" Shizu said \"Why do people think we're a couple?\" <br>\r\n\"Probably because of me being female, you being male, and the fact we have a 'pet' with us, no offense\" River said as Shizu put down the luggage <br>\r\n\"None taken\" Sora responded <br>\r\n\"So what on earth do you do on a cruise ship exactly?\" Shizu questioned <br>\r\n\"You really haven't been on one before?\"<br>\r\n\"I've been on ships before, just not on a luxury cruise liner\" <br>\r\n\u201cWell then, let me show you how to relax for once!\u201d River grabbed Shizu by the arm and they went out of the room quickly as Sora was left to sleep on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the cruise was just beginning, there was a familiar face with his courier and a new face that were on board the ship and were leaning on the guard rails. <br>\r\n\"Was it really necessary to get on the ship?\" His courier questioned, which both of them are wearing the same thing. <br>\r\n\"Well, since he came back from Las Vegas and is about the fight the 4, might as well give him good luck\" <br>\r\n\"You know that these people are going to figure out we're stowaways soon, right?\" <br>\r\n\"Probably, then we just abandon ship and swim as fast as possible\" <br>\r\n\"So, what makes you think that this man is really going to make it very far?\" <br>\r\n\"Just a soldiers intuition...An intuition that has made it through Pandora's box\" <br>\r\n\"So, why didn't you just talk to him before we set off to sea?\"<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to check out Japan and then come right back, shouldn't be a problem...By the way, how many couriers and rankers are on this ship right now?\" His courier pulled out his cellphone and checked the radar<br>\r\n\"Including me and you, there are 6 onboard, along with 3 ranked people also\" <br>\r\n\"Who the heck's the 3rd one?\" <br>\r\n\"Not sure\" <br>\r\n\"Wait, they don't track information like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The 3rd ranked person onboard-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3rd ranked person on board (Description: Short, skinny, long black hair, hazel and blue eye, pale.

River is attempting to make Shizu relaxed, which is going poorly as it's not Shizu's fault that he is not relaxing, its the stuff that goes around him from children pestering him, people making remarks and assumptions of River and Shizu being a couple which peeves him off quite a bit, he got into quite a few accidents from when he let his guard down and he ended up going overboard (Which Joseph was still around and he saved him several times) he got into several fights when people actually tried to steal his sword (Broken spirits and bones ahoy) and to top it all off, Sora was a giant sarcastic troll that actually attempted several times to ship both of them together just for the sake of entertainment...which Shizu is an impenetrable wall with a strong bastion couple along with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this, he still managed to remain calm overall and the best moments were of peace and the moments he spent with River, which they got to know each other a bit more from River's backstory to Shizu's insane adventures while hilarity ensues. A few days from this and currently it is nighttime with Shizu being out and River sleeping with Sora on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the sea looks at night, from your own eyes\" Went he went to the front of the ship he spotted someone right at the edge of it holding a sketchbook and just drawing. (To remind everyone: Description: Short, skinny, long black hair, hazel and blue eye, pale. Wearing multi-colored long-sleeve shirt, orange pants and black shoes) When he came up behind him, he just said a simple greeting \"Hi there\" <br>\r\n\"Yo\" The drawer said, who had a young-sounding voice, and his concentration not broken <br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing up so late at night?\" <br>\r\n\"One of my personalities thought it would be beneficial for me to go outside for once, well might as well draw something while I do that\"<br>\r\n\"Your personalities?\"<br>\r\n\"Multiple-personality syndrome\" <br>\r\n\"Another interesting character I seemed to have met\" Shizu thought \"Well, see you\" When he turned around, the guy grabbed him by the shoulder <br>\r\n\"By the way, you're Shizu Irie, are you not?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes I am, who's asking?\" He looked over his shoulder and saw the deep stare of both his eyes shining in the moonlight \"This doesn't look good\" He thought <br>\r\n\"I am also a ranked member, Johnny Rivas, you don't know me, but I know you from the couriers on this ship talking, now, let's fight here on the deck, right here, right now\"<br>\r\n\"Well this is sudden, give a reason why I should\" <br>\r\n\"Just think of it as a bead on a ranked member who is higher up than you, a practice battle if you will\" <br>\r\n\"You know, not to be arrogant, cocky, or overconfident, but are you sure?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes I am sure\" <br>\r\n\"Okay then\" Both of them walked away from each other and put a fair distance between them. \"Ready?\" Then Johnny pulled out a metal pole with a scalpel at the end of it, which he pulled that seemingly out of nowhere. He spun it several times around him skillfully as he ended it with holding his weapon like a regular sword<br>\r\n\"While you fight, I will see your true emotion through your actions, with how you see and know the environment around you while I get inspiration to see the art of battling of another beside my own\" When he said that, Shizu remember the words said by Jenkins and his own goals...strange how they seem to match in a way. Both of them charged at each other and clashed blades...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that fight was going on, Joseph and his courier were watching far away while sitting on the railing, <br>\r\n\"Wow\" Joseph reacted \"That guy has one weird fighting style\" <br>\r\n\"Well, he is particularly known for being unique in his own fashion\" <br>\r\n\"Shizu may be fast at his movement and swordsmanship skills, but that guy is reading him like a book and blocking all of his attacks, not only that, but his fighting style seems to be quite debilitating\" <br>\r\n\"Agreed, so, how confident are you in that man, really?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, in this battle, he seems to have lost, but that means he can learn more from people who can outclass them in their own way\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fight ended, Shizu hit the ground completely as he couldn't feel his arms, legs, and just felt pain internally. That was when Johnny was over him, \"Thanks for the fight, sorry if I was a bit to rough, this was really beneficial for inspiration for my art and manga\" Then he tried to lift Shizu up, which he was having some difficulties trying before Joseph and his courier came along to assist. \"Oh, hello there\" <br>\r\n\"We know where his room is, we can take him\" The courier said as they carried him off to his room while Johnny was standing there looking.<br>\r\n\"Without any words, I can tell that person is nice and he is going to be fun\" On the way over to his room, Shizu said, <br>\r\n\"Wow, that guy was good\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, we saw\" The courier responded <br>\r\n\"That was interesting to see\" Joseph said <br>\r\n\"That person I just fought...for some reason I can connect to him\" <br>\r\n\"Pretty much how you connected with me\" Joseph said as they got to Shizu's room \"So, is it unlocked or-\" <br>\r\n\"I got the key\" When they unlocked the door, it just so happens that River was up and when she saw Shizu she was not amused...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Johnny- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started a video chat with Katana again, which this time she was wearing cat-ears <br>\r\n\"Konichiwa!\" She said loudly <br>\r\n\"Konichiwa, I just met that guy that is going through the rankings and fought him\" <br>\r\n\"How was Shizu-san?\" <br>\r\n\"Judging from our fight, he is going to give you a good time\" <br>\r\n\"Yay! Bye-bye, I am going to sleep now\" Then the video chat shut off as he hit head on the desk <br>\r\n\"Dang, I really should watch my sleeping pattern, I feel like death now\"</span></div></div>",

That was when Johnny entered the room, carrying a laptop and an umbrella, and he grabbed a chair and just sat beside Shizu. <br>\r\n\"So...sorry about that\" Johnny said as he opened his laptop and started working on his project <br>\r\n\"Well, I think I should have fought harder than what I did there\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed how that fight was a bit...underwhelming, but it gave me some ideas so it wasn't all bad\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you did say practice match, and how you fought surprised me so much, also what are you working on?\u201d<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m working on a project, which I'm almost done with it\"<br>\r\n\"By the way, why are you on this ship?\" <br>\r\n\"I won a free ship ride from a contest I entered and our meeting is coincidental\"<br>\r\n\"Okay\" After a little while of silence, Johnny took a look at Shizu's head injury <br>\r\n\"Wait, I don't remember giving you that how did that happen?\" Then Sora suddenly woke up from his slumber and said <br>\r\n\"River was mad that Shizu had another fight on a ride that is supposed to alleviate fighting stress...As you can see she is a hypocrite\" Then Johnny just stared at Sora \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"A talking white wolf...and Shizu, either you have a tsundere companion or your companion is incredibly violent\" <br>\r\n\"What the heck is a tsundere?\" Johnny closed his laptop and stood up <br>\r\n\"You can figure it out\" Johnny just left the room without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went out and closed the door, Joseph and his courier were standing outside listening to the conversation. They said nothing to each other as both Joseph and his courier went the opposite direction of Johnny,<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Johnny said \"If you're going to do what I think you're going to do, I am against it fully\" Joseph turned around <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we're just going to talk to her\" Joseph continued walking as Johnny opened his umbrella as he was about to step into the sunlight \"I wonder where those guys have been hiding on the ship\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later in Shizu's room- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much all the significant characters are in his room with Johnny sitting in the corner with his laptop, Joseph and his courier bandaged up and slightly wet, with River behind them making a peeved face and Sora is lying on top of the bed, who is wide awake<br>\r\n\"Why is everyone in my room?\" Shizu questioned as he sat up <br>\r\n\"These two had a chat with me\u201d River responded <br>\r\n\u201cTranslation\u201d Sora said after \u201cI wrecked them and threw them overboard\u201d Then River came up and bonked Sora on the head with the blunt side of her blade.<br>\r\n\u201cA lot of things are happening on this ship\u201d Shizu said as he face palmed \u201cBut at least it\u2019s interesting\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Entirety of the ship ride in the nutshell- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of them were screwing around the entire time, Johnny spent most of his time inside doing something and chatting away with his little buddy with sleeping on occasion/ falling asleep while doing something and those screwball moments on the ship between the others were incredibly\u2026well they were entertaining to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Outside the ship-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was daytime when the ship had arrived at Japan. Which again, all of the significant characters are gathered there with the only thing off is Joseph slinging his courier over his shoulder. The reason for that is because he got \u2018mysteriously knocked unconscious.\u2019 <br>\r\n\u201cWell, see you guys later\u201d Joseph said as he put on his rebreather and jumped into the harbor water. Everyone else turned to each other and talked, <br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d Shizu questioned and before River could answer Johnny said, <br>\r\n\u201cI could lead you to your destination; after all, we\u2019re going to the same place\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, lead the way\u201d When they started walking Johnny stopped, \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you Japanese?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes, why?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYour English seems pretty good\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cConsidering how much I\u2019ve been around the world, my accent kind-of\u2026evens out\u201d <br>\r\n<i>\u201cSo, how\u2019s your Japanese?\u201d  &lt;(If dialogue is like this, it is basically a translation)<br>\r\n\u201cBet I know it better than you\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</i> When they started walking off toward whatever public transportation was available while still talking in Japanese, Sora and River just looked at each other, with River saying, <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a bad time, aren\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMost likely\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, where are we going?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThe home of original ranked 9th, which also houses the other 3 below her and is the pure definition of \u2018don\u2019t just a book by its cover\u2019\u2026Seriously\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see soon\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they took a bus ride to the home of the next ranked 4</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After taking a bus-ride to their destination they had all got off near a very large and a rather good-quality looking apartment building. After going to the front door, Johnny went to some intercom-number pad thing on the right side of the door and pressed several numbers. The doors opened afterwards after he finished putting in the password. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of the apartment building was actually quite normal-looking, nothing too fancy aesthetically, with a reception desk off to the side, the elevator on another side and a staircase in the back.  At the reception desk was a man wearing some sort of guard uniform with the only noticeable detail being the head-gear which seems to be some sort of security device. He turned at the entering group direction and said, in Japanese, <br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh, Johnny-kun, I forgot you were coming. Katana\u2019s up in her room doing the same old\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d Johnny replied \u201cWhat about the others?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAll of them are out doing their own thing as always\u201d</i> The group just went into the elevator, which to clarify the building has 10 floors, Johnny pressed the button for the top floor and they all just idly talked away.<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d Shizu said \u201cJust out of curiosity, who owns this building?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cTechnically speaking, that would be the person you are about to meet, but overall it belongs to all 4 of the next ranked people\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnother question, who are the people that live in this building?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNone of them are \u2018normal\u2019 people if that's what you\u2019re asking, they are either ranked, couriers, assassins, or other things.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, good to know\u201d The elevator doors opened and they followed Johnny straight toward a certain door, which the number was 91.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When he was about to open the doorknob he signaled the others to stand back. The minute he opened the door he said,<br>\r\n\u201cHey Katana, I\u2019m here!\u201d Then suddenly a squeal was heard and Johnny was tackled down and embraced by a young little-girl wearing a black Lolita dress with cat ears and a tail. While he was petting her head everyone just stared \u201cGuys, I would like to introduce Katana Shimanouichi\u201d Katana lets go of Johnny, stands back up, and just flashes the cutest smile<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d Everyone was still staring \u201cWhy is everyone staring at me like that?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cJust for clarification\u201d Shizu said \u201cIs this #91?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cUnbelievably, yes\u201d River replied \u201cHonestly I\u2019m surprised as you are as all I knew was that she looked very young despite her age, but this is pushing it\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHow old is she?\u201d River shrugged as sounds of grunting was hear and ignored <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, definitely more than 18\u201d That was when Sora interrupted their conversation <br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026little help here\u201d Both of them turned their attention to Sora, which Katana was on top of him and hugging his neck \u201cDon\u2019t ask how this happened\u201d <br>\r\n\"Sora\" Shizu stated \"Why do you keep attracting females and Katana why are you doing that?\" <br>\r\n\"Sora-kun reminds me of someone\" <br>\r\n\"How in the world-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was in Katana\u2019s room, which was quite large with shelves of manga and anime with a messy bed and the TV being left on an incredibly awkward scene which if I were to explain what was happening I would have to change the story age rating. For more details, Katana was sitting on the bed reading a manga as everyone else was sitting at the table <br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Shizu started \u201cWhat the heck are we doing?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d Katana said as she was still reading \u201cYou are going to choose how the fight is going to play out\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe individually, maybe multiple, or facing all of u as once\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhy the heck would I fight all of you at once?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThe money gained increases, you gain more experience, and other things\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnything specific?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNope, only that it gets better depending on how you play this out\u201d Shizu looked back to his little group. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot and facing 4 at the same time is just a wish to die\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cShizu\u201d Sora said \u201cAren\u2019t you curious about the item she is going to give?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cExperience and/or money?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not greedy and what experience? How many times am I going to fight multiple rankers at the same time?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou never know\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt that much, that is if I can get certain people in\u2026Hey Katana, can I bring in extra rankers and couriers for this?\u201d  <br>\r\n\"I don't see a reason not to\" <br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d Then Shizu thought \u201cWait why is something like this even allowed?\u201d Then he said \u201cOkay, I know what I\u2019m doing\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d Katana questioned<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which they entered the elevator and Katana pressed the elevator buttons in a certain pattern and it went down. <br>\r\n\u201cHey River, mind if I borrow your cellphone?\u201d River reached into her bag, got her cellphone, and then handed it to him \u201cThanks\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you need it?\u201d She asked as Shizu had texted something on it and sent it to someone. <br>\r\n\u201cPreparations\u2026For the mean time, I might keep this\u201d When he said that the elevator had made it to its destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doors opened, what was seen is some sort of underground parking lot which not only did it have dim lighting, but also a lack of people and quite a few vehicles. <br>\r\n\u201cThis is where we are fighting\u201d Katana said as all of them exited which Johnny had a particular expression <br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s the parking lot\u2026Well excuse me while I find a safe place to observe this fight!\u201d He went back into the elevator and immediately went up. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the feel of this\u201d Shizu said as Katana giggled and then disappeared into thin air \u201cWhat the-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cAll 4 of us are in this parking lot\u201d She said with a slight echo going through the parking lot and then all the lights suddenly turned off. Then the sounds of several motorcycles were heard as the lights of headlights were seen coming toward their direction with several green circles barely visible as the group of 3 were blinded by the headlights. When the motorcycles passed by them, River and Sora were grabbed leaving Shizu alone as the motorcycles just disappeared into the darkness. Then the parking lot lights turned back on with Shizu looking around his immediate area. A giggling sound was heard then a rising laughter came out \u201cAre you strong Shizu-san?\u201d Katana questioned with a serious tone \u201cYou know this world of ours isn\u2019t just fun and games, it\u2019s an abyss with people who have been destroyed and degenerated from within from the past of this world of ours. If you are truly strong\u2026face the people who have become strong from their strive and dark past\u2026Face people who will give it their all to prove that they aren\u2019t weak! Not like the so-called deadliest person\u2026But I guess I should look at myself first\u2026Never the less, prepare yourself for hell!\u201d Those last words echoed for quite a bit before silence had set in. <br>\r\n\u201cInteresting\u201d Shizu commented as he pulled out a green vial from his bag and unsheathed his blade \u201cHope your poison is potent Jenkins\u201d He spread the poison carefully on his blade. After he was done he begun wandering around the parking lot carefully and on full alert \u201cEvery ranker in this rankings is either broken to some degree or have a personal agenda they must accomplish\u2026I wonder if he got my message\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later from when Shizu started-  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same parking lot there was another elevator going down to its level. When it opened, 2 men in green and brown military-like uniforms walked out with the one behind the other holding a cellphone in his hand, <br>\r\n\u201cYou sure this is the place Pistolet?\u201d Joseph questioned in a hushed voiced (Pistolet is the actual name of his courier) <br>\r\n\u201cYes sir this is the place\u201d His courier replied as he put his cellphone in his bag <br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d He pulled out his flechette gun while his courier pulled out a silenced pistol \u201cStay to the shadows or wartime?\u201d Then the sounds of a battle was echoed throughtout the parking lot  <br>\r\n\u201cRecommendation, guns blazing\u201d Pistolet said as he took off the silencer of his pistol while Joseph transformed his flechette gun into a 3-barreled mini-gun <br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026Today may a good day to die, but we aren\u2019t going down yet\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhy the heck are you saying that for?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWords of encouragement\u201d When they were walking in the direction of the fight the sounds of chains were heard \u201cDid you hear-\u201c Then a swarm of chains came out of nowhere as both of them fired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back to Shizu from the beginning- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter avoiding an arrow shot at him, Shizu went into cover behind a van as he continuously looked around his surroundings, <br>\r\n\"I see\" A female voice said \"So his reflexes really are that good\" <br>\r\n\"But how good?\" A rough male voiced questioned \"I would love to see how he does against me\" <br>\r\n\"Guys\" Another male said \"Before you do, let me see if this man is the real deal. He may have bypassed the others, but how will he do against real skill?\" <br>\r\n\"Ryan\" The other male said \"Go ahead\" <br>\r\n\"Understood\" When Shizu peeked around the corner he saw a male coming of the darkness spinning around a chain with a chakram (Bladed Frisbee...Basically) at the end of it. (Rank 94: Ryan Bell, average height, average build, short black hair, brown eyes, light-brown skin. Light brown leather armor, pants, and brown boots.) \"Come on Shizu, show me what you got!\" Shizu came out of hiding with his blade out in front. Ryan stopped spinning his chained chakram and caught it in his hand as he pulled out 4 more chakrams and threw them all at Shizu. Standing his ground, Shizu was going to block/ dodge all of them...That was until all of them had split up into two disks mid-way. </span></div></div>",

Well thankfully he managed to run quick enough before the van exploded. <br>\r\n\u201cJeez\u201d Shizu thought as he was now facing Ryan face to face which running to cover would help, but also may kill him at the same time so he\u2019s not risking it until he knows where the heck the others are. Both of them were staring each other down, looking to see who would make the first move with Shizu just holding his sword preparing to defend with Ryan swinging 2 chained chakrams. Then he stopped swinging them and caught them in his hands,<br>\r\n\u201cYou know before this fight began I gathered some information of your combat abilities and you know what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI had half a mind to forfeit right on the spot out of pure info alone, but based on how you are here says differently\u2026oh and by the way check your 6\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d Shizu turned around and saw big, bad, and\u2026big about to grab him (Rank 93: Darwin Merce: tall, medium build, black medium length hair, brown eyes eyes, tan skin. Thick, grey armor with a helmet with a visor) Before he could grab him, Shizu just rolled away, but then stopped as a thermal bolt grazed his face. He looked in the direction of where it came from and barely saw someone in the dark area of the parking lot (Rank 92: Anna Range: Average height, slight build, brown hair in ponytail, hazel eyes, white. Wearing black and grey long-sleeve shirt, pants, and shoes)<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it I missed\u201d Anna commented as she loaded in several bolts into her vertical crossbow<br>\r\n\u201cRyan, why the hell did you give away my position!?\u201d Darwin yelled <br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be that fair to take ambush someone from the dark like that (And considering the last time you did that the person had all their bones shattered like glass) Anyhow\u201d Ryan turned around and ran toward an entrance \u201cGood look with Shizu!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGet back here you!\u201d Ryan was long gone by then and Darwin just facepalmed \u201cRight after he said \u2018real skill\u2019 he leaves the area\u201d Then Shizu said while he was a fair distance, using a pillar as cover. <br>\r\n\u201cFor a group of people who are supposed to be fighting together, you sure are lacking a certain something\u201d Then Darwin pulled out his Nock Gun (An actual gun which is custom made to be usable and not absolute crap in todays standards. Translaton of a Nock gun: 7 barrels of death of devastating recoil) And in reaction to seeing the big gun, Shizu thought \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look good\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou know that there are more things that meet the eye right?\u201d Darwin instantly fired his shotgun afterwards and there were devastating results as part of the pillar was blown away to rubble and several parts of the ground and probably some cars in the back suffered quite some damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering quickly from the shock and awe of the power of his shotgun he focused on Anna, who fired several bolts in quick succession, but Shizu ended up catching all of them which he made few observations and planning \u201cThat crossbow of hers fires bolts faster than usual and it is apparent that she has more than poison bolts on hand, not only that but that big guy and his gun is a bigger issue thus far\u2026Well time to aim for weakspots\u201d He reached into his backpack and pulled out a flare gun. While he was thinking and doing that action, Anna was reloading with explosive bolts and thinking, <br>\r\n\u201cDamn showoff, let\u2019s see you catch this\u201d While Darwin was reloading and thinking <br>\r\n\u201cGod damn range\u201d Both of them took aim with Darwin focusing on destroying his cover and Anna shooting at a right moment. Then the first shot was fired and all kinds of crap broke loose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Where we left off with the other group- <br>\r\nJoseph and Pistolet were both bleeding as the chains that attacked them literally came out of nowhere with parts of them scattered across the floor with assorted blades attached to them as well, <br>\r\n\u201cJeez\u201d Pistolet commented \u201cThat was close\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI think we nearly got decapitated\u201d Joseph said as he took a step forward and something had caught onto his right leg and lifted him off of the ground \u201cAh, what the heck!?\u201d He looked at his leg and saw nothing grabbing onto his leg, but there definitely was something there \u201cWhat kind of black-magic voodoo is this? This is a damn reminder of that swamp!\u201d Then he gave himself goosebumps of him remembering that place. Then a man came out of the darkness (Ryan) and both of the men aimed their guns at him, <br>\r\n\u201cHello there-\u201c Before he even finished both men opened fired only to see that some sort of \u2018invisible wall\u2019 was protecting him. When they stopped firing the \u2018invisible wall\u2019 turned into a visible wall of chains that fell apart with damage \u201cHow rude\u201d Both men were in disbelief as a girls laughter was heard, <br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026little fish like you should stick to the pond\u201d Then a little girl (Katana) came out of the darkness wearing a cloak \u201cThe ocean is filled with things like sharks and other predators not meant for people of your caliber\u201d Both men were in even more disbelief when Katana came out <br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d Joseph said \u201cBut I cannot take you seriously\u201d It looked like Katana held something in her right hand, as when she seemingly pulled something in the air, the force on his right leg increased drastically and the sound of one\u2019s bone being crushed was heard\u2026and so is the agonizing scream of it \u201cPistolet!\u201d With 1 word, Pistolet just threw down an extremely potent smoke bomb as it filled the surrounding area up very quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, he was long gone (Which the smoke lasted for quite a while) <br>\r\n\u201cJust what are you doing?\u201d Katana questioned as she released some pressure on Joseph\u2019s leg <br>\r\n\u201cAssisting a friend in need\u201d He replied as he had a cellphone in his hand, which had gone unnoticed.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy even? He is just going to leave you, it\u2019s not like you have been with him for that long\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cJudgement of character, respect, present, future, the list goes on, even if we haven\u2019t been with each other that long I can see things that you probably can\u2019t see due to your limited view on things\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you? The author of this plotline?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNope, I\u2019m just a side-character for the plot to continue onto the epilogue and hope for a happy ending\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cCan you really hope for one? Not everything is happily ever after\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat depends on 2 things, the higher beings of this world and how the character see\u2019s and interact with one\u2019s environment\u2026which from you, little girl, you are a sheep in wolfs clothing\" <br>\r\n\u201cJeez\u201d Katana said \u201cFrom what I read about Shizu, you are sounding just like him now\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI may think similarly to him, but in terms of action\u201d He aimed his gun at Katana \u201cI know when to hold back and strike with all my might!\u201d He fired as Katana immediately let go of the chain as she pulled a katana out of nowhere and Ryan got out his chakrams and they spun on their own like chainsaws. \u201cI did my part, now you do yours\u201d He hit the ground on his straight on his feet and pressed a button on the cellphone he was holding.

Shizu didn\u2019t come out all that well as he was covered in enough gunpowder that a single spark would turn him into the human torch, he had several bolts in him as there was also a gunshot wound on his left shoulder. He pulled out several syringes out of his bag for removing the poison, alleviating the pain, and something to increase the healing process as he is pulling out the bolts.  <br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u201d He laid down onto the ground \u201cThat could\u2019ve been a lot better, but also a lot worse\u201d He looked at the 2 rankers he fought \u201cWow, Jenkins\u2019 poison really is potent, it looks like they\u2019re dead\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d Anna said weakly \u201cAre you going to do something to Katana?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe worst injuries would be a cut or stab wound, nothing more\u201d While Shizu was still laying down Pistolet had appeared onto the scene <br>\r\n\u201cShizu! Jo- Holy crap are you okay?!\u201d He said after examining him <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been cut by storms of blades, struck by powerhouses, and cooked by lasers, this is nothing, now what were you saying?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cJoseph is-\u201c Then there was a large explosion sound forcing Shizu to immediately get up \u201cJust followed me! He\u2019s fighting rankers 91 and 94!\u201d Both of them ran to his position as Shizu said <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck did he do?!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHe assisted his friend!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Explosion site-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was dust everywhere as both Ryan and Joseph were laying down onto rubble on the next floor below as Katana was hanging onto a chain blade that she threw into the ceiling before she landed. She let go of the chain and walked toward Joseph who was still conscious, unlike Ryan who was bleeding from his head. Katana pulled a sword that went slightly between his eyes, causing a trinkle of blood to come out,  <br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a deathwish?\u201d She questioned with anger in her tone <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I signed up for\u201d Joseph quipped as Katana was reeling up her swing to slash Joseph as a gunshot was heard and the sword was shot out of her hand with her holding her hand as it was slightly bleeding. She looked up to see Shizu with his sword slung over his shoulder and Pistolet aiming his pistol, <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go off killing my friend\u201d Shizu said as both of them jumped down from their position, with Pistolet immediately tending to Joseph \u201cI didn\u2019t kill yours, so where do get off by killing mine?\u201d Katana had a pissed off face and pulled a katana out of nowhere and pointed a finger at Shizu<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have taken the others out, but I\u2019m not going to go down easily!\u201d She yelled as she grabbed something in the air and pulled which the sounds of chains and metal clanging were heard and she charged at him. Then all around both of them were a massive amount of chains and blades that were gunning for both of them with absolutely no visible room to defend against all of them, which it appears that this was a type of last resort kind of thing, so as a response, he sheathed his blade and ran at Katana\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral chains were left hung and drawn with some scattered across the floor along with several assorted blades. As light from above and around hardly illuminated the area as the dust didn\u2019t exactly help, it was clear what had happened and for most people it would be a shocker. Shizu\u2019s blade was laying near Joseph and pistolet while he was on the ground holding Katana as her blade was plunged right through him and with the surplus amount of blades going into him. Katana had a shocked face at what just happened and just cried a little as she just remembered something from this action, <br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d She whispered before she screamed \u201cWhy would this idiot do something like this? What kind of person does this to their opponent?! Especially one that almost killed your friend, what kind of clich\u00e9 main hero protagonist is this guy supposed to be?!\u201d Joseph just stood up to answer that question <br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see, Shizu is different from most rankers. His ideals and thoughts are contrast to most people and although both he and I think alike, our actions defined us and that is what sets him apart\u201d He picked up his blade which had some blood on it \u201cYou know Shizu doesn\u2019t die easily right?\u201d He swung the blade and the blood came off easily, leaving a trail of its quick movement \u201cLike his sword, he is just going to brush this all off  quickly\u2026Shizu let go of the loli assassin like a lolicon already\u201d On cue Shizu just got up despite having about 17 assorted blades jammed into his body and an extra one going through his abdomen, he staggered a little once he fully got up. <br>\r\n\u201cHow are you still alive?!\u201d Katana questioned as she tried to move \u201cWait, why can\u2019t I move?!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cParalysis\u201d Shizu said which he coughed up some blood and he began pulling out syringes and injecting himself. There was a distinct cut mark on Katana\u2019s abdomen, which although it wasn\u2019t bleeding that much, it still went deep enough that the poison on his blade had entered her system. \u201cWill you yield? Please do, I already responded to one of your friends that at the worst I would give you a cut or stab wound\u201d Then he coughed up more blood \u201cAlso I\u2019m almost dead\u201d he said with such calmness it was like he wasn\u2019t going to die in about a minute. Katana just sighed and said in a disappointing tone, which took a lot away from her recent dark-peeved tone, <br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I lost like this!\u201d Then suddenly her voice changed to a lighter tone \u201cOh well things like this happen, it\u2019s not the end of the world and at least it was fun and killed my boredom\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGreat, sweet innocence is back\u201d Shizu responded as he fell to the ground on his hands and knees \u201cCan someone call 911 or a black market doctor?\u201d Then Pistolet raised his cellphone <br>\r\n\u201cAlready did it ahead of time\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026Now wake me up when I\u2019m not dead\u201d Then Shizu just hit the ground and blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n95: Ryan Bell  <br>\r\n94: Darwin Merce <br>\r\n93: Anna Range<br>\r\n92: Katana Shimanouchi<br>\r\n91: Shizu Irie <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"You know that there are some things that you can't change in a person, right?

Anyhow, after River and Sora went out to do their own thing, Katana went into Shizus\u2019 section and then sat on his abdomen, causing a bit of pain to him.<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d She said in a curious tone \u201cWhat was with that main protagonist stunt you pulled?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause when one of your friends asked what I was going to do to you I answered \u2018at the worst a cut or stab wound, nothing more\u2019 Or something like that, so that's what I did, only left you with a cut\u201d She had an annoyed face<br>\r\n\u201cSo you took all of those hits\u2026because of that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d She shook her head after hearing that and then went close to his face<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are an idiot\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSince we\u2019re insulting each other, the fact that you and your friend\u2019s purposes relate to bonds of friendship and proof that you are strong, not weak is generic, clich\u00e9, and repetitive with the amount of times I saw that\u201d Katana made a cute pissed off face and then pressed her forehead against his <br>\r\n\u201cIt happened like that, shut it!\u201d She said with a bit of temper<br>\r\n\u201cGet your head off my head before-\u201c Then Joseph opened the curtain to their section<br>\r\n\u201cHey Shizu\u201d Then he looked at the scene as both Shizu and Katana looked at him \u201cI think they have a term for this\u2026Lolicon was it?

I wonder why they aren't using them\" He further looked into some of their story's \"Depressing, sad, generic, unfortunate, tragic, standard, standard...Ah, here we go, let me see...\" He was reading a certain person's history and then immediately shut the cellphone off afterwards \"Well, that was an interesting read, I wonder why it won't let me see the others...Oh well\" He got up from his position and began to walk toward the door \"I didn't expect to see some of that...I wonder how those people got through that\"  When he was about to touch the door knob it was kicked opened and he was knocked back, which when he looked up to see who kicked it open it was River and she didn\u2019t seem amused. <br>\r\n\u201cShizu!\u201d She yelled while there was a manga book in her hand and a bit of blood coming out of her nose. He immediately knew what was going to happen next and just ran toward the edge of the building, pulled out 2 swords and jumped <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What happened earlier- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatana and Shizu were alone in her room and she was handing him a sword with a strange looking handle, Shizu took it and unsheathed it, examining it closely <br>\r\n\u201cIts one of my onii-chan\u2019s swords, the jet sword, its what made him a great fighter and assassin, I hope you use this well\u201d Shizu sheathed the blade and placed it to his side \u201cBut just a fair warning, its hard to use and my onii-chan was the only one master of it, but I think you can use it at the very least\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence\u201d When he was about to get out of the room Katana stopped him.<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I forgot\u201d She gave him a manga, a small device, a piece of paper, and a cellphone \u201cYou\u2019re going to need this\u201d Shizu examined all the items and for the manga, when he opened it his face went completely blank as the sound of his blood going down from his head  to his legs might be heard. He handed it to Katana and just said, <br>\r\n\u201cGive it to River and say it\u2019s from me\u201d She grabbed it, <br>\r\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s going to happen, right?\u201d She questioned <br>\r\n\u201cThere is a reason why you gave that to me, also I have this\u201d He lifted up the jet-blade and she nodded in response <br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d She smiled brightly<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d Shizu thought \u201cThe amount of innocence that is beaming is blinding\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Present time- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the jetsword under him and used his other sword as a balance as he pressed the jet mechanism and he was flying through the air, though whatever he was trying to do fell flat when he was caught by a chain mid-flight and was dragged down onto the rooftop with a pissed off River holding a chain, <br>\r\n\u201cYo\u201d Shizu said as River shoved the manga into his face onto a certain page, which Shizu\u2019s eyes have been blinded \u201cOh\u2026So this is why you\u2019re pissed off\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?!\u201d River questioned threateningly <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just having some fun, you know being less serious when I\u2019m not in a ranked fight, like you said\u201d He joked as River took the manga off his face, but then stared into his eyes like a predator <br>\r\n\u201cSo, you want to have fun eh?\u201d She grinned a little and then pulled Shizu up forcefully and then started to drag him toward somewhere \u201cI\u2019ll show you fun\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cFor some reason I have a bad feeling about this\u201d He thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Johnny\u2019s room- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was very dim and Johnny was working on something on his laptop while he was spinning on his rolling chair, <br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d He stopped himself from spinning and looked at the other 4 rankers available \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat I think\u201d Anna replied \u201cThis room is dark and makes us look a lot more sinister than it actual is\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d Johnny responded \u201cIt\u2019s how I work\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cShizu\u201d Joseph responded \u201cI said this once and I will say it again, high chances he will make it far, but he still has to learn about certain things in order to not die early\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cEven so\u201d Darwin said \u201cHe is resourceful with what he has\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBah\u201d Anna said in a peeved tone \u201cThe guy really knows how to aggravate you\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI respect him\u201d Ryan said straightforwardly <br>\r\n\u201cNow\u201d Johnny said \u201cWith all of that said, why the hell did all of you give him an easy time!?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare-\u201c Anna was saying when Johnny said, <br>\r\n\u201cOnes true essence comes when they fight with their all, it is an insult when you don\u2019t even try that hard!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHe did dare\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Shizu noticed how he went through all of that way too easily, again, mind telling me why the heck you guys did that?!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI speak for us\u201d Ryan said \u201cAnd say that we weren\u2019t motivated and we didn\u2019t exactly have much to worry\u201d <br>\r\n\"This entire arc was one gigantic screwball, I swear, what in the world happened to everyone to lose their fighting spirit?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWe all have our lives\u201d Joseph replied \u201cits not like we are required to go further than our current rank, which not only are you no exception, but that is the past, this is the present, and most of us have something better to do than beating the living crap out of each other like it was a fight club next to a fully-stocked armory\u201d <br>\r\n \u201cTch, I know, I know\u2026Hey wait a minute I don\u2019t remember calling you up here!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI saw you guys going into the same room and thought I might join, also I was bored\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, its not like a under-lying dark plot or anything\u201d Johnny said while he started spinning again and hitting the ground when he spun to much \u201cIs it just me or was this like a tutorial?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Joseph questioned<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I\u2019ll let you figure out what I mean, now I want to see how Shizu handles the spike in difficulty thanks to everyone from 101-91, you all have been quite helpful in developing this ranker!\u201d He said sarcastically as he claps to match the sarcasm \u201cAh, the day he fights me for real is going to be fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was when the peace was broken when the sound of a door being kicked open was heard, <br>\r\n\u201cHey Sora, we\u2019re going!\u201d River yelled as Sora sprang up from his slumber accidentally knocking katana back <br>\r\n\u201cWhoops, sorry\u201d He replied as he was going to get out of the room, but found the door closed \u201cUm\u2026\u201d Katana opened the door for him, <br>\r\n\u201cBye Sora, say I said bye to Shizu-san too and that don\u2019t die out there!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI will!\u201d Sora replied as he left the room and ran towards River. When they met up, he said \u201cUm\u2026That girl is supposed to be more than 18, right?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIf I remember correctly\u201d River answered <br>\r\n\u201cJapan never ceases to amaze me\u201d Then he noticed Shizu being carried \u201cWait what happened to-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Airport- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Just for clarification, the plane transport isn't by standard transport, it's by private plane as there has been very bad tension between rankers and airport security...Seriously just their weapons alone...and the fact that they are pretty much 'trained killers' despite some of them completely opposite of that and also the fact that there really isn't really that many rankers if you compare it to everyone else which is just unfair to others. It's different for couriers as they are quite a few of them and are on separate terms with airport security* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much everyone was there to see Shizu and his group off toward their next fight, which the reason being is that after the hospital recovery all of them screwed around for a bit and had fun. Before they got on the flight, some people said their last words of encouragement or negativity and then the 2 groups went their separate ways, but more likely or not they might meet again\u2026well some of them definitely will. Also, common courtesy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the plane Sora was sleeping in the corner of the plane as Shizu and River were sitting right beside each other. Before they could lift off Shizu noticed River shaking slightly and hanging onto the arm rests tightly <br>\r\n\u201cHey River, are you okay?\u201d Shizu asked, knowing full well of her real emotion <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just fine\u201d She replied straightforwardly, but with a bit of nervousness in the tone which pained Shizu a lot as seeing her like this was not only new, but also something he really didn\u2019t want to see. And with preparation if this was going to occur, he pulled out a syringe and injected it into River\u2019s neck, which she reacted violently and almost one hit KO Shizu. She grabbed her neck and yelled \u201cAH! What the hell was that for?!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSeeing you scared is something I don\u2019t want to see (Which out of all of the things to be scared of\u2026) also, effect will take place is a moment\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shizu counted down from 5 with his fingers which of course the shorter time got the more River began to lose consciousness and then completely going to sleep which her head leaned on Shizu\u2019s shoulder which shortly after she grabbed onto his arm <br>\r\n\u201cHuh, she looks cute while sleeping\u201d He poked her several times in the head to see how well the sedative worked, \u201cWell that thing worked well\u2026maybe too well\u2026Hm\u2026if this place was more private, I think I might\u2019ve-\u201cBefore he could even finish, River made a frowning face and had held onto his arm hard enough to create a bone-crunching sound. Shizu made a silent pained face and kept his screaming in, <br>\r\n\u201cEven when she\u2019s sleeping!\u201d He said in a pained voiced \u201cWhat the heck are her strength parameters?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in the flying in the plane with River still unconscious, Shizu was looking out while it was nighttime, <br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d He was thinking \u201cIt appears that the friendship (98) and love path (92) is set, like those two\u2026I wonder how those will end\u201d He looked at River again and patted her head \u201cI think Katana had a term for someone like River\u2026I can\u2019t remember what it was\u2026Anyhow\u201d he looks out the window \u201cI wonder what others think of the world. This place is beautiful, yet ugly at the same time, people see this place differently from biased views or open minds and each one can live for something for either themselves or for others of either their own accord or forced\u2026Well I guess I\u2019ll know when I get to them\u2026I wonder where some of these people even came from\u2026\u201d He pulled out another syringe and just looked at it \u201cI wonder where all of this is going to take me to the future\u2026I wonder what\u2019s going to get me first though\u201d He fell asleep with River still holding on and his head leaned against hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, the plane had finally landed at its destination\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also, don\u2019t forget the stone buildings\u2026a lot of stone buildings\u2026and that big castle\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cRiver, with the amount of space this place has, what happened to just landing right in the middle of all of this?\u201d Shizu questioned <br>\r\n\u201cScenic route\u201d River replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Shizu was looking out the window and saw the highland castle, one of the top 7 combat schools in the world. One thing for sure to know was that it was huge and it stretched far with semi-high walls, big stone structures, and don\u2019t forget the giant cannons that lay around the place like it was fort Knox medieval version with people wielding gun-blades everywhere. <br>\r\n\u201cOh this looks\u2026\u201c Shizu was admiring the architecture which at least it fit the environment nicely \u201cSo\u2026.Where is this person?\u201d The vehicle suddenly stopped as River looked back and just pointed out the window <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d River was pointing at the mouth of a valley where there was a single person planting something into the ground. Shizu was examining the area around that person and made a conclusion, <br>\r\n\u201cWell then, this looks like a fighting ground set by the ranker themselves, well then\u201d He opened the case and got out two sheathes, his reflection and jet sword, put them to his waist and he dropped his backpack \u201cNo one get near my position until the fight\u2019s over\u201d He said before leaving the RV and walking toward the mouth of the valley. <br>\r\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve just dropped him off, what is he trying to do, look at the scenery some more before it ignites like a warzone?\u201d Sora said while he was outside observing the gap between them and the ranker in the valley <br>\r\n\u201cSora, you have no idea how right you are\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Sora asked confused <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see why, also let us watch the fireworks that are about to start\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking through the valley Shizu was observing everything, the slope of the rising hills, the amount of almost undetectable foreign objects in the ground (Dynamite wire sticking out and also small tubing), the sunlight, and even the castle in the background. When he approached the ranker (Tall, slight build, blonde hair in a Dutch braid and brown eyes. Wearing flak jacket and reinforced brownish pants and shoes) she was carrying a compact mini-version of a swarm of bees behind her back while holding a pistol with an elongated barrel to fit an axe and she was crouching and putting something into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fighters were at a fair distance away from each other, and she still had her back to him. <br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d Shizu said and the ranker got up from her crouching position and looked back <br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d She replied, which she had a\u2026well let\u2019s call it a Dutch accent. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the set-up of this place?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh this, what you are standing on right now is a training area to test one\u2019s instinct\u2026Or how fast they can run when they realized they just stepped onto a trap\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing this was set up for me specifically\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWith the amount of explosives set up and flares\u2026Yes it is\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cShizu Irie\u201d He replied as he pulled out both blades <br>\r\n\u201cAmanda Juko\u201c she placed her swarm of bee\u2019s onto the ground \u201cAlso a warning\u2026\u201d The bottom of her swarm of bees had ignited and started smoking white which another hissing sound could be heard \u201cWatch where you step, or else you\u2019ll probably lose your legs\u201d Her weapon had fired and had shot out sticks of dynamite along with some white substance. When the white substance hit certain parts of the ground, it had ignited the live wires and had detonated the dynamite below ground. Around the area, it had turned into the equivalent to a mine field with multiple reactions one after another\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know he\u2019s strong, but he still is human and those are still explosives, and he isn\u2019t built like a tank!\u201d River shrugged <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not worried about him losing, I\u2019m just worried about him losing a limb, also despite you being his friend, I\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t have faith\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cLook, I do have faith, but do you even know what he has in his backpack, do you even know what his problem is?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI know that he has a crap-ton of drugs in his backpack, so is he addicted to something?\u201d She joked  <br>\r\n\u201cNot even remotely! The things he uses are strictly for combat usage-\" <br>\r\n\"Unless he's shooting it out of a dart gun, the sedative he used is not going to be that 'combat usage'\" <br>\r\n\"...Okay most of them are\"  <br>\r\n\u201cSo, what is the problem he has?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to say this, there is a specific reason why he carries all those syringes (And no it\u2019s not an addiction!) there is a specific reason why he usually leaves people with the least amount of damage, heck there is a reason for everything he does no matter what!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou intrigued me Sora, mind telling me more?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTake it up with Shizu I said enough!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back to the fight- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the smoke from the gunpowder and white phosphorous cleared up Shizu had moved far away from where Amanda was. The area where the explosions had started had reduced the once green area into a warzone in a matter of seconds. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was close!\u201d Shizu said as he gripped his jet-sword harder \u201cI\u2019m still not confident on my skills with this new blade, how did its predecessor handle such a weapon?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHey Shizu, watch where you\u2019re stepping!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Shizu looked down and saw one of the tube\u2019s sticking out. \u201cOh-!\u201d He rolled out of the way as a stream of fire came up from it. But as he rolled into a new area he was blasted back by another dynamite which apparently had a short fuse. \u201cThis place is-\u201c <br>\r\n\u201cYou know, for a person who was a wanderer, your danger instinct is surely lacking!\u201d She set up her his main weapon like a mortar and started shoving dynamite down it \u201cFire in the hole!\u201d She started firing dynamite as Shizu started running toward her, being wary of the ground and the dynamite flying toward his position. But then there was an explosion under him as he was launched back yet again into the vicinity of the dynamite launched. \u201cOh this is not even-!\u201d He ran again and was blown back by the explosion. At that point Shizu was definitely getting his butt handed to him and he was not only getting worn out, but he was receiving a lot of injuries, mostly to his legs, but overall he is getting smashed. He pulled out a couple syringes to numb the pain and increase the healing process. <br>\r\n\u201cThis woman is giving me a run for my money here\u201d He stood up and shook his head \u201cBut even so\u201d He sheathed his jetsword and pulled out something from his backpack and pointed it at Amanda \u201cShe is still not as strong as \u2018her\u2019\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cA pistol\u2026I wonder why he isn\u2019t firing yet\u201d Amanda thought as she loaded in another volley of dynamite \u201cJust in case\u2026\u201d She fired again which Shizu aimed and, despite having limited experience with guns, managed to hit 1, causing a chain reaction, but something was wrong when white substance had started to fall from the sky <br>\r\n\u201cIs that-?!\u201d Shizu ran as when the white substance hit the ground it detonated the dynamite below. Shizu didn\u2019t come out unscathed as he was hit by just a few of the \u2018white substance\u2019, but found it to be burning his skin \u201cCrap, why does she even have that?\u201d He turned around and noted the distance between him and her, which was quite far. He brought his reflection sword and gun forward which he prepared for another charge despite the continuous injuries he was sustaining. <br>\r\n\u201cI admire your tenacity swordsman, but you can\u2019t beat with that kind of instinct!\u201d She adjusted her weapon and aimed it straight into the sky \"Again with this\" Shizu thought as he ran at her, but only to be faced with her weapon splitting into two, giving it two different area's of attack \"Oh what  the heck\" She fired a volley of dynamite from the part at the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, with skill and precision, he managed to cut the fuses of the dynamite before they could explode, making them harmless. Surprised as what she saw, she slammed her swarm of bees down onto the ground and a white smoke came out of it. Before Shizu could even reach her she fired one last volley, but this was different as it was in a form of some sort of gas as when it fired it gradually covered the place in a grey smoke. Immediately Shizu put on his rebreather (Equivalent to a gasmask in this case) and put away his pistol<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of smokescreen is this?\u201d He sheathed his reflection sword and brought out his jet-sword \u201cWith this amount of smoke\u2026Wait a minute this isn\u2019t-!\u201d After realizing what this \u2018smoke\u2019 was he got on his jetsword and tried to get out of it, and while outside of the smoke-screen\u2019s range, Amanda Juko was holding a cluster of dynamite and was lighting the fuse,  <br>\r\n\u201cThe test results for your abilities, Shizu Irie, is that you failed\u201d She threw it and when it made contact with the smoke it ignited incredibly quickly and it turned into a wall of flame. While staring she just thought about certain things about her life and decided to compare to Shizu in several aspects. After snapping out of it she continued looking at the fire and thought \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I overdid\u201d She picked up her hive of bees and was about to walk away when the sound of wind blowing was heard. She looked back to see something flying from the top of the blazing fire and head toward her. \u201cWhat the hell is that?!\u201d She brought out her main weapon and was about to fire, but the \u2018projectile\u2019 was too fast for her and as a last resort she used it as a shield while she used her pistol-axe to shoot the projectile coming at her. Both the main weapon and the projectile clashed with each other resulting in the weapon breaking and the projectile hitting its mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was knocked back far and then ragdolled for a little bit before stopping. The \u2018projectile\u2019 that hit her was now kneeling down, injured and burned, using his jet-sword as the only thing keeping him up and his other sword was laying down near him. Amanda looked up one last time before she noticed something off with Shizu, <br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026His life was like the others\u2026This world really is brutal\u201d The thing she noticed with Shizu was amplified by the fire going on behind him, which just died out \u201cI think I hear something hissing\u2026\u201d Before she could even react to escaping from her own trap, Shizu suddenly grabbed her and started dragging her around while running and avoiding all traps possible \u201cHey, what are you doing?!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGetting out of this area and then beating you in a place where it\u2019s more fair, you cheap little- BAH!\u201d While he was yelling at Amanda, Shizu stepped on a short-fuse dynamite trap and went flying along with Amanda \u201cHow many traps did you put in?!\u201d Shizu landed perfectly and basically just ignored all types of caution and ran at full speed, again pulling Amanda along like a ragdoll <br>\r\n\u201cThis entire valley is one giant hotspot!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me?! That was overkill!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I had to put my surplus of supplies somewhere!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you even have that much in the first place?!\u201d Then out of all of the places he ran into, it had to be one where there were metal tubing everywhere, which turned into a flamingo dance of death. \u201cWho in the world even thought of this?!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIs this how you drag a lady around?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSaid the person who turned this place into a practical Michael Bay film! A simply match in a valley wasn\u2019t enough? The environmentalists are going to be on our cases for this!\u201d After running for quite a while Amanda made a observation, <br>\r\n\u201cWait how are you running with your injuries!?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cADRENALINE RUSH! (Also don\u2019t forget the morphine and HP+ from earlier)\u201d Shizu yelled loudly as both were yelling incoherent dialogue as they were both being overlapped by the explosions. Also two things: A lot of explosives in this valley and Shizu walked a far distance apparently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople found Shizu and Amanda, which Amanda was knocked out cold (Or should I say hot) and Shizu was on his last legs, out of stamina, and very much injured. He was considered the winner of the match and both of them were taken to the castle infirmary (What? Did you expect the ranked boundaries to be the only people to put this guy in the hospital?) Later River said, <br>\r\n\u201cHey look, he didn\u2019t lose a limb\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAt least he is in one piece\u2026I hope\u201d Sora commented <br>\r\n<br>\r\n#91: Amanda Juko <br>\r\n#90: Shizu Irie <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see his true strength if he knows you are strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Like I said, he has a large array of throwing weaponry, but be warned, he is a deadly one and is the first person that will be fought if you pick free-world <br>\r\n-Electrical blades that will either have a electrical AOE release or stunning effect depending if it makes impact or not<br>\r\n-Explosive blades that either will have a fragmentation effect <br>\r\n-Poison blades that either poison you, wearing you down, or paralyze you<br>\r\n-Standard blades that's only effect is cutting you and being stuck on you <br>\r\n-Blade storm, which is Jerry's special, which he throws a storm of blades at you <br>\r\n-Grey shadow killer, another special, he disappears in a cloud of smoke and several 'smoke shadows' come out to attack you. Watch it, all of them can actually do damage and he may come in from behind for a large amount of damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Jerry Jenkins is a teacher/trainer at a combat school, and quite a ball-busting one at that with a great reputation, this man has a large reputation of breeding either well-trained fighters, which their profession massively varies, or ranked individuals. This person will not take just anyone and this person is BRUTAL in his training regiment, in fact you would probably die if you train with him. This person has a dark past which that mask hides and from what others say, he was part of an elite group of specialists of some sort, but then something happened and most of them were slaughtered with he himself being mortally wounded, though the fact that he is still standing kind of kills the mortally wounded part...Anyhow he has a lot of bad memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossible battle location: The combat school or one of his many dangerous training regiment sites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: Never fight this guy in a forest, jungle, or anyplace with lots of cover, YOU WILL BE SCREWED. </span></div></div>",

Also for the electrical attacks he either removes his gloves or sticks them into electric outlets. <br>\r\n-Electric pole, his metal pole becomes electrified which deals more damage and causes shock effect<br>\r\n-Electric pipe, his pipe becomes electrified, watch it, he can shoot from that thing, fire 'electric bombs', and the valve regulates the amount of electric output <br>\r\n-Electric wrench, ouch <br>\r\n-Electric punch, electrified unarmed attacks, ouch! <br>\r\n-Electric overload, Leo is completely engulfed with electricity and if you are carrying a melee weapon and that makes contact with his weapon it is going to be some awesome electrical light show (Though death is high, still awesome) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: This person is far from normal as he had attained a curse of a power. He continuously emits a strong electrical force so he wears special gear to keep the electricity under control. Another thing is that this person had fought local gangs as a vigilante and actually took out the largest gang around his town making a domino effect that wiped out most of the crime. Of course this man is usually hunted down by remnants of the original gangs and most have been unsuccessful. Funny enough, the place that he had made his base was originally the base of the largest gang, an abandoned power plant which for some reason has the tendency to have intense snow storms around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: You would most likely find him at the electric power plant that he lives in which is now semi-operational, just be careful of flooded electrical areas. </span></div></div>",

Also a diving knife. <br>\r\nSpecial: Effective underwater combatant <br>\r\nFact: This man is one of the most unluckiest people on the rankings list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Though best underwater, he can still kick your crap in. <br>\r\n-Trade ammunition, for the darts it can be switched from normal to poison, for the minigun rounds it can be switched from normal to incendiary to explosive. <br>\r\n-Underwater tactics: Very maneuverable, I'm just going to say that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Although he was born in Ukraine, he had never stayed in the same place for more than a year and so he continually had to lose friends for one reason or another (And he wasn't spoiled with technology so there was that) With the childhood situation out of the way we now move to his adult hood which he had joined the military. The unfortunate part happened when his plane had crashed into a swamp and he and a few others were stuck there. The most ominous part was that the swamp was filled with all kinds of creatures that want to kill them and the 'swamp guardian' that was basically what kept killing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he ended up as one the survivors of the swamp and he never returned to the military. On a side note a rescue party did come, but they all died. After he got out of the swamp he ended up working near the coast as a scavenger and, on another side note, he doesn't get a break near the coast as all kinds of crap happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: More than likely at the beach he works on, very rarely for him to be in the cursed swamped he crashed into earlier. </span></div></div>",

He would steal and kill to survive and somehow he ended up being the leader of a roving band of bandits. They eventually worked up to get supplies and the money to leave their town and out into the world to become even stronger in both their numbers and supplies (Or in this case weaponry) and then Marco encountered Franco...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranco was apart of a family of mobsters and his father, who loved him with all his heart, had taught him the family business and the art of gambling. That was where he gained his ability of throwing cards and his art of deception. But unlike Marco the mobster family had fallen and most of them died when Franco was a teenager and he was essentially drove away from his home in fear of dying. Then somehow he managed to go over sea's and into California where he had met a special friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first encounter was a fight which ended when Marco had cards in his legs and after chatting they hit it off and it turned into a very good friendship that wasn't built on deception. Speaking of, as a way to gain wealth both of them combined their powers and opened a casino with the gang being turned into dealers and guards. It went well, oh and one thing, robbing this casino is a bad idea unless you are a 1 man army. The casino along with other revenues had accumulated into a bounty and has no signs of stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Of course it would be the casino.</span></div></div>",

Whenever there is a fight this man would pick up the nearest thing to him and use it as a makeshift weapon, which was a chair, and he got into a lot of fights and so he figured that he practice using a chair and somehow he created a fighting style. As you can see of his position that style of fighting was successful. Funny enough this guy can also do many tricks with chairs whether balancing acts or some acrobatics relating to it, which this is some entertainment that one doesn't see all that much...or at least how he does it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: For whatever reason you would either find him in a furniture store or someplace with an abundance of chairs. </span></div></div>",

Usually wearing something black whether a black cloak or a black lollita dress. <br>\r\nNationality: Japanese <br>\r\nWeapon: Damascus katana, kunai, shurikens, chain blades.<br>\r\nSpecial: Turning invisible and amazing reflexes. <br>\r\nFact: Originally ranked 9th and in the original design she wasn't even in here, her brother, Kazuya Shimanouchi, was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Besides the backstabs and death from absolute nowhere...<br>\r\n-Joint-lock, throwing a kunai or shuriken into your joints to prevent movement <br>\r\n-Tainted blades, apply poison to weaponry, can cause sickness or paralysis and may result of a sword going through your throat <br>\r\n-Cloak and dagger, of course you know that Katana can turn invisible, but did you know her weapons can turn invisible? To be precise, even when she isn't invisible, her weapons can individually be invisible so basically invisible projectiles are scary. <br>\r\n-Bullet bound, she can reflect most projectiles, but not all of them so using a machine gun is perfectly fine. Thankfully she can't aim trajectory. <br>\r\n-Chained down, using the chainblades to restrict/limit your movement, the worst of it comes when they are invisible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: (Ryan) Funny enough, this man was actually hired, at one point, to kidnap Katana and take her to a certain location. Needless to say that had failed and it wasn't the brother that wrecked him, it was Katana because he had received very flawed information of her abilities which lead to his defeat and a stab to his pride. From his failure he had decided to, on his word and reputation as a mercenary, swore loyalty to her and that he will not harm her, in fact he would protect her. At first there was skepticism, but after a while that disappeared as, he may be a cold mercenary, but he is a man of his word. Here is a note on how he lost, he went in without weaponry, as he wasn't going to harm someone that looks like a little girl, and was going to do it non-lethally...as you can see this person has morals and is one of those people that does what they do to survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: (Darwin) Kazuya's best friend and, of course, one of his most trusted. This person was once a leader of a large gang, to be exact, one of their branches in Canada. He was a special gang leader as he was only there due to his leadership skills and the fact that he doesn't need protection from normal people. The day that he left was when he got a call from Kazuya for a special favor, which as being a good friend left his position of gang leader to his best friends position. Immediately after his absence the Canadian gang branch he was commanding had fallen to a small number of individuals, which it wasn't the lack of leadership, it was the strength of that group. Never the less, he was never hunted down by the international gang...as far as official records go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: (Anna) Kazuya's...eh...I guess you can say girlfriend (?). The day they met was quite a funny one to begin with. It was when Kazuya was hired to assassination someone in the woods, which it wasn't Anna, it just so happens that person he was after was in the vicinity of her. Anyhow, even with his training of being one of the best assassins that has ever lived he ended up being ensnared by one of her many traps and that led to...so many things. How she fits into all of this is when Kazuya needed people to protect her sister when he went out and...out of hesitation called Anna up. Overall in terms of protection he didn't regret it, but the moments with each other in private and public were just so...weird, yet funny, though sometimes awkward in many ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio (Katana): Interesting enough the only reason why she is an assassin is due to the family she was born in, which the family business was the art of assassination. When she was a child she had first watched her first anime and loved it when started a chain of events that involved continuously reading manga and anime for most of her spare time from childhood to the present. Also in case if you didn't notice, her growth was stunted since elementary and she has yet to...develop. Not only that, but with the combination of anime and her child-like everything this can only be described in two words, kawaii and loli. At a very young age she was introduced to the art of assassinations, which she disliked, but was forced to in fear of getting her anime and manga cut off. But then, from a certain event, she doesn't involve herself in assassinations that much anymore. </span></div></div>",

He actually wasn't crippled until some people from his past had grudges against him, ambushed him in the numbers, and broke his legs. The only reason why his wheelchair is so customized and rigged is because 'regular wheelchairs are too mainstream' plus he actually wanted to have a self-defense weapon that is inconspicuous just in case he gets attacked, which he did, also he wanted to do something like this for a long time and didn't have the drive to even bother to do it, well now he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Either still at his university or some other place. By the way his school is BOC academy. Which if you don't know is one of the 7 most prominent schools dealing with certain combat or skills, which BOC is like a insane tutorial version of combat. Which speaking of, if you see robots Chris made them. </span></div></div>",

Frequently he would dive under to look for anything of value. Time from time he would find something of value or something mysterious and would either sell to someone or just keep it for other reasons. Then one day a young girl with amnesia wandered into his cottage (By the way this is absolutely not suspicious at all, there is no way that this could lead to something bad) and out of kindness of his heart, he decided to take care of her until someone came out looking for her.

Several years later, that had all changed when someone had purchased her and she was then transferred to that person's place. At the very beginning she had feared that she was going to be treated like an object again, but fortunately the person was incredibly nice and had favored her over the others (Which she really doesn't miss anyone back at the tea house) and she had enjoyed her time in that person's home, at the very least more than the other place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso if you're wondering where in the world she got the whip...she is also a part of her master's security. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: At her 'master's' house. </span></div></div>",

Overall, how this man operates is based on a mix of being friendly and nice and being decisive and logical with his decisions on survival and if he is with others in certain situations he can help them survive as need be or straight up leave them/kill them depending on his view on them and their possible role in the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Where ever you find him, there would most likely be a disaster or some complete and utter survival death-trap. </span></div></div>",

After adulthood the group of friends were still together and had decided to become a sort of spelunking, adventuring, treasure-hunting, group of friends, that go to very dangerous places.

Kaede essentially gained her amount of skill in her spare time by throwing objects into the air and hitting them, how this works is that she tries to hit targets with those objects and with the amount of spare time she had she managed to perfect it. The reason for doing it? She was extremely bored. For Brian on the other hand, he was an aspiring demolitionist, but not for the army, more of a mercenary job, or at the very least be a very good person at destroying things. He had went to several well-known explosive experts to try and improve his skill in his art, which as you can see he was successful, but now let's see how they met in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during Christmas eve and Kaede was attempting to break her own records in an abandoned baseball field, at the same time Brian was just arriving into town because he was just walking by. Needless to say, the first time they fought they returned and received profanity and insults, and Kaede had won, they shaked on it, and they had a drink. The next day, they fought again, Kaede won again. Day after day, they would do this, and day after day, their skill will improve and so would their friendship. Then came the day that Brian won and then they started getting more serious IE started doing something productive/ bugger all and started to screwball it and do things around the place, travel a little, then screw around again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Abandoned baseball field<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Black reinforced armor which has a silver cross on the front and back of it. Also don't forget the cape, the hat, and how intimidating this person looks. <br>\r\nNationality: Slavic <br>\r\nWeapon: Custom scepter (Long-pole like weapon with spikes covering the entire handle, midway the spikes protruded the longest, the bottom part resembled mace, the top had 5 axe-shaped blades, 4 on the sides and one on top) <br>\r\nSpecial: Watch the blood frenzy, it's a killer   <br>\r\nFact: He has practiced cannibalism <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Holy blood lust<br>\r\n-Blood frenzy, releasing all his hate that manifests into a red aura that increases all physical stats <br>\r\n-Red cross, pretty much blood frenzy, except all that hate goes into his weapon which it's damage output increases drastically <br>\r\n-Blood sight, seeing more than most can see, essentially like a blood hounds nose...except in sight form. <br>\r\n-Rage, the more he is hurt the more he will hurt you <br>\r\n-Steadfast, cannot be stunned nor be interrupted, if you do manage to do either then you probably either are a walking tower, carrying a locomotive on you, or are the iron tarkus <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground: When he was young he was extremely aggressive and running away was never an option for him. So that is when his tale starts, when he joined one of Jerry Jenkins' (Ranked 101) notorious training regiments. This training regiment was different from others as it treaded grounds that are unholy to all and is extremely dangerous even for Jenkins' standards, although his trainee's were basically asking for it. It all occurred deep underground when he and a group of trainee's were wandering the deep dark winding cave, that was under a town/city that was f'd with darkness like it was a fantasy setting, when they faced the creatures they were supposed to fight. At first it was relatively easy, but then it escalated quickly when they all started to die one by one and then they all started to run away, except Borka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember when I said unholy land? Well, being trapped in here for a long expanse of time can change a person dramatically. This person had essentially turned into an embodiment of hate and blood lust and when he got out he went on a rampage and hunted down those who abandoned him in the underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to achieve his goal and later on he became an infamous killer and he had many people attempting to kill him, which failed miserably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Abandoned, dark town of death <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wearing full dark silver knight armor with the visor down, but the armor itself appears to be old and damaged by both time and fights and the affects of being in a swamp. <br>\r\nWeapon: A dreadfully enormous coarse-iron hammer and a dark silver rusted shield <br>\r\nSpecial: An immense amount of strength with an odd ability. <br>\r\nFact: Before you say that this person is evil, he does give you warnings to get out of his swamp before he comes in to slaughter you. Problem? The swamp is huge, you can get lost easily, and some people crash landed here...Yeah this person doesn't give a crap who you are and would just smash you for trespassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Although most of his abilities are most likely related to the swamp...<br>\r\n-Roots of death, roots will come up from underground, grab your legs, and would drag you under. Better be quick with the cutting! <br>\r\n-Vine-yard. vines would come and latch onto you/ getting in your way and would either result in annoying you, slowing you down, etc. <br>\r\n-Water burst, if Garfield slams his hammer down into the ground, the swamp water would forcefully burst upward and continue this pattern toward you, quite easy to dodge actually, if this makes contact you will either be forcefully dragged under with the water or be knocked back <br>\r\n-Water break, if you are too close to Garfield he will slam the bottom handle of the hammer into the ground and a wall of water would suddenly come up, this will only knock you back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning: Despite most of his fighting ability being related to the swamp, this person still has a crushing amount of skill and strength, also even while he is submerged waist deep in swamp water WITH that heavy equipment he is still fairly fast, can you imagine how fast this guy when you REALLY piss him off in a certain terrain?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground: This man's past is shrouded in complete mystery and even what he does in the swamp is speculation, but what the swamp originally had is not. The swamp that he is in was originally home to several large settlements of some sort of cult of sorts and several military outposts. Although speculation, it was believed that Garfield was either a guardian of the cult, a demonic entity summoned by the cult, or one of the tribesman guardians that were powerful and was pissed of the intrusion of the cultists and military personnel. Needless to say the last time anyone checked every single person in the swamp had either died, went missing, or got out as evidence of the abandoned settlements and outposts. It's unknown what the cultists did or what the military was even doing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years people had wandered in out of curiosity or wanted to see if anything of value was in there and most didn't come out. Also there was several reports of aircraft crashing into the swamp with many of their passengers going missing with out of all of them very few accounted made it out alive with some horrible tales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Definitely the swamp</span></div></div>",

Wearing multi-colored long-sleeve shirt, orange pants and black shoes. <br>\r\nNationality: American <br>\r\nWeapon: Ridiculously over-sized pencil, a giant-extendable-metal stick with a scalpel at the end of it, and maybe an umbrella (Do not underestimate it...Also its a combination of a sword and a gun) <br>\r\nSpecial: Single-handedly one of the most strangest fighting techniques that could ever come out of this place. Also personality and shape shifting.<br>\r\nFact: He has the following: Multiple personality disorder, heterochromia disorder, double jointed and is allergic to the sun.<br>\r\nAnother note: He changes personality when he sneezes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Fighting style that changes based on person and weapon changes. <br>\r\nOriginal personality, more for precision and defensive strategy. -Original shape <br>\r\nAggressive personality (<span class=\"cred\">Ira</span>), a lot more reckless, yet unrelenting attacks and power increase -Double-blade staff-type <br>\r\nChild-like personality (<span class=\"cyellow\">Kawai</span>) Absolutely no fighting experience what-so-ever -Literally just a stick...Would you attack her?<br>\r\nLazy personality (<span class=\"cgreen\">Samakoro</span></span>), overall more dodge and evasion moveset, but watch it if you piss him off while he's asleep. -Staff shaped <br>\r\nOlder figure personality (<span class=\"clgrey\">Alter</span>) Overall a lot more skill and discipline -Sword-sized <br>\r\nPsychopath personality (<span class=\"cindigo\">Kuroshi</span>), the most unpredictable and dangerous -Knife sized (May have 2 of the) <br>\r\nNeedy personality (<span class=\"clilac\">Yokai  </span>) Moreover, will not stay off your arse while attacking (Unrelenting) - Extendable mode <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground: Even when he was a child he was a complete shut-in and very anti-social. From his childhood until his teenage years, all he did inside was interact with his own multiple personalities, draw pictures, read books, write literature, tried his hand in manga and spent much time watching whatever interested him, which was anime. Now he has gained a reputation with how great his art and literature is. Aside from his success, he himself hardly has any social skills nor any life skills (Yet his other personalities actually know some, so he let's them handle it, for the most part) he is also labeled 'not even human' by many people, but those who encounter him first hand and actually interact are his closest friends. Also he lives by himself (Sort of) and he usually sits in a dark room all day and night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing to know is, with all that time he had become a very philosophical person and has been incredibly brutal with his honesty, yet he still cares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more thing: <br>\r\nIra is a female who is incredibly aggressive and would tear you limb to limb to protect her and her personality comrades <br>\r\nKawai is also a female and the child of the personalities and is all that, when this person is out, expect moe and kawaii flowing out like a river <br>\r\nSamakoro is the sloth who would fall asleep anywhere, even standing up, this person really doesn't care and is good if the user has insomnia. For some reason this guy is also philosophical. <br>\r\nAlter is the military/ father figure that whips people into discipline, when he applies order, he applies it hard with a hammer. <br>\r\nKuruoshi is the bloodthirsty maniac with principles that would now come out when it is killing time...or he is bored...<br>\r\nYokai is the person that, if she likes you, will be on you like glue (Unless personalities change) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso note that his appearance changes depending on the personality that he is switched to. It can be something simple like hair color, hair style, and eye color or something complex like completely changing appearance in height, gender, etc. And because his clothing is special it may also change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: His house which also is a gallery and is 'self-sustainable' </div></div>",

At birth they were both abandoned by their parents and had gone to the same orphanage. At that orphanage is where their strong relationship and journey had begun. Near the age of 13 they had both escaped from the oppressive orphanage to live in the real world. Needless to say they both had encountered incredible hardships and worked together to be able to survive and considering where they had went, if they didn't work together they would be long dead. These two traveled far and wide and encountered many types of people, both friend and foe, and at age 18 they had returned to the orphanage for reasons unknown, but it was discovered that it was long abandoned and no one bothered to bulldoze it so they made the building as a hideout/checkpoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Old and abandoned orphanage or a castle. </span></div></div>",

Wearing brown and light-brown light weight gear and goggles. Also she has wings, but it is not controlled with her spine or mind, it's with one hand on the handle to control complex movements with special motors and jets. Also in reality the wings are more for gliding and certain controlling. <br>\r\nNationality: UK (Generalized as heck again) <br>\r\nWeapon: Light-weight sniper rifle. Little note: Although it appears to be missing most of its parts, it still has the full capability of a regular sniper and it can be used with one hand. Custom pistol-rifle, its a pistol that can turn into a sniper rifle. But by itself the pistol has the same firepower as a sniper rifle and her last weapon is a short sword which was actually shaped from a broken long-sword, though this wasn't any other generic long-sword as its different in several ways. <br>\r\nSpecial: Flying and being a nightmare to melee users. <br>\r\nFact: Changed from Arvin to Charlotte for story reasons <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: What else can you do when one hand is on a handle and the other a gun? <br>\r\n-Spiral wing, spinning quickly to block a volley of bullets.

Unfortunately he wasn't the best in the combat field, at first, as he would shake with his gun out and he would flinch at loud noises. Normally under normal circumstances this man would've been sent out or killed the first few days if it weren't for the squad he was on.

His blades extend and slashes as you so quickly it's ridiculous, if this hits you fully it's game over, block most or some you might be okay, but either way this guy is worn out afterwards. <br>\r\n-Cold cut, a cold-bladed attack that freezes you at the core...figuratively of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory (Sasha Pajari) : Well two things 1: She's an ex-Russian soldier 2: She is a Russian soldier who likes anime. Though the only thing to go off of her military service is that she hated the living crap out of some of the men there. Another thing to go off of is how she even liked anime to begin with...well the only thing I have to say about that is that there was a soldier there that was a god at smuggling things and it just so happened anime was his hobby...well that about explains it. The reason why she hides her profession from other's is because it is a bit embarrassing and may have others question her profession and her own person. Well needless to say the only thing she needs is a strong computer because having physical items of her profession is hard to hide considering who one of her friends are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alexey Kuznetsov): Was once a long guard of a giant metal wall that had separated two powers for many years. Though he may be the lone guard, because of his over-casting intimidating figure no one has dared to even look at him as his appearance alone struck fear in the people on that side of the wall. The one random thing I have to say is that this guy must be good at poker facing because even in snowstorms and blizzards he is going to stand there like nothing is going on, seriously, when does this guy eat or go to the restroom?! In other news the only reason why he moved is because Ivan approached him the minute he got into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Vera Orlov): Not only is her skill recognized by other hunters, even before the 101 was set up, she also had a very good and strong relationship with most if not all of them. So essentially the more hunters you kill the more she is going to be pissed off and aggressive when you encounter her...yeah their relationship is that great even though they are leagues apart. Also she had a passion as a bounty hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Ivan Zolnerowich): The interesting thing about Ivan is that he was once a legendary assassin known only as \"Frozen Honor\" which says two things about him, he is about as cold as them come yet he has as much honor as much as they come. Because of this man are all of these people together and near each other (Which by the way, fighting all 4 at once is going to give you hell on earth that is frozen over) Also, he has one messed up past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Russian town in the middle of who the heck knows where with a giant iron wall and bastion right at its doorstep. </span></div></div>",

Let's just say it's an impenetrable fog and you can't see crap, also he comes out of nowhere. <br>\r\n -Flying steam shield, combine the steam thrower with the gun-shield to be able to fly and use the rifle...or just use it in combo with the sword with charge attacks or dodging. <br>\r\n -Steam cloud, turn on the valves and unleash a steaming hot defensive mechanism...seriously hear the hissing sound JUST RUN, it burns a lot. <br>\r\n -Steam blast, combine the rifle and steam thrower to shoot concentrated blasts of steam<br>\r\n -Steam slasher, combine the sword with the steam thrower to deal more damage. <br>\r\n -Steam Spider: At one point he may turn to his giant mechanized spider...Warning: Can breathe fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Background: Charles is a man who is way into the steampunk genre. In fact everything he has is related to steampunk from his transport, his home, his weaponry, and most of his clothing so he is a bit of an eccentric. With his extensive knowledge of thermal conversion and engineering he successfully managed to create effective and efficient vehicles and weaponry related to steam-punk. In fact he even created his own small town which is fully functional and he is the king (That title is actually meaningless as he just did that 'for the lolz and comedic value of it) and somehow people actually joined his little town (Which is a bit bigger than what you would expect) Also, steampunk town for the win. One thing to know about this guy is that this person is one of those people that really isn't serious, which he is more free-will and optimistic with a bit of weirdness in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Battleground: At least he doesn't send his subjects to fight you, he does it himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyhow, back to seriousness, though her skills in covert smuggling and trade is legendary, some idiot gave her away and now she is on the top 10 wanted list.

Of course he has pairs of two.)<br>\r\nSpecial: He has the ability to deflect bullets and move with superhuman agility and acrobatics. He can also use acidic and electric based attacks. <br>\r\nFact: He was originally ranked 5th, his original name was john and he sounds and looks like his twin sister (Which the flat chest makes distinguishing them that much harder) Also the trap award goes to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Jade's fighting style uses his agility and acrobatics to pull off super-human fast sword slashes and stunts that seem to break human boundaries which is basically saying you are going to see a lot of spinning and ridiculous maneuvers along with a few unarmed attacks. <br>\r\n-Sinne Paus, one of his hands glow green and he just has to touch your head and you will be paralyzed completely, anywhere else stuns just that body part <br>\r\n-Grenzwert-Pause, one of his hands generate an green electric orb and when he raises it over his head a green electric tornado comes out, the drawback is a massive energy drain so his agility is temporarily reduced. <br>\r\n-Giftige Rasierer, both blades gun-parts glow green and can shoot out corrosive razors <br>\r\n-Giftige Streik, both blades glow green and can be used to strike you down physically<br>\r\n-virvlande misshandel, a inhumanely fast spinning blade attack that can be used in any situation, whether falling or an under attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Jade was born into a rich family, but due to his nature he didn't fit in to the rich life-style at all and he went off on his own at the age of 15, unfortunately for him his sister followed him mainly because she liked him a lot more than the other family members. For several years they hardly ever separated and they had survived and thrived in the real world. Within this time span they had encountered many people, some becoming friends, some enemies, and some neutral. Both of them had become incredibly skilled in fighting, but Jade surpassed farther than his sister in combat ability just for the purpose of protecting her, also he gained other skills under certain circumstances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day they had arrived at an abandoned castle, which was rather shoddy, but dang big, it was quite interesting and all kinds of crap happened. For one reason or another both had decided to stay for an extended period of time after cleaning up house. After that extended period of time, somehow, that castle became the grounds for a combat academy (Which not only became one of the best one's, but also one of the more dangerous ones as YOU DO NOT SCREW WITH THE TEACHERS) which might've been by some of the friends they had invited...Or how the guys that were there are gun-blade crazy and respected these 2 like they were the god of gun-blades, except they didn't look like they ran into a costume shop that was recently hit by paintball WWIII. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jade he didn't stay for long and he mysteriously disappeared into the world once again, this time without his sister. The last thing he left was a golden medallion of a wolf on one side and a Gemini on the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Whether the castle or somewhere else in the world, you won't find this man, he will find you, although that might take a while.</span></div></div>",

This was quite underground for the most part until there was a leak that had occurred when to many people kept disappearing due to the game's particular way of getting members to participate.

This man is extremely two-faced as he is a hit-man (And other terms like mercenary and assassin also apply) But he is also a vigilante to some degree and a bounty hunter of which all of the above he excels greatly in. Overall his own personality contrasts to the stereotype hit-man, assassin, mercenary, etc. Though he is patient and he can be a stereotype of these classes if he wants to...he just...what's the right word...yeah he just doesn't give a crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Somewhere where there is alot of cover<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That last part due to the fact that cloning has occurred and artificial humans have been recorded. But again, all speculation. One vital thing you should know is that he thinks systematically, meaning that he doesn't believe in fate, destiny, or coincidences, he only believes in chance and cause and effect. With this he is literally able to calculate paths that may occur at a ridiculous speed and technically can predict the future. What you see is life, he see's a game of numbers and equations that may occur. Though in this world, there are people who have this ability, the thing is that none of them come close to the amount of complexity or ability like this person. Essentially, this person is like a walking bio-super computer that has surpassed all of its predecessors. It's still unknown on his origins, though what he did after was quite apparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Somewhere with a lot of technology...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dimitri is known as 'the mad doctor' for the reason that he has the mind of a twisted person that is curious about many things and won't stop until his goals are met no matter what which his personality and actions to boot are something that would make many fear him as they think they would be next to be cut up. Though what all of this was merely something of his past as now he is a lot more controlled and maintained, as he isn't as mad, in fact he can be very helpful and generous, although where he works now doesn't help his reputation much. Gabriel is known for only 2 things: A fiery rage and wrath of a 1000 suns and destroying everything, now that is true to much of a degree, he literally cannot help it and ironically enough he doesn't like violence all that much...despite having the ability to bulldoze a small army with his fists only. Anyhow, both ended up being good friends after a certain event had happened which Gabriel became his guardian, Dimitri became a wandering black market doctor, and somehow they ended up becoming the heads of the largest sanitarium on the face of crazy town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Sanitarium<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well for one thing they were successful in making the vegetation become huge as heck and managed to balance out the proper physical boundaries for animals to become bigger which this woman was the very first human experiment just as a test and to satiate these scientists curiosity. Well that was successful, but then shit hit the fan and big animals broke out started going hunting season. Never the less the island was abandoned, the military decided to close the area off with some super high-tech barrier and then everyone left it alone as they don't care that much about the island.

Another note worthy thing to mention is the amount of scars, burn marks, and bandages he is wearing.  <br>\r\nNationality: European (Though obscure, you probably guess where exactly) <br>\r\nWeapon: Steampunk artillery...ALOT of heavy ordinance <br>\r\nSpecial: Engineering...very unpredictable engineering, but mostly working <br>\r\nFact: Based off of 2 people I know in real life, which 1 is a hunchback and the other being...well an engineering buff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: One thing to know is that I think there is a reason why he's a hunchback, because jaysus Christ these weapons...And this is all in the backpack that defies logic. Note that they aren't ridiculously huge. <br>\r\n-Anti-armor cannon, compact long cannon used to pierce high-armored opponents <br>\r\n-Anti-air cannons, compact dual guns aimed straight up at an angle used to take down flying opponents <br>\r\n-Anti-personal machine guns, large automatic guns used to tear you a new one. <br>\r\n-Blind-spot cannon, a special gun designed to cover for his blindspot. <br>\r\n-Steam-burst, a defensive mechanism of which detonating a device that spreads burning steam everywhere. <br>\r\n-Passive: Malfunction, sometimes the guns can jam or even fall apart, but be warned, he is prepared for something like that. <br>\r\nAnd if need be, he will carry a certain weapon with his own two hands and attack you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack-story: Ray is a bit of a double-edged sword. On one hand he is quite good at what he does, at the other hand because of his luck or due to things like a machines limit or his own little mistakes thing would occur resulting in malfunctions at the worst times possible. He has been through many types of machinery experts and master's workshops from advanced workshops to steampunk workshops which he managed to create his array of artillery. But why would he do this? It's just a hobby, nothing more, nothing less...which is absolute bull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Metal junkyards or foundries...or Steampunk city. </span></div></div>",

She really likes the flower and decides to take care of it. But eventually that flower will die as does everything else so she would get out and get another special flower. That is how her mind works, having the feeling of love then dropping it when all has been dead, but warning, even after a breakup she will still love, even with denial, there is still love.

As you can see that project had succeeded. Although, he was sold as a guinea pig, he was quite happy about his new weapon, though yet again he was used as a bodyguard.

One of them being that the armor doesn't have anything below his torso except some sort series of jets that enables him to fly (Or in this case levitate/float) There is several modifications that make it more futuristic. Plus it has 2 'wings' and 2 'tails'. Also the color of this guy's armor and weaponry are black and red. <br>\r\nNationality: ???? <br>\r\nWeapon: A giant arsenal of weapons of all kinds<br>\r\nSpecial: Ability to open pocket dimensions and pull out weapons in the droves <br>\r\nFact: He was originally ranked 2nd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Oooo, a 'walking' armory and special moves? Goodie <br>\r\n-Marked for death, when you get marked, you cannot escape nor hide. <br>\r\n-Charge, a fast charge with weapon out front, it's bad enough to get impaled, but getting slammed by this guy hurts<br>\r\n-Full-weapon assault, using all the weapons in his inventory, he uses electromagnetism and DESTORYS YOUR DAY. <br>\r\n-Over-load, breaking all boundaries, all attributes are cranked up above the limit. This is where the battle realty starts. <br>\r\n-Dimension rift, this person had the ability to open a pocket dimension and pull out weapons <br>\r\n-Bozar laser, chest opens and fires some super laser <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory: Geroy in the present is quite literally a shell of his former self. Long ago Geroy was once a legendary fighter, one of great unparalleled skill and leadership. Regarded as many as a hero with all the good he has done and is very well likable and the only reason why you would hate him is if you hate people like this. He would easily be described as your fairy tale hero...except this is real life and he is a lot better. But onto the important part, why he is like this. Well let's just say that he did combat with an opponent that was stronger than him and he was slain. Unfortunately for him he wasn't given a heroes farewell and rest, instead he was put inside a metal combat mech thing which is keeping him alive (Sort of) and now he has changed all for the worse in terms of emotion and feeling and better for combat ability.<br>\r\nWhich is absolute overkill considering he was powerful already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank 20: Hilliard Khalon <br>\r\nDescription: Also only appearing in his armor,  is basically a ridiculously big dude in black and red armor that looks intimidating as all to heck. He may as well been an entire defensive barrier <br>\r\nNationality: ???? <br>\r\nWeapon: Big high-tech gun hammer-axe. <br>\r\nSpecial: Technically, he himself is the weapon <br>\r\nFact: In the past, both of these guys apparently were mistaken for brothers...also he wasn't that huge <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Um...Defining heavy hitter <br>\r\n-Earth shatter, whether his hammer or his weight, there will be rocks flying and earth cracking<br>\r\n-gun-volley, his armor opens up with barrels coming out of him...Well crap <br>\r\n-Rocket-volley, his back opens up and small explosive projectiles come flying <br>\r\n-Big hammer-axe 'munitions: lasers, bullets, and explosives <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory: In a similar predicament as Geroy in the sense that both of them are pretty much robots now with one of the only good things about it is that they look awesome (And intimidating as all to crap) Hilliard would be easily described as a little brother in the shadow of his older brother which as much as he hated it, it was extremely justified due to their power difference. He was contrast to Geroy in many ways, but he was still good and likable, and his abilities were nothing to laugh at. Unfortunately, despite both of these powerful men being together they both fell at the hands of opponents that overwhelmed them which makes you wonder how strong that opponent was to beat the 2ND MOTHERF'N STRONGEST IN THE WORLD THAT CAN DO DIMENSION POCKET BULLCRAP. And his weaker, yet still strong subordinate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: 'Dark Age city' Or big giant temple </span></div></div>",

What was different was that this was in the confines of a well-known prison which is doubling as a secret science facility continuously experimenting on prisoners without the consent of the government and doing it to sell those people as living weapons. The special thing is that this man is used as the secret weapon incase of prisoner break-outs which happen under consent of very skilled individuals that were locked up there. Yes this man actually is necessary because this prison island has some powerful people locked up and there has been people strong enough to break out successfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Prison island </span></div></div>",

He is really a person who embraces and loves life, it's just that he not only doesn't fit in with it, everything pretty much dies around him (Sometimes literally, but mostly metaphorically) So basically everyone around him would stay very far away from him in fear of being sent into a state of depression, dying, or getting their atmosphere wrecked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is born from a family of reapers and gravekeepers.

The darklands is a special place that you can only enter when you die and in certain conditions. (Or a master at opening dimensional portals) Those conditions is when you die unfairly, from accidents that you had no apart of to illnesses that struck you down, or maybe you haven't had a fulfilled life or you still have regrets, the darklands is a place not that far researched even among the supernatural divisions of the couriers and all of this is pure assumptions and theories. One thing though is that possible conditions that doesn't allow you access when you die is, when your death was justified, suicide, and other similar terms. Yet again its just theory, but a plausible one. Another theory that seems to be confirmed is that people who survive the darklands are forgotten which seems coincides with other cases which leads to this, the development of darkland abilities. Darkland abilities are said to be related to their sin, strife, weakness or something they held very dear and at the same time they are given a curse. Killian is a prime example as he had received powers that are overwhelming, but he suffers continuously without end, both physically and spiritually, and he cannot die. But this entire thing is just a theory and it may be wrong as for the most part it has remained a mystery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Somewhere empty and desolate/void of life </span></div></div>",

He would usually combine different types of plants to create new breeds and would usually involve certain chemicals and cause unpredictable effects. Then suddenly one of his brothers was on the verge of dying from a disease that couldn't be cured. So as an experiment he decided to use one of his mutated plants that, in theory, could cure him of his disease...well nether the less he was dead wrong. Not only did his brother mutate into a plant-like creature, but this creature had the ability to mutate human beings into grotesque creatures of a very dark nature with a spore-aura that grows from a flower that this thing makes/ was the original plant that was given to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n In time this plant had spread throughout the entire town that these two lived in and it turned into a unholy land of darkness which is quite literal since a dark aura cloud has blocked all forms of sunlight. This phenomenon obviously attracted the attention of many people which the military came and blocked off all passageways and people who entered who were curious/ fight frenzied got curbstomped. (Which again at the time it was still blooming) Skipping all the details of the events that occurred in the town, a vaccine was created to combat the black aura, Ken was infected and his aura can only be suppressed (Which by now you could guess it's development) his brother was killed and this town is still a hell-hole with all military-type and anyone that can fight in general pulling out as with very few survivors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Battleground: Quarantined dark zone city. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Disruption of time can do something like making your mental function to slow down considerable and doing something like making a second to you be 5 days in real life or making the illusion that the person is teleporting when really it disrupts your mental processing. <br>\r\n.Mental nightmare; will cause you have anxiety, paranoia, and make you see things. Overall, it\u2019s like sleep paralysis, but a heck of a lot worse.<br>\r\n-Paralysis, this person can freeze your motor functions or mental functions just by staring at your eyes.<br>\r\n-Mind reader, apparently she may be able to read your mind.

This science facility was more along the lines of human augmentation in which it was the weapons department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can see from here, that was successful which of course led it to become too successful the minute that they dropped some of their guard and Einya figured out what her power was and decided to use it.

The \u2018rust\u2019 can be removed with salt-water...or salt in general. Also if he was in his prime, he would annihilate you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: <br>\r\n-Passive: Rust fog, there is always \u2018rust\u2019 coming from the person himself. What this rust does is that when bullets are coming toward him, the effectiveness of those bullets become reduced and their damage is significantly reduced. This also applies to bladed weaponry in which their edge dulls and blunt weaponry become weaker. <br>\r\n-Rust breathe, breathes out a stream of rust in which not only does it reduce the durability and effectiveness of your current equipment, it also slows you down and may also blind you.<br>\r\n-Rusted edge, his sword can render most defenses to shambles and reduce their effectiveness and durability. Though not all at once, it will do it with enough attacks. Also the damage alone\u2026<br>\r\n-Roar of rust, he yells inhumanely and a full AOE rust attack comes forth<br>\r\n-Old swordsmanship, despite his appearance, his sword style is nothing to laugh at. It involves a fair amount of heavy strikes and severe spinning attacks. If he wasn\u2019t so rusted he would be more agile and his skill set would be more open to destroying you.   <br>\r\n-Shattered armor, when his armor falls apart you see his real form. Warning, he becomes faster than he was before, meaning prepare for the final act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack-story: Randolph is no mere-human. He is simply a humanoid machine created specifically as a guardian for a certain important person. Combat-wise, Randolph was a force to be reckoned with as his strength was incredibly high, his speed was quite amazing, and his durability and resilient were ridiculous. But that is not what set him apart from others; What made him different was that the creator had given him the ability to feel emotion. This was both an experiment and a lesson to see what would occur, and what happened was a success; both the guardian and the person under guard (By the way, it\u2019s a female) had grew up. But\u2026There were complications and human fear\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to paranoia and fear combined with what Randolph was capable of, he was separated from the one he had protected for a long time. The creator had disappeared, never to be seen again or heard of again by anyone, and Randolph was afflicted with a counter to his abilities and was left in a wasteland known as \u2018The graveyard of machines\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: The graveyard of machines <br>\r\nFact for the area: This graveyard was built around a large experimental spaceship that had crash landed in a large desert. Though it\u2019s a place where one could get good loot, it\u2019s also a dangerous place with hostile robots and vise versa which is why it has mostly been left untouched by anyone of higher power.

And yes, he is a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: Mostly what weapons he has, just to clarify. <br>\r\n-Throwing weaponry: Light, small, almost undetectable to see, and their cutting edges are nothing to laugh at. <br>\r\n-Throwing weaponry list: Boomerangs, chakrams, shurikens. All different with their own abilities, they still hurt like a mother. <br>\r\n-Phantom sniper rifle: A special weapon with special ammunition, this weapon has the capability to literally ignore armor and cover yet still retain massive damage. Though its range is short, this thing doesn\u2019t give a crap what you think. This thing doesn\u2019t leave any traces of its bullets. <br>\r\n-Phantom blade: A special blade he wields. What is scary about the blade he wields is that supposedly it cannot lose its edge and it can literally slice anything in its path yet not do any type of damage...To the environment that is, if it hits a living thing\u2026well\u2026prepare to die. Note how I generalize using the word \u2018blade\u2019 this is because this blade takes several forms, but the most symbolic one is the scythe. <br>\r\n-Phantom mode: To top it all off, this man has the ability to become ethereal (Dematerializing himself to the point that he might as well be a ghost) and pass through solid objects\u2026Even more scary\u2026Wait is this guy a ghost?!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstory: Unknown origins, unknown age, unknown\u2026well essentially everything. This person is one of the most mysterious people that have ever existed and he is only known for one thing: Killing. In the underground he is feared, aboveground he is a \u2018ghost with a vengeance\u2019 personified. Funny thing is, he is no assassin, hitman, or anyone of the sort because you cannot hire him yet he kills people. The thing is that he only kills specific types of people so he doesn\u2019t kill mindlessly or indiscriminately. The people he kills are all either criminals (Who do certain things), people who have made many people suffer, and vice versa\u2026Yeah so he is basically a vigilante that will scare the crap out of you and you would prefer to die from a heart attack than from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: ???? </span></div></div>",

Of course after many failed attempts he had successfully created a special weapon that can easily outbeat available supernatural attacks and normal weaponry. Unfortunately due to one of the after affects of one of his experiments that blew up his personality has sort of turned bi-polar, so what he is a little crazy.

Even without his powers, he had great skill in his fighting ability and could easily give even the best a challenge by raw skill. But then, his story truly begins. He was hired by someone to be the guardian of Yukiko, when she was 5 years old. He was never informed of her potential power and so he wasn't prepared for what had befallen him. Before we reach that let me say this: *Insert long bonding time and adventure for about 8 years* Now onto how he got into his predicament when they entered the gallery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was the daughter of Lixue Yomohiro, who had several reputations both underground, above-ground, and with other rankers but that is for another time. Anyhow she had disappeared and under consent of the people around her, Mosianarre ended up in the mix as apparently they couldn't get anyone else who was a badass to look after her. The best way to describe her time with Mosianarre can be easy described with this: \"At first this man scared me, I didn't know who he was. But after being with him for so long I found out he had a heart and he was a better man than what he appeared to be\" <br>\r\nAnd this is Mosianarre from his side view with how he spent his time, \"Yeah, the child is sweet and all, but how does one little child cause all of this misfortune and trouble!? DAMN! Ah, at least this is interesting...I honestly didn't expect this\" <br>\r\nWell, that all changed after the art gallery mishap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay I've been mentioning the art gallery and this is what it's correlation is to both of them. When they were examining the fine arts, Yukiko had found an interesting painting. The painting had two sides of it, one being an area of gloom and doom and darkness all over with a hint of limbo and the other being magical girl fuel with light and happiness for everyone and nyan cat pooping rainbows. Well needless to say, a certain power of hers activated and Mosianarre didn't have time to counter-act the effects so both ended up being sucked into the painting which made an entirely different dimension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this dimension it was two sides of the same coin and yin-yang. Mosianarre was stuck in the equivalent to limbo while Yukiko was in paradise. After surviving his hellish nightmare in his part of the dimension he made it into the other dimension where as he couldn't move Yukiko from her spot since she was experiencing her paradise that she didn't want to end. And before you ask, he didn't want to ruin her fun because his main job was not only to protect her, but to also keep her happy, which one of his abilities kind of supported his decision, also he really didn't want to see the aftermath when he pulls her out...Seriously have you see her move-list? She could literally end the world if Mosianarre was MIA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, they aren't completely isolated from the world they have left nor are they away from each other that much. They actually do interact with each other and are still quite close. Also there are people that have the abilities available to enter their domain and both of them can interact with the world they left in certain ways. For example: Yukiko can enter dreams and Mosianarre can enter hearts. There has even been notices where people were dragged into their worlds unwittingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso another fact: Some rankers do have a relation with both people here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Darklands/ Painter World/ Another f'n dimension which the guys who found this got curbstomped in 1001 different ways.</span></div></div>",

His equipment is made out of very flexible carbon nano-tubing and other material that make this clothing as akin to high-grade armor that one would not laugh at. <br>\r\n-Reflection, with all weapons he is able to reflect back bullets and attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory: Odd thing about Vincent. There is literally no information available about his entire person whatsoever. There is no medical records, no school records, no relatives, nothing, its like he was created out of thin air.

Though these days no one knows where he really is, but what can be sure is that he is a force to be reckoned with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick note: This person bares quite a resemblance to a certain person, although this is just in writing, he does look like a certain someone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: ????? </span></div></div>",

This move is extremely dangerous and may result in serious injury or death to the user, using jet-blades to it's full power on both the attacking blade and flying blade, a giant combo of blade strikes is unleashed while going downward by gravity, with this it causes a type of wind disruption and when it hits the ground a giant spiral of wind strikes the ground with strong force that the surrounding area is slashed apart. The problem with this is that this is with the amount of force the body is put through and with the initial and aftershock strike of it which may cause instant death. This is a last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory: Kazuya was regarded as one of the strongest assassins in the underground. Considering the family he belongs to, he would be a shame to his family name if he wasn't. Overall he disliked the assassination business because he keeps getting fame and infamy from many and one of these days it will kill him and the people around him, and, in some cases, those people who don't have honor among assassins would usually go for his family members, but due to their reputation they could only go for one target, his little sister Katana that he loved dearly because everyone else in his family is a massive douche and follows the family code too closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany, many times would there be some sort of attempt in kidnapping or killing and it would be Kazuya to be there to protect her. Unfortunately he can't be with her 24/7 so, with his connections, he contacted some old friends to act as bodyguards for his sister when he was away. Which with the amount of time spent with each other *Insert friend-bonding time* it had solidified their position as bodyguards to friends guarding each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here arrives the question, why is it that Katana had taken Kazuya's spot as the 9th best fighter in the world? Well, that question can be answered on the day where everything had changed which considering the day that it had occurred it really was emotional. The day of Christmas eve...well...I guess you can say...it was a black Christmas indeed. What happened that day can be explained later on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: ???????</span></div></div>",

Wearing very odd black mask with a slit for seeing, purplish-black long-sleeve shirt with blue crystals growing out the back, black pants, shoes, and gloves. <br>\r\nNationality: ????? Is this man even human? <br>\r\nWeapon: Two red curved swords and many tools of mind trickery and bull-flop. <br>\r\nSpecial: Master of illusion, deception, mirage, and disguise. <br>\r\nFact: I had no clue where to even possibly put this guy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: <br>\r\n-Smoke and mirrors, mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the real man of them all? Watch your back to the mirror, it might be the real one. <br>\r\n-Mind trickery, something smells weird, everything seems to be bending and disorienting, what is going on? What did you do to me? And when were there 8 of you? <br>\r\n-Hypnotism, I don't think I know what I'm doing, everything seems to be going wrong...I'm stabbing Clemmons, but I feel a sharp pain in my stomach. <br>\r\n-Environmental change, it appears the air conditioner is broken, it seems hot all of the sudden, now it feels cold, now I am slipping on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory: Clemmons can be easily classified as this, an entertainer that was bored of the same old routine that he has been doing for many years, so as a first he decided to be a little bit...rough with his audience. This...roughness had turned into a blood bath as everyone had eventually killed each other and Clemmons had made his escape. Did he enjoy it? Yes he did. Was he mentally bent? Probably. Was he ever caught? No he wasn't, if anything he had disappeared since then, but news has spread of his appearances during train rides and the eventually slaughter that came afterward. Watch it when you ride the train, it might lead to hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattleground: Train </span></div></div>",

Wearing a black cloak with black-purple shirt, black jeans, gloves, and shoes. <br>\r\nNationality: Japanese <br>\r\nWeapon: Two blood-red Katana's and a jet-black Zweihander. <br>\r\nSpecial: KILLING EDGE <br>\r\nFact: His kill count is in the millions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove-set: <br>\r\n-Blood-Frenzy, his eyes glow red and he becomes physically stronger in all categories. <br>\r\n-Armed with blood wings, growing wings of a demon and quickly slash down everything in his path like they are nothing. <br>\r\n-Red damnation, slaming his blade into the ground and causing a giant release of red energy to spread in a large area. <br>\r\n-Ravage, clash his own blades together and release a multitude of slashes that goes in all directions. <br>\r\n-Curse of the demon, a legendary effect if hit with his zweihander and actually live, people who are afflicted with this have been known to have changed drastically over a short time. They go into an uncontrollable rage and destroy everything in their path until they are restrained or killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory: Saico was the result of one of the many military experiments that had taken place to create human weapons. As you can see that experiment was successful...too successful. While still under surveillance he managed to break out of the underground facility that he was being held in, but not without slaughtering everyone in his path. Later on, due to the experiments done to him, his mind had slowly begun to alter and become extremely twisted, his heart was blackening, he was beginning to develop a blood lust that was going to be well-known, his thirst for fighting had grown very far and so he had begun one of the biggest slaughters ever done by one person. How this slaughter looked like? Well...it could be easily explained by these *insert scenes here* <br>\r\n*Insert scene of an entire city burning*<br>\r\n*Insert scene of a gigantic pile of bodies, both military and civilian, with Saico standing at the top laughing maniacally* <br>\r\n*Insert scene of Saico killing soldiers in the droves* <br>\r\n*Insert scene of Saico fighting a very powerful fighter, but then kills them* <br>\r\nBecause of this man (For the most part, as there were others) was the reason the battling 101 had even begun, which it had started as 10. Because of this man had many people lives have been lost and changed forever. Because of this person, some of these people we see who are ranked and others who are unmentioned, are strong as they are now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow this entire incident had fleshed out and ended can be seen at another time or be speculated. </span></div></div>",

The reason for this is not only for their sake, it's also for your character's sake (Look at some of these people's weapons and you'll know why) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother note: Note that these are the 101 of the RECOGNIZED strongest fighters, in this world there is always going to be people stronger than what others make out to be. Heck, maybe there are people stronger than #1...But that is quite doubtful for MANY, MANY REASONS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
