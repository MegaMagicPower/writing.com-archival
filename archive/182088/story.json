These creatures do not die unless killed, so they can't die of old age and sickness. This story is set in a Medieval-ish time, so people can worship different Gods, and they could be real. What I mean by Liona having a 'gift' with immortals is that they are...nicer to her, they listen to her, and sometimes talk back, mind to mind.\r<br>\nQuickSilver is Liona's pet baby dragon, she is to young to speak mind to mind. Dragons are very magical creatures so QuickSilver is constantly experimenting with her developing magic. Queen Delia hates dragons and thinks that they are horrible bloodthristy beasts. Liona thinks the exact opposite. King Jefory is a very kind king and some times a little weird, but his heart is always in the right place.\r<br>\nWell I think that's it.</span></div></div>",

She has dirty blonde hair and blue-gray eyes. She doesn't like her step mother and her two step sisters, but tries to get along. She is the classic rebel princess, sort of. She doesn't like all to sow and doesn't like to take the etiquette classes, but she does anyway. The mystery of her long lost sister, who she can't really remember now, is always in the back of her mind, even though it's been a few years now. She still has the 'women were dresses' out look and since she's been around her step mother and sisters for so long she sort of shares their views on dragons and other immortals, though she has never really been around them to know for sure what they are like.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Liona</u> Liona is fourteen years old, and light redish-brown hair, and has blue-green eyes, like the ocean. She loves QuickSilver with all her heart. QuickSilver comes to Liona's waist. She will <i>not</i> wear a dress, she wears a shirt and breeches, no more no less. Liona lives alone with QhickSilver. She makes camp for a few weeks then moves on. She gets captured by slave traders and sold to Princess Gwen. Liona is very set in her belifes. Roylity acts this way, nobility acts this way, and commoners and servents act this way. Liona believes in the shut up and deal with it way of life. She is very smart. This is one of her many mottoes: Never mess with someone who has the power to kill you, say what they want to hear. Liona looks on the bright sides of things. Example: Someone tells Liona that if she does a certian thing she'll die, Liona would say something like 'Look at it this way, if I die you'll have one less person to look after.' \r<br>\n </span></div></div>",

Finally the slave master announces that he will bring out one more. He pulls on a rope and a girl comes out. She, like the rest, isn't wearing much. She has light reddish-brown hair that stops just above her waist. Her face is set so you can't tell what she's thinking. With her is a...dragon? Why is a dragon with this girl? The dragon has it's legs tied together, so that this girl has to carry it, and a muzzle on. It's scales are scarlet and very small bits of lighting play across it's skin.\r<br>\n\"This is Liona.

The slave master hits her hard enogh to force her to her knees.\r<br>\n\"As you can see Liona is a bit of a troublemaker, but a good whiping can fix that. The <i>dragon</i> is rather vicious, a perfact fighting dragon. Liona is a hard worker, when given a reason. Do I hear a bid?\" A few people bid back and forth.

Her head was swirling, and every bit of exposed skin stung from its mistreatment from the brush, but she pushed herself to her knees.  Her arms wobbled, and she thought for a moment that she might vomit, but both her shoulders and her stomach held.  Eventually, she raised her head and sat back on her heels.  She held her hands to her head in an effort to keep her brains from spilling from her ears, and soon the world stopped spinning and she was better able to evaluate her injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing broken, that was a good sign.  And aside from a multitude of tiny cuts and scrapes, most of which would heal in a couple days, she was fine.  She exhaled deeply and smiled, happy with the end result of remaining alive after leaping from a moving carriage.  She would freely admit that it was one of her more foolhardy gambits, especially considering the alternative was, what?  Spending her days working closely with the king?  Safely behind the impenetrable walls of the castle?  Abundant food for which she needn't beg nor steal?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Gwen remained silent for the rest of the return trip to the castle, allowing her father to ramble on without actually hearing his words.  Her thoughts revolved around that peculiar girl, Liona.  Why had Gwen selected her, of all people?  Certainly there were others with higher value than that vagabond/thief that Gwen could (and probably should) have chosen, yet the princess' attention had been unerringly drawn to the sullen Liona.  So strong was her feeling that she had purchased the girl without actually thinking it through.  On the one hand she was pleased that her father approved of her selection, but on the other she was embarrassed to seen with that repulsive girl.  Upon their arrival back home, Gwen bade her father good afternoon and made her way to her room so she could ponder her morning's adventure.  Her servants and midwives scurried nervously to and fro but she sent them away so she could be alone with her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay down on her bed and laced her fingers behind her hair as she stared out the window to watch the gusts of wind ruffle the branches of nearby trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt annoyed her that Father was less annoyed than she.  Maybe she was more fiscally responsible than The King, because he seemed unconcerned about the coin used to purchase a slave girl  that could have been better spent as garnish at a horse trough.  Gwen pursed her lips and thought, \"Just because we have the money to waste doesn't mean it is advisable to do so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and tried to convince herself that it was not important enough to get herself so worked up.  She would be better off simply forgetting about the whole ordeal.  Given time, she was sure she could become shrewd in the art of negotiations.  Today, although a complete failure in Gwen's mind, could still serve as a valuable lesson that she dare not forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust let the girl go, whatever her name was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiona.  And her intense eyes stared back at Gwen's memory with enough heat as if she sat next to Gwen on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen shivered at the thought of that wayward waif entering Gwen's Royal Bedchambers -- no doubt under the cloak of darkness with the intent to steal as much as she could carry.  Her gown suddenly grew very heavy and itchy around her shoulders.  How she loathed how Father made her dress up just to go into town!  Every one of those regal -- and expensive -- gowns that hung from her closet were about as comfortable as a fortnight spent getting drawn and quartered, and the corset she currently wore beneath her tresses proved unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrina!\"  she bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door immediately opened and a tall, thin woman appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrina, kindly undress me and remove this cursed corset.  I wish to wear something more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, ma'am.  What shall I do with the corset, milady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burn it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Gwen's dress was held together with about two hundred yards of ribbon, judging by the amount of tugging and pulling on Corrina's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nearly there, milady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is lunch.  I'll have eaten by the time you free me from these bounds, woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, milady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once the pressure was released and her lungs were free to take in oxygen unhindered once more.  The dress fell to the floor and Gwen stepped out of it.  She held up her arms and turned so that Corrina could next work on the corset.  That was a chore as well, one which strained Gwen's patience, but once Corrina pried it from Gwen's torso Gwen sighed and slipped into a rather plain-looking dress that was one of the princess' favorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat again on her bed and instructed Corrina to leave her alone until lunch; she had much to think about.</span></div></div>",

Liona, the new servent, has a strange gift with immortal creatures, dragons, orgers, fairies, and the like. So eventualy she is put to work in the dragon stables. Gwens step mother, Queen Delia, doesn't like Liona for some reason. Maybe it's because Liona has a baby dragon as a pet, or because Liona is the same age as Gwens long lost sister would be now and she almost looks like her, but no knows for sure because they don't quite remember what she looked like please please PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR IMPUT AND ADD CHAPTERS!!\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</td>",
