She's paying absolutely no attention to you. You desperately try to loosen yourself from this bind, but to little avail. You kick and cream, but she takes no notice.

This causes her to loosen her grip and suddenly you are free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are filled with joy until you look down at what looks like a six story drop. The bind was what was keeping you from falling. You quickly latch onto her toe with your two hands. Your legs and the rest of your body are dangling over the edge as your arms hold on for dear life. You attempt to push yourself up or latch your feet unto the underside of her foot, but that tickles her and causes her to wiggle her toe up and down. You left arm looses it's grip as the wiggles. You have only seconds until imminent death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well I'll see you in a few minutes. I have something to show you that you'll like...Okay, bye now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hangs up the phone and brings her foot back down unto the ground.

You fall downwards to the front and before you can climb out, she joins you. At first her toes slam you against the front wall, and then slowly slide you underneath them. With the smell and constant pressure, you don't think things could get much worse, but then she gets up and walks. Each step pushes her weight on top of you and soaks you in her sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she take you directly to see her friend or does she take a detour first?</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s a bit cubby but very beautiful. She\u2019s only five feet and three inches tall but to you she\u2019s as tall as a skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gets closer to you she realizes that you\u2019re a tiny man. You can then see an excited smile come across her face and bends down with her hand wide open to catch you. As she bends down you get a full view of her beautiful breasts and without a second thought she scoops you up and traps you in her hand. You can hear the loud booms her high heals make with every step she takes. Her grip around you in her hand is still loose enough for you to move around in and light still manages to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she walks back to her gate with you in her closed hand you can\u2019t help but notice how nice her hand smells. It smells like lavender. When she arrived back at her gate it\u2019s almost time for her plane to board. As she walks to the line to board the plane her hand suddenly opens up. You look up to see her giant face smiling down at you. She doesn\u2019t say anything to you as she doesn\u2019t want anyone to know what she found. Instead she looks down at you with her big brown eyes and a mischievous smile runs across her lips, she then picks you up with her tumb and index fingers and puts you in her...</span></div></div>",

Flying back home for winter vacation was going to be a nice change from all the hustle and bustle of school. And after this stressful situation, it would feel even better. She had passed through security with this little guy, and somehow not even drawn a look of suspicion. As she was waiting to be boarded, Megan noticed that this flight was not crowded whatsoever. She slipped her feet out of her ballet flats to let them breathe. The little guys could wait, by the looks of things, she would be alone to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story inside this woman's purse however is something else entirely. Having to sit here, surrounded by gargantuan tubes of chapstick, tampons, her wallet, phone, keys and a variety of other assorted items was uncomfortable. What was going on? Why had the TSA guys not seen him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part for you had to be the waiting and uncertainty. Time in here was hard to judge, and you had tried to move the Iphone for yourself, without any signs of success. Just waiting had to be the most boring thing to do when you were an inch tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, boarding began. Quickly counting, Megan noticed 17 people. 17 out of room for 90. When she found her seat, she was ecstatic. She could lounge out without being annoying. Before she put her purse in the overhead though, she reached in to grab little guy. When she did, she had a hard time not laughing. Just a guy looking up at her next to her tampons was pretty funny. However she knew it was no fun and scooped him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look we can talk after all the stupid stuff with the plane. I'm Megan, by the way.\" She said to you with a smile. You returned one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping me Megan, I'm -\" and you were gagged as she covered you when the stewardess walked by.

As Megan got into Camille\u2019s car you felt a hard thud as Megan put her purse in the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls talked about verious things. As they drove your anxiety rose. You knew how humiliating this was going to be. Especially given the fact you had no clothes on. You prepared for the inevitable as you heard the car stop and the engine being turned off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou again felt a sudden jolt in your leather chamber as Megan got her purse. Megan and Camille went into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this thing you want to show me so bad?\u201d Camille said sounding eager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was then a rush of light and Megan\u2019s giant hand descending into the purse to get you. Before you could get out of the way you are scooped up by her hand and surrounded my pink flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Megan opens her hand you see two giant women looking down at you. One is Megan and the other is a woman who looks to be about 26-27. She had long wavy brown hair that goes passed her shoulders. Her skin is pale and her eyes are big and brown. She is also wearing big, nerdy looking glasses. She\u2019s a little cubby and you can also see she\u2019s wearing a big round bracelet on her left hand. You look to see her staring down at you with her left hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a little man?\u201d She says softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Megan replies proudly. \u201cI found him at the airport on my way here.

She lifted you up and gently placed you on her hand. She lifts you up to where you\u2019re leveled with her giant face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a cute little thing\u201d she says as she gently pokes you in your lower chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re just staring at her, with your face as red as a tomato from the humiliation you feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww Megan he\u2019s embarrassed\u201d Camille says in a babying voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is the cutest when he\u2019s scared or embarrassed\u201d Megan said with a smile. \u201cYou should have seen him when I removed his clothes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, I wish I could have\u201d Camille says whilst looking at you with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille then proceeds to give you a long soft kiss. Her lips cover your entire body but she\u2019s careful to not  kiss you too hard to where you can\u2019t breathe. It actually feels nice. She eventually stops and you\u2019re covered in a thin layer of saliva. She giggles and wipes it off with some tissue that was sitting on the coffee table. Then, out of nowhere Camille asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I keep him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still you feel like you\u2019re in the best situation you can be in given the circumstances. You\u2019re in the care of a beautiful giantess who wants to be your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides\u201d she added. \u201cMy roommate will be home soon and I don\u2019t want her to see you while I\u2019m not around.

They might try to steal you\u201d she adds in a voice that sounds a bit like a worrying mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree that that would be the best option. With that, she gently places you in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you look so cute in there!\u201d She says with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe zips you inside, but she doesn\u2019t zip it all the way knowing that you probably don\u2019t want to be in total darkness.

You feel slight motion as Camille walks into the store and slowly walks trough the women\u2019s section of the store. You start to get really board. You can\u2019t believe you just agreed to be the boyfriend of this giant woman you just met and now you\u2019re in her purse while she\u2019s clothes shopping. After a while you feel Camille set her purse down somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly light rushes in and you see her giant hand coming towards you. Camille gently plucks you out of her purse and sets you down on some hard surface. Your eyes take a few seconds to adjust to the light but you soon realize you\u2019re in a fitting room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think sweetie?\u201d she says to you in a sexy tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her and your eyes grow wide and your mouth hangs half open. Camille is wearing a long blue dress that exposes her cleavage, black high heels, stringy silver earrings, and a long pearl necklace that goes down to her waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou-you look gorgeous!\u201d You say still stunned by what you see. \u201cAnd classy\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille picks you up and cups you in her hands and gives you a long soft kiss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll aren\u2019t you a sweetie\u201d she says still holding you in her hand close to her face. \u201cAnd such a gentleman\u201d she continues as strokes you with her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as she complements you and pets you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you dressed up for\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I like to dress up from time to time.\u201d She explains. \u201cPlus I figure since I\u2019m dating again I should dress up when we have romantic evenings and stuff\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her words. You see that she really likes you and cares about you. At the same time, the thought of getting back to normal is constantly in the back of your mind and it\u2019s clear Camille has no intention of helping you return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell honey I need to change and pay for all this.\u201d She says winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille slowly takes off the dress and shoes. She\u2019s only wearing her bra and underwear and you can\u2019t help but stare in awe at her. You look down to see that you have a rather noticeable erection, even at your size. She looks at you and smiles. You bashfully look away. Camille leans in close to you. So close that you can feel her hot breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t worry honey.\u201d She says playfully poking your erect penis. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be embarrassed. It\u2019s nice to have a boyfriend who thinks I\u2019m beautiful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she continues dressing, scoops you up and puts you back into her purse and she prepares to leave. As you are lowered gently in to her purse you realize you\u2019re starting to develop genuine feelings for Camille. You think she\u2019s beautiful and she\u2019s taken care of you so far, plus she took you away from Meagan who would have certainly humiliated you. Then your heart sinks as you realize your only supposed to be on loan you Camille. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when Megan wants me back?\u201d you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks out of the changing room towards the checkout, you notice she forgot to zip up her purse. It\u2019s wide open and someone could easily see you. You don\u2019t want to tell Camille because you figure that would risk getting detected. You look up to see she is waiting in the check out with her new clothes in her hand. All you can do is hope nobody sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

She slipped you into her one sock and slid you down to her feet. Suddenly you were engulfed in a putrid smell. With her feet, she inched you down underneath her sole and started pressing hard against your body. She wasn't pressing hard enough to kill you, but certainly hard enough to hurt you. Also, her sweat was starting to soak into your skin. She moves you to front foot and underneath her toes where she increases the pressure even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know when you are ready to obey me, slave. I can keep you in there all day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the television turn on. Suddenly your world rises as she lifts her foot up against the coffee table. Suddenly, the foot that was on top of you is now vertical. You start to fall as gravity kicks in. You realize that at this size that is like a few story drop, and in desperation try to grab onto the foot. The first few holds do not seem to work, but eventually you latch on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he, that tickles,\" she squeals, clearly enjoying your predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now dangling off the sole of her foot. You realize that if you climb a little more to the toes, there are some better holes. Her well pedicured feet don't have too many footholds. You start to climb, but this seems to only tickle her more and making her flinch. It's hard enough climbing but even harder when your wall keeps moving. At one point, you reach up to one hold and as you're hoisting your body up, she figdets, and you slip. You're legs and your other arm both slip from their spots, and you're left dangling from your arm. You know you have only a few seconds before you drop and must decide what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your dilemma, she asks, \"Are you ready to obey your new Mistress? We can stop this at any time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you give in to her or take the fall?</span></div></div>",

You wrapped your arms around the lower part of the sole, not going all the way around, but the furthest you could and gave it a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now a sympathy kiss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO IT!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached your mouth up to give it a kiss. It was hard to do as it smelled like salt. You closed your eyes, puckered up, and give it a little peck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of kiss was that?! I couldn't even feel it! Try again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did the same thing but held the kiss for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't feel that one either. No kiss is proper without tongue!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you pushed against the sole and stuck out your tongue, licking up and done. She groaned in pleasure and delight.

The tongue slammed you against the top of the giantess's mouth and slid you into the waiting abyss of her throat. You were drawn into her throat, kneaded downwards by her muscles. After a journey that certainly felt much longer than it must have actually been you plopped out of her constricting throat and into her stomach. It was pitch black but you could feel the fleshy walls and ceiling of your living prison, soon to be tomb. You threw yourself at a nearby wall, screaming and thrashing. As you did so...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take a good look at the giant woman who shrank you from in her hand, even with her fist closed. The woman looked like she was in her late 20s and had bright blood red hair. She wore a pair of blue sunglasses and had a tattoo of some sort over her left eye. She was also very fat, you'd say at least 400lbs with a bulging belly that made her pink tank top look painted on and a massive butt that looked as wide as she was tall and was covered in black pants. The giantess takes you to a corner where nobody could see either of you and opens her hand as she smiles down at the inch high shrunken man. \"Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum.\" She says with a giggle. You look at her and groan. \"Sorry,\" says the fat giantess. \"Couldn't resist.\" \"Why are you doing this to me?\" you ask. You then grunt because the giantess puts one of her fingers over your mouth and smirks as she wiggles her big butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh, uh,\" says the giant redhead. \"I'll tell you in due time. But first we have to get to our spot. The giantess reveals that she has several purple and polka-dotted carry-on bags and giggles as she lifts one up and unzips it. You look in worry and then the giant lady tilts her hand, causing you to slip and fall screaming into the bag. You land with a grunt on several shirts that looked too tight to fit on this giant lady and look up to see nothing but her smug face looking down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've fallen into her carry-on bag, the giantess zips you in and takes her luggage away as she hums to herself. You look around the mess of clothes and see that with the place zipped up, it's almost too dark to see. You can see several books the woman brought, all of which by big name authors as well as what looks like a rather large makeup kit. What you don't see is anything that could've been used to shrink you. You're guessing that she most likely wouldn't keep it in the same place she would keep a shrunken victim, if she even still had it on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel motion and hold on tight to one of the giantess's shirts as the carry-on bag you're on is placed with the others on a cart. You hear rolling and gulp before the luggage is put away in the cargo hold of the giant woman's plane. It isn't long before you hear an engine sound and the plane takes off. You've rode in planes before but always as a passenger. It was a scary thought that you were an inch tall and riding in a giant woman's suitcase. Speaking of which, that obese scarlet-haired giant was already in her seat (or rather <i>both</i> her seats given how large she was) and calmly listening to headphones as she is no doubt thinking on what she's going to do with you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait in the bag with the giant woman's clothes, you begin to wonder to yourself \"This woman shrank me,\" you think. \"A total stranger, yet that big cow shrank me so small she could carry a dozen of me in her mouth. But why did she do it? Heck, how did <i>she</i> shrink me? Who is this giantess?\" You sit down on a novel that had to weigh as much as a phonebook and think of three possibilities on who this monstrous behemoth lady was and what she wanted with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this woman is a witch,\" you think to yourself. \"Maybe she's a sorceress, perhaps hundreds of years old, who shrank me with a powerful magic spell. Oh my. If she <i>is</i> a witch and she's <i>that</i> powerful, maybe I'm not the first of her victims. For all I know, she could have dozens of shrunken victims in her other suitcases.\" You shiver at that idea but then you come up with another possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But on the opposite end of the spectrum,\" you think. \"That soda I drank earlier tasted funny. Maybe that woman is a mad scientist who created some kind of strange formula meant to turn people like me into insects. Maybe she needed to make sure that it worked and used me as a guinea pig as a plot to take over the world. Oh, I hope that isn't the case.\" You kick back and suck your thumb just thinking about the red-haired giantess laughing as she stomped an entire city, dressed as a queen. \"That would be horrible,\" you say to yourself. \"I hope I'm not right about that theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a spark came to you. \"I did see that giantess wearing a bunch of jewelry. She could be rich. That's it. This giant woman who shrank me, could very well be a wealthy businesswoman. Maybe she runs a big company that just developed a shrinking ray and she chose me to test it out on! That's it. Maybe she's gone into the business of selling shrunken humans, developing shrinking technology for warfare or maybe she's simply planning to shrink all her employees to save on costs.\" You bite your nails. None of the possibilities of who this strange giantess was or how she shrank you sounded pleasant to you and you were afraid of what the giant fat lady was going to do to you when she arrived. You worry so much that you scream and pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you wake you, you hear that the plane has landed and then you gulp as the giant fat redhead lady was walking up to pick up her luggage with you inside. Unbeknownst to you, you were now in...</span></div></div>",

Give it a day or two to think it over and then decide whether you want him. If not, just send him back to me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, it\u2019s just that I never had a little person like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s new doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad, but forget about that for now.

A tiny man!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAnd so young too! What a rare find!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enthusiastically picks up your jar and takes you over to Sarah humming to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you find this cutie?\u201d the woman asked Sarah while looking at you and wiggling her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend Zoey brought him in this morning. She must have caught him on her way back and vacation. She sometimes sells me little guys she shrinks when she goes on vacation.\u201d explains Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Today\u2019s my lucky day! I think I might want to buy him\u201d says the woman. \u201cWould you mind if I took him out of his jar to examine him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d replies Sarah. \u201cJust be careful with him. His type aren\u2019t common. Especially young ones.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart starts racing as the lady removes the lid and slowly tilts the jar. You slide down onto the palm of her hand. The woman sets down the jar and slowly lifts you up to her eyes. As she lifts you, you see she\u2019s wearing a dark blue tank top and a black skirt. She\u2019s wearing stylish, long, black boots, and she has above average size breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there cutie\u201d the woman says in a somewhat babying voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously tell her your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, don\u2019t be scared little guy\u201d she says in a soft tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then starts petting you with her index finger. You can\u2019t deny it feels nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just the cutest little thing!\u201d the woman says barely being able to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you see her lips pucker and before you can move out of the way the woman gives you a kiss. Her lips engulf your entire body and you gasp for breath as her soft lips press against your tiny body. Her lips move back and cover you in a layer of saliva. You are in a state of shock, the woman sees this and giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Mia, would you like to be my pet little man?\u201d she asks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are too shocked to really respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww\u201d Mia says with a fake frown. \u201cWell it\u2019s not like you have a choice\u201d she says smiling at you. \u201cYou\u2019re just too cute to pass up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia then turns her attention to Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him!\u201d Mia excitedly announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll enjoy his new home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has to\u201d Mia says giving you a playful poke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to take the jar with you free of charge?\u201d Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia thinks for a moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You realize I\u2019m horror you\u2019re in someone\u2019s luggage. As your eyes adjust to the light again you see you are surrounded by various types of women\u2019s clothing. You look down to see yourself laying on top of a bra, one that looks like it belongs to a woman with large breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can really grasp the full gravity of the situation a giant hand with painted blue fingernails reaches into the luggage and scoops you up. You then look up to see the face of a giant woman staring right at you. She appeared to be in her early to mid twenties and had striaght long red hair. She was wearing a black tank top that exposed her breasts, tight jeans, and from what you see she was also wearing running shoes. She also was wearing a big silver bracelet on her left arm. As her big blue eyes studied you a smile came across her lips. <br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there little guy\u201d she said in a sweet voice<br>\r\nYou\u2019re still in too much of a state of shock to really respond. After all you just realized you spent god knows how long in this woman\u2019s bag and now you\u2019re in the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n\u201cAwwww, you\u2019re such a cutie!\u201d She exclaimed wiggling her finger in front of you. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I caught you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait\u201d You stammer \u201cwhat do you mean caught me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI shrunk you, silly\u201d she explains <br>\r\n\u201cI bought an experimental shrink ray on my way to the airport. I am on my way home from vacation and I saw you and I thought how great it would be to have a tiny guy like you all for myself.\u201d she ended with a light poke at your tiny body. <br>\r\n\u201cThe person who sold it to me also said that the victim would be knocked out for a little while so it gave me plenty of time to put you in my luggage and take you somewhere where I can look at you with being noticed\u201d she added <br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t go with you! I\u2019m in college and I have a family! I\u2019m flying home to see them!\u201d you protest <br>\r\n\u201cToo bad little one\u201d the woman says feigning empathy \u201cyou\u2019re mine now and you\u2019re just going to have to live with that. I\u2019ll take care of you I promise\u201d with that she lifts you up to her mouth and gives you a kiss. Your entire body is covered by her lips and you\u2019re covered in her saliva. She giggled and gently dried you off with her shirt.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d You say in a shaken tone.<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really decided yet, but don\u2019t worry. I have a nice long flight to think of something.\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly a loud speaker announced the woman\u2019s flight.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s us little guy, back into my bag you go\u201d she says in a sing songy voice<br>\r\nWith that she plucks you off her palm with her fingers, drops you in her bag and zips you up. <br>\r\nYou feel the bag lift up and begin shifting again as the woman hums to herself. As you lay on the soft bed made out of her clothes you think about the predicament you\u2019re in. You think that maybe everything will be fine, she seems like a nice woman (but obviously a little nuts) who wouldn\u2019t want to hurt you. You also worry what she could do to you since you\u2019re so small and at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman makes her way onto her plane and stuffs her bag with you in it into the overhead bin above her seat. As the plane takes off you ponder your options. The zipper is close enough to try and open and you could make an escape attempt. You then think that there\u2019s really nowhere to go on a plane 35,000 feet in the air. The clothes you are laying on are also very comfy and you\u2019re tired from not being able to sleep the night before and you could use a nap, but this could be your only chance to escape this woman\u2019s clutches.<br>\r\nWhat do you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You flinch as you hear the M&amp;Ms get pulverized by her massive teeth and savored by her tongue. You can even hear a *gulp* as she swallows her snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMach dir keine Sorgen, ich werde dich nich essen\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cHeir, hab eins. Ich kann mein Haustier nicht hungern lassen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hands you an M&amp;M and sets you down on your lap. You can\u2019t help but smile, you love chocolate and you think it\u2019s pretty cool having a giant M&amp;M. The woman watches you eat your snack and giggles as she watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d You say in a shy voice with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiles back at you, once again she scoops you up in her hand and you are brought up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDu bist ganz bezaubernd!\u201d She squeals quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you several kisses that cover your entire body, eventually after about 40 seconds she relents and gives you room to breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJetzt musst du zur\u00fcck in meine Handtasche, bevor dich jemand sieht\u201d she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even at her huge size, her laugh is melodic, infectious and appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you adorable?\u201d, she says, \u201cthat is the cutest thing I have ever heard in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings her palm up so that you are at eye level with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonetheless, little dude, I think we need to establish some house rules. Firstly, I did not shrink you and I have no idea how to return you to normal size than you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact\u201d, she says, bringing her free hand up and beginning to pet you, \u201cfor all I know you could be lying to me and this is the size you have always been. Maybe you have always dreamed of being a big person like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubs her finger up and down your back. You hate to admit it but it is the most relaxing, comforting thing you have ever felt in your life. Despite yourself, you begin to groan with satisfaction. You desperately hope she does not notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecondly\u201d, she says, \u201cthe simple fact is you are not a person like me. Whether you were or you weren\u2019t in the past is by the by but people are big enough to live and move around independently and use people things without help from a big, giant woman. Whatever you are now, you definitely ain\u2019t a person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel humiliated at being dismissed like this but you are overwhelmed by just how huge Sydney is and date not say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thirdly, you need to accept that I am bigger and stronger than you and I am going to be deciding what is best for you from now on. The fact is you are going to be my pet. You can like it or not like it, you can accept it or not accept it and you can either obey me from the start or I can have fun training you to be obedient. But, whichever way, the outcome does not change. You are my pet from now on and you will be doing whatever I say. And frankly we will get on a lot better if you are positive about the experience. I don\u2019t want a pet who whines about how small they are and demands in vane to be set free. I want a pet who appreciates how cool it is to have a hot gigantic woman looking after them and keeping them safe. And I will get what I want in the end. It is just a case of how much you want to fight before you start to obey me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you say, little man, are you going to keep complaining or are you going to start enjoying being the prized pet of a gorgeous owner?\u201d</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The premise of the story is simple: While at an airport, you blank out and wake up after having shrunk to about an 1 inch tall. \"You\" are a male and in your twenties. The reason for you shrinking is unknown (unless explained in a thread). Feel free to let your imagination take you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's set up some ground rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No male interactions and no toilet (You can have a male bring a shrunken individual to a female, but keep the male interaction very brief, no more than a few sentences. Don\u2019t dwell on it.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Please make sure your post advances the story in some way, as opposed to short pointless posts like \"She smashed you, and you died.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Good grammar is preferable. Not to say, I'll hound you for having a slight mistake, but if there are so many misspelling or grammar, then it's unreadable. Also use punctuation. I don't want to sound like a perfectionist, but these things exist so that the reader can read it easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Use paragraphs breaks. This may seem like an odd rule, but I've seen too many posts in various Interactives write the whole thing as only long paragraph. It's incredibly hard to read as it is hard on the eyes. USE WHITE SPACE! It exists for a reason. Otherwise, readers have trouble following it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you have dialogue, try to make every new statement its own paragraph. That makes it easier to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Make sure to have at least 2 options for each post you make. In interactives the point is to have options, so don't force the reader to go a certain path too often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) I prefer humiliation, feet, vore, mouth play, crush, slave, and entrapment, but you don't have to follow my preferences. Make your posts your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise have fun! Don't get put off by the boring part of establishing rules: it's annoying but necessarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
