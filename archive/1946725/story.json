Meanwhile Arwen was making sure the other women and children were able to escape from the battle,\"Hurry, we must escape!\" She said to the others, but then she had remembered that she needed to head back and get something very valuable and could not fall into the hands of the enemy,\" I must go back and find the ring of air, make sure to stay on the path\" Arwen said to her friend that she would probably never see again. As she came back, she noticed that Saruman the White was interrogating her father, Elrond and asking where the ring of air is,\" Where is the ring, my old friend? You will tell me or you will die\" Saruman said. Knowing she had to be stealthy, Arwen had to sneak around to her fathers' courtiers and get the ring. When she arrived at Elrond's courtiers their were already uruks sacking the place to find the ring and these weren't regular Uruk-Hai soldiers, these were war chiefs, the strongest and smartest of the uruk army.\" Well looks like I'll have to fight them\" she said as she readied her sword. She entered the room and and killed two of the war chiefs but the third one picked her up and threw her into the war and she then found the ring and so did the uruk,\" The ring will go to lord Saruman\" the war chief said as he readied his sword and arwen did the same. They both came and the war chief knocked her sword out of her hand and then said,\" looks like I'm taking u prisoner elf\" he said to her as picked up the ring. When they arrived to Saruman they had took Elrond away to be killed,\" Did u find the ring?\" Saruman asked,\" Yes my lord and I also have a prisoner\" the war chief said as he gave saruman the ring.\" Ah isn't it the daughter of elrond\" he said to arwen,\" Saruman looking old as ever\" she said to him.\" You will be coming with us to Isengard and don't worry there's no need to kill you yet\" he said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at Isengard and Saruman was about to make a huge speech to all of the uruk-hai,\" My great Uruk-Hai army, you did well and slaughtered the elves of Rivendell and now we will have a great feast of food!\" He said to all uruks as they began to eat. Saruman then turned to Arwen and said,\"You know that they will try to eat you if you go down there\" he said to her,\" I would rather be down their than up here with you\" she said,\" so be it\" he said. Then he called the war chief over and told him,\" take her down their and tell her that she can eat, we are supposed to be sending Sauron a elvish queen\",\"Will do my lord Saruman\" the war chief said </span></div></div>",

As we all know Hobbits tend towards puting on weight rather than loosing some. So all in all it was not surprising, that after the hardship under Saruman, some Hobbits did so. Sam, Frodo, Merry and Pippin did their best to reconstruct the shire back to what it looked like before. With green hills all over and king Ellessar himself let his D\u00fanedain watch over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of the usual evenings, when five hobbits, named Merry, Pippin, Frodo, Sam and Dick sat at a table in the Green Dragon. \"Good evening guys. What can I do for you?\", asked Rose, who worked at the inn. \"We would like a beer each\", replied Pippin loud and clear. She went of. Sam turned around like hypnotized from her curly blonde hair. \"Oh, you like her, hm?\", asked Merry. Sam blushed. \"Well, pretty much\", he mumbled. Just a few minutes later, she brought their drinks. \"Here you go.\" She smiled. Sam smiled back and her heart bet faster. \"Why don't you invite her to join us?\", Pippin asked Sam. \"I think she has to work\", replied the gardener. \"Well I think we all have so much money now, we could pay her tenfold what she would get today, and none of us would notice. You are just shy\", said Merry. \"That would have been the old Samweis\", thought Sam and so he invited her to join them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the woman sat at the table. Frodo had offered her a seat next to Sam, which she gladly accepted. \"Would you like to eat and drink something?\", Sam finally asked. Rose had a meal just minutes ago, but the Hobbit next to her looked so kind, that she replied: \"Well, why not.\" He decided to impress her and so he ordered the most expensive meal available. The plate was huge and Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin all had enough before they had finished their share. Rose was stuffed as she hadn't been hungry in the first place, but had eaten either way. \"Would you like some more?\", asked Sam. He didn't wnat her to go again. \"Well, I think I'm gonna explode\", she thought to herself. But a foolish part of her remembered that Sam had paied for all of it and it would have been a shame to let it all go to waste. \"Well, why not\", said Rose and tried her best to smile at Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was half an hour later when Rosie's overstuffed belly really pushed against her robe. \"I think we're gonna leave now\", said Frodo. \"But Frodo, there's Fredegar and Tom and all the others over there\", replied Pippin, oblivious to Frodo's intentions. \"No, this table. Leave the two of them\", he whispered to Merry and Pippin and so they did. </span></div></div>",

Though now back in his lax life in the Shire he seemed to have gained back his lost pounds and then some. As he was getting ready to go take care of his garden he noticed that his belly poked out slightly from his tunic and that his belt also seemed tighter than before. Curious, Sam pulled off his tunic to get a better look at himself. He seemed to put on a decent amount of weight, he was probably bigger than he was when he went off on the journey. His belly pooled over his belly and his chest was softer as well starting to form moobs. Whenever he would move his belly would slightly jiggle. Sam brushed it off for now and put his tunic back on, he still had work to do in the garden anyway. He was sure his days as a gardener back in the Shire would help him take of a few pounds he didn't want to get to big.</span></div></div>",

No matter how many weeds he seemed to pull out it never looked like he was closer to being finished. After clearing up most of the weeds he heard his stomach growl. Which was odd for him to hear he usually didn't get hungry at this time of day. Though he gave a shrug and headed back in his home for a snack. He reached up into the cabinet and grabbed some bread. He used a bread knife and cut himself a slice to eat. As he finished that his stomach was still demanding food, he had not properly satisfied his hunger. Sam sighed and made himself another slice of bread. But of course, his stomach was still not sated. Unable to sate his hunger with a couple of slices of bread he dug into the pantry and made himself something to eat using bread, meats, and cheeses that were locked away in the pantry. As he set his plate he dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp\" Sam burped as he finally finished his meal. He almost emptied everything that was in the pantry but he didn't care his stomach was finally content and wasn't growling with hunger anymore. Though his tunic did feel tight after all that food and his belt felt a few sizes too small. He took off his tunic and loosened his belt and gave a sigh of relief it felt nice not to be constrained anymore. As he relaxed he realized his belly looked bigger than it did this morning though it was hard after his binge, which kinda annoyed him he liked it better when it was nice and soft. Wait... what was he thinking he was hoping to try and lose some weight not gain more, but then again he had always been a bit big even by Hobbit standards but it was kinda nice as well. He guessed maybe a few pounds wouldn't hurt...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam decided not to open it and just rest. He needed to digest the large quantitiy food that he just had consumed. His belly was already beginning to soften again which pleased Sam. He them heard the door open and as he lazily looked over to it he saw that it was his good friends Mary and Pippin. \"Sam?!\" They said in unison. Shocked to see the sight of their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled, \"Hey guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, you're huge.\" Pippin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled and began to rub his giant belly. \"Yes I know, but unfortunately it isn't enough.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mary said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that I've been getting fatter on purpose I kinda like just getting bigger and stuffiung myself it's well, blissful, \"Urp\" another burp escaping from Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Hobbits get closer to investigate Sam. As they get closer they truly understand just how big he's gotten. His belly was the most prominent feature he had they felt like if you stuck your hand to far in it you may lose it. During their adventures they were all to knowledgeable about beefy pectorals facing many Uruk-Hai. But now they saw two strange orbs of fat on Sam's chest. Plus they noticed his sides had this strange folds. Curious Mary grabbed them and started to shake them it caused Sams's buddy to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that feels good\" Sam says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really like getting bigger?\" Pippin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't we help you out. Mary said \"it seems that you could need some help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have a deal with the shopkeeper down the way, just grab my gold puch and pay him with whats inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" the twins said in unison. They departed the bloated Sam and headed off to gather more food for him. When they were a safe distance away Pippin blurted out \"Did you see the size of him?!\" he said bewildered. \"It's like he ate an Orc... or two\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary shrugged. \"Well I guess he must have built up an appetite, you know we did save the world after all. Can't blame him for being hungry, plus he looks kinda happy doesn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but still I still can't believe it's the same Sam that would take care of the Baggin's gardens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the twins finally made it to the market, they saw a cart full of food, they had seen nothing like it almost looked like it was a floating mess of food rather than a cart full of food, the twins realized just what they were getting into. As they paid the shopkeeper, made their way back, exhausted by the heavy load of the cart, they finally made it back to Sam's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey guys, glad you're back,\" Sam said, he hadn't moved from his spot at all. \"You can just put the cart in the pantry don't worry about it.\" As the twins did so they collapsed on the ground exhausted as they took a sigh of relief, three growls of stomachs could be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like I'm not the only one hungry,\" Sam said with a smirk.  \"Come on grab something from the pantry and join me in second breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins smiled, eager to get something to eat and be in the company of their friend, unknowing their own waistlines would expand.</span></div></div>",

Try to keep it all in the content of Middle-Earth but apart form that feel free to add whatever you want. I would be happy if you don't let the characters gain like a hundred lbs in a single chapter but keep it slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
