His friend Larry had gotten into trouble again and even though the charges weren't serious, Phoenix figured he couldn't count on Larry to <i>not</i> make it harder than it had to be. If anyone could go from petty larceny to contempt of court in under 60 seconds, it'd be him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the details, he looked to his watch and realized that his cab would be there soon. He opened the door of the agency but realized that a small cardboard package was sitting at his feet. \"Hmm? It's way too early for mail...\" he examined it for a second, but looked up to see his ride had pulled up. \"I'll read it on the way,\" he decided as he boarded the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix sat in the back, he forewent small talk to read over the instructions, telling the driver he was just reviewing case files. <i>'Body swap, possession, shape-shifting? Would be great if it was real, but it all sounds kooky.'</i> He had to admit though it'd make the trial much simpler if he could become the judge, or have his assistant take over the prosecutor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nick! Took you long enough,\" speak of the devil, Phoenix's assistant Maya was impatiently waiting for him in the lobby. Larry was sitting in the corner, seemingly inconsolable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Maya, had to look over the case files one more time,\" he replied. \"Have you gotten anything out of Larry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya rolled her eyes, \"hardly. I think his girlfriend broke up with him again? He's being difficult, and he wasn't even accused of murder this time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do we know who the prosecutor is?\" Phoenix asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen them with my own eyes, but I'm <i>pretty</i> sure I heard a whip crack outside the door,\" Maya responded with clasped hands. \"You know what that means, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh lord, not Franziska,'</i> Phoenix groaned internally. She'd do whatever it takes to get a guilty verdict, no matter petty the trial. He could only guess she was coaching witnesses right now. <i>'But I bet if I had someone on the inside, it'd be a lot easier...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha thinking about Nick? C'mon, we're partners! Don't hold out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix reached towards his pocket, considering sharing the remote with Maya (and maybe Larry), but there was always the risk it wouldn't work and he'd look 'foolish' as Von Karma might put it. If he tried one of the functions himself, like possession, there'd certainly be no risk, but it might pay off in the long run to have other people informed about it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wright, the prosecution says you have two minutes,\" a beleaguered and bruised guard informed him from a crack in the door. \"Please don't make her angrier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Phoenix! Show me what you got! Is it some sort of smoking gun? I want to know!\" Maya shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix figured that he may as well test the device now, so he decided to...</span></div></div>",

He made his way to the Prosecutor\u2019s lobby in the courthouse. As he expected, he found Franziska Von Karma. She seemed to be yelling at and whipping some poor Bailifs, she was far too busy doing that to notice Phoenix. He aimed the remote at himself and clicked the Aware Swap button; he then proceeded to aim at Franziska and once again clicked the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Phoenix was standing where Franziska was.  In his hand was a whip and standing in front of him where two scared bailiffs. Phoenix looked down at himself and was greeted by the unfamiliar chest and clothing of Franziska Von Karma, it was instantly clear that the swap had worked, Phoenix turned around, the two and began to walk toward Franziska in his body. bailiffs running away as he did. Strangely enough, Franziska seemed to be entirely calm about the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Franziska was panicking internally. She was suddenly in a different body, not only that, but she was in the body of that foolish fool of a defense attorney.  Of course, while she was panicking internally, she made sure not to show it. No matter what body she was in, she was a Von Karma and a Von Karma is too perfect get fazed by anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix walked up to her, Franziska gave a cocky grin \"Mr. Phoenix Wright, are you so sure that I will annihilate you, that you stole my body to sabotage the trial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat was dropping down Phoenix's face, while that wasn't exactly his intention, one can easily interpret it that way. \"No, not exactly.\" He began, but he interrupted himself when he noticed the remote in Franziska's hand. Thankfully, it seemed she hadn't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly? Then what was your intent? Finish your sentence, fool!\" Franziska instinctively moved her arm in a whipping motion, but there was no whip in her hand. Although there was no whip in her hand, she definitely had a grip on something. She looked at her hand and saw a remote. Franziska was no fool, she only had to read the labels on the button s to figure out that this remote was what caused the swap. \"Putting aside the 'why' for now, you can explain to me the 'how'\" She said, holding up the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sighed, he was hoping that he wouldn't have to explain the remote. He explained to Franziska how he got the remote and what each of the buttons did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska eyed the remote \"So, am I correct to assume that you used the 'Aware Swap' button to switch the two of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're right.\" Phoenix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll switch us back right away.\" Franziska said and pointed the remote toward Phoenix in her body, moved her finger to the Aware Swap button and clicked it. She then pointed the remote at herself in Phoenix's body, she was about to click the button again when suddenly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD IT!\" Phoenix shouted, he had switched into Franziska's body to give him an extra edge in the trial, if Franziska swapped them back now all he would have accomplished was telling someone else about the remote. \"Von Karma, in today's trial, we would be evenly matched.\" Phoenix bluffed \"So, how about a little challenge? You're a perfect prosecutor, but can you be a perfect defense attorney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska wasn't falling for his trap \"The Von Karma family is trained to be perfect prosecutors, defense attorneys are nothing but bugs to be crushed under our feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the only thing you're perfect at is prosecuting? You wouldn't be able to perfectly handle the jobs of the 'bugs' you step on?\" Phoenix played on her pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska wanted to say something back, but she couldn't think of anything. She wished her whip was in her hand so she could put this fool in his place. She then thought of a retort \"You think I am that foolish, Phoenix Wright? If you were in my body for the trial, you would surely take ruin the my reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix got smug and had already prepared to counter that point \"The same can be said of you. If I tried to do anything that would ruin 'your' reputation, you could easily ruin 'mine', why would I take that risk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nranziska wanted to counter his argument, but she could think of a counter. She soon gave up \"Fine, but know this. The second this trial is over, we are switching back.\" Franziska said commandingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Phoenix said as Franziska walked away. He began to read through Franziska's court record. This trial would be.....interesting to say the least.</span></div></div>",

Since the defense has failed to prove that a third party could have been present during the crime, I will now give my verdict. Mr Wright, do you have any closing statements?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska gritted Phoenix's teeth, sweat forming at her brow. She was clearly used to the Judge being on her side. Having this much onus put upon her was more than she could adapt to all at once. \"N-no. Your honor. I have no more statements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Nick! You believe me right? I was framed!\" Franziska glared at Larry in response, shutting him up instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge merely shook his head. \"With that, I declare the defendant, Larry Butz...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>\"Guilty.\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will report tomorrow for his sentence of 7 hours community service. Now if that's all then I'd like for everyone to vacate the courtroom. We have important things to get to today after all.\" 'Phoenix' begrudgingly nodded is head affirmatively as he stormed out of the courtroom and into the defendant lobby. Maya ran after him, confused at her boss's behavior. Larry trudged with them, similarly depressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay, Ms. Von Karma?\" The judge asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, your honor,\" Phoenix replied, still stunned. He was SURE that Franziska would be able to find the contradiction in the witness's testimony. He himself caught it while looking over her notes, but he wasn't in a position to call it out from Franziska's body. There was no way Franziska had let him win though - her pride would forbid that. Not to mention, she seemed very upset over losing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix mulled this over as he walked into the Prosecution's lobby, <i>'The prosecutor has it far too easy out there... my client's ought to really count their stars that they have me at their backs.'</i> He took a seat on a stray couch and awkwardly waited for Franziska to switch them back, trying to keep his hands off her as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>WRIGHT</i>!\" a shout rang out as the door slammed open. \"This is unacceptable!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPheonix's eyes popped as Franziska stomped over to him. \"W-what? I won, right? Isn't your record fine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head violently. \"No, this isn't a win. Everyone else will think you lost, but <i>I'll</i> know the truth. All this means is that now <i>you</i> have a perfect record as a prosecutor, and <i>I</i> am a complete failure as an attorney.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, that's a shame and all, but you have no one to blame but yourself. If you looked at the photo from the security footage, you would've had all the evidence you needed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to enrage Franziska even more. \"Unacceptable! I cannot let myself be outdone by you again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix felt his heart sink. \"W-what do you mean?\" he asked, rubbing the back of Franziska's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I will not switch us back until I've won a trial as a defense attorney,\" Franziska replied, arms crossed. \"I'll be keeping the remote as well, so you don't ruin my efforts. I simply can't let rest until I've proven that I am perfect in all pursuits.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You don't want to do that! After all, what if I hurt your reputation?\" Phoenix asked, trying to reason with her. \"I've never prosecuted before today, after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. My body seems to have rubbed off on you judging by your performance in the courtroom. You'll do adequately! Besides, maybe having a day to bask in perfection will do some good for you,\" Von Karma said snidely with a hand on her hip. \"Now, I'll be heading back to your office to await a case. I expect you will handle my duties in turn. Do not tell anyone of this!\" She then turned and marched out of the lobby, leaving Phoenix in total shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Phoenix rose from his seat, \"can't believe this...\" he muttered. He was going to be trapped as a woman until Karma won a case? And a prosecutor?! That device was beginning to look like a curse...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoenix couldn't believe the turn things had taken, but he knew that there was nothing he could do about it until Franziska won a trial. Well, he supposed he could forcefully take the remote back and take his body, but if he did that he would surely get a face full of whip. Being in Franziska's body for a while longer was easily the better decision here. Unsure of what to do, Phoenix began to look through Franziska's things. He found her cell-phone and a wallet with her address and car keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked through Franziska's cell-phone contacts. It was a bit of a breach of privacy, but his curiosity overpowered his morals. He wanted to know what people a so called perfect prosecutor called on a normal basis. As Phoenix looked through her numbers, he couldn't help but notice that a majority of them were just labled 'Fool' with an initial next to them. He had a pretty good guess on who 'Fool P' was. However, there were two numbers that weren't labeled fool. Miles Edgeworth and Adrian Andrews. This was understandable, Edgeworth and Franziska had a sibling relationship and if Phoenix recalled correctly Adrian and Franziska were close friends. Of course, Phoenix didn't call anyone right now. He was extremely uncomfortable in Franziska body as the trial had went on. He couldn't imagine having to act like her around people who would notice her odd behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked through her wallet next. He eyes popped as he saw the amount of money that Franziska had on her. <i>'why don't I get payed as much? I actually win these trials'</i> Phoenix thought to himself. He looked for an address, but what he found was a bit surprising. Franziska didn't have a home in town at all, not even an apartment. The address he had found was for a hotel room. <i>'Oh yeah, she doesn't actually live in the country.'</i> Phoenix remembered. Franziska is from germany, she was just often in town. But he hadn't expected that she was staying in a hotel room <i>'Actually, with all the money she makes, I shouldn't be surprised'</i> Phoenix remembered the money he had just seen in her wallet, he couldn't imagine how much she made if she carried that much on hand. Thankfully he knew where the hotel she was staying at was it was the Gatewater Imperial Hotel, which was close to his office, which also meant if something extremely important came up and they needed to swap back quickly there should be no problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix then looked through the last thing that Franziska had on her, her car keys. As Phoenix exited the courtroom he activated Franziska's car alarm and located her car. It was a rather expensive look red sports car, similar to Edgeworth's. <i>'And so the trend of prosecutor's having it better off than attorney's continues'</i> Phoenix thought Begrudgingly. He got in the car and put the keys in the ignition. Phoenix couldn't remember the last time he had driven a car. He got a small smirk on his face as he thought of the fact that now Franziska had to ride his bike home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix wondered what he should do now. His first thought was to go to Franziska's hotel room and just rest there for the day. That way, he wouldn't end up in any weird situations as Franziska, such as having to prosecute a trial against an actual defense attorney. Although, he wasn't sure if that was the best idea. Franziska was expecting him to do her job and it probably wouldn't be smart to anger her. On the other hand, he was still very uncomfortable in her body, it may be in his best interest to just stay at home and get used to the body before doing anything major.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other idea was to go down to the criminal affairs department and find out if there were any court cases to work on. Either for him to prosecute as Franziska or for Franziska to take the defense for. Either way would be beneficial, if he took a case to prosecute, he would be doing Franziska's job like she asked. <i> 'Maybe I can keep a longer perfect record than her or Edgeworth'</i> Phoenix joked to himself. If he got a case for Franziska to take the defense in, he could find an easy case for her and hopefully get out of her body as soon as possible. Of course, going by experience, the second the name Phoenix Wright was put on a case file, the case would go from easy to near impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Phoenix decided to...</span></div></div>",

If Franziska wanted to be a defense attorney, then Phoenix figured he would let her do just that. He'd take the opportunity as a day off. He'd look into finding her an easy case tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short drive, Phoenix found himself at the Gatewater Hotel. It wasn't a particularly pleasant place for him, just based on the memories he had, but he supposed he was lucky that it was right next to his office. If anything went wrong, he could rush on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the lobby, Phoenix was surprised that no one asked what he was doing there. People were usually always so distrusting of him in his old body. One of the bellboys even bowed to him as he passed! <i>'Is this because she's a prosecutor or because she has money?'</i> It was certainly a nice change of pace to be so respected. He only wished it would carry over to his real body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix made it to Franziska's hotel room without any problem. He'd been inside a Gatewater room before, but he was still surprised at how spacious it was for just being a single person's hotel room. Aside from a large bed, Franziska's room even seemed to have some furniture installed, including a nice chair, a large wooden work desk, and a bookshelf full of case files. It didn't seem standard - Phoenix had to guess that she had brought those in on her own. He could see it now; Franziska whipping some poor bellboy as he dragged that mahogany desk up the stairs. \"Just hope she tipped him well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the logistics of the matter aside, Phoenix sat down on the mattress of Franziska's bed and pulled off her heels. Those shoes had been killing him for the past hour. It was no wonder Franziska was always in such a bad mood - he couldn't imagine anyone being upbeat while wearing those. He threw her gloves away on the mattress while he was at it. After a moment of deliberation, he hiked up her skirt and pulled her stockings off her legs as well. They were far too tight for comfort! With his legs exposed, the fact that he was in a skirt was far more pronounced. He ran a hand down her leg and shivered a bit. He was getting intrusive, but it was too late for anyone to worry about that. If Franziska was worried about her privacy, she wouldn't have let him go off alone with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she wants me to be her, then I'm going to do it my own way,\" Phoenix decided as he pulled himself back to his feet. \"Not my fault her ego is so fragile...\" he reasoned as he walked over to a dresser to search for some clothes, undoing her neck tie as he went. \"Now please, please have something casual in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Phoenix, German apparently lacked a word for 'casual'. At least, that was the only conclusion he could come to after searching through Franziska's clothing. The simplest outfit he managed to piece together was a pair of maroon pants with a prim and proper white shirt - the shoulders still puffed out for whatever reason. She didn't have an flat heeled shoes, but he did manage to find a pair of sandals with some low heels. He forewent the necktie; no reason to choke himself if he wasn't on the job after all. He looked himself over in the mirror and it was clear these were only the components to what was probably a much more complicated outfit, but he was mostly just glad to find some pants. He didn't really care to dress up so complexly the way Franziska or Edgeworth did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hmm... what is Edgeworth doing come to think of it?'</i> Phoenix wondered. He and Edgeworth were friends, but they were always a bit snippy towards eachother as a rule; it wouldn't seem very professional for them to get too friendly considering they were rivals. Now he was Edgeworth's colleague though; he was basically Edgeworth's younger sister in fact! He wondered what it'd be like to pay him a visit like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to wonder how Maya and Pearl were as well. He hoped Franziska was atleast trying to act like him, but he could wager she wasn't just based on the fact that he wasn't trying very hard to act like her so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I maybe tell someone what's going on? Or at least check in? I wouldn't want my friends to be too off put by 'Phoenix Von Karma' after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Franziska's phone and her car keys, 'Franziska Wright' left the Gatewater hotel to go visit...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm sure he'll feel better and apologize after that.\" For some reason, he couldn't bring himself to explain things to Maya. He was worried she'd just laugh about him being in a woman's body, or that she'd recommend they try something reckless. He consigned himself to just having to minimize Franziska's damage until she changed them back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was just staring at Phoenix with a look of pure confusion. \"Von Karma, are you feeling alright?\" Phoenix had to admit, he wasn't exactly doing much to imitate HER either, but fair was fair. \"You're sounding very... rational.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix gave a nervous grin and waved a hand in front of himself. \"Uh, I'm just in a good mood after winning is all! You guys only see me when I lose, right? I can be really nice when I win!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya seemed to consider it for a second, still eyeing Phoenix up and down. \"Hmmm, I guess you're right actually. Come to think of it, I've never seen Phoenix lose either, aside from this one time, and that guy was actually guilty. Maybe he's just a really bad sport?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix could feel a sweat drop rolling down his face. <i>'Great, now she thinks I'm a sore loser.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I don't have anything else to do if I'm not helping him out. I should go after him!\" Maya exclaimed, pumping a fist n the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You should really just leave him alone for now. I know the feeling after all,\" Phoenix insisted. \"You know, uh, we never really talk that much Maya! How about you just ditch Phoenix for today and we go hang out. Does that sound alright?\" Phoenix asked. He was willing to do anything to keep his friends away from Franziska rampaging with his identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was taken aback at the suggestion. \"I don't know Von Karma. Uh, you seem... great, and all, but I don't think its... professional? For us to hang out together? I do work for an attorney after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly making excuses, but Phoenix knew her weakness. \"How about I buy dinner?\" he asked blankly. '<i>Atleast it won't come out of my bank account this time.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's expression instantly changed to elation, and she jumped for joy. \"That sounds great! Let's go! Where were you planning on going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix considered the landmarks around town. He just had to keep Maya busy while Franziska looked for a case right? He decided to pick someplace he knew she'd like.</span></div></div>",

You don't seem like the kind of person who enjoys the circus, Ms Von Karma.\" Maya said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Phoenix himself actually didn't have the fondest thoughts about the circus, especially after the last time he was there.\"No, I actually really like the circus, especially Big Berry Circus. A Von Karma only goes to see the greatest of performances.\" Phoenix said, he tried his best to imitate Franziska by citing her family name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was a bit skeptical, but she wasn't going to turn down both a free meal and an invitation to the circus. \"Alright, let's go!\" Maya said and grabbed Phoenix by the wrist, practically dragging him out of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Maya be the one who dragged them out, Phoenix was the one driving. \"This is a pretty nice car, Ms. Von Karma. Nick would never get something like this, he's too much of an old grump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'More like I don't get paid enough and what I do get paid goes to you and burgers'</i> Phoenix thought to himself. The car ride was relatively short and the two of them soon arrived at the Big Berry Circus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting tickets and going inside, Phoenix and Maya took their seats and watched the show. The circus was exactly how it was last time Phoenix was here. With an unfunny clown, to whom which Maya laughed at all his jokes, A ventriloquist with some serious issues, the young animal tamer, and of course, the circus' star and main attraction Max Galactica, the super star magician. Although Phoenix was bored for most of the show, he perked up and payed attention to Max and Regina. Both because of the major roles both of them had played in that case and because their acts were genuinely impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the show, Maya was clapping wildly, along with most of the audience. Phoenix stood up, sadly he hadn't brought a watch along with him, so he had no way of knowing the time, but he imagined that it was late in the afternoon. He imagined that Maya would be wanting that burger dinner around now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them made their way out of the circus, a member of the circus walked up to Phoenix and Maya. It was pretty clear that they recognized Maya from the case and wanted to talk to her. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

He's been stingy though and told me its too far and too expensive. You'd really take me there???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix gave a nod.

Let's head out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour or so later, the two arrived at the aquarium and were headed to the ticket counter. They had been chitchatting the whole way over and Maya seemed to forget she was with Von Karma after a certain point, almost treating Phoenix like he was himselft. It was a welcome relief for Phoenix, he needed SOMETHING familiar to grab onto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, your current outfit looks nice on you. You should wear pants more often,\" Maya said absently as they approached the entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks,\" Phoenix replied, a bit unsure. It was weird being complimented on your looks when you were in someone else's body. He never thought about it much, since Franziska was usually a rival, but he supposed she was actually rather attractive. Before his mind could linger on the subject, however, a loud voice broke his concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAR MATIES! WELCOME ABOARD MY VESSEL, I BE CAPTAIN JACK SHIPLEY!\" A tall, broad shouldered man stood in the middle of the building's lobby, aboard what seemed to be a small boat on wheels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! Look, a pirate Nick! Er, I mean, Franzy,\" Maya said, correcting herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh great. She's taking to Larry's nickname for Franziska too.'</i> Phoenix groaned mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen him before, he's part of the show!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I BE HEAR LOOKING FOR MORE SEADOGS FOR ME CREW! WOULD ANY OF YOU LANDLUBBERS WANT TO JUMP ABOARD AND HELP ME TAKE DOWN THAT DARNED WHALE ONCE AN' FOR ALL?\" He shouted again, gesturing widely to the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me! Me!\" One person shouted raising their hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I want to go!\" another called out, jumping up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAR, I CAN'T HEAR YOU OUT THERE! I NEED ALL YA' TO BE LOUDER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya put her hands to her face in shock, \"Franzy, he's asking for volunteers! Maybe we can be in the show?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix felt his heart sink. \"Oh no...\" He covered his eardrums as Maya raised her hands skyward and broke the sound barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"OVER HEAR! WE WANT TO JOIN!\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costumed man gave a hearty laugh. <i>\"There she blows! That lovely lady has the spirit!

Come along now, time's a'wasting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya grabbed Phoenix's hand and dragged him aboard Jack's \"boat\", which was soon wheeled off backstage. He couldn't imagine that Maya would warm up to 'Franziska Wright' so quickly! '<i>I'm far too nice... maybe I should take a cue from Von Karma next time...</i>' he thought to himself, as he was taken away.</span></div></div>",

Go to the crew's quarters and get into yer uniforms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix and Maya headed to a back room, which was filled with several pirate-like costumes and props. Phoenix looked at outfits and grimaced. He wouldn't want to be dressed up as a pirate on a normal occasion, much less dress someone else up like a pirate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking at the outfits, Phoenix looked around and to his surprise, Maya had already changed. She was dressed up as a pirate, she was even wearing an eye patch and carrying a rubber sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avast, Franzy! Be quick to change, we can't be missing the ship!\" Maya said, putting a bad pirate accent to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix chuckled a bit. At least Maya was happy, he chose a random outfit, stepped into a changing room, and began to change. Never in a million years did he imagine that he'd see Franziska Von Karma, prosecuting prodigy, dressed as a pirate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Franziska, Phoenix had to make sure that she never found out about this, he couldn't imagine what her reaction would be, but he was positive it would end in at the very least a whipping. He put on a bandanna with a skull on it and an eyepatch, hopefully no one would be able to tell that he was Franziska from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was jumping up and down with excitement. Phoenix decided to put on a show for her \"Ahoy, matey Maya, let's get to the ship!\" He said with half enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack Shipley entered the room, practically shouting \"ARE YOU TWO LANDLUBBERS PROPER SEADOGS YET?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya saluted with the rubber sword she had picked up \"Aye, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack laughed \"AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, LASS?\" He said to Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Aye Captain.\" Phoenix said, once again regretting bringing Maya to the aquarium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT, MATEYS, FOLLOW ME TO THE SHIP! WHEN THE SHOW BEGINS, JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD, OR WALK THE PLANK!\" Jack said, walking out of the room. Phoenix and Maya followed closely behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show was about to begin...</span></div></div>",

With some nudges from the crew's trained orca, he made his way to the back of the stage, dragging himself onto land where he was out of sight of the audience and could shiver himself dry elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avast! Excellent job first mate Maya! It seems that the Dread Pirate Franzy has been defeated!\" He turned to the audience at home and gave gave them some spiel about how Phoenix -who had been deemed the villain of the show - had been taken away by Ora the whale to Pirate Jail or something equally silly. The captain was very impressed by 'Franziska's' appearance, and seemed to think she was perfect for the role of villainess. Thankfully, Phoenix went to artschool long enough to be able to act his way through the show satisfactorily. Maya herself seemed so thrilled by the whole thing she nearly forgot she was spending her afternoon with Von Karma of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an attendant brought a drenched Phoenix a towel behind the stage, there was a large round of applause from the audience as Maya and the Captain finished up the show. A mass of footsteps could be heard as they were presumably funneled into a gift shop somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was impressive,\" the attendant said, in a soft voice. Phoenix turned his head to her as he dried off his hair. She was in costume as well - with a light blue shirt rolled up beneath her chest and darker blue hair that draped past her shoulders. Around her neck was an anchor necklace. \"It was... Franziska, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wright? Who told you that???\" Phoenix asked, worry in his voice. Who could possibly know? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I hear outside? It is Franziska - right? Or did you prefer Franzy?\" She seemed a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sorry, I misunderstood. Er, yeah... I'm Franziska,\" Phoenix replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extended a hand, which Phoenix hesitantly shook. \"Well, I wanted to say you did a great job! I usually have to come in to do some backup but you held your own out there. Have you acted before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was willing to bet that the answer was no for Franziska. \"No but, I uh, do a lot of public speaking at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I guess that explains it then,\" she replied. She looked back to the stage, where Maya and the Captain were making their way back to the rest. \"Well, I'll let you get changed. We should talk more afterwards though. That sound fine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" Phoenix replied, not really sure how to act he quickly scurried off to the changing room. He closed his eyes as he peeled the soaked pirate outfit off of Franziksa's body, suddenly feeling quite cold and exposed as he stood in the room still wet and nearly naked. He opened his eyes again to search for his towel and his face flushed red as he saw Franziska's body in the mirror, wearing nothing but her underwear, in a mirror before him - her hair also very messy after his time in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a high pitched yelp, he quickly clamped his eyes shut once again. \"I don't want to give her a reason to be mad at me - she's too young anyways!\" Phoenix told himself as he located the towel in the dark and quickly dried off again. The sensations were a bit much for him. He could only hope Franziska was being just as overwhelmed right now - maybe it'd push her into giving up faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with how dry he was, he quickly rushed to change into the dry clothes he brought. Getting his lower body dressed was simple enough but as he struggled to hook a bra, the door to the changing room slammed open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahoy Franzy!\" Maya shouted jubilantly, causing Phoenix to jump and drop the bra, arms akimbo as he was shocked by the sudden entrance. Maya just laughed it off, \"gee Von Karma, I never knew you had a fun side to you - we ought to let you win more often. Oh! Maybe I should go on a case with you some time instead of Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix, redder than a tomato, quickly bent down to scoop up the lost garment, facing away from Maya to preserve some sense of modesty. \"Uh, you don't have to stress so much - we're both girls here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah, you just surprised me was all,\" Phoenix murmured as he got back to the task from before. His fingers twitched with anxiety, which only made it harder to pull off, but he lucked out and heard a satisfying snap as he hooked it into place. He turned around with a sigh of relief, but as he made to grab the shirt he brought he quickly jerked his head away again as he was greeted with the sight of Maya similarly disrobing from her costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can never let her know about this,' Phoenix made a note as Maya just sorta stared at him quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay Franziska? You look really red. I'd hate to learn your good mood has just been a fever or something,\" she said bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shook a hand in front him, trying to keep up simple eye contact. \"No! Uh, not at all. I'm just, turning over a new leaf you know. Edgeworth won when he got nicer too so uh, I'm trying the same. I'm just, uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not used to having friends?\" Maya offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Sure,\" Phoenix agreed. \"So uh, just be patient I guess is what I'm saying.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it, dude!\" She replied with a thumbs up as she returned to taking off her shorts, giving Phoenix a moment to turn back around and button up Franziska's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was talking to the lady who handles the animals - Azura. She said we did great!\" Maya continued as Phoenix kept his view tilted towards the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I'm glad you had a good time too,\" Phoenix idly replied, only half paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said they're having a filming crew come by for a show tomorrow - so that they have some clips for a commercial or something. She wanted to know if we'd come back for it! I know you're working slowly at this, but what do you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's face went blank at that. <i>'No way would Von Karma ever forgive me if I did that as her. She'd probably never forgive me if she learned about the past hour or two at all, but atleast that isn't on video.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she said it'd be easy. We'd mostly just stand for most of it while she does the hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'But... if she thought I was embarrassing her she'd certainly give up this game... maybe the whip lashes would be worth the chance?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Franzy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shook his head, frizzy hair shaking about as he did. \"Uh, well Maya...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, I could be called to handle a case at any moment - I don't have time for a lark like that again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya, who had thankfully finished getting dressed by this point, pouted at this. \"Oh come on! What about law school makes you all so stodgy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix crossed Franziska's arms and shook his head again. \"Sorry, but that's how it is. You understand, right? You and er, Mr. Wright are always interrupted by cases. Right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya looked down dejectedly, \"Yeah I guess... actually, that gives me a different idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix could feel an eyebrow twitch in worry. \"W-what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya leaned forward with a wry grin, \"how about I be <i>your</i> assistant for a case? Give Nick a chance to cool down. I bet you'd win again with me! I'm the real brains of Wright and Co. after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" Phoenix replied skeptically. \"Well, Prosecutors are supposed to work with Detectives, you know that right? You're just a civilian.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya puffed up her cheeks defiantly. \"We break the rules all the time though! The police let Nick and I investigate crime scenes all the time. Honestly you'd think after this long they'd stop putting Gumshoe on Phoenix's cases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix grimaced a bit - her logic held up. <i>'Maybe I'll be better off with company anyways, and keeping Maya and Pearl out of Franziska's crosshairs,'</i> he told himself. \"...Alright, fine. You can come to my office tomorrow and lend a hand, and we'll see how things go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya smiled in delight and gave Phoenix an unexpected hug. \"I never thought you of all people would turn out to be so cool, Franziska! I'd always wanted to make more friends my age y'know. Nick and Edgeworth are nice, but they're still just old dudes. No fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm barely older than you!'</i> Phoenix shouted mentally, barely hiding the indignance on his face. Maya didn't seem to notice as she twirled around and skipped out of the room however. \"I gotta go tell Nick! I'll see you tomorrow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she really so desperate for female friends that she'd want to spend a day with Von Karma...?\" Phoenix murmured. He kinda felt bad in a way - living in Khurain Village must've limited her social life a bit. He supposed he would never have met her at all if it weren't for her older sister. \"Well, I hope she doesn't get used to it.\" </span></div></div>",

Perhaps staying in her body wasn't the smartest decision after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought about his options at the moment. Looking at the remote in his hand, he figured that he could experiment with it some more. Not only had he not tested the other buttons, but he could see what else could be done with Unaware Swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were also drawn toward his closet and it's current wardrobe. Maybe the best way to get used to his current body would be to get intimate with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Phoenix decide to do</span></div></div>",

It was the most self explanatory option and would be easy to pull off. He pointed the remote at Maya and pressed the aware swap button, registering her as the first target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You pressed the button, but nothing happened! Was the remote a dud after all?\" Maya said, a bit upset that nothing had happened yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only selected you as the first target.\" Phoenix began to explain. \"I just need to select someone else for you to swap with next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix began thinking about who to swap Maya with. He ruled himself out, the trial was about to begin and the last thing he needed was Maya taking his place for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person to come to mind was Larry, Phoenix had a feeling that Larry was going to be called to the stand. Knowing Larry, he would end up making himself look more guilty than any bit of evidence that the prosecution could present. Maybe if Maya was in Larry's body they could get a bit of an advantage, if the prosecution called Larry to the stand expecting him to incriminate himself and Maya acted like a regular person while in Larry's body, it may throw off the prosecution's plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to come to mind was the prosecutor herself, Franziska Von Karma. Franziska always put up a near perfect prosecution whenever she was on the case. Phoenix had a feeling that despite this just being a small Larceny case she would put up as much of a fight as usual. If he switched Maya with her, than he may be able to 'even' the playing field. However, this plan had one fatal flaw, Franziska being in Maya's body. Not only would they have to explain the remote to Franziska, but he would probably have to face her whip when she got back to her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother possibility that came into his mind was swapping Maya with the Judge. Phoenix doubted that Maya would like becoming someone as old as the Judge, even if it was only temporary. However, if she became the Judge, then they would be guaranteed a 'Not guilty' verdict. All Maya in the Judge's body would have to do is sit back for a while and then give the verdict when she is ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these three possibilities in mind, Phoenix chose to swap Maya with...</span></div></div>",

In a moment Larry and Maya were swapped into each other's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya let out a shriek once she noticed who she had become and began to feel herself all over. \"C'mon Nick! You could have at least put me in Von Karma's body!\" Maya said, feeling  Larry's goatee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix rubbed the back of his head. \"Well, uh, once she got back to her own body she probably would have whipped us to hell and back.\" Phoenix said, carefully choosing his words so he did aggravate Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya felt Larry's hair \"Woah! I have an even more ridiculous haircut than you now.\" Maya said than laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was going to say something back, but he was interrupted by the sound of Larry in Maya's body. Similar to Maya, he was feeling his new body all over, although he was more panicky due to not knowing how he was suddenly inside of a girl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick explanation of the remote to Larry, Larry seemed to get excited. \"Woah! So that little thing could swap bodies? Sweet! Let me try, Nick!\" Larry begged Phoenix from inside Maya's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, we have a trial to get ready for.\" Phoenix said and put the remote in his pocket. \"Maya, do you remember what Larry told us at the detention center\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya bounced up and down with glee \"Sure do, Larry was going on a date, but the girl stood him up. He was walking around town yelling aloud about stuff when he happened to stumble across the scene of the crime. When the police asked if he saw anything, he went on one of his usual rants and they arrested him because his random gibberish was suspicious!\" Maya recapped the night of the crime based on what Larry told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now just make sure you stick to that if the prosecution questions you. Don't go off on random tangents.\" Phoenix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, don't act like Larry?\" Maya questioned jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Phoenix responded to her and they both laughed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\" Larry asked. \"You have some important job for me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked to Larry. \"Uh, yeah, you, uh, have the most important job of all. You, uh, get to be my assistant for the day.\" Phoenix said to Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I won't let you down Nick! I'll do whatever an assistant does better than any assistant you've ever had!\" Larry said with a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, they were all called into the courtroom. Maya in Larry's body stood at the defendant's stand while Phoenix and Larry in Maya's body stood at the defense desk. On the opposite side of the room, Franziska Von Karma was standing at the prosecutor's desk preparing for the upcoming trial. Larry was admiring Franziska from across the room, which looked strange from Maya's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Judge came in, the trial began. \"The prosecution has provided key evidence to proving the defendant's guilt.\" Franziska explained to the court. \"To begin, the prosecution calls the defendant, Larry Butz, to the stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya in Larry's body walked up and stood calmly at the witness stand. \"Witness, explain to the court why you were out that night.\" Franziska ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya is Larry's body smiled and began to explain \"Well, I was supposed to be going on a date with a girl, but she stood me up, like most girls do.\" Maya said. Franziska and the Judge were both a bit surprised at how calm 'Larry' was acting, but said nothing of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could say anything about the testimony just given, Larry in Maya's body began shouting. \"What do you mean like most girls?! Any girl in their right mind would want to be with the Butz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Larry could say anything else, the Judge began to bang his gavel. \"Order! Ms. Fey, please refrain from any more outbursts. Defense, you may cross examine the defendant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix whispered to Larry. \"please don't say anything else like that, I don't Maya to be too mad at me for letting you into her body.\" Phoenix told Larry and then began to cross examine Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trial began to get going, Larry got bored. Trials were boring for him when he was the one on trial, they were even more boring as a bystander. As Phoenix was talking about how 'Larry couldn't have been there at that time' or something like that, Larry got an idea. He saw the remote and manual hanging slightly out of Phoenix's pocket, Maybe he could use the remote to end the trial a bit early?

What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve making some progress in training. I\u2019m up to a 35% success rate when channeling, now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, \u2018what\u2019s up with turning me into you\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! That!\u201d Maya said. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you do that!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a big old curmudgeon, that's why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Curmudgeon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! So, now, with a youthful spirit in place of your old bones, you\u2019ll learn to enjoy things more in your personal life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it didn't work. My face hurts from falling over. And my feet hurt. And my brain hurts from all the adjusting it\u2019s been doing. How do we know my brain won\u2019t reject your organs or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that was gonna happen, it would\u2019ve happened while I was possessing you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn't make me feel better at all!\u201d Phoenix said. \u201cOkay, fun\u2019s over.

What\u2019s the big problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could trip off a cliff and fall and die, for one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we don't have to go to any cliffs. Pleeeeease, Nick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you even care about my attitude, anyway?\u201d Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya scratched her cheek and looked off as she pondered the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix put a hand in his left pocket. \u201cYou don't care, do you? It\u2019s something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I pushed the button. But it\u2019s not really why I want to now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya glanced away awkwardly. \u201c...Let\u2019s just forget about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it something serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s nothing, I promise.

What\u2019s the reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya scratched her cheek, then looked back at Phoenix once she realized what was happening. \u201cWait, hold on, are you seeing Psyche-Locks right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix pulled his hand out of his left pocket, revealing the Magatama he was holding. \u201cJust one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought the powers that be are a bunch of drama queens. It really is just stupid, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lock broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the powers that be just made the Judge more patient with me, so don't worry about it.\u201d Phoenix said. \u201cAlso, four penalties, Maya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! You\u2019re the lawyer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Ready to tell me what it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026 I kind of wanted to twin for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s twinning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know. Twinning. Being twins. Going around looking like exact copies for fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, that\u2019s it!?\u201d Phoenix asked. \u201cThat was behind a Psyche-Lock!? I thought it was at least more than that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you it was nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but that almost always means it is something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn't I just say you take things too seriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Something along those lines, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya leaned forward in a smirk. \u201cOkay, now I am worried about your attitude again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a big curmudgeon, I know.\u201d Phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, a confession! I win! Now you have to do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? I don't remember making any bets!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, too bad!\u201d Maya said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun, c\u2019mon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that there\u2019s any fun to be had in \u2018twinning\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya clapped her hands together. \u201cOf course! Think of the possibilities!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could go to a costume party as alien clones, or\u2026 we could\u2026 uh\u2026 race or something and see who\u2019s got better running skills!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d win. I\u2019d keep tripping and falling over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d keep laughing and falling over, it\u2019s completely fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure any of that sounds like a good time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could play pranks on people, or something, I don't know, please?\u201d Maya suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... What kind of pranks?\u201d Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cLike\u2026 we could do that thing from the 60\u2019s cartoons where the person thinks they won a race but one of us is already at the finish line eating a cheeseburger! Or\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I get the idea, Maya.

What was that about?\" Asked Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I haven't done anything.\" Gumshoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Anyway, what brings you here, pal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't steal my lines, pal. And I should be asking the same thing to you. How come Wright's not here with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean!?\" Maya said, cheeks puffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I didn't mean anything by it. It's just, y'know. I don't think I've ever seen you without him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm alone now. So, what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speaking of being alone, who's that?\" Gumshoe changed the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that? The girl sitting there by the basketball hoop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jig was clearly up. Phoenix stood up and turned to face Gumshoe, only to get a shrill scream in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, what!? Why are there two of you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm Maya's twin sister, didn't you know? I'm... Moya Fey.\" Phoenix bluffed, confidently as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you've never heard of the famous Moya Fey!?\" Maya played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I've never heard of a Moya anything, actually. You've got a twin!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Ever since I was a baby!\" Maya bluffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As opposed to what?\" Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, well, I hope you two don't... uh... get in any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold, on. Detective,\" said Phoenix, \"I think you're hiding something from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix reached his hand into his left pocket, the sound of chains filling his ears. Gumshoe froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... why would you say that, pal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you kept changing the subject whenever Maya asked what you were doing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were more pressing matters at hand, Ms. Moya! In regards to you in particular!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Why don't you tell me now, then?\" Phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe drew silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it. I'll do better than just that. I think I know what it is you came here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, pal! There's no way you could know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You acted very unnaturally after hearing about Edgeworth's car trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're responsible for what happened to Edgeworth's car, aren't you!?\" Phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really that bad at hiding things?\" Gumshoe said, the locks breaking as he spoke. Phoenix could feel the Judge growing kinder from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you keeping that, by the way?\" Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My magatama? What do you mean?\" Phoenix asked. \"It's just in my pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have pockets!?\" Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do! Where were you keeping everything before!?\" Phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always just, kind of, kangaroo'd stuff around with the belt-thingy. How did you even find those so fast?\" Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my stuff was in them. Look, it's on the inside of the jacket bit.\" Phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... pals? I'm ready to tell you my secret, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I already figured it out.\" Phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know that, pal, but I was kinda hoping for some advice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of advice?\" Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I say to Mr. Edgeworth? He'll throw a fit when he finds out it was my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Phoenix said, \"if I were you, I'd probably just be honest with him. I'm sure he'd understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You barely even know Mr. Edgeworth! You've barely even said two words to each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not Maya.\" Phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... how can I tell the difference?\" Gumshoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea! Gimme my Magatama.\" Maya said. Phoenix obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya took the magatama on Phoenix's necklace off and put the green one in it's place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done. Perfect idea! And speaking of perfect ideas, I have an idea for talking to Edgeworth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's plan is as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep 1: Switch with Gumshoe<br>\r\nStep 2: Gumshoe goes and finds out how Edgeworth would react as Maya<br>\r\nStep 3: Decide what to do depending on his answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good, but just one question. What do you mean, switch?\" Gumshoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an explanation, Gumshoe agreed to the plan, but do they have time to pull it off, or is Edgeworth already on his way up?</span></div></div>",

If she stayed as detective Gumshoe, she could ask people whether or not they saw Gumshoe in her body. She could say that she was 'investigating a disappearance' or something like that. Too bad there wasn't a way to do that without Gumshoe's smell. \"Alright, but as soon as we see him, I'm swapping back immediately.\" She moped a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but we need to hurry up before he gets too far.\" Phoenix said. He knew that this whole 'go and prank Edgeworth' thing would somehow end in disaster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix and Maya didn't even walk halfway down the hallway before Maya began to complain about being in Gumshoe's body. \"Ugh, NIck! You have no idea how hard it is to be in a body that is so different from your own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix had a bit of an angry twitch \"Trust me Maya, I know the feeling.\" He said with a bit of a grudge in his borrowed voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the end of the hallway, they saw the elevator open. waiting inside of it was Edgeworth. \"Ah, Ms. Fey. I could have sworn you ran away from the garage in tears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to spend time explaining the whole 'I'm not Maya, I'm Maya's twin sister' story to Edgeworth, Phoenix decided to just play along and pretend that he was Maya. \"Uh, yeah, I did. I actually came up the stairs after I ran from the garage\" Phoenix made up an excuse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I assume that you passed on what I said to the good detective here.\" Edgeworth inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, um, I.....forgot what you said.\" Phoenix attempted to both bluff his way out of the situation and find out exactly what Edgeworth told Gumshoe in Maya's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth raised an eyebrow \"You forgot the information that made you burst into tears and run away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, you know me. Maya 'forgetful' Fey.\" Phoenix tired to laugh it off, although that laugh was mixed with a painful grunt as Maya stomped Gumshoe's foot onto Phoenix's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth sighed \"Fine, I may as well repeat myself. The good detective is here anyway.\" He turned to Maya in Gumshoe's body. \"That car damage will cost tens of thousands to repair. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I may have to let you go.\" Edgeworth said. It seemed that Phoenix and Maya were right in their guess that Gumshoe was fired. Even then though, the fact that it was true was still shocking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix and Maya stood dumbstruck, Edgeworth walked by them. \"I expect you to bring your badge to my office in about...\" Edgeworth paused as if to think for a second \"Four hours\" He finished. As he walked by, Phoenix could have sworn he saw a slight smirk on Edgeworth's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix and Maya continued on to the elevator in silence. They just couldn't believe that this was actually happening. As they entered the Elevator, Maya took out the remote and pointed it at Edgeworth, who still had his back turned to them as he walked toward his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Phoenix exclaimed in a whisper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm teaching Edgeworth a lesson. I'm going to shapeshift him. My body's shape is still saved on the remote. I'll just change him and we'll leave using the elevator before he even knows what's happening. He can deal with being someone else while we find Gumshoe\" Maya said, angry at Edgeworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix considered letting Maya do it, just as a small bit of payback. However, something wasn't sitting right. He couldn't take his mind off of that smirk Edgeworth made and it seemed odd that Edgeworth would want Gumshoe to turn in his badge in a few hours, rather than taking it immediately. Perhaps he should stop Maya and let the situation play out naturally. At the same time though, it may be good to let Maya vent off some of her frustration, the investigation into where Gumshoe is may take longer if Maya is too busy thinking about how angry she is rather than focusing on where Gumshoe is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he decided to.....</span></div></div>",

Unless it hadn't registered to either of them, yet. The good detective was always a bit slow. But that doesn't explain the smirk. The smirk formed specifically upon Gumshoe seeing him in his current state. That means he was not only expecting it, but was happy to see it. Gumshoe must have caused this. Was it some sort of petty revenge? Was not taking his badge just then a mistake? Could Gumshoe even be trusted with a badge if he was a man willing to break the laws of the universe to turn him into someone he wasn't for petty revenge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't himself.

Maybe going out and having fun with someone who is, now, close to your age will loosen you up a bit.\" Kay stated her plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I have already decided that I am going to wait here in the office until Gumsho returns.\"  Edgeworth refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay got a devilish grin \"You know, security might not like it if the were told that a teenage girl was hanging around Mr. Edgeworth's office while he was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay rubbed her nose \"I'm the great Yatagarasu, and I will still that grumpiness away from you\" She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth could tell that she was serious. She probably wouldn't relent. However, he was unsure about leaving his office. He hadn't been keeping track of time since his body changed. What if Gumshoe were to come back while he was gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, he decided to....</span></div></div>",

We're going out on the town!\" Kay said, grabbing Edgeworth's now smaller hands. Edgeworth let out a groan as he was pulled out of his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way, what do I call you?\" Asked Kay as they began to make their way through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miles Edgeworth, please,\" Edgeworth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay shook her head. \"Not going to happen, buster! You're not Miles Edgeworth anymore, so I'm not calling you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do call me that, Kay.\" Edgeworth pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... who did you say you were? Maya Fey? Then it's settled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Nnngh! Fine!\" Edgeworth said. He was going to regret that decision, he thought. He shot a cold glare in Kay's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I can't believe I didn't believe you really were Edgeworth at first. Your stuffiness and chilly glare transcends your vessel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth crossed his arms. \"... Am I to take that as a compliment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course, Maya!\" Kay said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two went out for food. Kay decided that wherever they went, it had to have a vending machine with swiss rolls.  By sheer coincidence, or perhaps by the sheer power of Maya's appetite, Edgeworth felt a craving for hamburger for the first time in what might have been decades while in Maya's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too hard to find a place that suited both their needs, and as Maya's stomach filled, so did Edgeworth\u2019s brain fill with worry. Worry, primarily about what would happen if the good detective returned to his office in his absence, made him struggle to focus on the moment. Despite this, he was able to maintain a conversation. But even his worry couldn't prevent him from noticing that Kay was suspiciously intrigued with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the meal, Kay gave Edgeworth a sheepish look and quietly got his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may be honest with you, Mr. Edgeworth,\" said Kay. \"The main reason I wanted to do this whole 'going out' thing was because I was trying to make sure it really was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, that information surprised Edgeworth less than it would have had the two of them known each other for a shorter period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But here's the thing. Now that I'm fully convinced,\" said Kay, \"I think I want to hang out some more! This has been super fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, now?\" Edgeworth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do, 'Maya'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Edgeworth go against his better judgment and continue to hang out with Kay? Not a smart tactical move, but it's possible he may be having fun himself, in his own way.</span></div></div>",

Sadly, Maya's body lacked a watch. Thankfully, the eatery that him and Kay had stopped at had a clock on the wall. The time he had asked Gumshoe to eat with him was......Nearly an hour ago?! He should have expected that this would have happened, he hadn't even checked the time before he had left the office with Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he could go back to his office and check if Gumshoe was there, he knew that would be a waste of time. Gumshoe wasn't the kind of person to stand around when waiting for Edgeworth. Edgeworth had suspicions that Gumshoe had caused this transformation, and if he did then the chance that he was waiting for Edgeworth at the office was even smaller. He imagined if Gumshoe were the one to cause it, especially if the real Maya had helped him, he would want to see his handiwork or himself and go out to search town for Edgeworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth figured he'd attempt to call Gumshoe.........unfortunately it seemed that either when his body had Shapeshifted into Maya's he didn't get a copy of her phone like he got a copy of her clothes or she wasn't carrying one on her when the Shapeshift had happened. This meant that the only way he would have to contact him would be to use a spare phone he had kept at his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Kay was patiently waiting for Edgeworth to answer her. She looked eager to be around him. Even if he went back to the office and called up Gumshoe, it would be late at night by the time he made the call. Maybe it would be best to indulge to Kay's desire and spend a little more time with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Kay, I'll spend a little bit more time with you.\" Edgeworth finally replied to Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay was ecstatic. She grabbed Edgeworth and practically began dragging him out of the eatery and down the sidewalk \"Thanks so much 'Maya'! I promise, we'll so much fun, even you will have to smile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay was clearly excited. Edgeworth had a feeling that they were going to be out until she tired herself out, which knowing Kay, would be a very long time.</span></div></div>",

The odds of you not only having a twin sister that you never heard of until a few weeks ago, but that you waited a few weeks before taking her around the city are slim at best. Now, why don't you tell me who she really is?\" Edgeworth said, glaring at Maya at the end of the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Maya could say anything, Phoenix spoke up. \"Do you have any evidence that I'm not her twin sister.\" Phoenix he asked. He didn't exactly feel happy referring to himself as Maya's sister, but he wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to outwit Edgeworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth turned his glare over to 'Moya' \"No, I have no evidence to prove you aren't her twin, but I can make a simple deduction.\" He noticed the glowing Magatama that 'Moya' was wearing. He recognized the stone from that case up in the mountains \"Quite an interesting stone you have there.\" He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Magatama, all women in the Fey clan have one.\" Phoenix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I can only recall one time I've ever seen one glow.\" Edgeworth said, he then turned to Maya \"Ms. Fey, where is Wright right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick's, um, he's at the office right now!\" Maya stuttered as she thought up a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk appeared on Edgeworth's face. \"Perhaps I should give him a call, he may be able to solve this mystery.\" He pulled out his phone and dialed Phoenix's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silence, a Steel Samurai ringtone was heard...coming from 'Moya'. Edgeworth looked over at 'Moya' \"Go on, answer it.\" Edgeworth said with a confident look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked for his phone, he was surprised that he still had it at all after the shapeshift, he found it lying in Maya's sleeve, well, he found a phone there. His phone must have been affected by the shapeshift too as it was an exact copy of Maya's, but it still clearly had his number. He answered the phone \"Hello?\" he said, and his voice also came out of Edgeworth's phone's speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth hung up the phone and put it away. \"Just as I thought. So, are you two ready to tell the truth, or do I need to go even further with my deductions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this doesn't prove anything.\" Phoenix stuttered. \"If I'm not Maya's twin, then who could I possibly be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in terms of body, there's no way you can be anyone other than Maya's sister. You are completely identical to her. However, you are almost too similar to her, no matter how hard you look, there's no difference in appearance between you two. That's unnatural, even twins have slightly different appearances.\" Edgeworth began to explain. \"I have a feeling I know who you really are, but first, I'll need you to answer for why you have Phoenix's Wright's phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, he.\" Phoenix struggled to come up with an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found Nick's phone on the ground by the office earlier, so we picked it up so we can give it to him next time we saw him!\" Maya interrupted Phoenix with another lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"OBJECTION!\"</span> Edgeworth yelled. \"I caught your lie Fey, you said that Wright was in his office right now, if you picked it up outside the office, why not just go inside and hand it to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we, uh.\" Maya stuggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth interrupted. \"Now for my second question, Why do you have that Magatama?\" He said as he pointed to 'Moya'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? All Fey women have one.\" Phoenix said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, all Fey women have a Magatama, but I've seen that particular Magatama before, with Phoenix Wight. Did he drop it to?\" Edgeworth said smug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes\" Maya said, much less confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he must have gotten much more careless with his possessions since the last time we saw each other. The Wright I knew was able to hold onto that after falling into a freezing river. The only time he let go of it was when he handed it to me.\" Edgeworth pointed out another contradiction in their testimony<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Maya's were silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I continue? The only logical explanation for who you are is.....you're Phoenix Wright!\" Edgeworth finished his deduction as he pointed at Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you figure it out?!\" Maya said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only a deduction, I didn't have any real proof....until you confessed just now. So, how did you do this?\" Edgeworth asked. \"Don't try to lie, I'll figure it out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Maya come clean about the remote now?</span></div></div>",

Watching Phoenix think he was her just struck her as one of the funniest images she could even imagine! She stood behind him and cleared her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not Phoenix Wright anymore. Now, you're Maya Fey, spirit medium extraordinaire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maya' rapidly blinked. What just happened? She felt all funny, like her brain was working overtime or something. Weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around. She was standing right outside the public prosecutor's office. But why would she have come there? She wasn't planning on seeing any prosecutors, at least not that she could remember. For that matter, what did she remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could answer that question, she felt an exhale on the back of her neck, coupled with the sound of a stifled laugh. Getting kidnapped one time is enough for something like that to cause a panic, so she quickly jumped forward and spun around into a defensive position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off, cree...  huh? Aah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had turned, she saw that the supposed attacker had been none other than... herself? Upon seeing that, she fell over, bringing her full attention to what might be the weirdest outfit she'd ever caught herself wearing. Why on earth was she wearing Franziska von Karma's clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the real Maya was losing her mind. Within seconds he completely flipped out on her, fell down from surprise, and was now picking at Franziska's skirt wondering what the heck was happening. This couldn't have gone better if she'd tried! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird that 'she' seemed to forget what had happened in the last few hours, but she supposed it made sense if the remote was trying to make sense of the change in identity while the real version of her was right here. The question is, would he eventually remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maya' stood up. \"Um... hi? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm you... from the future!\" Maya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not from the future, but yeah, I'm you,\" Maya explained, stifling another chuckle. He was even talking like her! This was so weird, she loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... do you know why I'm dressed like this, or is this just a really weird day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes to both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was so weird, she wasn't sure she liked it. This other Maya seemed to not even care about what was going on. Maybe she's not trustworthy. But what reason did she have to think that? Sure, another her creeping up behind her and breathing down her neck right after she suddenly appears in front of the prosecutor's office wearing a completely different outfit from usual seemed odd, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that actually was really weird. Like, alien abduction-ey weird. Suddenly it felt like trusting this weird copy would be the less wise of the two options. But maybe it wouldn't be so wrong to at least give her a chance? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does 'Maya' do?</span></div></div>",

Or the little fool might be even angrier that the \"little girl with the whip\" was near her.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two memories were conflicting with each other. On one hand, Phoenix's memories knew Pearl loved Nick and enjoyed his company. On the other, Franziska had made a considerably bad impression on Pearls and she knew how much the little one despised the whip lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solution to the struggle was easy. As the command said: Go with the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska clapped her hands together in the best imitation of Maya she could muster. \"Just... out having fun! You know me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... but why are you wearing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErm. \"I was behaving foolishly and-\" Uh. \"My... robes got dirty, so Von Karma lended me hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an imperfect display. She felt disgust wash over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pearly seemed to buy it, a surprised look on her face. \"The one from your trials?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...she's usually so mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranzy struggled to maintain her mask. \"Well, she... has a lot on her mind sometimes! I think you two would get along if you tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hm. If you want me to Mystic Maya...\" But she seemed doubtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest to move past that. \"Why don't we get a...\" Ms. Fey was always eating so... \"A delicious snack! My treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glittered. \"Really? Thanks Mystic Maya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two ventured onward. Franzy eager to try and mentor Pearls in the \"right\" direction, unlike that silly assistant. Pearls eager to spend time with the girl she admired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they were both likely to influence each other in wildly different ways.</span></div></div>",

Every time she stumbled a bit in the heels, she'd blame her 'Foolish Fey's body,' unable to remember her lack of actual experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearls asked a lot of questions \u2014 \"What've you been eating lately, Mystic Maya? Have you helped with any cases lately? How has Mr. Nick been?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranzy tried to field the questions as best as she could \u2014 \"Double cheeseburgers!\" \"Well, that foo- Er, Larry Butz needs defending.\" \"Um, fine.\"\u2014 but the name 'Nick' seemed... familiar, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could collect her thoughts, they finally arrived at the cotton-candy stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearls' face lit up. \"Wow! I've never had cotton candy before!\"  She looked directly up at Franziska, eyes beaming. \"Thank you so much, Mystic Maya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConflicting Phoenix-feelings of affection and Franziska-feelings of mild annoyance battled inside her. Eventually, affection won out. Franzy's face softened into a smile and she rubbed Pearl's head fondly. \"It's no problem, P-pearls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying the exorbitant price for two cotton candies \u2014 and shooting the cashier an evil eye when Pearl's back was turned \u2014 they sat at a small table to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska managed to finish off her cotton-candy in a time comparable to Maya, an effort that left her clutching her stomach a bit. Still, she didn't let it show on her face \u2014 that wouldn't really be 'going with the flow' now, would it? All the while, Pearl was eating her cotton candy slower, half trying to be polite, half speeding up in order to imitate Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">(The girl is rather cute, now.)</span> Franzy thought to herself. <span class=\"cpblue\">(Still, she could be remedied of some of her.. imperfect notions.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, P-Pearly.\" she stuttered, Maya's nickname for her unfamiliar on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl looked up from her cotton candy questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about, um, 'Special Someones'. Don't you think you're a little too ol\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl cut her off excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you have? Isn't it so <i>nice</i>? Someone who loves you so much, they'll do anything for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, howe\u2014\" Franziska tried to get a word in edgewise, but Pearls' enthusiasm was impossible to quench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prince who'll ride on a white horse to save you! A person who you can always count on, and share spaghetti, and you both eat the same noodle, and you end up... It's <i>perfect</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska's mind was already wavering before that. Naturally, being perfect herself, she would never consider taking a romantic partner \u2014 who else could equal her? That preconceived notion and the command to go with the flow were battling it out in her head, neither side winning out, at least until Pearl said that final word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska's head swirled with thoughts after that, justifying the complete 180 in her mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">(Well, the girl <i>did</i> have a point. A flawless woman with a flawless partner would simply outshine anyone else even more than they already do.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Certainly, there needs to be a intense vetting process beforehand \u2014 need to make sure their intelligence, looks, athleticism, and commitment to perfection are adequate, but after that...)</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blush covered her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\"><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">It'd be nice to be cuddle...</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, more Pearls than she realized leaked in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped out of her reverie by the small spirit medium, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you going to say, Mystic Maya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska blinked in confusion. \"I've... forgotten.

Somehow, Franziska had made that more feasible: she'd brushed it and styled it into something of an undercut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA von Karma didn't make mistakes. Thus, the prosecutor had found ways to make her sudden fashion choices much more tolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranzy's brain sputtered and frazzled. She... was von Karma. Yet, there was von Karma right there. And now that she thought about it, she remembered Maya using the remote on a von Karma. But... which one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost too much to bear.

One moment he was running and the next he was sitting, it took only a moment to realize what he was sitting on, it was a motorcycle. He immediately noticed a police officer standing in front of him, writing a ticket. \"Ma'am, you do realize you were going 20 over the speed limit?\" The officer said as they wrote the ticket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix put two and two together fast. Maya must have swapped him with this person so she would have time to get away- Wait, 'Ma'am'?!  Phoenix quickly looked down at his new body, and without a doubt, he was now female. He recognized the red jumpsuit as Desiree Delite's. He couldn't believe Maya had swapped him with her. Wait, if he was in Desire's body, did that mean she was in his?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was laughing nonstop as soon as she saw the look on <i>'Desire's'</i> face.

She thought about all of the things she could do with it, she was going to have so much fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, but first she should check on Desiree in Phoenix's body. She was suddenly thrust into this situation without warning after all. Maya walked over and sure enough, Desiree was freaking out over her sudden change in body. Thankfully, she recognized Maya. Maya explained everything to Desiree, after the explanation, Desire seemed to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A remote that can switch bodies?\" Desiree repeated confused, before a smile appeared on her face \"You gotta let me and Ronnie try it out sometime!\" She laughed. \"So, Nicky-boy didn't want to do anything with it?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's such a killjoy, but don't worry, I have a feeling he'll want to use it reeealy soon.\" Maya said with a giggle.

I can't exactly do Nick-boy's job for him. We'll need to swap back.\" Desiree voiced her concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, we have this!\" Maya said as she held up a remote \"With this, if any cases pop up, we can easily do Nick's job for him, no law degree needed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a long day</span></div></div>",

After dealing with the cop, Phoenix looked around for Maya and Desiree in his body, unfortunately, they weren't anywhere in sight. He sighed, what was he going to do now? He needed to get the remote from Maya if he ever wanted a chance of getting his body back. He thought about places Maya could be, it was possible she just went back to the office, but knowing her she was probably off playing with the remote and switching other people. He had no leads to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe supposed he could just go to Desiree and Ron's apartment for now. Maya was bound to eventually get bored and come to switch him back, all he would have to do is wait her out. Phoenix momentarily considered riding Desiree's motorcycle back to her home, but quickly decided against it. He had no idea how to drive it, and getting arrested for reckless driving was not something he planned to do today. Thankfully the bike was already pulled over from when Desiree stopped for that cop. Phoenix got off the bike and began to head for Desiree and Ron's apartment. \"She'll get it back, somehow\" Phoenix assured himself that nothing would happen to the bike while it was parked there<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Phoenix arrived, he slowly opened the door and looked inside the apartment, it seemed that Ron wasn't home. Phoenix let out a sigh of relief as he entered and locked the door. He couldn't exactly tell Ron about the swap, he would sound completely insane, if Ron were to show up, he'd need to act like Desiree. Phoenix shuddered at the thought, he couldn't imagine having to act like someone else's wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sat down on the couch and looked up at the ceiling. \"Note to self: Next time I find a magical body swap remote, don't tell Maya.\" He sighed to himself. His attention was brought to his new-temporary body. He didn't particularly like wearing Desiree's clothes. It was far too tight for his comfort and the unzipped part by the chest make him feel overexposed. He would have zippered it up more, but he had a feeling that if he tried to, he'd end up touching a body part that would violate Desiree's privacy. He then felt around Desiree's earrings, they were so large. Why did she even have steering wheel shaped earings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was interrupted by the sound of a knock on the door.

At the same time though, if they were lying about not swapping anyone, him not checking for lies would be the equivalent of keeping those people swapped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Phoenix decided to...</span></div></div>",

As Maya left behind Nick, Desiree said something to her \"I'll be sure to meet up with you next Tuesday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll try my hardest to remember.\" Maya turned around said right before once again walking toward Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" Phoenix asked Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, just some girl stuff.\" Maya said with a grin on her face. In actuality, Maya and Desiree had swapped quite a few people around town before meeting up with Phoenix. Most of the people who were swapped she knew, but there were some people who were complete strangers to her. She did at least make sure that there was at least one person she knew in each swapped pair. She and Desiree made the plan to keep them all swapped until next Tuesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------Meanwhile in several places around town---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fool!\" The body of Detective Gumshoe yelled at the body of Franziska Von Karma \"You expect me to believe that you had no role in this!\" Franziska yelled loudly from Gumshoe's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm as clueless as you are pal. One second you were whipping me and the next I'm holding the whip\" Gumshoe said from Franziska's body and rubbed the back of her head as he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska reached for where she normally held her whip, only to grab nothing. She chose instead to keep yelling. \"Until you find a way to turn us back to normal, your salary will drop like a rock.\" Franziska threatened and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away, Gumshoe panicked briefly about his salary, but then he realized something. Franziska couldn't lower his salary from his body. In fact, she had his salary right now and he had hers. He opened her wallet and his eyes went wide. He certainly wasn't going to be eating instant noodles while in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren Paups was panicking as she looked in the mirror in the house of a complete stranger, she was suddenly in the body of a man that she didn't know. He had spiky hair and a goatee and was wearing an orange jacket. How could this have happened and if she was in this man's body did that me he was in hers?! She fainted at the thought of what he could be doing in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of town, Larry was looking at his reflection in a fountain at Gatewater Land. \"Well hello beautiful\" he flirted with the reflection in the water. He had no idea how he ended up in the body of an attractive girl, but he wasn't one to question how things happen. He was just going to enjoy this for now and hope he was turned back to normal soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles Edgeworth sat in a dressing room at Big Berry Circus. One moment he was doing some paperwork and the next there was suddenly a flamboyant magician and a wooden puppet both asking him about a marriage proposal. Thankfully he excused himself to a dressing room before he had to actually speak to either of them. Edgeworth racked his mind on how this could have happened, but he had no ideas. The one thing he did know was that he needed to get back to his office and check on his body. He looked down at the body he was currently inhabiting \"But first, I'm going to need to change clothes. I wouldn't be caught dead walking around in this ridiculous outfi- <i>cough</i>\" Edgeworth began to cough as some glitter got in his mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina Berry sat bored in Edgeworth's office. She was having a fun day working on her act at the circus when suddenly Max and Trilo came up to her to ask her something, but before she could hear what they had to ask, she was suddenly in a random office in some random man's body. Not knowing what to do, she chose to just doodle tigers on the papers that were on the man's desk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor Kudo stood looking at his own unconscious body. He couldn't believe what had just happened. One moment he was sitting at his table in Tres Bien staring at the waitress'....outfit and the next moment he was standing with a tray in his hand. He was going to ask his own body what was going on, but it fainted the second it looked at him. Victor looked down at himself, he recognized that outfit anywhere, he was in the body of the Tres Bien waitress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were only a few of the pairs that Maya and Desiree had swapped around. Maya chuckled every time she thought about it. Who should the story follow now?</span></div></div>",

Phoenix and Maya were similarly confused as the typically serious prosecutor began to giggle with glee, hopping up and down like a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!

I lied actually,\" he told the judge, smiling all throughout. \"Larry is like, totally innocent, and I think he's really cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the defense bench, Phoenix and Maya were very perplexed. \"Nick... do you think...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix turned to Maya and whispered back, \"it can't be, but there's no other explanation. I think it worked!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Von Karma, you can't be serious! The police investigation turned up no evidence, you claim? Why are we even holding a trial then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Franziska' just shrugged, \"I don't know! Ask the detective. Anyways, the prosecution rests your highness!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your honor!\" The judge was absolutely baffled, but he didn't really know how to proceed without the prosecution well... prosecuting. \"Urk, well, in absence of any testimony or evidence, I suppose the court moves to... find Mr. Larry Buttz... innocent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfetti rained from the sky as the verdict was declared. Larry spun around on one foot and was about to free himself from the courtoom, but tripped up and landed straight on his face due to Von Karma's heels. He looked up to see both Phoenix and Maya standing over him, Phoenix stretching out a hand to help him up. \"Uh! Oh, thanks,\" Larry responded as Phoenix pulled him to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Von Karma, is there...\" Phoenix was unsure of how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something you would like to tell us?\" Maya asked more confidently. \"Something about a certain Mr. Buttz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry stared at them for a second, recalling that Phoenix still had the device, which meant that his only way out of Franziska's body was Phoenix's help. But, if he told Phoenix what had happened <i>now</i> then Phoenix would surely ruin his fun.

Instead of returning to normal, he could possess Phoenix or Maya! If he possessed Phoenix, he'd have control of the remote. Then, no one would tell him how to use it! Alternatively, he could take Maya's body and act like her; maybe Phoenix wouldn't realize it and he could have some fun as her for a while?

Thanks for the lawyer-y help, but it won't be enough to fix my broken love life!\" Larry's body said, referring to Phoenix's 'defense' of him in the trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix slapped a hand on his face and turned to Larry in Maya's body. \"I can't tell if he's in his body or not! It could go either way at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should just let him go? It doesn't seem like he went into anyone else.\" Larry in Maya's body said with a nervous shrug. He was worried that Phoenix would find out that he wasn't Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked around the Lobby, making sure that no one was acting too out of the ordinary. \"Yeah, I guess you're right. Let's just get out of here before he starts begging us to use the remote again.\" Phoenix joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Larry in Maya's body said with a nervous laugh. Over the years he had grown used to people making jokes like that about him. Though, normally he wasn't the one who was supposed to laugh at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix and Larry in Maya's body separated from Larry's body, Phoenix began to speak \"This remote is an amazing thing. Who do you think sent it to us? I'm pretty sure we aren't best friends with any super scientists or anything like that.\" Phoenix joked as he wondered where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry was less concerned with that. \"Who cares? It's fun, that's all that really matters!\" He said. Larry was far more concerned with what the remote could do than where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix laughed. \"Yeah, I guess you're right. If they wanted us to know who sent it, they would have wrote their name on the package.\" He stared at the remote again. \"I think we should test it out again at the office. It was a bit risky trying it right before a trial. We were lucky that the possession button did work, but we don't know if the other's do. We should find out as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry was really excited by the idea of using the remote again, but he wasn't sure if he should do it so soon. He had just gotten into Maya's body. Maybe it would be better if he didn't go with Phoenix for now. He had heard that Maya lived in a nearby village and was it's 'master' or something like that. He could stay there for the night and get more acquainted with her body. After thinking it over, Larry decided to....</span></div></div>",

He realized it was best that he get away from Phoenix for now - if he stayed then he was bound to be discovered sooner or later. Not to mention, there was no way of telling how the remote might affect him while he was using a 'commandeered' body. Maya was still inside it with him, after all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to Maya's wrist, Larry realized she wasn't wearing a watch but decided to keep up the act anyways. \"Oh! Uh, actually Nick, I got to be back at Cobain Village right away! Official Master stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix lifted an eyebrow in confusion at this. \"You mean... Kurain?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry nodded quickly, sending Maya's hair flying in front his face, \"Yeah! That's it! I'll meet up with you tomorrow though, don't worry. Don't use the device without me though!\" He gave a big wave with Maya's arm and ran off, going in the direction of the train station that he knew Maya must take to get into the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, alright, see you then?\" Phoenix replied, more question than statement. He stood there baffled as Maya ran off, apparently not having time to test out the device she had been interested in seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or two later, the train rolled into Kurain Village. Larry was sitting laid back, Maya's legs propped up on the seat across from him with a satisfied expression. He did it! He was home free! Larry could have Phoenix release him from Maya's body tomorrow, but until then Larry was free to enjoy her body however he wanted. He felt a bit bad about it, but upon seeing the village he was going to the \"Master\" of for the day, any guilt gave way to excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village was definitely rustic, but Larry couldn't wipe the grin off of his face when the people began bowed to him reverently as he cross. \"Welcome home Mystic Maya,\" they would say to him. They were looking at him a bit oddly, but hey were all submissive nonetheless. <i>'It's like I'm a princess! No one is ever this respectful to me!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya!\" a voice called out, causing Larry to stop what he was doing and look around. At first, he didn't see anyone, but looking down he realized a little girl had run up to him. \"How did the case go? Did Mr. Nick win?\" Her tone was  more informal than the others; she seemed to know Maya more personally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah! Nick swept away the case, but I think Larry had a hand too,\" Larry replied a bit too proudly. He had definitely seen this kid with Nick before, but he was having trouble remembering her name. <i>'Is it... Garnet? No that's not right.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong Mystic Maya?\" the kid asked, seeing the pensive expression on Larry's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nothing! Hey, how about you tell me about your day while we walk back to my house, huh?\" The little girl thankfully fell into Larry's ploy, and led the way, talking about some show she had seen earlier as she lead Larry straight to Maya's home - the largest in the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are Mystic Maya! Do you have anything else to do today?\" she asked, a smile on her face. She was definitely cute, but Larry didn't really want a kid following him around all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, yeah! Phoenix wanted me to... do some research for him. I'm going to be a bit busy, but I'll come get you if I have time, alright?\" This seemed satisfactory to the little girl, who nodded and walked off, leaving Larry to his own devices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, just a little alone time,\" Larry said with a relieved sigh as he entered Maya's bedroom. He wasted no time going through her things. The room was loaded with neat things! Aside from a large closet of robes and dresses, she had jewelry! Pearls and beads were all over, but one particular thing that Larry noticed was that she had some necklaces that were just like the thing Nick carried around. The Magalama he called it? Whatever. Pictures also scattered the room - Nick, the girl, and a woman that Larry recognized as Nick's boss were all in them. Little nicknacks and souvenirs were also all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with turning over Maya's stuff, Larry opened the closet up and found a fully body mirror. \"Heeeere we go!\" he said excitedly as he looked himself over. This was great! He could feel Maya's body body bursting with energy - it was like he was on top of the world! He had Maya's cute body and the respect of this town that came with it! \"Maybe I'll stay just a bit longer if it all goes well...\"</span></div></div>",

It was much longer than his and Franziska's. \"How does she deal with all of this?\" he said as he grasped some in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry's looked at Maya's top knot in the mirror \"hmm\" a juvenile idea popped into his head.

What little non-robes clothes she had were mostly formal-wear, and, was that a waitress uniform?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry took out various clothes and held them in front of Maya's body in the mirror. \"Maya wouldn't mind if I change her outfit.

For some reason he couldn't comprehend there was two buckets of water on the side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To help your spirit energy, you must strengthen your soul. You must carry these two buckets to the top of the mountain and back before nightfall\" one of the other women told Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry laughed nervously at first, but it slowly began to sink in that they were being serious. He would do anything to get out of this situation, but as everyone stared at him he knew there was nothing he could do. Reluctantly he picked up the buckets and began to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks. This sucks. This suuuucks\" Larry said in between breathes ten minutes later. He was surprised he went so long without needing a break. Maya's body was full of energy, but even then he still needed a break eventually. \"How often does she do stuff like this? If I need to do anything like this in her body again, I'd rather become a rock\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry felt the sun beating down on him, it was way to hot to be doing this.

Larry had never been to a fancy hotel before, so he hurried there. Once he arrived, he practically barged into the hotel lobby. Normally he was questioned and kicked out of fancy places like this because he had no money, but now that he did have money, he could do whatever he wanted here! Larry headed to the elevator and pressed the button for Franziska's floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in Franziska's hotel room, Larry was overjoyed by the room. He was surprised at just how big the entire thing was, even the bed was huge! He took off Franziska's shoes and began to jump on it as he looked around the room. There was a chair and a nice looking desk, and a large bookshelf with all sorts of files. Larry was a bit disappointed that there was no T.V. in the room, upon closer inspection, it looked like the bookshelf was in a place that would more suit a T.V. set, maybe Franziska ordered the hotel to remove the T.V. and bring in her bookshelf?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter jumping a bit longer, Larry got bored and stopped. Larry wondered what to do, thankfully, Franziska's stomach asked for him. Larry noticed a phone in the room and a grin spread across his face, he began to dial the number for the hotel lobby<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" someone at the front desk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is Franziska Von Karma, I am staying at the hotel and I have a question, can I order food to my room?\" Larry said, trying to imitate Franziska<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course Ms. Von Karma! The Gatewater hotel offers only the best of 5 star cuisine, we can give you the chef's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me the biggest, juiciest, hamburger you can make!\" Larry said, stating his idea of a 5 star meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person on the other end of the phone was silent for a minute \"Madame, you must be joking. Perhaps you want some lobster or some-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me my Hamburger! Oh, and some soda too! Or do I have to order from somewhere else\" Larry said like a child. He impersonation of Von Karma vanishing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course Madame, right away!\" The person on the other end of the line said. Both out of fear of not getting money from Franziska buying food and out of fear to what she had done to the entire staff last time she was told 'No'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the other person had hung up, Larry put down the phone. He wondered what to do while he waited and his eyes were drawn to Franziska's closet. He rushed over to the side of the room and opened it, alongside many fancy outfits, there was a full body mirror! Larry hopped up and down, poses in attractive ways, and overall just amused himself with the mirror for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting bored just posing in the mirror, Larry's attention was drawn to the outfits in the closest \"Franzy won't mind if I try a few on.\" Larry said as he began to unbutton and take off the top Franziska's current outfit. As he was taking it off, he heard a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry answered the door and to his joy, a Bellboy had arrived with his hamburger and soda, Larry took the food from the Bellboy and closed the door, not even leaving a tip. On the other side of the door, the Bellboy was blushing and confused, one of the hotels richest guests just answered the door wearing only a bra as her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry sat on the bed, not bothering to put on a top, and began to eat his burger like a pig, not caring about the mess he was making on the bed or on Franziska's skirt. \"I'm going to love this!\" Larry said between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>--------14 DAYS LATER--------------</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were in the hotel room two weeks ago, you would scarcely believe this was the same one. The bed, once clean neatly made and clean, was now unmade with blankets thrown everywhere and stains covered it. The desk, once organized with only important and relevant papers on top, was now covered in food wrappers, shopping bags and empty soda cans, as was the floor. Gone was the bookshelf, in it's place was a large T.V. Larry ordered be brought in. All the files were once organized and placed carefully on the shelf were now thrown on the ground, some ruined due to spilled soda cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the room, the woman who occupied it was unrecognizable. Gone was the strict prosecutor who would whip all those who disobey her, Sitting on the bed watching T.V. and eating popcorn was a woman wearing only underwear and a baggy blue badger T-shirt Larry had bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past two weeks, Larry had been doing whatever he wanted as Franziska. He had been going out to amusement parks, eating whatever he wanted, taking her car out on joyrides, even getting her a speeding ticket at one point, and he had even gone on two dates with his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what he hasn't done? Gone to court, he was completely unconcerned with Franziska's job as a prosecutor, the only time he had really thought about it was a few days ago when he received a phone call on Franziska's cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Von Karma, are you well? You scheduled to prosecute a case every day this month, but other than the case against Mr. Butz, you haven't shown up to court once! What is-\" That was all Larry listened to before he hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Larry sat on the bed, Franziska's cell phone once again began to ring, he looked at the caller I.D. and he recognized the name. \"Hey Edgey!\" Larry yelled as he picked up the phone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other side of phone was silent for a few seconds before Edgeworth began to speak \"Franziska, why haven't you shown up to any of the cases you volunteered to take?\" He said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" Larry began as he thought up an excuse \"I've just been taking a break and enjoying life! Spending my money, going on dates with the handsome Larry friend of yours. I'm even going on another date with him tonight. I'll come back to the courtroom sometime, I mean, what's the harm in missing a few cases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other side of the line was silent, Edgeworth hung up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his office, Edgeworth clutched his phone in his hands, something was definitely wrong with Franziska, she would never be so nonchalant about cases, something was wrong and he needed to find out what before her career was ruined forever. This strange behavior started last time she fought Wright in court, Edgeworth decided to give him a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mr. Nick speaking.\" Phoenix's voiced answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth wondered why he introduced himself that way, but he had more urgent business to take care of. \"Wright, something's wrong with Franziska, this began after she last fought you in court, do you have any idea what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, is she sick, what's wrong?\" \"Phoenix\" asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth didn't want to explain to anyone what was currently going on with \"Franziska\" \"Nothing I have to explain to you, Wright, I'm going to question Larry about this, if he comes running to your office, tell me immediately.\" Edgeworth said as he hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth put on his coat and began to head out, determined to question the only other person that \"Franziska\" talked about, Larry Butz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the phone, \"Phoenix\" was standing worried, suddenly, \"Maya\" stomped into the room \"Pearls, I told you, if the phone rings or someone knocks on the door, don't do anything and wait for me to switch back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past two weeks, Phoenix and Maya had been using the remote and now were pretty skilled at using it, they had tried out all the buttons and knew exactly how everything worked on it. The three of them were currently in each others bodies via 'Aware Swap.' Phoenix was in Maya's body, Pearl was in his, and Maya was currently at Kurain village in Pearl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Ed-jih-worth was worried about Ms. Von Karma, I think she's sick.\" Pearl said to Phoenix, sounding worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's eyes widened like he saw a ghost. \"I forgot about Larry.\" He couldn't believe that he had made such a colossal mistake, he could of ruined Von Karma's life. He hurried out the door with the remote, not bothering to switch back to his own body. He needed to find out where Larry in Von Karma's body was and get him out of that body! First, he needed to find out where Von Karma lived!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shall the story follow?</span></div></div>",

He even left Pearl alone at the office with his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix reached down to where his pocket usually was on his clothes, but he remembered that Maya's outfit didn't have pockets and he left her cell phone at the office. So he went over to a nearby payphone and began to dial the number for Kurain Village. He asked to talk to 'Pearl'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nick, or is it Pearl?\" Maya in Pearl's body asked from the other side of the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya it's me, Phoenix, we've got a problem! Do you remember the first time we used the remote? When we let Larry into Franziska's body?!\" Phoenix hurriedly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we let him in her body so you can win the- AHHHHHH we forgot to get him out of her body!\" Maya yelled, realizing what had gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on the next train, I'm going to try to sort this mess out.\" Phoenix explained to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it! I'll be at the office in about two hours!\" Maya said, hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Phoenix called Maya, he dialed another number, hopefully this person would be able to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Who is this?\" Edgeworth asked as he answered his cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edgeworth, it's me, Maya\" Over the past two weeks of using the remote, Phoenix had gotten used to using a different name while talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Fey, what do you want?\" Edgeworth asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what's wrong with Franziska.\" Phoenix said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spoke with Wright earlier, and I just visited Mr. Butz, neither of them knew what was wrong with her, why do you?\" Edgeworth asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not something I can explain over the phone. Do you have somewhere we can meet?\" Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Come to my office, we'll talk there.\" Edgeworth said, before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix arrived at Edgeworth's office, he was sitting at his desk looking over some files and drinking a cup of tea, on the table was a second cup of tea he had clearly prepared for 'Maya'. \"So, Ms. Fey. What's wrong with Franziska?\" Edgeworth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix didn't drink the tea that was prepared for him, he was more of a coffee person. \"This will take a while to explain.\" Phoenix said before he told Edgeworth the whole story of the remote, everything from all of the functions, to how Larry was currently in Franziska's body, to how the person sitting right in front of Edgeworth was really Phoenix Wright in Maya Fey's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth sat and listened to the story, once Phoenix was done explaining, Edgeworth spoke up. \"Ms. Fey, you just spent 30 minutes of my time with nonsense. Do you actually expect me to believe that you have some sort of-\" Edgeworth was suddenly cut off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Remote that can......\" Maya's body began to say, before putting a hand to it's throat. Edgeworth looked down to see he was now clothed in Maya's robes, he was now in her body. It only took him a moment to regain his composure. He grabbed the cup of tea that Phoenix hadn't touched and began to drink it. \"Alright, Wright, I believe you. So tell me, how did Larry end up in Franziska's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was silent \"Well, that's sort of, my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth scowled at Phoenix from Maya's body \"Well then, we must fix this immediately. I'll handle the planning. Rest assured, Larry won't spend another day in her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Edgeworth, I'm counting on you.\" Phoenix said, he picked up the remote and once again did an Aware Swap with Edgeworth. Unfortunately for Phoenix, Edgeworth was still holding the cup of tea when Phoenix swapped, which Phoenix proceeded to drop and spill all over Maya's robes \"Ow, Ow, ow! Hot tea! Hot Tea!\" Phoenix yelped in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'And this is why I'm in charge of the plan'</i> Edgeworth thought to himself. Edgeworth and Phoenix spent several minutes in silence as Edgeworth thought of a plan, eventually Edgeworth broke the silence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>EUREKA!</b> I thought of something! So, apparently Larry in planning to go on a date with himself tonight. If I were to take a guess, he's trying to increase his own reputation by making it appear he's dating Franziska. The two of us could show up at their date and get him out of her body from there, but if he were released from her body from there he could just possess any random passerby, we can't let that happen. What we need to do is lead him to somewhere secluded either my office or yours. I highly doubt he would listen to either of us, but there is one person he is guaranteed to listen to, himself. If his own body lead him somewhere, he would think it was all part of the 'date', once we lead him to the assigned place, we can extract him from the body.\" Edgeworth laid out his plan to Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was impressed Edgeworth had thought of the plan so quickly. He nodded his head in agreement \"So, who's going to be in Larry's body and impersonate him?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whichever of the two of us can do a better impersonation of him, after all, the person we need to fool is himself.\" Edgeworth answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Phoenix and Edgeworth thought about how well the each of them could impersonate Larry. Both shivered at the thought of having to act like Larry. After some more thinking, it was decided that _____ should play the role of Larry</span></div></div>",

Did you forget about little old me?\" Phoenix felt vomit building up in his throat as he put on a flirty voice to talk with Larry's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maya, uh, I,\" Larry's body said, flustered. <i>'First Franzy wants to start dating, now Maya is flirting with me, this is the luckiest month of my life!'</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come over to Edgeworth's office, we can, talk, there.\" Phoenix flirted again, it wasn't even a second later that Larry's body hung up the phone and began to drive over. \"I think I'm going to be sick.\" Phoenix said to Edgeworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Larry's to arrive at Edgeworth's office. He wasn't even 5 steps into the room before Phoenix used the 'Aware Swap' button and swapped bodies with Larry's body. From Larry's body's point of view, he was now looking at himself. \"Ahh! What are you?! Some kind of shapeshifting alien who wants to take my body so he could date Franzy?!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth shut the Larry copy up by handing him a hand mirror. Larry looked at his reflection in surprise, he was in Maya's body! \"Larry, we're going to let you be Maya for one hour. However, you must tell us where you planing to meet with Franziska for your date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Larry copy was too preoccupied staring at his new reflection to think about questions or think about the question Edgeworth had just asked. \"I'm supposed to pick her up at the Gatewater Hotel in twenty minutes.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Edgeworth, let's go!\" Phoenix said and headed out the door. Edgeworth followed suit, however, once he left, he made sure to lock the Larry copy in Maya's body inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just use the 'Possession' function?\" Edgeworth asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I did that, there would be a Maya copy in her body. Maya would probably be smart enough to leave the office if it was locked, Larry, not so much.\" Phoenix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth drove Phoenix in to the Gatewater Hotel to meet Larry in Franziska's body. \"Oh yeah, Maya should be arriving at my office any minute now. Edgeworth, call my phone and explain everything to Maya and Pearl. Tell them to meet us at your office.\" Phoenix told Edgeworth as he exited the car, Edgeworth merely nodded and pulled out his phone as Phoenix walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix couldn't believe what he saw, it was clearly Franziska's body, but it wasn't dressed anything like Franziska. Larry clearly just threw on a white T-Shirt with a food stain and a random pair of running shorts, neither of which looked like something Franziska owned. Her hair was a complete mess. Larry clearly hadn't been taking good care of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix took a deep breath and walked up to Larry in Franziska's body, doing his best impression of Larry. \"Franzy!\" Phoenix said and pulled Larry in for a hug. \"I left the Samurai Dog stand early so I could come and meet you!\" He made up a Larry-like excuse for why he was here slightly early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that! I- I mean, you need as much money as you can make to pay this month's rent\" Larry said to what he thought was his double. He believed the excuse because he would do something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Franzy. Anyway, I have a super fun place for us to go on our date tonight, I even got someone to drive us there!\" Phoenix said and began to lead Larry to Edgeworth car. Edgeworth was just putting his phone away, he had explained everything to Maya and Pearl. \"I asked Edgey to drive us anywhere we wanted on our date tonight!\" Phoenix said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth glared at Phoenix for calling him by the nickname that Larry had given him, but he didn't say anything about it and merely went along with the act. \"Yes, that's right, I am a gentlemen after all, I wouldn't turn down a favor from a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry in Franziska's body was skeptical, Edgeworth never helped him before! However, Larry said nothing, after all, what reason would his double have to lie? He got in the car and Edgeworth began to drive off to his office.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three of them arrived at the Prosecutor's building, they found Maya in Pearl's body, and Pearl in Phoenix's body waiting outside. Once Edgeworth parked, Maya walked over to Phoenix in Larry's body \"Hey Nick! Good job getting Larry! Maya said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry's eyes widened as he realized he'd been tricked. He stood up and tried to escape, but he stopped by Edgeworth.\"You're not getting away, Larry.\" Edgeworth said and Larry sat back down in the backseat of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore doing anything else, Phoenix swapped Maya and Pearl, so Maya was in his body and Pearl was in her own body. He then swapped himself with Maya, getting his own body back and putting Maya in Larry's body. Phoenix and Edgeworth then proceeded to drag Larry in Franziska's body upstairs to Edgeworth's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did the Maya copy give you any trouble?\" Maya said, assuming that Phoenix took Larry's body via possession for this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.......actually\" Phoenix began to explain, but he was interrupted as Edgeworth unlocked and opened the door to his office, revealing the Larry copy in Maya's body halfway through undressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let the Larry copy in my body?!\" Maya said as she ran into the office and stopped the Larry copy from going any further. The real Larry in Franziska's body smiled at the sight he just saw. Once Maya had stopped the Larry copy, Phoenix used the remote and put Maya in her own body and the Larry copy into Larry's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, tie Larry's body up while we hold the real Larry still.\" Edgeworth said, and Maya and Pearl proceeded to do just that. Tying the Larry copy to Edgeworth's office chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done! All we need to do now is have Larry Possess his own body! Oh, when Franziska wakes back up, she's gonna be mad when we explain to her what happened, you might not want to be around for that Pearly.\" Maya said. Pearl took the hint and began to head out of the office, planning to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larry, if you attempt to possess any body here other than you own, we will find out, and your punishment will be much more severe\" Edgeworth explained and pointed the remote at Larry in Franziska's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry didn't know what to do, if he went back to his own body, who knows what Franziska would do to him?! But, how would he escape. Then he had an idea, Maya's cousin just left, no one here would notice if he took her body! But, there was a chance they would check on her when they find out that he went to another body, he didn't have much time to think, he decided to</span></div></div>",

With Edgeworth's threat in mind and Phoenix and Maya standing in the room, he went back to his own body. Franziska's body seemed to be unconscious for about a minute, a blank look in her eye, possibly a side effect of being possessed for so long. Once she seemed to regain consciousness, she began to question where she was and what was going on, after some questioning, it was clear that she was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix, Edgeworth, and Maya explained what had happened to Franziska, they explained everything about the remote and what Larry had been doing in her body for the next two weeks. With every word out of their mouths, the look on Franziska's face got angrier and angrier. By the time they finished explaining, Franziska looked like she was going to strangle Larry. However, before she did anything, she turned to Phoenix and Maya and asked them a question \"So, which one of you fools let this foolish fool into my body?\" She asked coldly, as if asking who she should kill. Maya backed away and pointed to Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska reached to where she normally kept her whip, but found it to be absent. Her attention then turn to the clothes she was currently dressed in, clothes completely unfitting of a Von Karma. She looked over to Larry in fury<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you didn't have any casual clothes, so I went on a shopping spree\" Larry tried to explain. This only infuriated Franziska even more. Before Franziska went insane, Maya walked up to her and whispered something into her ear. Franziska looked skeptical at first, but as Maya continued to explain, a small smirk formed on Franziska's face. Maya handed her the remote and She walked out of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she going?\" Phoenix asked, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The store.\" Maya said, smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is she getting?\" Edgeworth asked, and eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, you'll she\" Maya said playfully, meanwhile, Larry had a scared look on his face, it was clear he wasn't ready for the consequences of his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Franziska returned from the store.........with a small cage. She swiftly pointed the remote at Larry and in an instant all that remained on the chair was a bird. The bird began to freak out, it tried to jump and flap it's wings to get away, but Larry didn't know how to fly. Franziska took bird-Larry and put him in the cage. \"How long did you say this foolish fool was in my body?\" She asked the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fourteen days\" Edgeworth stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then for the next Twenty Eight days he shall be stuck like this. Wright, you shall be the one to take care of this pest.\" Franziska ordered, no one in the room objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Franziska had regained control of her body and trapped Larry in the body of a bird, her first priority should be to attempt to save what little bit of a reputation she had left, however, there were still two loose ends about this situation that bothered her, Phoenix Wright and Maya Fey. Because of these two, a complete fool had full reign of her life and body, nearly ruining both, these two weren't going to get off unpunished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Franziska, she still had the remote in hand. She even had a punishment thought up already, for the past two weeks someone with a complete opposite personality from herself had been in her body, Phoenix and Maya needed the same thing to happen to them. Perhaps being possessed for a few weeks will teach them a lesson about meddling with other people's lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was, who should she punish first?</span></div></div>",

If you don't, I will use the remote to punish you.\" She threatened. Edgeworth wanted to object, he didn't want anything to do with this remote, but he knew how extreme Franziska could get when she was angry, the safest thing to do right now would be to do what she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Franziska used the remote on Edgeworth, Maya had a terrified looked on her face, she regretted handing the remote to Franziska earlier. He scared look turned into a blank expression momentarily before she seemed to regain some sense of composure. The terrified look on her face replaced by a scowl of annoyance, it was clear that Edgeworth was the one now inhabiting her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Edgeworth in Maya's body could speak, Franziska spoke to Edgeworth's body, now inhabited by a copy of him. \"Thank you for letting us use your office, Miles. We'll be taking out leave now\" Franziska said and left the office, Phoenix and Edgeworth following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska turned to Edgeworth in Maya's body. \"Now Miles, you are to stay in Ms. Fey's body until Mr. Butz punishment is finished, however, that is not all. Similar to how Mr. Butz put no effort into impersonating me, you are not to behave like Maya Fey. You are prohibited from doing any of her responsibilities as a spirit medium or the future head of the Kurain family. By the end of the month I want people to scarcely recognize you as Maya Fey!\" Franziska named her demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth was awestruck, surely she was joking?! However, he knew Franziska well enough to know that whenever she was mad, she was dead serious. He would've objected and disobeyed her, but he feared that if he did Franziska would keep him in Maya's body for a longer amount of time. So he chose to obey for now. Of course, not doing any of Maya's spirit medium duties wouldn't be hard. He hardly believed that spirit channeling was real, he had no intentions on doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Franziska explained her terms to Edgeworth, Phoenix slowly back away and began to make his way down the hallway. He had nearly escaped, but bird-Larry, whose cage was currently in Phoenix's hands, began to make noise, giving him away <i>'Thanks Larry, even when you can't talk you make my case worse'</i> Phoenix thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you're getting out of this, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I have already chosen who I want to occupy your body, follow me.\" Franziska said, making her way to the door, not even bothering to look at Phoenix \"And leave the bird, 'Ms. Fey' will take care out it until we return.\" Franziska said on her way out. Phoenix handed the bird cage to Edgeworth and followed close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Franziska and Phoenix got outside, she stopped to look for her car, Phoenix explained that Edgeworth had driven them here and Franziska's car was still at the Gatewater Hotel. They would have to walk to the place Franziska wanted to go \"For making me walk, the punishment for you three has been raised to 42 days.\" Franziska told Phoenix. Phoenix prayed that Larry hadn't done anything else that would provoke Franziska to raise the time of the punishment.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, he shuffled over to the door, stunned by how big it now was; he could barely reach the nob! He put an ear to the door and listened closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let him do <i>what</i>?!\" he could hear Franziska shout from the other side of the door after the situation was explained to her. A chill ran down his now tiny spine as he listened further to the conversation. The others tried to calm her down to little avail, and to Larry's worry, the conversation shifted to his (vacant) body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Larry, have you returned?\" Now it was the stern voice of Edgeworth butting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, Edgy. I'm all normal, I promise!\" He heard his body say on the other end. \"Now uh... you all aren't going to hurt me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Yes! Smart-man!' </i>Larry thought with a fist pump. As dumb as he was, the Larry clone knew when to just go with things. He didn't really know what was happening, but he knew that whatever was going on was bad for him, and it'd get worse if he didn't reply affirmatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>CRACK</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW, FRANZY PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXPECT NO MERCY FOOL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>SNAP</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>AHHHHH</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry winced. He could almost feel the pain himself. He knew he made the right choice hiding out in Pearl's tiny form. There's no way they would even hurt him should they find the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while longer though, Larry heard a rush of footsteps coming towards the door, and he barely moved away in time as Franziska slammed it open, marching out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she going?\" Phoenix asked, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The store.\" Maya said, smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is she getting?\" Edgeworth asked, and eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, you'll she\" Maya said playfully, meanwhile, Larry's clone had a scared look on his face, it was clear he wasn't ready for the consequences of his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry could barely hide the pounding of his heart as Franziska came back with a bird cage, which now contained his original, transformed body. Apparently, whipping wasn't enough. Franzy had decided that Larry needed to stay in that shape for 28 days, and he could only watch as his panic-stricken clone was carted off to where-ever Franzy decided to take him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Nick and Maya exited the room with a few welts as well. Thankfully, Franziska spared them similar punishments, as Edgeworth had managed to talk her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll give the remote back Wright, I assure you,\" Edgeworth said as Phoenix struggled his way down the wall. \"She's vindictive, but not a crook. Once Larry has served his sentence, I'm sure we can get it back from her and properly figure out what it does.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sighed. \"Yeah, you're probably right. We treated it like a toy and got into this mess. We ought to be more judicious with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, can't we just steal it back,\" Maya whined. \"We were having a lot of fun! Right Pearly?\" She suddenly turned her attention to Larry, who jolted to attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah! It was, er, super fun. I really want to try it again N-Mr. Nick!\" Larry had to congratulate himself on that save at the end. He had just barely remembered Pearl's term of respectfulness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix just shook his head though. \"Sorry Pearl, but at this point we'd just provoke Von Karma. We just need to be patient, okay?\" He said softly, looking sympathetic to the young girl who was in truth just Larry hiding from his crimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Larry's next step?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His best bet for now would be to be patient and stay as Pearl for now. \"Okay, Mr. Nick. I hope she gives it back soon.\" He said in Pearl's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Pearly, let's get you back to Kurain village.\" Maya said and took Larry by the hand. Larry followed silently until they were at the train station. When they were on the train to Kurain, Maya kept talking about what she had done in Pearl's body before she had come to help with \"The Larry situation\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry paid little attention and only gave the ocasional \"uh-huh\" or nod of affirmination. He was more focused on how he would keep up the Pearl ruse for 28 days at minimum. He nearly messed up in just referring to Nick as \"Mr. Nick\" earlier, how was he supposed to keep it up while doing spiritual changling training or whatever the thing Pearl and Maya do was called<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! We're here, come on Pearly!\" Maya said as the train reached It's destination. The thankfully Maya walked with him all the way to where Pearl stayed, so he didn't too risk his cover by asking where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Maya left and he was alone, he looked around, while the room was bigger than the one he had stayed in as Franziska and he had a whole building and village he could walk around. However, things in Kurain were certainly less luxurious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in Pearl's closet and found that nearly all of her clothes were identical to the robes she was currently wearing. She did have a normal looking outfits too. Larry found a mirror and stared into it \"Guess this is me for the next month\" he said pulling on Pearl's cheeks and making silly faces. \"Might be fun to be a kid again for a bit, not like It's forever anyway\". Larry said, bracing himself for the next 28 days</span></div></div>",

There were plenty of good places around town where he could have fun with some money. His thoughts were interrupted when he felt some hunger begin to grow in Franziska's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that settles it! Thanks for choosing where to go new stomach!\" Larry said, looking down at Franziska's stomach. He began to drive to a place where he often went to eat, Tres Bien. The food there wasn't particularly good to Larry, but it was French! That meant it must be good, plus France was the country of love. So a true lover must like French food! At least, that's how Larry understood things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a drive across town, getting only a few dents on Franziska's car, he had arrived at Tres bien. Once he went in and took his seat, he had already began having a more enjoyable time then he usually did here. Usually he had to give up most of his savings just to have a small meal here, but now he had Franziska's wallet! He went and ordered the most expensive thing on the menu, he had no idea what it was, but he could afford it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his food arrived, Larry spent more time eying the waitress, a woman with short hair and glasses, than time spent actually looking at his food. He usually did this, although somehow he felt that it was strange for 'Franziska' to be seen doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry took a bite of his food...and immediately spit it out and began rubbing whatever residue was left off his tongue with Franziska's gloved hands. It was just as gross now as it was in his own body. He was honestly disappointed, but he cheered up quickly as he reminded himself that it wasn't his money that was spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his still full plate, Larry's mind went back to the waitress from earlier. More specifically, the waitress' uniform. He looked down at Franziska's body. \"I wonder how good Franzy would look as a waitress.\" He thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind drifted once more as he thought about was to make that possible. He could go and ask the owner of the place if he could temporarily 'work' at Tres Bien, that way he could get the waitress uniform and just change into it. Although there was the off chance that someone would actually come in and order something, so maybe he shouldn't take the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over, Larry chose to...</span></div></div>",

The place had become a second home to him during his legal career, and he couldn't bring himself to let it go even in his disbarment, so he had converted it into a talent agency while he played poker on the side. He had to admit though, gambling didn't give him much of a sense of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the doorstep, he noticed a small package lying on the doorstep. \"Trucy must've missed it,\" he muttered as he picked it up. It didn't have any address on it, which was curious, but Phoenix doubted it could be dangerous. Not giving it much more thought, he opened the door and walked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey daddy, how was your day!\" Trucy greeted Phoenix as he walked in, apparently practicing her 'magic panties' routine. Phoenix worried she might be getting too old for that to still be cute, but he didn't have the heart to tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine,\" he replied with a smile, \"but I need to take a break. I'll be in my office if anything comes up, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" she said as he went into his office and decided to look over the package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, body swapping?\" Phoenix laughed as he read the instructions. \"Did Maya send this as a joke? Suppose it gave me a chuckle if she did.\" He was ready to stow it away and forget about it, but the more he thought about it the more he atleast wanted to try it out. Making a living off gambling for so long was beginning to wear him out a bit. With a device like this he could switch with a lawyer and relive his 'glory days' if just for a bit; it would definitely help his self esteem. He was well acquainted with Kristoph Gavin, another famous lawyer, and he knew Kristoph also had a protege fresh out of law school. If he wanted, he could also switch with someone totally different, like his daughter or one of his friends, and try out something entirely new. It'd be nice to be someone else after seven years of disbarment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Phoenix decide to do with the device? </span></div></div>",

The first person that came to mind was the only other defense attorney that he had contact with, Kristoph Gavin. Phoenix has been a <i>'friend'</i> of Gavin's for years, ever since his disbarment. While Phoenix severely doubted that Gavin would appreciate the swap, he didn't exactly have a say in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Phoenix did have contact with two other lawyers, he didn't know if becoming either of them was a good idea. After all, these two were prosecutors. The first was a long time friend of Phoenix's and unlike Kristoph, Phoenix could say without a doubt he was a true friend. He was Miles Edgeworth. Phoenix had been in contact with Edgeworth even before his disbarment. While Phoenix knew Edgeworth wouldn't find the remote very amusing, it may be good for both of them to live in each others shoes for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Prosecutor he knew was....less nice. She was Franziska Von Karma, the successor to Manfred Von Karma. She was one of the strictest and one of the most win happy Prosecutors around. She even carried a whip around in court, Phoenix could testify for how much she used it. Although she was very trigger happy with her whip and called nearly everyone a fool, she seemed to be a good person at heart and legitimately cared about getting the right verdict in the end. Phoenix figured swapping with her would be a nice bit of payback for all the times she whipped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the idea switching with either prosecutor rubbed Phoenix the wrong way, it may be interesting to be on the other side of the Prosecution bench for a day or two. After all, other than those two his only real choice was becoming Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some careful consideration, Phoenix went to his phone and began to dial the Phone number of......</span></div></div>",

However, when he saw the begging look on Trucy's face, he put that thought out of his mind. Phoenix could stay straight-faced and argue with fierce prosecutor's back in his glory days, but he was a complete pushover when it came to his daughter. \"Alright. You go hide in the back room so the second you doesn't see you and freak out. I'll be right back in a new body.\" Phoenix explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy had a giant grin on her face \"Alright, Daddy!

He wanted to keep trying out the remote, so he dove downwards and into the woman's body, causing her to nearly trip and fall as Phoenix took over her senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Phoenix shrieked in a new, higher pitched voice. He stood on wobbly legs, not sure how to take a step forward in the woman's heels. \"Uh, alright, one step at a time,\" he told himself, legs shaking back and forth as he tried to make his way into the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!\" Unfortunately, he failed and fell forward into the grass. He supposed it was better than concrete? <i>'Better thank Mia's ghost for buying an office with a lawn I guess...'</i> He pulled himself back up, this time opting to just kick the woman's heels off his feet. He took a moment to brush off the woman's dress, feeling more than a bit strange as he did. Her dress was a lot looser than Trucy's; it almost felt like he was wearing a curtain around his torso; he didn't even have anything to cover his arms. The fact that it was cinched right below the chest accentuated a lot of the differences as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get back inside before I change my mind,\" Phoenix decided, walking up to the door with his sandals in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Knock Knock*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the door opened on the other side, revealing a grinning Trucy. \"Hello! I take it you're not here to schedule a magic show, right?\" She asked, guessing who was really at the helm. Phoenix merely nodded, and awkwardly shuffled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing dad!\" Trucy exclaimed, looking Phoenix up and down. \"I can't believe we're almost the same height now! She's really pretty too.\" Trucy looked a bit closer, and spied the ring sitting on Alita's hand. \"Ooooh, I wonder if she's going to be married soon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shivered a bit at the thought. \"So long as her wedding isn't going on tonight, then I don't think it affects us,\" he said. \"So, now that Jinxie with your clone, what do we do?

He looked down at himself and began to examine the body he had just taken<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's uniform was definitely easier to wear than Trucy's magician clothes, but Phoenix would have a hard time saying that he was 'comfortable' in either of them. While Trucy's cape did an okay job at covering her body's arms, Phoenix could still feel that he was wearing any sleeves. In contrast, this girl's uniform had long sleeves. Unfortunately for Phoenix, both Trucy's dress and this girl's uniform left his legs very exposed. He doubted he would ever get used to that feeling. <i>'Maybe I should have possessed Ema, at least she wore pants!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked back up and realized that he misjudged how close this girl was to the office when he had possessed her. She was about two blocks away. Phoenix began to walk back to the office. As he was walking, he took notice to the girl's hair. It was much longer than his and Trucy kept hers tied up near her neck. With every step he took he felt it move and tickle the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how long Phoenix waited for a body to come by he expected Trucy to be waiting impatiently by the door for him. Phoenix couldn't help but wonder though, did the girl he had possessed have any plans for the afternoon? While he supposed he had no way of finding out, he hoped that his body hijacking wouldn't affect this girl's life in anyway.

Trucy said she wasn't supposed to be here for a little over an hour, there was no way he was on the couch for that long. \"Your here early.\" He said, he tried to imitate how joyful Trucy sounded all the time, but there was an obvious nervousness in his voice.

Phoenix also needed to leave quickly, Trucy could come out of the backroom at any second which would also lead to Jinxie seeing two Trucys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's go.\" Phoenix said hesitantly and let with Jinxie. <i>'Hopefully Trucy figures out why I suddenly left the office'</i> He thought to himself as he walked</span></div></div>",

It seemed even when he left LA, trouble seemed to follow him, as he had immediately been wrapped up in a murder trial with some of the highest stakes he had ever encountered. Thankfully though, he managed to turn things around and save both himself and his defendant, a child named Ahlbi, from the guillotine. After that, things had calmed down, and he finally had some time to enjoy the sights while he waited for Maya to be done with her training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting, he had made his temporary residence at Temp'uhl Temple, which had generously given him some lodging after the incident. It had been a long day of walking around the city, finding new places, so he was glad to get back to his room for a bit of rest in the mid-afternoon before he went out on another outing that evening. What he didn't expect to find was a package waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's this now?\" Phoenix muttered as he picked it up from the nightstand by the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dear Mr. Wright. We're horribly sorry for the rough beginning you've had in Khura'in. We trust this will make your stay much easier.'</i> ~ Anonymous <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the monks certainly didn't leave this here,\" Phoenix said to himself as he finished reading over the manual. As far as pranks went, this was a pretty abstract one. Phoenix was used to being the butt of jokes though, so he decided he would roll with it. After all, someone went through all the trouble of preparing this for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pocketed the device and exited the temple early, figuring he'd go ahead and give it a quick try before he met up with Ahlbi.

She was a princess and her people did love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix considered possessing her, after all. She did sorta owe him for all the trouble her Divination Seance had caused him during Ahlbi's trial the other day.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoenix had barely been in Khura'in for an hour when the trial started, and Princess Rayfa made Phoenix's life incredibly difficult during that time. Because of her, he was nearly executed on his own vacation! The people here seemed to hate lawyers, but they loved the royal family. Rayfa probably lived a pretty easy life in Khura'in - she wouldn't be too out of luck if Phoenix decided to take her body for a day. Phoenix imagined that being the country's very own princess would make his stay <i>much</i> easier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot totally sure how to go about possession, Phoenix slowly lowered himself down over Rayfa, who was moving through a crowd of citizens, waving to them and listening to what they had to say. From an outside perspective, Rayfa stopped for a moment, seeming to stare off in to space, before blinking and regaining some level of composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Rayfa, please bless my child!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Benevolence, will you look at our petition?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thank you for your goodwill, princess!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the shouts from the crowd overwhelmed Phoenix as he was trying to come to grips with his sudden change in form. He was suddenly very light, and very small. The people towered over him in his new body - even if they were filled with adulation and praise, it was intimidating. \"Uh, yes, uh, thank er - very much!\" He tried to muster up in reply, waving feebly. His high pitched voice was too distracting for him though, and it came out as just a squeak. He could hear the chimes of bells as they fluttered on his wrist as well. In his other small hand, the remote was gripped tightly. He certainly didn't seem to fit the role of graceful and resolute princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix realized there was no way he could last as Rayfa in public for long. He was fortunate enough that English seemed to be common in Khura'in. If he had to speak Khura'inese, he'd be utterly lost. He gave a fast series of thanks and platitudes as he pushed his way through the crowd, trying to get to the open street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Benevolence, is everything okay?\" A tall figure suddenly came into view; it was holding a rifle. Phoenix had to look up for once in his life to make eye contact with what he could figure out what a guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, certainly,\" Phoenix replied quickly. \"Could I - uh, we,\" he stumbled, still taken off guard by how fast it all had happened, \"get out of this crowd maybe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, your benevolence!\" The guard replied, Seemingly from nowhere, a number of guards overtook the area, surrounding Phoenix as they escorted him into a long limousine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wow, perk of royalty,'</i> Phoenix thought as he climbed into the back and sat down. He was glad to finally have some of the noise blocked out. Hopefully the benefits would continue to pile up - he didn't have the fortitude to deal with the kind of fame that Rayfa seemed to have here! He finally looked down at himself and took stock of his new body. By his reckoning, Rayfa was probably a bit younger than his daughter. She was very skinny and petite, and her clothing left her legs very exposed. Her arms were only covered by the cloak as well. He didn't seem to have anywhere to hide the device on his person, unfortunately. He wasn't sure he was willing to venture out into public without keeping it safe somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to return to the palace, your Benevolence?\" The driver finally asked from the front as the car began to make its way out of the road. Phoenix thought about and realized that it would certainly be a great sight to see; if he was the princess himself, he could explore the entire palace free of restriction! There were likely many places that tourists weren't allowed to go in there, and he'd be able to regroup himself a bit. He hadn't yet finished exploring the city though; even if the crowds threatened to be too much, it would certainly be interesting to go about in public as something more than a mere sightseer. </span></div></div>",

He also carried the faint fear that he could be discovered. This remote didn't seem like anything Maya had ever showed him, but he imagined that if anyone could spot a possession, it'd be a nation of spirit channelers. While he was here, he knew he had to capitalize on the opportunity and go somewhere that no tourist was allowed to go! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me back home to the palace,\" Phoenix instructed the driver. He lacked the force of conviction that the real Rayfa had when she spoke, but the driver followed his instructions regardless. In fact, if any of the body guards thought the princess to be acting strange, they didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Just wish my employees back home showed me this kind of respect...' </i> He thought to himself as he took in the sights of Khura'in from outside his window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe palace was somehow more beautiful than Phoenix had expected, yet also more labyrinthine than he could have guessed. He found himself out in a courtyard looking into a koi pond, trying to act natural. It wouldn't do him any good in terms of keeping a low profile if the <i>princess</i> was lost in her own palace. As beautiful as the building was, he couldn't help but feel like someone was watching him, even after he had waved the guards away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd feel better if only I could find a safe place to hide this thing...\" Phoenix mumbled to himself while watching a large frog swallow down a dragonfly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"<i>There's a space hidden in your bedroom behind the portrait of the warbaa'd,</i>\"</font> a voice abruptly whispered into Phoenix's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHA!\" Phoenix cried out in Rayfa's voice, alarmed to find an old, white haired woman suddenly whispering into his hear, hunched over next to him. Where had she been hiding?! \"Wh-where did you...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess?\" the woman asked with an eyebrow raised, slightly befuddled. \"I was over behind the tree, like usual. Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh, yes! I'm fine!\" Phoenix almost shouted back. Did Rayfa have ninjas in her staff? \"Uh, why don't you show me this secret space? You can lead the way.\" Phoenix said, trying to regain control of the situation. The attendant could show him to the Princess's bedroom in the process too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- 2 Days Later ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix could scarcely believe it had been this long since he\u2019d been so relaxed. Being a high-profile attorney at such a young age, getting disbarred, and getting reinstated had really done a number on him. He barely realized how much stress he had built up over his career! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;Crack&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix let out a satisfied sigh as the masseuse popped a vertebra along Rayfa\u2019s back. As Rayfa, he had access to everything a princess could want! Great food, an amazing bed, and the ability to see everything the palace had to offer. He couldn\u2019t imagine many foreigners got the chance to see such a place up close! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy shoulders please,\u201d Phoenix said lazily, eyes closed as the massage continued. Adapting to being Rayfa \u2013 a young girl \u2013 was certainly a difficult experience, but her body also made him realize the toll age had been taking on him. He was always an active person -even if not by choice- but he\u2019d begun to notice that the long hikes, rough falls, and often the full out sprints that he engaged in were leaving him more and more winded every time. Rayfa\u2019s body was flexible, balanced, and still had plenty of youthful energy left in it. He knew that he was probably going to be in for a sore back when he returned to his old form, but there was no point in dwelling on such negative thoughts in the moment. Instead, he let himself focus on the moment, and how calm he felt to be relieved of his responsibilities over the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything else, Princess?\u201d The servant asked diligently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s good for today,\u201d Phoenix replied after a moment\u2019s consideration, stretching his new, spindly arms as he pulled himself up into a sitting position. Thankfully, no one here seemed willing to question why the Princess was speaking so much English. \u201cYou can go return to whatever you were doing now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, your benevolence,\u201d the woman replied with a bow as she made herself scarce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix tightened the robe he was wearing as he hopped to his feet, making a point to close it around the back. The robe wasn\u2019t a far cry from what Maya usually wore, but it was certainly made of finer materials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to wonder what Maya would think of this situation. Would she laugh at the fact that Phoenix was in a young girl\u2019s body, or would she be jealous that he got the perks of royalty? He half considered visiting her like this, but decided it might cheapen their reunion when he went back to his real body. For now, he was content to live free of concern. Rayfa didn\u2019t realize how spoiled she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Benevolence.\u201d Phoenix\u2019s revelry was interrupted as the older attendant, Nayna, came into the room. She gave a short bow like the rest of the staff, but Phoenix noticed that she seemed to be more informal than the rest of Rayfa\u2019s servants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What is it?\u201d He asked, a bit nervous. For some reason, she gave him an uneasy feeling. She seemed to know Rayfa more than the average person in the palace.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI would like for you to follow me. You are needed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Again, he had forgotten. <span class=\"clblue\">(Yeah, the Dance of Devotion would probably be pretty impossible in this,) </span>Phoenix agreed. <span class=\"clblue\">(Oh, no. The Dance of Devotion!)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMental \"gulp\"-ing aside, the whole trial was waiting on him. Phoenix grabbed all of Rayfa's ceremonial gear and changed into it, and then left for Tehm'pul Temple. <span class=\"clblue\">(So much for the perks of royalty,)</span> he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe High Court of Khura'in was as dark and oppressive-looking as the last time. The pillars towered over his head, even more so now that said head was so much closer to the ground. And that was before he noticed all the eyes of the gallery, watching his every move with an intensity greater than even the last time. Phoenix shuddered internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Benevolence!\" bellowed a voice from the Judge's bench he could barely see the top of. \"A moment longer and I would have missed my class again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix stared the Judge in the face, terrified. He was so paralyzed, he could have stood there for hours if the Judge's hearty laugh hadn't put him at ease a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only joking, princess. The only thing that could keep me here that long is that pesky lawyer showing up again. Ha ha ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see!\" Phoenix said, the irony of the Judge's statement only serving to terrify him further. \"Haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that Her Benevolence is here, we can begin. Prosecutor Payne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked over to the prosecutor's bench to see Gaspen, no longer wearing his gold suit, sash, or crown, instead opting for the brown suit of their first meeting. He seemed less assuming, somehow, his smug persona having apparently been shattered by the events of the previous trial. Phoenix couldn't help but hold in a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Magistry,\" said Payne. \"Your Benevolence, have you been informed of the identity of the victim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked around awkwardly, as if searching for some kind of secret exit out of this place. \"Nayna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayna approached his side at a speed that could only be described as cartoonish. \"Yes, Your Benevolence?\" Nayna whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I supposed to know about that?\" Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayna paused for a moment, looking to the side. She then turned back to him. \"I suspect the prosecutor forgot to send a message to you, but yes. Just pretend you know and the S\u00e9ance should still work.\" Nayna said, before darting off at a similarly cartoonish speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix firmly glared at Gaspen. \"Yes, I know, uh, <i>all I need to know</i>! Let us begin!\" He said, quickly reaching a crescendo. The gallery didn't react much at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it was time for the Divination S\u00e9ance. He'd only heard the speech once and seen the Dance twice, which he could only hope was enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take a miracle for him to pull this off at all, much less his first try. But does the \"miracle\" happen?</span></div></div>",

Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!\" now that the easy part was out of the way, it was time for the difficult part, the dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got into Rayfa's usual starting position, closed his eyes, and began to dance. He had only taken the first step before Rayfa's body's reflexes took over. Every move in the dance just came to him naturally, he wondered how many times Rayfa had done this over the years for her body to be able to do this on pure reflex. How many times has she seen the last moments of peoples lives? The mere implications of this disturbed Phoenix. She was still a young girl, but she had to deal with this who knows how often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the dance had finished, Phoenix opened his eyes and looked into the pool of souls, doing the dance perfectly was only part of the difficult. The most crucial part of this was something he wouldn't be in control of even if he had spent the entire two days in Rayfa's body practicing. Spiritual energy. It wouldn't matter how well he did the dance, if he had no spiritual energy, nothing would happen. The question now was, what was spiritual energy tied to? The body and the royal family's bloodline? Or the soul?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's question was answered as the pool of souls bubbled and an image begin to appear in it. The seance had worked. Phoenix and the rest of the courtroom looked into the pool of souls and watched the last moments before the victim's death. Phoenix looked over at the defendant of the current case and sure enough, the vision incriminated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defendant look as pale as a ghost, Phoenix imagined that they were going through the same feelings that he and Ahlbi had. He tried to console himself with the fact that he knew nothing about the person who was currently on trial, but the mere thought of <i>anyone</i> being put on trial with no defense disgusted him. Phoenix then made an important decision. Even if he was currently in the body of the royal priestess, he would defend this person with the best of his ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it appears that the defendant committed the crime. May they find peace in the twilight realm.\" The judge said and was about to slam down his gavel, but he was interrupted from and unexpected source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OBJECTION!\" Phoenix yelled in Rayfa's voice. The entire courtroom was shocked, the other day they had heard that word used in the courtroom for the first time in two decades by a foreign lawyer that they all hated, but now their own princess said it! \"Your magistry! Let me look over the vision, I'm sure I can find something that can prove the defendant's innocence!\" Phoenix asserted himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge stayed silent in shock. Was the princess being serious?! Was the princess willing to defend someone? Even if there was the risk of the D.C. act? What would the country do if the princess had to be punished under the act? He couldn't comprehend what was happening,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OBJECTION!\" Payne's shrill voice shouted. \"Your benevolence, your visions are always flawless. Surely this won't be-\" Payne stopped talking as Phoenix glared at him. Payne was smart enough not to argue with the royal priestess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your magisty, my seance was wrong the other day, please allow me to examine it thoroughly.\" Phoenix requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge was still confused, but he got a stern face and banged his gavel, silencing the gallery that was chatting among themselves about whether or not the princess had gone insane. \"Very well, your benevolence. You may examine the vision.\" The judge accepted Phoenix's request \"I have no idea what you're thinking, but this old servant of the Holy Mother will support you the whole way\" The judge added at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your magistry.\" Phoenix thanked the judge <i>'Where was this support when a little kid was being accused of murder'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPayne was still silent. He didn't know what to do! If he lost the trial, he would be humiliated. If he won, he would be going against the princess, which would no doubt cause the kingdom to hate him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix watched the vision closely, he was ready for a trial</span></div></div>",

This time it came much more easily to him now that he knew he was doing it right, but that didn't make it any less scary. The only change was that this time, an image actually appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image was nearly pure white. It seemed the victim heard footsteps as the silhouetted figure of a woman with tall hair approached with what looked like a knife in hand. The victim turned away from the light and ran, their footsteps joining the pursuer's, before a rush of pain struck and they fell to the ground. The memory ended there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix rewound the S\u00e9ance to the bright light. \"Hm... that light. Is that a sunset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gallery's eyes turned to Gaspen, who promptly fumbled with his papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prosecution has no alternative explanation at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Phoenix. \"Now, for my preliminary insights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked into the crowd. They all watched him with bated breath. \"The victim stared into the sunset, when the silhouette of the defendant approached. This frightened him, so he turned and ran, his footsteps echoing off the concrete floor. But his pursuer was too fast, and at that spot, the victim lost his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gallery looked to Gaspen. He took a breath. \"As was clearly demonstrated, Your Honor, the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I'm not done yet!\" Phoenix shouted. He could make out a few murmurs and gasps in the crowd when he did. \"Those were, as I said, only my preliminary insights. Mr. Payne, may I see the evidence for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Court went silent. Payne squinted at him, confused. \"For what purpose, Your Benevolence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would just like to see it, please. Nayna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayna obeyed, snatching the copy of the court record from Gaspen and handing it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it possible that he found a contradiction in the Court Record?</span></div></div>",

He thought about the way things went last time: it was insanely uphill keeping the judge's attention, and the crowd was hounding him the entire time. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect though was the thing that made the people of Khu'rain too afraid to even take up defense: The Defense Culpability Act. When Phoenix had defended Ahlbi, he put his own life on the line by association. That was a risk he had taken numerous times in his career, but he had employees and a kid back home to worry about. It was selfish, but Rayfa's body was like a shield. If there was one thing he learned from being Rayfa for two days, it was that she was very beloved by her country. Since he now knew he could perform a divination seance in her place, his impersonation was complete. Even if he lost defending someone, they'd never put her to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Seeing Rayfa take the defense might even change some minds,</i>' Phoenix mused. '<i>Although, defending from a teenage girl's body will be... a strange position to say the least.</i>' Still, Phoenix was accustomed to nothing but strange circumstances at this point in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Nayna in tow, Phoenix made his way 'home' back to the palace. He'd need to spend quite a bit of time reviewing this case if this was all going to end up being worth it. Thankfully, he had the authority to atleast demand SOME privacy in Rayfa's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Phoenix was faced with a dilemma that rarely struck him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What should I wear?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his normal body, Phoenix was accustomed to wearing the same blue suit whenever he had a case. It rarely changed, and he appreciated the constancy. When he was off the job, he just wore casual clothes. Now, however, he was in a totally different body with a much, much broader set of outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe <i>could</i> just wear Rayfa's usual channeling outfit, which she always wore to trial, but it didn't feel right. He wasn't going to this trial as a priestess, he was going as a defender! He needed something different to show that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to his previous mentor, Phoenix decided to go for something simple. Thankfully, western styles of dress weren't unheard of in Khu'rain. Inga - Rayfa's father - regularly wore a suit and tie. While it was lined with some distracting light blue patterns and the buttons seemed to be made of a reflective silver, Phoenix eventually managed to come across a mostly normal black suit in Rayfa's vast wardrobe, complete with a silk tie and a mid-length business skirt. He opted to have the servants simplify Rayfa's hair as well, holding it up behind his head rather than on the sides in its usual pretzel-looking shape. The tiara and the facial markings had to stay, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving his temporary form a look over in the mirror, Phoenix was satisfied. Rayfa probably wouldn't appreciate the transformation, but Phoenix needed to feel like a lawyer if he was going to enter that court as one. Even if that meant wearing a skirt, he'd do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing escorted by Rayfa's usual entourage, Phoenix knew that he was drawing the eyes of many. Her bodyguards and servants didnt dare protest him, but he knew they found the 'princess's' knew behavior to be more than odd. Some of the citizens he passed along the way seemed to scarcely recognize her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident in his ability to handle the situation even without his usual form, Phoenix strode into the court with Rayfa's small legs to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This prosecutor seemed to be a Khuranist monk with long silver hair and a necklace of beads. The prosecutor had their eyes closed and appeared to be praying. Phoenix wondered if this was what a typical Khura'in prosecutor looked like. \"I thought Payne was in charge of the prosecution of this case?\" Phoenix said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new prosecutor opened his eyes and looked over to Phoenix \"Unfortunately, chief prosecutor Payne couldn't attend today's trial. He informed us that a dog ate his prosecutor's badge. I have come to take his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'They actually fell for that lame excuse?'</i> Phoenix thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge then spoke up \"Your Benevolence, are you positive you want to go through with this?\" He asked. \"While I'm sure that you won't be executed under the DC act, I cannot guarantee that you will not receive some form of punishment if you fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix hadn't thought about that. Yes, there was no chance he would be executed or arrested, but what if some other punishment were to be passed onto Rayfa because of him? He chose not to think about that, it was too late to turn back now \"Yes, your Magistry. I will take on the defense in this trial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prosecutor sighed \"It appears that the foreign attorney's putrid ideals have affected our royal priestess' mind. Oh holy mother, give me the strength do deal with this child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, be careful what you say about the royal family.\" The judge warned the prosecutor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the two minutes he had known him so far, Phoenix already didn't like this prosecutor. Although, despite the cold attitude he was showing so far, something felt off. The more he looked at Sahdmadhi, the more Phoenix noticed that he seemed sad to be prosecuting against Rayfa. Phoenix supposed that no one would be happy about going against their princess and brushed it off.</span></div></div>",

He had been wasting the court's time trying to save a man who in all likelihood took someone else's life. In nearly every case he took, he started from the assumption that the defendant was not guilty, and moved on from there, but what if, here, he was simply wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well?\" Prosecutor Payne asked, \"What did your 'preliminary insights' discover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWright paused for a moment, scanning over the papers again, trying to hide the distress that rang through his mind as his philosophy was met with the stark reality that sometimes, the initial investigation actually finds the guilty client. Quite a world-shattering event, I know. Giving one last thumbing through the papers, he closed his eyes, moving his thumb up and down on the staff in what would be an obvious tell to his distress had Apollo been at the trial, before opening them again and outstretching his arm towards the court in a flourish that he felt was distinctly in character for the Kuhrainese princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My preliminary insights have confirmed that everything in this vision is correct!\" Phoenix shouted, then gave a smirk that killed him on the inside, \"I apologize for my misuse of the court's time. I simply wished to ensure that this defendant scum was guilty. We all know what happens when some foolish defense attorney comes in and meddles in the court's affairs, do we not? I was simply making sure that, if they were here, they would find nothing. And, in my personal but highly informed opinion, they would certainly not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge nods, \"Yes, that is completely understandable.

Thank you for ensuring that nothing like that will be occurring today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProsecutor Payne clears his throat, then opened, in Phoenix's opinion, his big stupid mouth, \"Well, with that out of the way, I believe that we should move on to more pressing concerns: the sentencing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Phoenix speak up for this portion of the trial?</span></div></div>",

Um, of course,\" Phoenix replied. \"I'll head over right away.\" In his two days at the palace, Phoenix was fortunate enough to not interact with Rayfa's parents. He had to feel a little bad for her to be honest; it mustn't be easy for a child whose parents are always so busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your clothes?\" the old maid asked, raising an eyebrow inquisitively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked down at the outfit he was in. It must have been some cultural ignorance on his behalf, because to his eyes, it didn't look much less formal than anything else people wore around the palace. He supposed he would follow along with Nayna's suggestions though - it <i>was</i> her job to aid the princess after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Phoenix replied, as he brushed past Nayna to make his way towards Rayfa's (temporarily his) bed chambers. As Nayna followed behind, he sheepishly asked, \"would you... mind helping me get dressed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly thereafter, Phoenix clad in Rayfa's usual cloak and dress - with her hair tied up and adorned by her tiara - stepped into the audience chamber as regally as he could. Nayna kept her distance - hidden in the shadows somewhere presumably. If Phoenix had to guess, the family must have had her hide herself less she disturb the princess's regal air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Rayfa, my dear,\" a woman's voice rang out from the end of the hall. It had a soft texture to it, but something about it felt a bit off - maybe forced. The acoustics brought it to Phoenix's ears long before he was even near the throne. \"We have been most eager to meet with you.,\" she said, her expression not especially showing any emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed we have,\" a gruffer, male voice, broke out. Phoenix suddenly became aware of the smell of cigar smoke in the air, as Inga revealed himself as well, standing next to the throne. \"We have some... vital matters to discuss with you,\" he repeated. Phoenix had actually had the... pleasure of meeting Inga before, after the initial trial where he put his life on the line for his tour guide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Are these two always this threatening?'</i> he wondered, feeling especially exposed with goosebumps running up and down his now hairless arms and legs. \"Y-yes, of course.

We would in particular like for you to visit Khurain village in California - something of an enclave for the faithful there. We have some business for you to attend on our behalf.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix blinked in surprise at that last part. Khurain was where Maya was born! In fact, it wasn't far from his home at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand, Rayfa?\" The Queen's voice remained level, but Phoenix had to admit that there was an intimidating quality to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes ma'am!\" Phoenix replied with a bow. He realized 'Your Highness' would probably have been more appropriate, and Rayfa's parents did seem to raise an eyebrow at his word choice, but pushed it no further. One more perk of being a princess, he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. We have arranged for an aide to prepare you with information relevant to the trip. You will be departing in only a few days time. We expect great results.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Phoenix responded once more in Rayfa's voice, bowing again before turning to leave the hall. He found himself exhaling loudly once he was no longer in the audience chamber; it was a relief to be gone from the intimidating presence of the Queen and her husband. He had been lucky enough to avoid their company for the two days before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured that Nayna was likely keeping an eye from a corner somewhere, so he kept his thoughts quiet as he walked. As fun as it was being Rayfa, he came to this country to see his friend. It would defeat the point to take a trip <i>back</i> to the states. Not to mention, it would leave him very far from his body. Overall, he couldn't think of a lot of ways that going would make sense. He'd probably have to just leave Rayfa's body now to let her make her preparations on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, he knew he'd have to take the remote out from its hiding place and use it once again. He pushed the door open to Rayfa's room, a large white and gold chamber that housed a large bed, a larger armoire, a makeup table to the far right corner, and its own restroom as well. He could hear the sounds of birds outside and even the croaking of a frog from the pond beneath the window. It was beautiful, luxurious, and peaceful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dammit, I like it too much here.' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went to where he had stashed the device, he told himself again that this was always a temporary situation.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uh, no. I just needed a moment to calm down.\" Phoenix told the driver. Phoenix decided that he'd prefer to go around the city instead of seeing the palace. Sure, if he went to the palace he would be able to see areas that would be off limits to tourists like him, but he was more interested in seeing the Kingom of Khura'in itself than the palace. \"Please, just drop me off somewhere around here.\" Phoenix said to the driver. In terms of the remote, Phoenix decided to keep as tight a hold on the remote as he could until he could find a safe place to put it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver parked the limo on the side of the road and Phoenix exited. The transition from being in the limo to being in the breezy outdoors really highlighted how weird Phoenix felt wearing a skirt. As the limo drove away, Phoenix wondered where to go. He imagined that no matter where he would go he would have to deal with large crowds wanting to speak with Princess Rayfa. He supposed he had better mentally prepare himself for that <i>'I've dealt with crowds chanting for me to die, I can probably deal with them praising me'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while he knew that no matter where he went there would be crowds, he still had no idea where to go. He was still a tourist after all, he barely knew a thing about Khura'in in general, and that included any interesting locations. That's when a little light-bulb went off in Phoenix's head, he knew a tour guide! He had even planned to meet up with Ahlbi when he was in his own body. Of course, he would probably have to come up with some excuse as to why the Kingdom's own princess would need a tour, but he would probably think one up, probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix began to make his was to where he had said he would meet up with Ahlbi in his own body, he passed by many people who praised and talked to him. Some spoke in English, others spoke in Khura'inese. Some people were just giving praise to and praying for Rayfa, others were actually bringing up various Khura'in related problems they had wanted to talk to the princess about. Phoenix had no idea how to act like a princess, let alone one from a completely different country, so he just waved to and thanked the people who praised him and told the people who were actually bringing up problems that he would listen to them later, hopefully by then he would have already left Rayfa's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that he wasn't really paying attention to what these people were saying and not giving much thought into his responses, Phoenix was getting mentally exhausted as he made his way through the crowds. Rayfa must have a less relaxing time than he had first thought if she had to deal with things like this all the time, he had only been in her body for a little under half an hour and he was getting tired, she had to deal with these kinds of things all the time. After a few more minutes of walking, Phoenix was getting close to where he had agreed to meet up with Ahlbi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he was close, he spoke into the entire crowd and put on his best impression of an elegant ruler \"Citizens, I have some, uh, important business to attend to. I ask of you to clear out and let me attend to it.\" It wasn't the best in the world, but thankfully the citizens were loyal to Rayfa and they cleared out. After about a minute of looking around, Phoenix found Ahlbi and his own body. Ahlbi was showing his own body around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix waved to Ahlbi, who was understandably awestruck at seeing the princess waving to him with a smile. As Phoenix walked over Ahlbi bowed and greeted him \"Your Benevolence, hap'piraki!\" Ahlbi greeted him. Phoenix's own body gave a similar greeting, but was clearly a fair bit more nervous about it..Phoenix knew exactly why his own body was nervous, after all it was him, Rayfa had nearly sentenced him to death and now, as far as his body knew, she was suddenly happy to see him and Ahlbi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Benevolence, what are you doing here?\" Ahlbi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Phoenix had thought up an excuse as to why 'Rayfa' would want a tour while he was walking through the crowds on the way over. He once again put up the elegant ruler act. \"Ahlbi, you're a tour guide correct. Well, I need to do a test of your tour to make sure you don't give off a bad impression of our country to foreigners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhlbi's eyes practically sparkled as he heard he had the chance to escort Princess Rayfa around, but before he accepted he turned to Phoenix's own body \"I'm very sorry Mr. Wright. I can't show you around tonight, but don't worry! I'll make sure to spend twice as much time showing you around tommorow! I'll even rework my tour so I can tell you absolutely everything that I know about the places we go to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's own body rubbed the back of it's head. \"That's okay Ahlbi, you don't have to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do! We have so much we have to see! I'll make sure you wake up super early tomorrow so we don't lose any progress!\" Ahlbi insisted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix could feel a drop of sweat go down his face, he probably just sentenced himself to several extremely long speeches from Ahbli about the history of Khura'in tomorrow. <i>'Maybe I could have the second me sit through all of that'</i> Phoenix considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Phoenix's own body had left, Ahlbi turned to Phoenix in Rayfa's body and began to speak \"Your Benevolence, where would you like to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ahlbi. I want you to treat me like a regular tourist. Don't call me 'Your Benevolence' and assume I know absolutely nothing about the country.\" Phoenix told Ahbli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Benevo- I mean, Rayfa. Oh!.\" Ahlbi said then pulled out a Magatah'man. \"For you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Phoenix said as he accepted the Magatah'man and began to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be twenty dahmas.\" Alhbi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Phoenix said, losing the elegant ruler act now that he had convinced Ahlbi to treat him like a normal person. \"But I'm the Princess. Why do I have to pay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlhbi looked a bit sad \"But you told me to treat you like a normal tourist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I guess I walked into that one'</i> Phoenix thought. \"Okay, I'll pay you for this next time I go to the palace, but from this point on I want you to not charge me for anything.\" Phoenix told Ahlbi. While he was sure Rayfa could easily afford anything in this country, he didn't want Rayfa to have to explain to anyone why she was suddenly spending money on tours of her own country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Let's begin the tour!\" Ahlbi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Before we go, I need you to put this in your bag.\" Phoenix said, he saw an opportunity to stash away the remote. He doubted that Ahlbi would lose the remote, especially if the princess herself gave it to him. \"Don't touch any of the buttons on it.\" Phoenix emphasized as Ahlbi put the remote in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix spent the next hour or so on the tour with Ahlbi. Things went well. Ahlbi was good at giving tours, even if he did often talk to long about various topics. While there was the occasional person walking up to Phoenix and wanting to talk to Rayfa about something, Phoenix was getting okay at brushing people off and saying he would listen to them some other time. The tour was going well, until Ahlbi bag began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ahlbi's dog Shah'do jumped out of Ahlbi's bag. That wouldn't have been a big deal, but Phoenix saw what was in Shah'do's mouth, the remote! Phoenix gasped when he saw it. Ahlbi noticed too and walked up to Shah'do and tried to take the remote out of the dog's mouth. However, Shah'do wouldn't let go. Ahlbi soon got into a struggle with Shah'do for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Ahlbi accidentally use the remote while struggling with Shah'do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoenix practically panicked as he saw Ahlbi accidentally push one of the buttons. He ran over to stop them before Ahlbi pressed another button, but he was too late. Suddenly, Phoenix's prospective changed, he was a few feet away from where he had been standing, but more importantly, he was tiny! Even Ahlbi looked like a giant to him right now. He also had something metallic in his mouth, but it wasn't in for long before Ahlbi pulled it out. That's when Phoenix saw what it was, the remote! Phoenix tried to say something, but all that came out of his mouth was a bark. That was all Phoenix needed to realize what had happened. He had become Shah'do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix tried to run toward Ahlbi, but he couldn't get used to having four legs and barely made any distance. That's when he realized, if he was Shah'do, then was Shah'do Rayfa?! He looked over to see a crowd of people around 'Rayfa'. From an outsider's perspective it looked like Rayfa somehow forgot how to stand, judging from how wobbly her legs were. There was also a distinct look of fear on her face. Phoenix prayed that nothing that would require Shah'do in Rayfa's body to actually move around or talk would happen before he could get the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phoenix could do anything else, Ahlbi suddenly picked him up and put him in his bag. Phoenix wanted to jump out like Shah'do had done a few minutes ago, but due to the fact he wasn't used to the dog's body, he could do it. His one hope was that Ahlbi would put the remote back in the bag and he would use it when he did, but Ahlbi wasn't putting it in. Probably because he was worried Shah'do would steal it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile with Shah'do in Rayfa's body. A group of guards came up to what they thought was Rayfa \"Your benevolence. Your presence has been requested at the palace. Please come with us.\" The guards said. All that came out of 'Rayfa's' mouth was a series of barks and whimpers, though the noise of the crowd around Rayfa drowned them out. As the guards escorted 'Rayfa' to the limo from earlier, Shah'do tried multiple times to go down on four limbs and crawl, but every time he tried a guard would pick him up, thinking that Rayfa was tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix heard everything that had happened from within Ahlbi's bag, thanks to Shah'do's dog body having great hearing. He couldn't believe it, in the span of two hours he had not only put himself in a dog's body, but he also put a dog into the body of royalty. He needed to fix this fast, but to do that he would first have to get the remote from Ahlbi and get back to a human body. He just prayed that Ahlbi wouldn't use it or worse, lose it.</span></div></div>",

Of all the time Shah'do could have jumped out of the bag and try to take something, why did it have to happen while he was showing the princess around?! Ahlbi sighed \"We're probably going to get in trouble for this, Shah'do.\" Alibi said to what he thought was his dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix felt bad for Ahlbi, from his perspective it looked like he had upset the Princess of his country. Thankfully Rayfa Won't have any memory of any of this, so the poor kid probably won't get in trouble. Phoenix decided that he could worry about Ahlbi now, he needed to find a way to get out of Shah'do's bldy. Getting Shah'do out of Rayfa's body was his second priority, but he couldn't fix Shah'do from a dog's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhlbi had put the remote in his bag next to Phoenix after 'Rayfa' left. <i>'I just need to reach it and press Possession'</i> Phoenix tried to move his body closer and press the button <i>'C'mon. Almost there.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Phoenix was about to press it, the top of Ahlbi's bag was opened and Ahlbi reached in to grab the remote. Phoenix cursed his luck. \"We should return this to the Princess next time we see her.\" Ahlbi said aloud while looking at the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhlbi looked at the remote from all angles, but no matter how he looked at it, he couldn't figure out what it was for. The buttons were all labeled, but he couldn't understand what any of them meant without context. \"What did the Princess use this for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ahlbi turned over the remote, he didn't pay attention to his fingers as they passed over the buttons, one slight slip and he may accidently press one. Phoenix knew he had to stop him, things could get complicated if Ahlbi used the remote. He began to shake the bag, hoping to draw away Ahlbi's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhlbi was still looking over the remote, he was holding it backwards and it was now pointing at himself.

As the dog let go, both of them fell backwards from inertia, sending the sound of bells ringing out. But as Phoenix opened his eyes, he realized he had managed to prevent the worst. He was still himself - that was, Rayfa. He quickly picked himself up off the ground and began straightening out Rayfa's skirt, which had been messed up during the tumble down. Everything about her was a bit too frail - even her clothes! Thankfully, her body was unhurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry for that Princess Rayfa,\" Ahlbi began to say profusely as he also pulled himself up. \"I don't know what got into him! I swear he's usually a good dog!\" Ahlbi plucked a barking Shah'do from the ground and tried to put the dog back into his bag, but instead the pup leaped out of his arms and onto his head. Ahlbi gave a tired sigh, resigned to his failure. \"So... uh, would you like to resume the tour?\" he asked, hands placed nervously behind his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix suddenly felt a lot more vulnerable after that near miss, so he wasn't so sure about continuing, especially with that dog about. He shook his head, \"I'm not so sure Ahlbi. After that incident, I think I'm done for today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhlbi, for his part, seemed crestfallen at the rejection. \"Well, alright princess. I hope you enjoyed the tour.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did very well!\" He replied, hands up, \"you just... uh, shouldn't bring your dog is all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, \"I guess I ought to find somewhere easier to keep him...\" he trailed off and his eyes drifted as he began to eye Phoenix's hand. \"Say, your benevolence, if I can ask, what is that thing anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix flicked an eye over, realizing he was holding the device right up for Ahlbi to see. <i>'Hope he doesn't read english...</i>' For now, it'd probably be best kept a secret, but Phoenix did momentarily have the thought to share his finding with Ahlbi. He didn't necessarily have to reveal that he was Phoenix, but he could maybe let Ahlbi see what the remote did. The kid led a difficult life, and was accused of murder only a little while ago, maybe he could benefit from some sort of break? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, Ahlbi,\" Phoenix began with Rayfa's voice. \"This thing...\" </span></div></div>",

Ahlbi seemed confused at first, but as Phoenix explained what the remote\u2019s functions to him, Alhbi\u2019s expression turned to one of wonder and amazement. He seemed particularly interested when Phoenix explained the Possession function and how it turned the user into a ghost form that could possess bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossession?! Does that have anything to do with Spirit Channeling and Divination S\u00e9ances?\u201d Ahlbi asked, eyes gleaming with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sorta, but with this someone living can take over the body of another living person, even if they had no spiritual power.\u201d Phoenix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!

He had nothing against Ahlbi using it, but at the same time he was a bit worried. Ahlbi was just a kid after all, if he and Ahlbi were to get separated while Ahlbi was in another body, he couldn't imagine what would happen. Of course, Ahlbi and him getting separated was only one possibility, it was entirely possible that nothing bad would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Phoenix let Ahlbi use the remote?</span></div></div>",

He could have possessed literally anyone, and Phoenix couldn't exactly walk up to random people and ask \"Hey, are you Ahlbi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix went and sat on a nearby bench and began to think things through. There were several stray looks from passerbys, but after spending several hours in Rayfa's body, Phoenix got used to the looks. Too bad he was far off from getting used to interacting with those people. \"Ahlbi mentioned he wanted to spend time as a tourist.\" Phoenix thought aloud. The kingdom of Khura'in was relatively small and wasn't exactly a popular tourist spot. Phoenix hadn't even seen any other tourists since he had arrived in Khura'in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over for a little while longer, Phoenix had two ideas of who Ahlbi could currently be. The first could be Phoenix himself, or rather Phoenix's body that is currently not under his control. Ahlbi wanted to become a tourist and who would be better to become than the newest tourist who knew next to nothing about the country. If Ahlbi had possessed Phoenix's own body, he could ask his own body to give him a basic tour of the Kingdom and see if his basic tour could use any improvements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second idea that came into Phoenix's head about who Ahlbi could have possessed. Phoenix's own assistant, Maya Fey. While Maya had been in the Kingdom of Kurha'in for a little over two years, it was entirely possible that she hadn't been given a complete tour and hadn't seen some parts of the Kingdom. If Ahlbi possessed her, he could convince his own body to give him a tour of some less known spots in the Kingdom and see if that part of the tour needed some work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to sit around any more, Phoenix stood up and straightened out Rayfa's skirt. Unfortunately, Rayfa didn't have a watch and there weren't any clocks nearby. Phoenix looked up to the sky, it seemed to be getting dark, but he had no way of telling exactly what time it was. He began to walk over to the temple. Even if he showed up early, he could spend time walking around as Rayfa to pass the time until Ahlbi arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later on, Phoenix saw a familiar body wave to him and begin to run over. \"Your benevolence, it's me, Ahlbi.\" Ahlbi whispered from his borrowed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix laughed and rubbed the back of Rayfa's head \"Yeah, I figured.\" although Phoenix knew without a doubt that the person in front of him was Ahlbi, it was still strange to think of the person standing in front of him was someone else. What body was Ahlbi in?</span></div></div>",

Apollo had been a part of several high profile cases since he met Mr. Wright, and the agency was beginning to bustle again. Mr. Wright himself was even considering getting his badge back in order to become a lawyer once again after his name had been cleared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe parked outside the building, bringing his bike inside since their was nowhere to chain it up outside. It would've seemed unprofessional, but the lobby for the agency was already loaded with props and trinkets belonging to Mr. Wright's daughter, Trucy. \"Someone ought to make her clean the place up,\" he grumbled as he stepped over boxes, hoops, and the like over to the small room that had been declared his office. Phoenix himself reserved the largest room, by virtue of seniority. Apollo thought this unfair, since he wasn't even a lawyer at the moment, but Mr. Wright owned the building, so he made the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo failed to notice one of the items cluttering the floor however, and went tumbling down into the pile of stuff, landing on a dirty plate that was presumably there from the night before. \"Lovely...\" he said as he pushed himself up, looking back to see what he had tripped on. It was a small cardboard box, and as he looked it over, he realized it was addressed to him, but there was no word on who sent it. \"Why wouldn't I have already seen this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo grabbed the package from the floor and decided to take it into the room with him, sitting down at the small desk reserved for the office's junior partner, and looked over the contents. It was a remote with a set of instructions for its use: body swapping (aware/unaware), shapeshifting, and possession. \"Did Trucy buy this in my name? Sounds like something she'd want,\" Apollo said, \"well, I suppose it has my name on it. I may as well try it right? I have nothing to do until I get a case anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo considered ways to use it; he could maybe use it on Mr. Wright or Trucy if just to shuffle things around in the office. He was the only lawyer, but they still treated him like the lowest rung on the totem pole since he was new. Mr. Wright owned the place and Trucy could do whatever she wanted; maybe they could be in his position for day! He could also just try to have fun in a less vindictive way, either on his own or with a friend. Otherwise, Apollo figured he could wait until an opportunity came up to use it practically; this would make a nice investigation tool for sure, and if he spent the day trying to goof off, there was a chance he'd miss a client. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Apollo decide on? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He skeptically read over the directions, and ascertained that it was some kind of body swap device. He strongly doubted it was true, but he was willing to admit that the possibilities it presented were more than intriguing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I have nothing to lose trying it out,\" Apollo said to himself as he spun it around in his hands. \"If it works, then I've clearly won the lottery. And if its a prank, well, whoever sent it clearly put a lot of effort into it. I ought to humor them.\" The box and instructions laid on the coffee table, and Apollo decided to scoop them up and hide them in his office space for the moment, lest someone else come across them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo glanced over the functions once more, trying to figure out which one to use first. He had to admit, after the last couple of months being swamped with cases, he'd like to be someone else for a bit and just take a breather. The last case at the space station was particularly stressful for him. If he wanted some time off, then the possession and aware swap functions would definitely be his best choices. The former seemed to have less consequence, but it would be a bit... amoral to take someone's body without them being able to show dissent. Aware swap would be a bit more ethical, but he'd have to convince the other person to go along with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shape shift function definitely seemed the most utilitarian; Apollo could imagine it being useful on a case. No one had to become aware and technically no one had their body stolen, but Apollo would seem missing to everyone else, and he ran the risk of running into whoever's body he took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally, there was unaware swap. Apollo couldn't really see a practical use for that one, but he admitted it would definitely be a funnier option. Swapping himself with a coworker or just swapping two coworkers around and having everyone act like it was normal would take the edge off the day for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, he figured it was pointless to overthink it when he didn't even know if the device worked yet.

He looked down at the body he was now in and immediately recognized who he was. The yellow suit and skirt he now wore, the device around his neck, and the orange hair that was now falling into his face. He was now in the body of his co-worker Athena Cykes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That remote really does work.\" Apollo said, surprised to hear his Athena's voice coming out of his mouth. This remote was by all means impossible, but he couldn't exactly deny the fact that it worked. Speaking of the remote, it was somehow in his hand now. It seemed the remote traveled with you when you used the possession button. That was convenient, if his own body still had the remote he would have to go through a lot of trouble to get it back, he guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was in a body again, he wondered what he should do. The manual said that when he was in someone else's body, his own body would act like nothing happened. So, he could just go somewhere in Athena's body and relax for the rest of the day.

He could go somewhere else in town and do something else until it got a bit later. Athena's body was getting hungry, he could go somewhere and get something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo supposed that just standing around in the hallway wasn't going to do anything and began to head out of the building.

While she didn\u2019t own anything particuarlly fancy, her clothes also weren\u2019t poor. She had an average wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo looked through her clothes to see if anything in particular caught his mind, nothing really did, he didn\u2019t know much about women\u2019s clothing.

With nothing else catching his eye, Apollo took out the unifom and decided to put it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was a bit weird to put on a school uniform and wear it around the house, Apollo brushed off those thoughts thinking that no one else would see him wearing it. Plus, wearing an outfit like this may help him adapt to being in a female body, even if it was only temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a bit hesitant, Apollo soon took off Athena\u2019s suit and began to change clothes. He made sure to keep his eyes closed to protect Athena\u2019s privacy. Although changing with his eyes closed was a bit of a challenge, but he percivered. Almost every movement he made while putting on the clothes felt strange to him. Once he had finished putting on the old school uniform, he went over to a mirror to make sure he had put it on right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, he realized that he may have underestimated how long it had been since Athena had last worn this uniform. It was small on her and left her midriff exposed. While Apollo supposed he should go and put on an outfit that actually fit right, He decided against it, do to not wanting to go through the pains of changing with his eyes closed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with the change of clothes, Apollo went over to Athena\u2019s kitchen to go get something to eat\u2026.</span></div></div>",

After all, she had thought she was speaking with her best friend, not some random person who had her friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about not telling you earlier...I wanted to help you out, but it felt like my advice was really bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper calmed down for a moment since the person in front of her looked embarrassed, not at all like someone who might want to silence her for figuring out their secret. \"But...if you're not Thena, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually Apollo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Juniper settled down again, Apollo explained how he had found the remote in the mail and wanted to try see if it was real. He explained the possession feature, which gave him immediate feedback in regards to the remote actually working. He also said that he hadn't meant to possess Athena; he just leaped at the first chance he had when someone got back to the agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...you've just stayed in Thena's body since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I was kind of curious about being a girl. Felt like a waste to just do paperwork all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how long were you planning on keeping her body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just until I got back to the office tomorrow. Any longer and I think Athena might get mad. If it's just one day, I could probably get by if I offered to share the remote with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well, that's good. I can't say that I wouldn't be as curious as you if I had found that remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...and I am really sorry about the terrible advice. If you want, my offer about using the remote to help you out still stands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper carefully considered what Apollo was offering.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he entered the person, everything sort of went black for a second, so thanks to his hastiness, he didn't actually get to see who's body he was entering. As his vision returned, though, something definitely felt off. He was human again, but the body he'd entered felt rather different to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at the hand that had been raised to knock on the door. It seemed small and feminine, covered by a white, fingerless glove. He lowered his arm, seeing the feminine hand lower on his command. He probably shouldn't have been surprised, considering he'd been a ghost a few seconds ago, but it was still somewhat off-putting to see a hand that was clearly not his moving as if it was. Of course, now he knew why his body felt so different; he was no longer a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his new body, seeing the pink dress he was clothed in, and the long, brown braids falling into his field of view. It took him a moment, not being used to seeing it from this perspective, but he recognised the body he was in. He was in the body of Athena's childhood friend, Juniper Woods. After meeting up with Athena again after getting charged with murder twice, Juniper had been stopping by at the office every now and then on days when she didn't have any classes. Apollo supposed she must have been doing that today, although it was a little odd that she showed up before Athena had even arrived at the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the hand that hadn't been used to knock, Apollo noticed that he was still holding the remote. It had disappeared when he used the possession function, so he supposed now that he'd found a body, it had reappeared in his hand. He did feel a little bad about taking Juniper's body, even if he hadn't meant for it to be her, but perhaps this was what he needed. Juniper likely didn't have anything else she needed to do today if she was visiting the office, so maybe he could use her body to take a little time off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could decide what to do, Apollo hear footsteps from the other side of the door. His body must have heard Juniper knocking, just like he did, and was coming to answer the door. Now Apollo was more than a little nervous. He knew that taking someone else's body would likely involve having to try and act like them, but he wasn't prepared for it to happen so soon. He especially wasn't prepared to interact with his own body, talking to a copy of himself. If he didn't get his nerves under control, his copy would probably perceive that something was wrong and question him about it. Maybe he should just leave before his copy opened the door. If he could get away quickly enough, maybe he could avoid the situation altogether...</span></div></div>",

I'm sure Wright and Fey would have appreciated it more.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth pushed the contents of the package aside and resumed his work, organizing files and sorting out paperwork.

Was it a prank? Would it just make a noise and do nothing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth wasn't willing to seek out a test subject -he'd just look foolish and overzealous- so he was about to throw it out when his phone began to rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Edgeworth!\" Miles could hear Detective Gumshoe on the other line. \"You there, pal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes detective?

He supposed it wouldn't hurt.

He felt... smaller. He felt a breeze over his legs, which he realized were covered only by a white skirt. A small white hat had fallen to the ground in front of him as well - just like the one Rhoda wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what's happened!\" A deep voice called out.

That's insane!\" Rhoda cried out. Hearing his own voice in such a panic was rather unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Edgeworth replied, trying to sound cool, \"yet here we are. Don't panic Ms. Teneiro, this should be perfectly reversible.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhoda fixated Edgeworth's eyes on the device that was now in her hands. \"Do you have any idea where this thing might've come from?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth shook his head, Rhoda's bangs shaking left and right as he did, \"not at all. In fact, this is the first time I've used it at all. I assumed it to be a hoax.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence for a moment. Rhoda suddenly seemed to be rather deep in though. \"So, if I just click these buttons, then we turn back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be correct. I assume you would like to switch back without delay, correct?\" Miles was certainly ready to go back into his own body.

This time, there was no way he could deny that something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth suddenly felt very different. His felt smaller, more delicate. His arms and legs felt exposed, and he was pushed up onto the balls of his feet. He could feel something resting atop his head, and something pulling his hair back behind him. But most importantly, he could feel a void between his legs, and a weight hanging from his chest. Even just looking at the delicate hand that was holding the remote told Edgeworth everything he needed to know about what had happened; he has swapped bodies with Rhoda Teneiro. He was at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mr. Edgeworth?\" Edgeworth heard a voice that sounded remarkably like his own. Looking up at the source of the voice, he saw none other than his own body, as was to be expected. No doubt Rhoda was now inhabiting his body. \"Was something supposed to happen?\" she asked. It seemed the remote was doing exactly as promised. Not only had it managed to switch their bodies around, but Rhoda was none the wiser. She, along with everyone else in the world except Edgeworth, likely thought that the two of them had always looked like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, nevermind, it's nothing,\" Edgeworth managed to get out, a bit off-put when he heard Rhoda's voice come out of his mouth instead of his own. Although the test had been a success, he wasn't sure he should say anything. As far as Rhoda was concerned, this was all normal. He thought it best to keep this quiet for the time being, it may come in handy later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay. Shall we go then?\" Rhoda said, gesturing towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth nodded, and said, \"Yes, let's go.\" He did agree to go have lunch with her, after all. That said, Edgeworth wasn't sure he felt comfortable walking around in Rhoda's body. Perhaps it would be best to swap back before he left.</span></div></div>",

Rhoda saw him use the remote a minute ago and assumed that it did nothing, however, if he were to pull it back out again right now she would surely question what it did and Edgeworth didn't want to share what the remote did with anyone just yet. Not until he had tested each of it's functions and was sure that no part of it was defective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Edgeworth and Rhoda walked outside to go somewhere to have lunch. Edgeworth got a feel for walking around in Rhoda's body, it was strange and unfamiliar. The breeze he felt along his legs and not to mention the slight bounce on his chest he felt every step made it nearly impossible for him to focus on Rhoda, who was talking about what she had been up to since they parted ways after the investigation a while back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Edgeworth and Rhoda arrived at a small place that Edgeworth had picked out. They served both food and tea here, plus it was close to his office, so he came here often. Edgeworth ordered some tea for himself and began to talk to Rhoda about what he had been up to since they last met. As Edgeworth drank his tea, he noticed that it tasted different than usual. He figured that must have been because the taste buds on Rhoda's tongue were different than his own. Thankfully, the the tea didn't tast particularly unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhoda and Edgeworth talked for a while. It wasn't too often that Edgeworth was able to talk with someone for an extensive period of time, when he wasn't investigating a crime scene that is. Even with the strange sensations of Rhoda's body, he found this talk to be enjoyable. Once Rhoda had finished some food that she had ordered and Edgeworth had finished his tea. They paid and left the eatery. \"Thanks for coming out to eat with me. It was nice to catch up.\" Rhoda thanked Edgeworth in his own voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was quite enjoyable. I hope we can have a conversation like this again.\" Edgeworth said with a smile. He gave a bow, but because he had forgotten about Rhoda's hat and it fell to the ground. He picked it up, thankfully this reminded him that he had to switch back. He grabbed the remote, pointed it at himself, and prepares to use it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before he could press the button to switch back, Edgeworth heard an unfamiliar ring tone. He figured that it was Rhoda's phone and returned his focus to the remote. However, Rhoda spoke up and interrupted him. \"Um, isn't that your phone ringing?\" She asked Edgeworth. It was then Edgeworth realized that the ringing was indeed coming from what 'Was' Rhoda's phone, but was now 'his'. The ownership of the phones must have been switched, similar to how their clothes were switched around during the Unaware Swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered the phone \"Hello? Miles Edgeworth speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was greeted by the frantic voice of Detective Gumshoe on the other end \"Mr. Edgeworth! You gotta come quick! There's been a murder at Gourd Lake!\" Gumshoe reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth should have expected something like this to happen. Sometimes it seems that this city couldn't go a week without some kind or murder. \"Alright detective, I'll be there in a few minutes. Make sure no civilians go near the crime scene.\" Edgeworth said before he hung up. He turned to Rhoda \"I'm sorry we have to cut this short, but there's been a crime.\" He explained to her and then took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suddenness of the situation had caused him to forget about the fact that he needed to swap back with Rhoda and by the time he had noticed he had already parted ways with her a while ago. He would just have to find her and swap back later, but for now, he would have to put his full attention on this case. Even if he would have to handle it in an unfamiliar body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short while Edgeworth had arrived at Gourd Lake. He was greeted by the familiar faces of Edgeworth and Kay. \"You're here, Mr. Edgeworth! Me and the other cops have been searching this place top to bottom, searching for evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay rubbed her nose. \"Oh, Gummy. You should know by now that Mr. Edgeworth always finds stuff that you miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't look down on me, Pal! You're little thief thing can't even help investigate without the evidence it needs to recreate what happened!\" Gumshoe said, defending his usefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth let them argue, his mind was occupied by another thought. Could the remote help him with the investigation? The more thought he gave it, the more he realized that the Possession button would be rather useful here. If he used it and possessed either Gumshoe or Kay, then there would be two of him at the crime scene investigating. As his own, or rather, Rhoda's body would be acting like he normally would. If there were two of him investigating, then he should theoretically be able to investigate twice as fast. While he would have to deal with having either Gumshoe or Kay's body, it wasn't as if staying in Rhoda's body would be any less strange to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Edgeworth use the Possession button to help investigate?</span></div></div>",

While having two of himself might make the investigation go smoother, he decided it was confusing enough that he was stuck in Rhoda's body for the duration of the investigation, and he didn't want to escalate the absurdity by taking over the body of one of his assistants while Rhoda's body went around and did his job for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he left the remote in Rhoda's handbag, which he'd acquired in the swap, and proceeded to break up Gumshoe and Kay's argument. \"Detective Gumshoe, would you mind filling me in on the details of this case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir! A man was found washed up on the shore of the lake just a few minutes ago. He was already long dead, with a wound on the back of his head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, blunt force trauma would be the cause of death, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we're thinking so far. We're still waiting on the autopsy to come back. We haven't identified the victim either, and the only person at the lake at the time was the young woman who called the police, so we don't have a suspect yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, in that case, let me ask a different question. Kay, why are you here?\" Gumshoe was obviously here as a member of the police force, however Edgeworth couldn't fathom why Kay was hanging around here as well. Now that the whole Yatagarasu case had been dealt with, he'd hoped she might stay out of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to help! I did steal the role of your assistant, didn't I?\" Edgeworth simply glared at her with his arms crossed, doing his best to not have his arms press against his newly acquired breasts. Kay rolled her eyes, before responding, \"I just happened to be here at Gourd Lake when the police showed up, and since Gummy was here I figured it was alright if I helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth sighed. \"You should go home, Kay. The Yatagarasu case is over, you shouldn't be getting involved in police business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on, Mr. Edgeworth! I'll be super helpful! I promise! Back me up, Gummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mr. Edgeworth! What if we need to use Kay's Little Thief again, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth shook his head. The two of them were hopeless. One moment they're arguing over who's better, the next they're working together to try and convince him to let Kay stay and investigate. At this point, it would probably be quicker to just give in. Kay probably wouldn't cause that much trouble... probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you can stay. But this is the last time I allow you to assist with an investigation. We can't just have civilians running around a crime scene as they please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Thanks Mr. Edgeworth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween having to deal with both Gumshoe and Kay's antics, and having to adjust to being in Rhoda's body, Edgeworth had a feeling this was going to be a very long day. \"Well, with that out of the way, I suppose we should head to the scene of the crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Right this way, Mr. Edgeworth,\" Gumshoe said, leading the way through Gourd Lake Park.</span></div></div>",

She was involved in a kidnapping case a few months ago, coerced into the crime by her boyfriends. She seemed nervous as she entered, pulling at a loose strand of hair with one hand as though trying to distract herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... uh, hello Mr. Edgeworth,\" she mumbled, averting her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Lauren? Do you need something?\" Miles asked, trying to coax a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, need your help,\" she said, putting her hands behind her back. \"There's been some appeals since the incident. They called me back to court, and I, uh, think I need a lawyer.\" She said quietly and reserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth shook his head in reply. \"I'm sorry Lauren, but I'm not a defense attorney. I could refer you to a firm I know, but it wouldn't be ethical for me to represent you as a prosecutor. Edgeworth actually HAD posed as a defense attorney before, but those were extenuating circumstances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Mr. Edgeworth!\" She cried with clasped hands. \"I've never been in a trial before! I don't have a lot of people I trust, I want someone who isn't a stranger representing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth looked to the remote for a second. Maybe it held the answer? It wouldn't be proper for a prosecutor to act as a defense attorney, but what if Edgeworth wasn't a prosecutor? He could use the remote to switch with a defense attorney and represent Lauren that way. However, that'd possibly require bringing a third person into this mess, which would just be embarrassing if it didn't work. The other possibility was having Lauren choose to defend herself, and then switch with her. Then Lauren could feel safe knowing Edgeworth was defending her while the rest of the world just saw her defending herself. Edgeworth wasn't entirely sure how he'd feel about being Lauren though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have a solution,\" Edgeworth said, deciding to...</span></div></div>",

Or worse, what if two Lauren's were found? Finally there was possession; possession definitely solved the utilitarian issues, but it raised some ethical problems. His body would carry on and he'd be able to act in Lauren's place, but what would happen to her?

Miles had used the remote to take control of Lauren's body, but he had underestimated the amount of time between the possession and the trial. Miles had just spent over 24 hours inside of a woman's body; it was definitely... unique to say the least. He worried that it was all a bit too intrusive to Lauren, but Edgeworth told himself that this was just the best way. Lauren had a bit of a fragile personality - he doubted she could defend herself, and she'd probably give Wright a hard time. He was sure that, with himself at the helm of Lauren's body, he could get her a favorable verdict without any undue stress towards her. Maybe hearing that she defended herself in the trial would give her a self-esteem boost? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the thoughts of ethics out of his mind, Edgeworth pulled himself up from the lobby chair as the bailiff called him into the courtroom. He had worn the same black dress Lauren usually did, but removed the apron and bandanna, opting instead to just tie Lauren's hair back. That left him in a simple, yet still formal enough, black and white dress. Miles straightened out the skirt as he walked, still not very accustomed to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked up, alone, to the defense bench, Miles' looked to the prosecutor's bench to see it empty. On the witness stand stood Lance Amano, Laruen's former boyfriend, staring at Edgeworth-in-Lauren derisively, his hands still cuffed. Miles opted to ignore him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you have joined us today Ms. Paups,\" the old judge said from upon his chair. \"It's rare that defendants choose to represent themselves. I do hope you know what you're doing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be just fine, your honor. No attorney is needed for this trial,\" Edgeworth replied in a matter-of-fact voice, giving the judge a short bow. Lance seemed taken aback at this; he had likely never seen Lauren act this confidently. Edgeworth didn't look at Lance, but he couldn't hold back a slight grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've thrown him off guard. That's good - he'll be as much trouble as the prosecutor. I'll need to shake his confidence,'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where is the prosecution?\" the judge questioned. \"It's rather unbecoming of an attorney to be late.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the door from the prosecutor's side of the courtroom opened.

It's too bad a beauty like you is about to be charged as an accomplice.\" He did an air guitar gesture and then turned to the judge. \"The prosecution has key evidence and a witness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth supposed he should at least be glad that Klavier's attitude would make the trial easier for himself. However he was worried about the future of prosecuting if this man could become a prosecutor, but he opted to worry about that later. The fact that Klavier had just flirted with him, or rather, flirted at him in Lauren's body made Edgeworth a bit uncomfortable. He got over it quick, however he imagined that Klavier would keep on doing things like this for the rest of the trial. This was going to be a long day.</span></div></div>",

Even longer since they last succeeded. I think Ms. Paups has proven her point excellently.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth-as-Lauren gave a grandiose bow in reply, \"I try my best, your honor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, I'm telling you it was her idea!\" Lance shouted from the witness stand, straining against his handcuffs. \"I was just an accomplice is all! Do you even know who my father is?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we've heard enough, Herr Amano,\" Klavier butted in casually with a snap of his fingers. \"The appeal is over, Fraulein over there has made her case. You didn't exactly have much to stand on going in anyways. I suppose it was all a nice practice round though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if the prosecution has nothing else to say, I declare the defendant Lauren Paups to be....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Innocent.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfetti came down from the rafters and claps were heard upon the judge's declaration. Edgeworth gave a short bow and wave to those watching as he made his way back into the defendant's lobby, glad to have the trial be over with. It was a pretty crazy thing for him to do! He'd probably do well to leave Lauren's body soon, she'd probably be rather confused when this was all said and done. Miles began to search through Lauren's bag when he heard a voice chime in behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was some impressive work back there, you were almost as skillful as a real attorney.\" Miles recognized the voice instantly, turning to see Klavier Gavin. \"Tell me, where did you learn to handle yourself in court like that? You don't seem the type to be a law student.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles frowned for a moment. \"I had a... legal adviser beforehand. Most of the evidence was laid out in the investigation anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier didn't seem to buy it, and he merely smiled and shook his head. \"Well, I just want you to know I don't want there to be any hard feelings. I'm just doing my job out there after all. The fact that there are people like you who can throw down just as hard gives me some faith in the system.\" Miles was a bit surprised to hear him sound that lax; in his experience, prosecutors were a bit more... competitive than this. \"Just so there are no hard feelings, Fraulein, how about I take you to get something to eat? Maybe you can tell me more about yourself on the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth frowned in discomfort. He didn't expect to basically get asked on a date post-trial. He wasn't totally sure what to do. His gut said to just leave Lauren's body now, but if he did that then she would certainly be confused, and Klavier would definitely be concerned. If he stayed for a little while, then maybe he could steer away from Gavin and get Lauren back home before he left her body. A small part of him was curious as well; there definitely seemed to be more to this rockstar prosecutor than he saw on the surface. Maybe going with him would reveal something enlightening? </span></div></div>",

Plus, he had to admit, he was curious about Klavier. \"Alright. However, I am very busy, so I can only be around for a little while.\" Edgeworth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier gave a slight laugh and shook his head. \"Sure, sure. Follow me, I know a good place nearby.\" He said with a snap and began walking, giving a hand motion for Edgeworth to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk Edgeworth and Klavier were outside of a small noodle stand. While Edgeworth wasn't a fan of cheap noodles, he was glad that Klavier didn't choose some romantic location to eat at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the most extravagant place, but sometimes the simplest of foods are the best.\" Klavier said with a smile. \"I'll order the food. You just sit down and wait.\" Klavier said as he motioned for Edgeworth to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Edgeworth had seated himself and Klavier had ordered the food, Klavier began to speak to Edgeworth. \"You know, both your Ex and the court record described you as a bit crazy, the kind of woman who would speak to herself. Yet in court today, you were as cool headed as a snowman. There must be a reason for that\" Klavier questioned Edgeworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was an important trial. I needed to act in the way most suited to the situation. Nothing more.\" Edgeworth bluffed, Klavier wasn't completely convinced. Edgeworth had a question of his own. \"What about you, You don't seem to take your job seriously at all. Why is someone like you a prosecutor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off, prosecuting isn't my alone job, I'm also a rock star. Now, before you ask 'Why are you both?', I'm both because I can be both, I put all my effort into both because I know that I can be great at both. The number of honest and good prosecutors nowadays is tiny and the ones who are are growing old. I know if I do my best to do my job right, other new prosecutors will follow. I'm setting the example.\" Klavier explained with a snap of the finger between each sentence. He end his little speech with an air guitar. He laughed \"I think I just got some inspiration for a new song, thanks to you Fraulein\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the finger snaps and air guitaring annoyed Edgeworth, he felt he could understand Klavier a bit more. Once the noodles had arrived, Klavier and Edgeworth both began to eat, there wasn't much conversation during the meal itself. Edgeworth was never one for conversation and Klavier was too busy thinking of lyrics for his new song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the meal was finished, Klavier stood up. \"It was nice meeting you Fraulein, I hope to see you again.\" He said as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small piece of paper and handed it to Edgeworth. It was his phone number. He walked away with a wave of the hand. Edgeworth put the paper away in Lauren's bag<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was over, Edgeworth was ready to leave Lauren's body. The remote was in the bag and he could use it at anytime. However, he wondered if he should just leave right now while he was in public, or at least walk to Lauren's home so she wasn't just put in the middle of public with no recollection of what happened the past two days since he possessed her.</span></div></div>",

It had been the case that had convinced him to remain as a prosecutor after he had had some doubts about his path in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had gotten Edgeworth's deepest sympathies after the debacle had come to an end.<br>\r\nAfter all; finding out that your dad had been a foreign president that had been killed by an assassin hired by his body-double, was quite a mouthful for any boy to swallow.<br>\r\nLuckily, John didn't appear to have suffered any mental trauma from this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth did wonder why he had come to see him, though. Technically, he had already gotten a reward from the boy's adoptive mother, Judge Justine Courtney, in the form of a free ticket to a front-row seat for the premiere of the movie in which he had the lead role: 'The Great Monster Moozilla vs. Gourdy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the movie wasn't in Edgeworth's prefered genre, (on the extremely rare occations that he did go to a cinema), he had to admit that the movie wasn't half bad; John was certainly a very skilled actor in spite of being only 13 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering again why the young movie star had chosen to come and say thanks one more time, Edgeworth replied to Gumshoe: \"Send him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than twenty seconds later, the door to Edgeworth's office was opened and John Marsh stepped in.<br>\r\nHe looked exactly like he did when Edgeworth had met him the first time; clad in a red jacket with a Holstein-calf-hide pattern; knee-length blue jeans; sock-less feet tucked into a pair of black tennis-shoes; a black backpack with a cow-head keychain on his back; and, most notably, a pair of fake horns in his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth noticed that John seemed to have the same bratty expression on his face that he appeared to have during their first meeting, but then realized that it was actually more like an expression of irritation than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth decided to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So; what are you really doing here, John?\" he asked the boy. \"Your mother already thanked me from both of you for the help I provided during the case, so it's obviously not why you've come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's eyes widened a little out of surprise, before he gave a little smirk and said: \"Well, you're still as sharp as a tack. You're right; the whole 'saying thanks' thing was just so I could get easier access to your office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then sighed. \"I have actually come to ask if you could be a consultent on my next film.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth was definitly not expecting that answer. His eyebrows almost disappeared into his hair as he stared at the boy in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey; it wasn't my idea,\" said John with a huff. \"You see; since you solved the case concerning... my father...\", Edgeworth could see he was trying not to get emotional at that memory, \"the studio decided to take some 'inspiration', as they put it, from the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a key scene in the next film, my character is put on trial by a corrupt prosecutor that's accusing him of being responsible for all the damage from the previous film, because my character can communicate with Moozilla.<br>\r\nBecause of the prosecutor's influence, no lawyer wants to represent him, so he has to defend himself during the trial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed again. \"Normally the studio asks my mom about any legal stuff, but she has been so busy lately that she doesn't have the time. Then Will Powers remembered you from his own trial and suggested to the executives that you might be an excellent candidate to take her place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth couldn't help himself; he actually snorted half with laughter and half with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn let out a dry chuckle. \"I know; sounds ridiculous, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it sounds less ridiculous compared to what I recieved in a package this morning,\" said Edgeworth and proceeded to tell John about the remote. \"Whoever sent it must think I'm a fool. Obviously they haven't heard about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah; what a moron,\" agreed John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth held up the remote with a smug look on his face and pointed it towards John so that he could see it, too. \"As if you could swap bodies with someone by pressing a button.\" To demonstrate how silly it was, Edgeworth pushed a button on the machine, expecting nothing to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich button did he push?</span></div></div>",

Of course, she was happy to win, and happy for her client, but that meant that until someone else stopped by, Athena was going to be stuck, once again, with her normal office duties. So, more toilet scrubbing and paperwork. <i>Boring.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer morning routine was the same as ever, but as she stepped outside, she tripped over a box sitting at her doorstep and fell to the ground, gracefully as always.

It was some kind of remote, the manual that came with it claimed that it could swap people's bodies. It had four functions 'Aware Swap', 'Unaware Swap', 'Shapeshift', and 'Possession'. at first, Godot thought that it was complete nonsense, however, part of him couldn't dismiss it. He had known Mia for years and knew that spirit channeling was real. So, while it was slim, there was a chance that this remote could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before he tried it out, he needed to think of a purpose to use it for. One thing came to mind, his only purpose in life at the moment, protect Maya Fey. Ever since he heard the news of Mia's death, he vowed he would keep her sister safe. When he became a prosecutor, he learned that Maya's aunt Morgan Fey was planning to do something. He needed to protect Maya from her aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he used the remote, he could stay close to her, at least until Morgan put her plan into motion. The only person around Maya right now was that trite lawyer who let Mia die. While swapping with him and making him with the pain that Godot was currently living with would be good karma for Mia's death, Godot wasn't willing to put himself into trite's skin. He doubted he could handle looking at the face of someone he hated in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe safest thing he could think of at the moment would be to take the body of Maya herself. After all, what would better way to ensure that she was safe than him taking the helm of her body. While part of him would feel guilty about stealing her body, it would be worth it if he could keep her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he could be being hasty right now, perhaps there was a better body he could swap into to keep her safe. Did he swap with Maya?</span></div></div>",

The question now was, what swap should he use?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first button was also the simplest 'Aware Swap' Using this would put him in Maya's body and her in his. This option was also the most ethical because it was the only one where Maya would be the aware of what he was doing. However, was this the smartest option? If he did this, she would be in his body and have no idea how to live his life. Should he really thrust her into that situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see any real use for the next button 'Unaware Swap'. This button would give him Maya's body and give her his, but the two of them would still have their own lives. The world would still see him as Godot, the manly, coffee loving, prosecutor, but he'd have the body of Maya Fey. This button really wouldn't be of much use to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was 'Possession', the easiest of the buttons to use. With this he could take her body and she wouldn't be put into his. This button was also the most unethical, if he used it, Maya Fey would essentially cease to exist until he unpossessed her body, and since he was planning to take it until he knew she would be safe from Morgan Fey, that could take a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth and final button was 'Shapeshift' with this, he could turn his body into a duplicate of Maya's. If he played his cards right, he could use himself as a decoy to Morgan's plan without ever getting Maya involved. It would be difficult though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over several times and giving each one of the buttons careful consideration, Godot decided to use the ______ button</span></div></div>",

He had gone through a bit of a rough time a few months ago when Chief prosecutor Miles Edgeworth had fired him, but ever since he had come to the Kingdom of Khura'in, he had made a comeback as an even greater prosecutor than ever. He had even gained the title of being this country's Chief Prosecutor. A title that his brother Winston could only dream of achieving. It was incredibly simple, considering that no defense attorney's ever challenged him. Of course, just because his life was good now, that didn't mean it couldn't get any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mail this morning, Gaspen received a package with a remote and manual. The remote was labeled as a 'Body Switcher' It had four functions 'Aware Swap', 'Unaware Swap', 'Possession', and 'Shapeshift'. After a through read of the manual, Gaspen had a basic understanding of the remote and got a wicked smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he had a high currently had a high title of being he Chief prosecutor of he Kingdom, but what if he could be someone more famous? There were still some people in this Kingdom who were more important than Gaspen, all of which had more power even in the courtroom than him, but with this remote, he could become them and thus be the most famous and important person in the courtroom! He went over in his head people he could become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person who came to mind was someone he saw at every trial in this country, the princess herself, Rayfa Padma Khura'in. Despite the fact that he was a prosecutor, he really didn't do that much during trials and got no recognition for his work. The Princess on the other hand, was praised by the people and her Divination Seances were taken as fact during trials. Surely she could stand sharing some of that fame with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to come to mind was the queen herself. Of course, if he became the queen, he not only have complete control of the courtroom, but the entire Kingdom. Although, taking over the queen's body could result in some problems. He would have to take on the queen's responsibilities and if he messed up, he couldn't imagine what would happen. If the people revolted against the queen because of him, he would have to deal with the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Gaspen decided to...</span></div></div>",

She read through the manual, apparently this remote had the ability to swap bodies around and other similar functions. She thought it was nonsense at first, but she was still curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what would she use it for? One thought immediately jumped to mind, Blue Corp. She had been looking into Redd White's shady dealings for quite a while now, but most of what she had wouldn't hold up in court. If this remote actually worked, she could easily infiltrate Blue Corp and get any info she needed on White.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could easily get into Blue Corp if she took the body of an employee of White, or better yet, take White's body. Once inside all she would have to do is look around White's files until she found some incriminating evidence. It shouldn't be too hard to find something like that in White's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had a plan, she needed to decide on one important factor, should she do this alone? She had confidence that she could do this on her own, but even she was a bit afraid of the risk she was taking. If she messed up at any point and the remote got stolen, she could end up stuck in someone else's body, or worse, he body could be stolen. Without anyone else knowing of her plan, things could end up really badly for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had someone else come with her, they could potentially help her if she got stuck in another body or if the remote got stolen. White had several employees and contacts. She could easily have someone else come with her in the body of a Blue Corp employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who would she have come with her? The first person to come to mind was a lawyer that worked for her, Phoenix Wright. Phoenix had just defended his first client in court the other day, he was a rookie in all definitions of the word, but Mia still saw potential in him. It might be good for her to bring him along, he was a good co-worker and Mia felt she could trust him with a mission like this. On the other hand though, it may not be best for her to bring along the man who had a habit of sweating bullets under pressure on a stealth mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to come to mind was Mia's sister Maya, she knew without a doubt she could trust Maya to come along with her. Plus, she wouldn't have to worry about convince Maya that the remote was real, she was sure that Maya would believe it without any proof. On the negative side, putting Maya into the body of someone else might not be the best for sneaking into a place. She would probably give them away within five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, did Mia decide to tell someone else about the remote and go with them, or did she decide to infiltrate Blue Corp on her own?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoenix made his way to the Fey and Co. law offices. Mia had called him early that day and said she had something important to show him. When he walked into the office, Mia began to tell him about some remote that she had got in the mail and how it could apparently swap bodies around. He didn't believe a single word of it. \"Chief, are you okay? Do you have a fever?\" Phoenix asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't believe me? Alright, guess I should've expected that. Guess you'll need some proof!\" Mia exclaimed and suddenly point the remote at Phoenix. In an instant, Phoenix point of view changed. One moment he was standing in the middle of the office, the next he was sitting in Mia's chair- and looking at himself! He looked down and saw that he was in Mia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe me now?\" Mia asked smugly from Phoenix's body, Phoenix remained silent and only nodded. \"Good, now, let me explain the plan to you. We're going to use this remote to sneak into the building of a company called Blue Corp. We'll be taking the bodies of the CEO, Redd White, and an employee of his. Understand?\" Mia asked to make sure that Phoenix was paying attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, mostly, but why are we sneaking into this place?\" Phoenix asked, reasonably confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia explained to Phoenix what kind of company Blue Corp was and why she needed to get Redd White arrested. \"Do you understand? This is one of the most important things in my life. Will you help me?\" Mia asked for his cooperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright chief, let's do this.\" Phoenix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia swapped back with Phoenix and the two of them made their way to Blue Corp. It wasn't far from the office, so the walk wasn't long. \"Alright, Phoenix. I've been watching this building for a while. So I know the perfect employee to use in order to get to White and take his body.\" Mia explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Phoenix asked, it seemed that there was a lot of employees at this large company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a secretary at the front desk, her name is April May. We'll use her. White should come out of his office if his secretary calls him.\" Mia explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sounds good. So, you're going to take her body?\" Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, you are! I'm going for the CEO himself.\" Mia stated Phoenix was shocked, he didn't know he'd have to take the body of a woman! He sighed, this was probably the only way. \"Okay, Phoenix, I'm going to use the 'Possession' function on you. When I do, you'll be in some kind of ghost form, according to the manual. All you'll have to do is fly into her, and you'll become her! If it works, come outside and tell me.\" Mia said before she pointed the remote at Phoenix and pressed the 'Possession' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Mia said, Phoenix ended up in a ghost-like state, his own body walked off to who knows where, seemingly unaware of anything that just happened. Phoenix flew into Blue Corp. and saw a woman at the front desk, this must have been April May. Phoenix flew into her and possessed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately felt unpleasant. The change in gender was just as bad as it had been when Mia had swapped with him earlier, but April's clothing made the changes all the more obvious. \"These clothes can't be professional.\" Phoenix said in her voice. He wobbled outside, her large heels were very hard to walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked.\" He told Mia, who only laughed at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now all you need to do is call White out of his office, I'll possess him when that happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix wobbled back into the building, the faster this was over with, the better. Is he able to call White out of his office without problems?</span></div></div>",

His heart was pounding with anxiety and his legs were shaking. The fact that he had April's breasts and dramatically exposed legs only amplified the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Please work...'</i> he prayed as the elevator door opened. There was a small waiting room, pleasantly decorated with some plants and light blue furniture. It was very empty otherwise, however. Phoenix could imagine the claustrophobia would get to someone as they waited to be let into Redd's office. Thankfully, he was an 'employee' at the moment, and nervously made his way into the office, taking short steps due to his short and tight skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mr. White...\" Phoenix almost squeaked as he slowly opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, April?\" The vice replied, overly confident and just a bit flamboyant in tone. It somehow seemed distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... er, someone here to see you over at the entrance. Its very urgent.\" As Phoenix pushed his way in, he felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. On a TV screen hoisted up to the far right wall was security footage outside the office. He could see Mia, waiting in the lobby on the first floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know very well who <i>that</i> woman is, Ms. May.\" Redd replied, his voice dripping with disdain. \"Quite a nuisisance. But a dumb one atleast! I can't believe she just came right into my castle like this. What a splendiferous afternoon...\" Redd's hand calmly moved over to the far side of the desk, where he clicked a switch on a trophy he had laid out as a decoration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Security, there's quite the annoying pest over in the lobby. I need you to handle her. Why not take her to the basement floor? I'll be down there in a moment or two to give a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative sir,\" a gruff voice replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\" Phoenix shouted in a panic. \"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just swatting an annoying little bug that flew in through my window,\" Redd replied jovially. On the TV screen, Phoenix could see two men in suits materialize, seemingly from nowhere, run in and grab Mia by the arms. She shook her left arm free, and reached for the remote, but she was seemingly too late as one guard tore it from her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is bad...' Phoenix could only watch as the guards frog marched Mia away, one of them putting a hand over her mouth to keep her from speaking as he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was most entertainifying!\" Redd exclaimed as he clapped his hands, getting up from the desk. He turned his attention to Phoenix, who was suddenly feeling very vulnerable without Mia as a lifeline. Phoenix's heart was pounding as he began to speak. \"Now, Ms. May...\"</span></div></div>",

Once Phoenix was on the elevator down, he began thinking about what to do now. The situation was dire to say the least. Mia had been taken to the basement and one of White's guards had taken the remote. How was he supposed to get out of this situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave calling the police a thought, but quickly decided against it. From what Mia told him, the police wouldn't act against Blue Corp. Plus, even on the off chance that the police would take action, by the time they got there, whatever damage White was going to do would be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix would need to act on his own, but what could he possibly do from April's body? Obviously he couldn't just go down to the basement and fight off the guards to save Mia. He wouldn't be able to do that if he was in his own body, let alone April's. He needed to think of a plan, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis greatest advantage at the moments was that he left the office before Redd. However, that advantage would only give him at most two minutes. If he didn't act fast, Redd would make it down to the basement and do god knows what. There was no way he would be able to go down to the basement, free Mia, and leave before Redd got down. A confrontation with Redd was inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Phoenix would need to do is provide a distraction for Redd, but how? That's when Phoenix had an idea, and thankfully, he had it just as the elevator reached the first floor. He went to April's desk and called White's office. Thankfully, White picked up \"Mr. White. There's someone here to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms May, how dare you distrurb me?! I told you to cancel all my appointments.\" Redd said over the phone, very angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Think Phoenix, think. What kind of person would a person like Redd want to see, no matter what?!'</i> Phoenix thought to himself, suddenly he had an idea. \"The chief of police is waiting outside in their car.\" Phoenix told an obvious lie, he prayed that White would fall for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite was silent for a few seconds \"......I'll be there momentarily.\" He said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix let out a sigh of relief, he couldn't believe that had worked, but he had no time to be glad over that. This would only buy him a few minutes at most. He needed to hurry. He went to the elevator and took it to the basement. On the way down he had thought up a plan. obviously he and Mia wouldn't be able to get out of this situation as themselves, but the remote could get them out of this no problem. The problem would be getting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the elevator got to the basement, he looked around and eventually found the room Mia and the guards were in. Mia was, as expected, giving the guards trouble and resisting as much as she could. From the looks of it, she had broken her arm free from the guard's grip once and punched them in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix waled into the room, the guards were obviously shocked. It was clear the only person they expected to come was Redd himself. Mia, on the other hand, grinned when she saw Phoenix, however, she made sure to wipe the grin off her face, as not to alert the guards. Phoenix took a deep breath \"Mr. White saw that you confiscated something from the intruder, he ordered me to come and retrieve it for him. Phoenix said as confidently as he could, trying his hardest to hide how nervous he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo the guards fall for this?</span></div></div>",

He could see Mia, behind the guards, making a gesture with her neck for him to go on, but Phoenix was all of a sudden realizing how little Mia explained about the remote. He wasn't really sure what any of the buttons did, and there wasn't much time for him to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*creak* </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill rolled down Phoenix's spine as he heard a door open behind him. \"I've arrived, gentlemen, I hope you didn't start without me,\" Redd White's ostentatious voice sounded out from the door frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Ms May? I gave you clarific instructions! Cancel my appointments! Also, I do believe that the chief of police was nowhere to be found.

Anything!\" He heard Mia call out as she socked the guard next to her in the stomach, rushing to charge Redd.

Mia tackled White to the ground, but he quickly pushed her off. As White picked himself up from the ground, White kicked at Mia before she could get up. Before the kick connected, Phoenix quickly aimed the remote at Mia and pressed the same button as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite perspective suddenly changed, he was back on the ground, but before he could react, he suddenly felt a large amount of force hit his stomach. He winced in pain. After recovering, his eyes widened in shock. He was looking at himself. Mia was similarly disoriented by the body swap. She also didn't have much time to react as the two guards restrained her former body and Phoenix in April's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry Mr. White! She caught us off guard.\" One of the guards apologized with fear in his voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not exactly how she planned, Mia could still make this work. \"Ah, um, tie Ms. Fey to that chair. I'll handle her myself later. However, let Ms. May go.\" Mia gave the guards orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards did as they were told, though not without some resistance from White. \"Let me go, you imbelictons! I am the el presidente of this company!\" White complained to death ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else, Mr White?\" The guards asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're both fired.\" Mia said to the guards shock. Mia wasn't going to let them off without punishment. They may have just been doing their jobs, but they were very close to doing god knows what to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards wanted to complain, but they knew better than to speak up against White. They left without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia turned her to Phoenix and let out a sigh of relief \"That was too close.\" She then smiled \"Looks like I made the right choice in bringing you along, Phoenix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was still recovering from the shock of the situation, but it seemed that the hard part was over. \"So, what now, Chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first we'll need to take care of the man in my body.\" She said and turned her attention to White.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you did this, Ms. Fey, but once I get my body back, you'll sufferone.\" White threatened from Mia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia sighed, she had hoped that she could get this situation handled without White figuring out about the whole body swapping thing, but that ship has sailed. All the more motivation to get all the evidence she'd need against White before she went back to her body. \"Okay, Phoenix. We'll leave him here for now. Now, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix and Mia headed for the elevator and once again rode it up to Mr. White's office. Mia wasn't comfortable to be walking around in White's body, but she was doing a better job at hiding her distaste than Phoenix. \"Alright, Phoenix. I'll just need you to work as lookout for now. If anyone comes to see White, send them away.\" Mia told him. Phoenix wasn't exactly happy about doing secretary work, but after the danger he had just been in a few minutes ago, it was welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had spent the next two or so hours looking through all of Redd's files. She found plenty of useful information, ranging from contact lists to full out records of exchanges. This stuff would be invaluable evidence against White.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also able to get into his computer fairly easily \"Hey Phoenix, you'll never believe it. That egomaniac's password was his own name!\" Mia called out to Phoenix in the hallway. She looked through his files and sent whatever seemed useful to her personal email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything had been sent, she walked back out into the hallway, where Phoenix had been waiting. \"Alright, I think we have everything we need. Let's go get my body back. After that, we'll get you out of April's.\" Mia relayed the plan to Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them rode the elevator back down to the basement for what would hopefully be the final time.

Who knows what he'll do! You fired his guards, but he still has contacts and probably thugs. Can we act faster than him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia paused, Phoenix's words making sense. \"That's an excellent point Wright. If we put him back in his body now, he can mobilize damage control against us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia shook her head. \"Two options, as I see it. We can find a way to slow him down, or we keep his body and sabotage his contacts until we're ready to strike.\" Redd was still shouting at them in Mia's high pitched voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can we keep his body though? We can't just leave him in yours; especially if it means tying him up in this basement!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Which is why I think <i>you</i> would have to be the one to use my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME!?\" Phoenix exclaimed in shock. Why was she so intent on leaving him as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, \"I could use the possession button to go back to being myself, but there's no telling what Redd's body would do. It may very well pick up right where the original Redd left off. I have to stay here and burn his bridges until we're secure enough to go forward with the information we've gathered. April May doesn't know anything that's happening though, and she's just a lackey. If you left her body and took over mine, you'd be able to suppress White and hold down the law office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you trust me to do that, chief?\" Phoenix asked, surprised at the responsibility she was considering giving him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia nodded. \"You proved to be very quick on your feet today. I'd be in dire straits without you right now. The decision is yours to make though.\" </span></div></div>",

While they certainly had the option to put White in his body and try to slow him down, but that plan had plenty of risks. Mia probably found out about plenty of his contacts, but if Redd acted before they could do anything....Phoenix chose not to think about that. The best option here was for him to possess Mia's body while she prepared. \"Alright Chief, put me in your body.\" Phoenix told Mia of his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia smiled and aimed the remote at Phoenix. She pressed the Possession button and Phoenix once again found himself in that ghost-like form. White didn't know what was going on, but he knew it wasn't good for him. He let out once last string of threats before he suddenly stopped. Mia's body blinked for a second, her body's facial expression changed and it was obvious that Phoenix was now the one in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore doing anything else, Mia turned her attention toward April May, who was obviously confused. How had she suddenly ended up in the basement with her boss and some woman? \"You can go home for the day Ms. May, You aren't needed anymore.\" MIa sent April home. April was even more confused now, Redd was never one to randomly give days off! She had a feeling something was going on, but she said nothing and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce April had left the room, Phoenix spoke up. \"Can you untie me, Chief?\" he asked, still stuck in the chair they had put White in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia walked over to the chair and began to untie Phoenix \"You're the chief now, Phoenix.\" Mia said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix knew she said that as a joke, but in a way, it as true right now. Mia was trusting him to temporarily take over her job and life. For all intents and purposes, he was Mia Fey right now. Could he handle it? He was still a rookie lawyer with only one case under his belt, could he handle he job? He also barely knew anything about her personal life, could he properly act like her in front of her family or friends?  The mere thought made him nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia could tell he was nervous. \"Don't worry, you'll do fine. It won't take too long for me to burn all of White bridges, the man didn't exactly keep people close. Getting rid of his contacts shouldn't be too hard. Just give me a week or two.\" Mia said as she finished off untying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix stood up, he was again had trouble adjusting to the change in body, at least Mia's clothes covered a lot more than Aprils. \"I miss my body.\" Phoenix voiced his discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being in White's body is no vacation for me either.\" Mia voiced a similar discomfort. The two of them made their way to the elevator, while in the elevator, Mia gave Phoenix a quick summary of people who might visit the office while he was in her body and how he should act around those people. Once the elevator reached the first floor, it was time for them to temporarily say goodbye. \"Alright Phoenix, when I'm ready I'll call you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Chief.\" Phoenix said and took a deep breath \"I'll do my best to hold down the office until then.\" He said and began to walk out of Blue Corp. This was going to be a strange week to say the least, but he would try his hardest. Mia rode the elevator back up to White's office. She was going to have a busy week, but the mere thought of finally being able to take down White excited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will the story follow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a short commute that felt like an eternity, Phoenix managed to find Mia's residence, stumbling into her apartment in her heels. \"How can women walk in these?!\" He complained as he kicked them off his new feet. \"Its torture... dunno if I can handle a week of them.\" Exhausted, he plopped Mia's body down on the nearest couch in front a small tv. Thankfully, Mia had closed the office for today. She clearly anticipated something like this happening, and wisely decided they would just open back up tomorrow. Thankfully there were no cases to attend to, so Phoenix had some time to acclimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had certainly been a whirlwind of a day. He never believed in the supernatural before, but here he was! He got thrust into a life or death game of intrigue where he was using someone else's body to go undercover! To cap it all off, he was still not himself. Phoenix would never have guessed that Mia would put so much faith in him. <br>\r\nHe never imagined he'd spend any amount of time as a woman, let alone a whole week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the promotion is nice, even if it is temporary,\" he murmured as he looked down at his new self. He had to admit that even though Mia was better dressed than April, she could hardly be described as modest. \"What kind of shirt even is that...?\" he wondered. Her neckline was very much exposed, and her top drew a lot of attention to her breasts. Her skirt left her long legs very exposed as well. He reached downward and ran his hands down his new calves, shivering a bit as he did; the sensation of his legs being hairless was a new one. Phoenix felt like it might've been going out of line to examine his boss's body like this, but it was basically inevitable. She trusted it to him for at least a week, maybe more. It'd be impossible to <i>not</i> be intrusive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he pulled himself out of the couch and looked around at his new living space. Mia's apartment was only a bit bigger than his own, but it was certainly nicer. The kitchen and living were were in one large area, and all the appliances seemed fairly clean and in order. Mia was a pretty well established attorney with a solid record, so Phoenix supposed it made sense she could afford a nice place on her own. The walls of the apartment were a pretty dull beige, and most of the furniture was black, giving it a fairly spartan air to it. A fairly expansive book case full of law books stood on one wall and there were a few tapestries on the other wall as well, but Phoenix couldn't understand the text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'They look pretty old. She did mention being from a little village outside town, must be keepsakes.'</i> The only other rooms were her bedroom and a bathroom. Nervously, Phoenix entered the bedroom, finding similarly colored walls along with a home work desk, a locked file cabinet, and a drawer for clothes. She seemed to have a closet as well, with some suits hanging up similar to what Phoenix was wearing. Phoenix realized he was going to have to think of the place as <i>his</i> bedroom for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a mirror inside the closet door, Phoenix took in the sight of himself as he took the scarf off Mia's neck, feeling a bit choked by it. He was feeling exhausted after the crisis moment from earlier, and wanted to take a rest. Searching through Mia's wardrobe, face red, he found what he guessed were her sleeping clothes: a nightgown with a sort of kimono design to it. He couldn't very well sleep in her suit and skirt, so he figured he'd have to change into <i>something.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well chief, can't say we won't be pretty close after this...\"</span></div></div>",

A solid block of time spent involuntarily looking at the naked body of his superior was about as uncomfortable as this situation could get, short of some of the horrid ideas he stopped his imagination from conjuring up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, the deed was done. He still felt unbelievably uncomfortable. That word had run through his mind a few times now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix checked the shower off the list and moved to getting dressed. Despite his ineptitude when it came to anything to do with cosmetics, he actually managed to dress up and make himself up in a manner that looked presentable and aesthetically pleasing. He sighed with relief as he began to recognize Mia's face as he normally saw it in the mirror. After a bit more time, he finally felt satisfied enough to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick breakfast later, Phoenix walked out the door, electing to wear Mia's relatively flat pair of shoes to avoid collapsing on the way to his destination. He knew he'd have to learn to walk in the heels eventually, but since he was already adapting to so much, he gave himself a break.

Probably because he was now the boss and it was now his office. He sat down at Mia's desk. There weren't any cases that she was working on, so he just did paper work. It was an overall boring time. After an hour or two, Mia's phone began to ring. \"Hello?\" Phoenix answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the phone was a voice Phoenix recognized well \"Hey, Chief it's me.\" Phoenix heard his own voice on the other end. \"Sorry, Chief, I caught a *ACHOO* a cold. I don't think I'll be able to come to work today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix felt relieved for two reason. First off, he was relieved that his own body wasn't coming to work today. He was still getting used to the fact that he was now Mia, interacting with his own body would make adapting to being someone else all that much harder. It was something he'd certainly have to do eventually, but he'd prefer later rather than sooner. Secondly, he missed out on a cold because he became Mia, lucky him. \"Alright...Phoenix. Take the day off.\" Phoenix told the other him over the phone, talking to himself as if he were a different person was difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Chief, I should be better by tomorrow.\" The other Phoenix said over the phone before he hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix put away Mia's phone and stared at the ceiling. What was he going to do now? He had finished up Mia's paper work and there weren't any cases to currently work on. He spent the next span of time just sitting around the office bored. His boredom was interrupted by the sound of someone knocking at the office door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix went over the list of people who Mia said might visit. The most likely person to visit was Mia's sister, Maya Fey. Mia had told Phoenix about her sister, but hadn't told him much about her. He hadn't even seen a picture of her. The second person to likely visit was Marvin Grossberg, Mia's old boss. Mia had said that Grossberg often visited sometimes and that she trusted her old boss. The third, and least likely person to visit was an old friend of Mia's, Lana Skye. Mia said that she and Lana were friends when Mia was studying to be a lawyer, but the two have been less close lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix went over to the door and answered it, on the other side was....</span></div></div>",

You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easier not to lie, Phoenix thought. \"Busy. It's been busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw.\" Maya said, momentarily dropping her cheery demeanor.

Maybe Maya and Mia had plans he didn't know about. So, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so, this might sound weird, but in the shuffle... this week, uh... I think I completely forgot what the plan was for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya pulled a face at that, then put a finger to her chin. What was the answer?</span></div></div>",

Simply getting Phoenix to pretend to be her around him was not an option.

She planned to copy someone's body then, once they were far enough away, turn into them before heading to the office. She noted a woman with a red afro and green outfit distractedly talking into her phone. Making sure that no one was looking at her, Mia quickly pulled out the remote and pressed the right button to copy the woman's shape. A light appeared on the remote, recognizing the success of the function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the woman hung up and headed on her way. Mia waited before heading in the opposite direction into an alley. Looking around to ensure she wasn't being followed and that there were no cameras around, she pointed at herself and pressed the button. The changes happened quickly: Mia felt a huge growth of hair on her head as she shrunk a few inches and grew out in other areas. She sighed in relief. Even though she still wasn't herself, it felt good to at least be a woman again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange woman's outfit happened to have pockets in the jacket, which was good considering Mia hadn't brought a purse with her. Putting the remote into one of the pockets, she headed for the office.</span></div></div>",

Sure, some people took notice of her hairstyle, but no one was getting in her way. When she reached the office, she was satisfied that Phoenix had done as he was told. Mia knocked heavily on the door, waiting for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, the office is closed right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoenix, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited as she heard the lock turn and the door opened. \"Chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, Phoenix,\" Mia commented as she looked over her real body. She took it as a good sign that Phoenix had managed to adapt quickly to his situation, even applying a small but noticeable amount of makeup. \"You seem to have gotten the hand of looking the part of a real woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix kept from reacting to that comment. \"Who's that? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, Phoenix. Just let me get in first and make some coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix stepped aside as Mia made her way to the coffee machine. As she prepared a favorite of Diego's, she explained first that she had disguised herself as a stranger to keep anyone from seeing Redd White enter the office. When Phoenix asked if someone was wandering around in White's body, Mia explained the shapeshifting functionality of the remote, which had allowed her to copy someone else's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That leads us to why I needed to come here. I hadn't stored a copy of myself on the remote, so I need to do that before I see Diego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How come you don't just want to swap back into your real body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing. White's still quiet in there while you're possessing my body, right? What do you think might happen if I tried to swap bodies with you while you're still possessing my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix paused. \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And neither do I. I can't take the risk that White will wake up before we're ready to take him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, Chief. But why come here anyways? Who's Diego?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia smiled. \"Diego was my senior coworker back when we still worked for Mr. Grossberg. But more importantly, he's my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Phoenix? You seemed surprised that I had a boyfriend. Are you saying I'm not pretty enough for one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Nonono, of course not, Chief! You're incredibly beautiful, and more importantly, you're an incredible person! You could probably be with anyone you wanted to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia chuckled. \"I'm just messing with you, Phoenix. But it was nice to hear you say that. Flattery will get you everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sweated as he was pretty sure that saying went the complete opposite way. \"I'm really glad you didn't make me go see him. I can't imagine having to pretend to be in love with some guy I don't know. Speaking of him, though, what happened to him? Mr. Grossberg said he had woken up in the hospital. Was he in a coma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia nodded as her face became serious. \"Exactly. A few years ago, Diego ingested a poison that the doctors thought would kill him. When he was still alive after a few days, the doctors were astounded and kept him as a coma patient. They told me it might be years before he woke up, assuming he ever did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did he get poisoned in the first place? I can't imagine that he'd just stumble upon some poison and decide to try it out himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a long story that started from my very first case as a lawyer. To give you the short version of the story, my first client committed suicide on the witness stand after he ingested poison, allowing the real culprit to escape unpunished. Diego and I didn't give up on pursuing her, and he finally got the opportunity to interrogate her. That's when she laced his coffee with poison to silence him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this seemed awfully familiar to Phoenix. \"Who poisoned him?\" he asked, though he felt like he might already know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, our mutual friend, Dahlia Hawthorne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned as bad memories returned the forefront of Phoenix's mind. It still hurt. He had gone out with her in college, and he had thought they were truly in love with each other. Only Mia was able to show him the truth: that she had been scheming to kill him over a necklace she had given him. A necklace that had contained a bottle of poison. \"That day,\" Phoenix began as his voice returned to him, \"when I first met Dahlia and she gave me the necklace. Was that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You figured it out very fast, Phoenix. Yes, that was the day she poisoned him. I'm just happy that Diego managed to pull through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine beeped a few times, letting the lawyers know the coffee was ready. Mia took out a thermos and poured the coffee into it. \"He'll need some of this in his system. I swear, it's like coffee is part of his blood or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished pouring the coffee, she took the remote out of her pocket and pointed it a Phoenix. After pressing the button to copy her body's shape, she turned it back on herself. The changes were again quick but noticeable, as her hair no longer felt like a giant presence on her head. \"That's better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...that thing is pretty powerful. Too bad we can't do anything about me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia smiled in sympathy. \"Sorry, Phoenix. I know I'm asking a lot of you, but I really couldn't trust anyone more than you to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Chief. Even though I'm stuck as someone else, at least I still look like someone I trust and respect. I can't imagine what it's been like for you to have to pretend to be White.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a very mature outlook to take. You really have come a long way from the boy who proclaimed in court that his Dollie doesn't poop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks Chief.\" Phoenix wondered if Mia would ever let that indiscretion ever go. Most likely not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia chuckled as she went to her desk to get a purse she kept in there. She placed the thermos inside before zipping it up. \"Alright, I need to get going. Be sure to wait a bit before heading home, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it, Chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, thank you Phoenix for doing this. I'll find a way to repay you for this later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't worry about it, Chief. Just go and get to your boyfriend. I'm sure he's hoping to see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia gave a smile as she headed out. The hospital where Diego was at was not very close to the office, and she didn't want to use White's car to get there. The bus to get there, however, would be at a stop not very far. Mia got to the stop just as the bus pulled in. After paying the fare, she found a seat as the bus began to start driving off. <i>Soon, Diego. I'll be with you soon.</i></span></div></div>",

Do you know where 4114 Valencia Street is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck Mia instantly and she struggled to keep a straight face. This was one of White's guards. He was working the desk on alternating days with the other detail.

A remote that can switch bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went quiet for a moment, though Mia could vaguely make out some footsteps. \"...That sounds so cool! So what, you just want me to come over so we can play around with it, because I'm up for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia took a pause. \"There's something more important I'd like your help with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with the remote,\" Mia clarified. She took another pause. The way she asked this question would be crucial in getting her to help. Maya'd never accept if she thought it was too risky to the both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia took a deep breath, and let it out. \"Would you be interested in a stealth mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the remote!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with the remote. We'd sneak into a company headquarters to find evidence for a case I'm building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Maya respond?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While he may have been a man chasing a phantom, Simon scantly believed in the supernatural, and this 'body swapping remote' was definitely magic as far as he defined it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt <i>did</i> entice him, however. He had been searching for the 'Phantom' who had sabotaged the HAT-1 flight for years, but there was only so much he could do from behind bars. He barely knew if the man even existed, but it was the only thing that kept him going after he took the fall for a crime he didn't commit. \"I am running out of time...\" he said to himself, looking to the calendar the prison guards had so graciously given him. Every day that passed was a day he got closer to death row. If this absurd machine <i>did</i> work, he could have the freedom to go where he wished and investigate with total freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could just find the phantom and deliver justice, then it didn't matter if he cleared his name.

He could use that line later depending on how things go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, there was a lot of catching up to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I correct in assuming that you are Athena Cykes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the flesh!\" Athena said, cheerily. \"I haven't seen you in forever!

Only as a formality, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's up? What's the plan with the remote!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four types of swaps in his arsenal. He immediately dismissed the unaware swap as useless. All that would do is give him Athena's body, but he'd still be a prison and it wouldn't even prove the remote's authenticity to anyone but himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left him with three choices. The obvious would be to do an aware swap. If he did that, he could theoretically be free to investigate whenever he wanted, but Athena would be forced to sit in jail, which defeats the entire purpose of these last seven years, even if it's only temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA posession would leave a fake copy of his consciousness, leaving Athena out of jail, but in exchange, he'd be taking her body, which he considered unethical, even if, again, only temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third option would be a shapeshift. He would have to be sneaky about it, but it would allow him out of the prison while keeping Athena's consciousness alive and out of prison. But, if he was missing, the police might cause him trouble when he returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... what does he do?</span></div></div>",

On the other side of the glass in the detention center was....a box. <i>How did they get in here wearing that...thing?</i> He couldn't tell the gender of the person wearing the box, due to both the box itself and the wall between halves of the detention center blocking his view. Although, he figured he'd be able to figure out much about this person once they started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....and you are?\" Simon asked after a few seconds of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person wearing the box jumped back surprised once Simon spoke up and then seemed to hiss like a snake. They then stuck their hands and a camera out of the box and quickly flashed \"Myriam Scuttlebutt, I'm a reporter at Themis legal academy.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny amount of interest or caution Simon had left him when he heard this girl was just a reporter. He had to deal with many asking questions about what had happened, and over the years the amount had shrunk to near none. There was the occasional one though, usually ones who were new at their job and were doing there own investigations on old cases hoping to find some kind of conspiracy or something of that sort they could report on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he expected, Myriam asked questions like any other reporter did, although the fact that she kept hissing and kept herself hidden in a box was certainly unique. Simon answered her questions with the stock answers he had practiced over the years. As the conversation kept going, Simon's mind drifted to the remote he had received earlier. He doubted it would work, but there was no harm in trying in. Heck, if it didn't work then at least the box girl would have a story <i>Insane inmate threatens reporter with remote</i> Simon couldn't help but chuckle at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the off chance that it did work however, Simon gave some thought into which one of the remote's setting he should use. First off was the Aware swap button. Using that, he would be able to leave using her body, however she would be in his body. Her being in his body would risk either something happening to her in prison or him being mistaken for being insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next choice was the Possession button, which would provide him with the same result as the Aware swap button, but without him having to worry about her in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one would be the hardest to pull off, the Shapeshift button. With this he wouldn't have to involve this girl at all. Once she had left all he would have to do is use it when she left and then once he had shapeshift into her he would merely have to play out a 'Snuck into the prison for a scoop' act and get escorted out. The problem with this plan was pulling it off. He couldn't risk either the guards or the security cameras seeing him shapeshift. Thankfully he had learned from an escape artist a few cells down that there are a few blind spots in the prison security, nothing major enough to pull off a break out, but enough to stay out of sight for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more thought, Simon chose to use....</span></div></div>",

He knew he had her number. \"Well, you have to do me a favor,\" he explained. \"And then I'll guide you straight to the truth of the case seven years ago. How about it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed a bit hesitant at that. \"What kind of favor? I'm not going to bust you out of jail!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon shook his head. \"Nothing so oblique, I just need you to sit still and be quiet for but a moment,\" he explained. It wasn't a total lie. If the device worked as intended, then there's still be a Simon Blackquill in prison when he was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyriam crossed her arms and squinted a bit through the box, but seemed to yield. \"Okay... but nothing funny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't dream of it,\" Simon replied with a chuckle as he swiftly moved a hand into his jacket and pressed down the 'possession' button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision was instantly displaced, as though he had jumped up to the ceiling but didn't fall back down. He heard yelling below him. \"Hands to yourself prisoner!\" it shouted. He somehow shifted his viewpoint, seeing the guard from early rushing towards... his own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'It's real then!'</i> While Simon's body would be confined to the prison, his mind could escape unseen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't doing anything,\" Simon's body insisted. The guard didn't listen, and began to frisk Simon over, \"I was merely fixing a button you fool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard was too busy searching Simon for some sort of weapon that he didn't seem to notice the girl on the other side of the glass began to shake. Without a word, she rose up from her seat and walked out of the room, giving only a short bow as courtesy to the officer guarding the door on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simon walked out of the jail doors, he threw the carboard box off of Myriam\u2019s shoulders. Various notebooks and school supplies scattered about around it, but he scarcely cared. He looked down at his hands, now much smaller and more delicate in Myriam\u2019s body. In an instant, he was free from the prison. He couldn\u2019t believe it, but here he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching behind his head, he pulled stray twintail in from his eyes. He realized all of a sudden that he didn\u2019t actually know what this girl looked like. He didn\u2019t even have a plan for what to do as her actually. Looking around, he noticed the pile of school supplies scattered about and grabbed a mirror from the pile, pulling it up to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is Myriam then, hm?\u201d he murmured. \u201cI guess this is me for the moment. But the binder clips won\u2019t do,\u201d he said to no one in particular as he undid the clips that held Myriam\u2019s hair up, throwing them off to the side as her hair fell down her back. <i>\u2018As though she wants to look ridiculous,\u2019</i> he thought as he kicked the box away too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around a bit more, Simon managed to find a few other useful items in the pile: a journal, a phone, and a wallet. Thankfully, the remote was there as well. Apparently it had followed him from his old body. He had no idea how she kept all of these in a box while she wore it, but the phone looked a bit beat up, so he was willing to bet the answer was \u2018poorly\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look at her student ID confirmed what he thought based on her uniform; she went to Themis Legal Academy. The students there were well known for going into the legal world. <i>\u2018Might be some useful resources there,\u2019</i> he reasoned. As he thought it over however, he realized that he barely knew who he was at the moment. It might be a bit premature to launch an investigation when he didn\u2019t even know where his currently body lived. His impression of this girl was that she was strange, that was certain. He doubted that anything he did would affect her reputation. However, if he was really going to start his investigation, it might do some good to figure out what resources she had at her disposal. He still had the remote though, so it wasn't like he had to keep Myriam's body. If it began to seem like she wasn't going to be of use to him in an investigation, he could easily jump to another one. </span></div></div>",

Before he left, he took one last look at the stuff that had fallen out of Myriam's box to make sure he didn't forget anything actually usefull. Under a pile of notebooks and pencils he found a laptop, it didn't seem to be too damaged from Simon throwing the box, and access to the internet could prove to be usefull. He chose to take it with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon soon made it to Myriam's home. Thankfully, he didn't run into her parents as he entered. He didn't exactly know Myriam in a way that he could do an impression of her. As he entered her room, he opened her Laptop, the screen seemed to be slightly cracked, but not unusable. He went through Myriam's files, it became increasingly clear she wasn't a good journalist. Almost everything she had was typical gossip, she seemed to be especially interested with a certain trio of students. She had nearly a hundred pictures taken of this trio, nearly all of them obviously taken in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon did a quick internet search of the UR-1 incident, as expected no one thought anything about it other than what the courts had decided. As far as anyone in the world was concerned, Simon had killed Metis. Simon gritted Myriam's teeth at the thought of the real killer still being free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's thoughts were interrupted as some sunlight shined in from the window in Myriam's room. The sun was setting, he supposed it was getting late. He chose to go to sleep for now and make his next move tommorow. He closed Myriam's laptop and got ready for his first night sleeping on a real bed in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Simon was awoken by the sound of an alarm clock. He turned the alarm off and pulled himself out of bed. That was easily the best sleep he had in years, but he needed to focus now. He considered his options for what he could do now. The first option was to go to school as Myriam and learn what he could at Themis. The next option was to completely skip school and learn what he could elsewhere and perhaps get a better body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of thought, Simon chose too</span></div></div>",

He had just finished explaining to Apollo that he was in the U.S. looking for the Founder's Orb. Unbeknownst to Apollo, Dhurke was currently dead and being channeled by the spirit medium Maya Fey. Of course Dhurke didn't tell him, what father could tell their son about their death? He knew Apollo would find out when the time was right. Right now, his first priority was getting the Founder's Orb back to Khura'in. He just hoped that Maya as capable of channeling him long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were all leaving the office to head to Kurain village, Dhurke noticed an unopened package by the door to the agency. It was labeled 'To Apollo' Dhurke picked it up. Apollo and Trucy were already out the door and walking down the hallway. Dhurke stared at the package and began to open it. \"Any package of my son's is a package of mine.\" Dhurke gave himself that excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside that package was some kind of remote and a manual. Dhurke took both as he followed behind Apollo and Trucy, he read the manual. Apparently this remote was some kind of Body Switching device. It sounded like nonsense, but Dhurke came from a country where seeing the visions of the dead was normal, so this didn't seem too far out of the realm of possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote had four functions 'Aware Swap', where both people would be aware that the swap happened. 'Unaware swap' where the person holding the remote would be the only person to notice that bodies were switched around, 'Possession' where the affected party would be turned into some kind of ghost-like state and be able to possess people, and 'Shapeshift', where people's bodies can be turned into exact copies of other people's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhurke thought of the possibilities of the remote, what could he do with this? The first thought that came to mind was finding a way to have a physical body without needed Maya to channel him. She had been through a lot and he didn't want to put further mental strain on her by having her channel him for long. If he used the 'Possession' button, would his spirit not be channeled by Maya? There was only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed the remote at himself and pressed the possession button. In a moment he was floating in mid-air in a ghost like state. The experience wasn't the most pleasant, considering he was already a dead man walking. He looked down at the body he just left to see....</span></div></div>",

He waited patiently as the Russian sailors brought in his special luggage and threw it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the sailors had left, he opened the special luggage, his best friend Ryuunosuke Naruhodou laying within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghh\" was the first thing out of Ryuunosuke's mouth. \"I wrote \"Do not put upside down on the luggage and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like the Russians couldn't read your Japanese.\" Asougi laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of discussing and laughing about why Asougi brought Ryuunosuke along and the difficult time he had inside the luggage, an important topic needed to be addressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do now?\" Ryuunosuke asked \"If any sailors see me, they'd throw me out for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma's eyes lit up. He had clearly been waiting for Ryuunosuke to ask this question. \"Naruhodou\" He began as he pulled out a strange wooden device \"Recently I came across a device that will help with that problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ryuunosuke could ask what it does, Asougi pointed it at him and pressed a button. With a flash, Ryuunosuke's body began to change instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding where Ryuunosuke once was stood an exact copy of Susato. \"W-W-Whaaaat?!\" Ryuunosuke practically yelled as he felt around his new body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsougi for his part just laughed \"Looks like it worked perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuunosuke took quick deep breaths, trying to calm down. Was this magic? How could he suddenly turn into a young woman? But, Asougi seemed perfectly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his friend still clearly panicked, Asougi decided to explain everything in whole. He had recieved a package with this strange device yesterday and a manual explaining what each of the functions on it could do. He had felt that this device was the perfect way to smuggle Ryuunosuke to the British Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the sailors were to see you, they'd throw you overboard for being a stowaway immediately, but they wouldn't look twice if they just saw a normal passenger. You'll be able to leave the cabin with ease, as opposed to me just keeping you locked in here.\" Asougi explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuunosuke for his part had now completely calmed down, Asougi's confidence was reassuring. However, Ryuunosuke saw a fatal flaw in this plan \"But what about the real Susato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsougi thought about it for a minute \"Hmmm....I guess you'll just have to make sure not to run into her.\" He said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuunosuke suddenly felt much less confident in this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the next month and a half, you aren't Ryuunosuke Naruhodou. You are Susato Mikotoba. Oh, also. You may be able to walk around the ship freely like this, but I'll still need you to sleep in this wardrobe at night. After all, a second Susato wouldn't have her own room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuunosuke held his hand to his head. This was going to be a long trip.</span></div></div>",

He had to walk with his legs practically pressed against each other, which constantly brought to his attention a major change in his body.

The breeze of the wind didn't help him ignore the sensations<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can keep this up for a month and a half\" Ryuunosuke said to Asougi. \"Susato's body feels so.....strange\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsougi laughed \"Would you rather stay in the wardrobe the whole trip? Or become a sailor and have to work the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsougi had a point, while being Susato was not ideal, being shoved into the wardrobe the whole trip seemed even more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, since the real Susato is also on the ship, you should make sure to behave like her if anyone talks to you. We don't want to arouse suspicion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuunosuke gulped at that, he knew next to nothing about how Susato would act around people. He had never actually interacted with her. Asougi seemed to notice his nervousness. \"Just behave as a polite woman.\" Asougi said, to which Ryuunosuke nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two of them were engrossed in conversation, Ryuunosuke didn't pay attention as he turned a corner.

Phoenix got a turkey sandwich, while Maya got one of the largest, most ridiculous-looking burgers that even she had ever seen. She finished the burger before Phoenix even finished his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix checked his watch. It was about time to lock up the office for the night. So, he and Maya headed down to the Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices, and locked the door. But, right as Maya started to walk back down to the ground floor, Phoenix called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Maya? I found a package here, it's for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya walked back over to find a small cardboard box sitting next to the office door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's not for you? It's pretty boring-looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it has 'For Maya Fey' written on it in giant, black sharpie, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Good point.\" Maya said, a little embarrassed at how hard her attempt at a quip backfired. \"I'll just... be taking this.\" Maya picked up the box. The two of them stood there in silence, Phoenix starting to smile at her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow!\" Maya blurted out, before leaving the building and going home. At a faster-than-normal walking speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya arrived at home, and set the box down on the table, now itching to see what was inside. Inside she found a remote and an instruction booklet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote was a body-switching remote, which allowed the user 4 different body-switching effects. Aware swap, the traditional kind, unaware, which switches bodies but leaves everyone but the user completely unaware that any change even happened, possession, which lets you take someone's body, leaving a copy of you in your place, and shapeshift, which makes your body look exactly like someone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">(Woah!)</span> Maya thought. <span class=\"clblue\">(Think of all the cool stuff I can do with this!)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could possess Nick, and then use his body to give herself his wallet! Or maybe, she could shapeshift into Nick, go to his bank as him, and take all of his money out! Or maybe, she could do something that didn't have anything to do with taking Nick's money! The possibilities were endless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes Maya forgets that it's a miracle Phoenix can even afford to keep his house with how little work he gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Maya headed back to the office, remote in tow. She knocked on the door, Phoenix opened it, he let her in, she asked if he had any new cases, he said no, as usual, and then they kicked their feet up and did nothing for an hour or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I almost forgot to ask\", said Phoenix, after a particularly boring episode of The Nickel Samurai came to its conclusion. \"What was that box you got last night? Anything important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya could tell Nick about the remote, but then she wouldn't be able to mess with him, since he would know what was up instantly. At the same time, if Nick went along with it, having a partner in crime to mess with people or something could be awesome, too. But she could always tell him later. So, what does she do?</span></div></div>",

A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A machine that lets you swap bodies! It was that package from yesterday! We could do all kinds of cool things with this. We could swap with a big corporate guy and mail a bunch of money to us! You could swap Larry with his new girlfriend and watch them both freak out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Larry has a new girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When has he ever not had a new girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Good point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought about it for a second. This could actually be a really interesting device to play around with, but... Wait. How did she even know it worked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you haven't tested that on someone already, have you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I look like, some kind of Psycho or something? Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she hasn't even used it. Only Maya would find a remote in a box and start showing it to people before she even knew it did anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Maya. That is almost without a doubt a joke or something. How do you know that thing works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it works! Watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya held the remote up and pointed it at Phoe-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OBJECTION! Not necessary! You don't need to prove it, I believe you, just do not do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, Nick! Are we gonna mess around with this awesome power or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Maya. I don't think people would be too happy with us stealing their bodies. It's almost kidnapping, or something. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're too scared to try, but think about this! We could switch bodies with policemen, and then arrest everyone on the scene of a case so we can investigate! Or, we could just pretend to work there! Cut out the middleman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix hadn't thought of that. This remote could be useful, if he survived Maya's 'fun' first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Nick! What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

He looked over to where he was to see himself still standing there. He scratched his head in confusion, only to recoil in pain when he realized he jabbed his face with his fingernail. He then realized that he felt really strange. He felt extra weight on the back of his head and on his chest, but felt way lighter in general. He started to look around him before looking down.

Unluckily, or perhaps luckily, the bang Phoenix got in the body cause him to lose his memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit of time passed until Phoenix finally came to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Phoenix said, sitting up and taking in his surroundings. He looked over to his desk, to see his body sitting there, feet up on the desk, eyes looking back and forth on a magazine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya, while Phoenix was unconscious, had hidden the remote in a pocket of the suit she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you finally awake?\" Asked Phoenix's body. Maya wasn't sure whether or not Nick had lost his memory or not, and she didn't want to give away anything by assuming one way or the other, so she tried to be really vague until she had an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix tried to stand, but he lost his balance and had to sit back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm awake, yeah. Uh... why was I out?\" Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you tripped and bonked your head on a table.\" Maya explained. \"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... alright.\" Phoenix said. \"Uh... well... physically, anyway. Uh... do you know where, uh... where this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya silently cheered at that question. He had lost his memories! This could be great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to tell him that he always was Maya. His memories would come back at some point anyway, no harm done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where this is, N-Maya!\" Maya said to her body. She almost slipped, there. She could bring everything back really quickly of she wasn't careful. \"It's the Wright and Co. Law Offices!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maya? Is that... my name?\" It rang a few bells, that was for sure. But something about it felt... off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.\" Maya feigned concern. \"You lost your memories, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked up at Maya, with very real concern in his eyes. \"I must have.\" Suddenly, his eyes widened. \"Oh, no! I lost my memory! It's gone! Who am I!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya leaned back in her chair. The reason she hadn't gotten up was because she was having balance issues too. She started to quietly snicker despite her best effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, calm down, Maya!\" She yelled at him, still holding in chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix stopped freaking out and took a minute to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sir?\" He asked. \"Do you know... me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I know you! You're Maya Fey, my beautiful, amazing, genius assistant, and part-time spirit medium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya Fey, huh?\" It still rang a lot of bells, but some doubt still rose up within him. \"So... who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoenix Wright, Ace- or... uh... attorney at law. Your old coot of a boss. You call me 'Nick' and we get burgers together and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name \"Phoenix Wright\" rung some bells, too. A lot of them. A suspicious amount of bells more than the name \"Maya\" rung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Mr. Wright?\" Phoenix asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'm sure! I'm Phoenix Wright, you're Maya Fey, who is the best, and the sky is green, what's there not to be sure about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, blue, I mean. The sky is blue.\" Maya corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I don't remember being a spirit medium.\" Said Phoenix.  \"And am I really a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me, just take a look at yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked down again. He WAS wearing channeling robes. These were girl's clothes, too, weren't they? Robes and skirts like this are girl's clothes. He knew that. So he must be a girl, then, right? And why would he be wearing robes for channeling if he couldn't channel? He must be a medium. It's the only way this all made sense. He struggled to find a reason not to believe what this man was telling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I believe you.\" Said Phoenix. How he felt about the facts didn't really matter. There's no way he could deny what was right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother silent cheer from Maya's corner. It worked! She had him totally convinced! And her acting was marginally not terrible! She was so good, she could even dub an anime! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne consequence Maya hadn't fully considered was that she was in charge of the office now. She checked Nick's watch and saw that it was about lunchtime. A realization dawned on her. She could go buy all the burgers she could ever want! She was in charge of the money! Part of her wanted to grab 'Maya' by the arm, run out of the office straight to Grilliam Shakespeare's, and maybe even give her doppelganger a taste for burgers, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, at the same time, all these problems with balance and all the confusion could definitely cause a problem if they got caught while they were out. And Nick's body didn't get hungry as easily anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do 'Phoenix' and 'Maya' head out or stay in and think about their life choices?</span></div></div>",

Aren't burgers expensive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nearly dropped her jaw, despite the fact that it was Nick in her body, she couldn't get around the fact that her voice practically just said that she didn't want burgers.

Let's just go already!\" She said and grabbed Phoenix's arm and practically dragged him out of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was unsure about this Mr. Wright man, he was very hyper and seemed to make decisions on a whim. Although he couldn't remember much of anything, he had a hard time imagining this person as his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk later Phoenix and Maya were at Grilliam Shakespeare's.

He could vaguely remember being here before and buying food, but he couldn't remember any specifics. He tried eating the burger, but it didn't taste very good to him, he had a hard time imagining this place, or burgers in general as one of his favorite things, despite 'Mr. Wrights' insisting. Once Maya had her food, she began to chow down. Although Phoenix's stomach was full, she forced herself to eat it do to her pure love of burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were done eating, Maya had eaten multiple burgers while Phoenix barely ate half of one, they walked out. \"So, do you remember anything Maya?\" Maya asked Phoenix, still suppressing laughter at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Phoenix remember anything about who he really is?</span></div></div>",

He was watering that plant in the corner of the room, but then, the next instant, he felt smaller, and saw Mr. Wright, or \"Nick\", or whatever he's supposed to be called, standing by the plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't quite sure what to make of it. Maybe it had something to do with him being a spirit medium?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one thing, Mr., uh... Mr... Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat name. \"Mr. Nick\". He'd heard that somewhere before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, uh... two things, actually. First, do I have a little sister, or cousin, or something? That calls you 'Mr. Nick'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya started to worry. Things were coming back to him pretty quickly. And if he gets his memories back while they're out, she could be in some serious trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could work this to her favor, though. He asked about Pearl like he thought they were related on his own. Maybe she could use that to reaffirm his identity for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pearly?\" Maya asked. \"Or, uh, Pearls? Which is the name that I, Phoenix Wright, call her and not you, who calls her Pearly because you're Maya Fey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the name \"Pearl\" brought her back to him. Yeah, Pearl Fey was Maya Fey's cousin, and since he's Maya Fey, that means that Pearl is his cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! Pearly! I know Pearly! She's my cousin, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was excited. He had remembered something about himself that he didn't feel weird about! Maybe he was wrong to be so unsure about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled. He kinda wished he had kept that burger as a leftover. <span class=\"clblue\">(Oh, well. There's always dinner time.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was still something bothering him. What was that strange memory about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping me remember Pearly! I have another question, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was getting a little tired of all the questions. But hey! She knew her life better than anyone! It'd be super easy to answer anything that she was asked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember something happening. I was watering a plant, and then I felt myself move, and get smaller, and I saw you where I was standing. What do you know about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept maybe a question like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" Maya said. \"As you know. You... are... a spirit medium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. That makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And spirit mediums have special powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one of the powers is, that you can take over other people's bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can!?\" Phoenix asked. This didn't ring any bells at all, but the idea that he could take over a person's body excited him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. That's what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can I do it now!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Can't do it now, sorry.\" A bad mistake. Maya realized a second too late that what she described was exactly like the possession function on the remote. She could have used that, but alas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Asked Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you... haven't... been training. Duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But I feel like this didn't happen that long ago. Like... maybe in the past week or so? Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what!? No! No! Don't be, uh, ridiculous, Maya! It's been months! Months and months! A long time! I'm not lying, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the lie Maya told. Did it convince Phoenix?</span></div></div>",

It may be better if she let Phoenix stay at the office for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Phoenix was getting a bit suspicious of her advice of 'recovering memory' he may get really suspicious if she wouldn't let him go to 'his' home for the night.

He stepped outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought back a ton of memories. Complete, fully formed memories. A woman with giant hair, Pearly, some souther lady who annoyed him, all very interesting people. He must have been here a lot for it to leave such an impression on him. Sounds like this is the correct living space. Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to look for Fey manor, where he'd be staying for the night. The giant building near the station seemed to be most likely. He made his way towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mystic Mayaaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around to see a little girl that looked kind of like himself heading towards him. This must be Pearly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing back so soon, Mystic Maya?\" Pearly asked. \"I thought you were spending time with Mr. Nick today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... hiya, Pearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix wasn't sure what to say.

Y'know what, forget that for a second. I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you, Mystic Maya. What's troubling you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I was at Mr. Nick's office, I hurt myself pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl gasped very loudly. He probably should have seen that coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... well, anyway, when I hurt myself, I think I lost my memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl covered her mouth with her hand. \"Oh, no, Mystic Maya! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. But I'm going to need your help, okay, Pearly? I need you to help remind me about everything I forgot, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking to Pearl was really easy and natural, Phoenix noted. Although, that would make sense, her being his cousin and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl finally nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mystic Maya! I'll show you all around the village and help you remember your life! Come with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl grabbed Mystic Maya's arm and brought her all around the village, explaining all the traditions, rules, meanings, and techniques of the village. Phoenix thought that even a stranger could channel a spirit after hearing all the detail Pearly went to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Mr. Nick help you remember anything?\" Asked Pearl, as she showed Mystic Maya the side room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He was very nice. If it wasn't for him, I don't even think I would have remembered you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was probably the wrong thing to say. Pearl's gears started turning with a ferocity matched by her first meeting with Mr. Nick. He was \"very nice\"? It must be true love! They really are made for each other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl thought of a genius idea. Maybe, in this malleable state, she could push Mystic Maya's love to the forefront of her mind, and give her the courage she needed to finally take their relationship to the next level! Just throw it in like all the others, she won't even realize anything's strange!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have something else important to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix loved to hear that. Important meant big. And big meant another step closer to total recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Pearly!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl took a deep, deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Mr. Nick are madly in love with each other! You both want to be a couple together and you want to hold hands and go out on dates and everything amazing couples are supposed to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, this avalanche of truth spilled out of Pearl's mouth over the course of only a few seconds, the entire time Phoenix spent staring at her, slack-jawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that doesn't answer the important question.

This system is responsible for all the hormones that cause human emotion. This includes happiness, sadness, love, anger, fear, adrenaline, and so on. The important thing to note is that sexuality, and even more importantly, sexual orientation, is influenced by this system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn layman's terms, if a straight man and woman were to swap bodies, the hosts would have the same orientations as the bodies they took. As opposed to it carrying over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... when Pearl tells \"Maya\" about \"her love for Mr. Nick\", his normal sexual orientation isn't present to debunk this claim, which leaves the equivalent of a memory deprived teenage girl using the little knowledge she has of a person to assess the claim that she loves him, while under the assumption that the person telling her this knows more than she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, this girl knows Phoenix Wright as the man who helped her recover her memory, took her out to burgers, which are her favorite food, and said super nice things about her the whole time. \"Beautiful, amazing, genius assistant.\" That's how she was described by him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya thought about Phoenix Wright. Something powerful washed over her. Suddenly, everything started rushing back. Every moment they spent together she could see in her mind's eye in vivid detail. In the heat of it, she didn't notice that they were all from Phoenix Wright's perspective looking at her. And there was no time to dwell, because as soon as she accepted that as truth, everything else came back as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Maya Fey. She had a big sister named Mia Fey, and Aunt named Morgan, a mother named Misty, a cousin named Pearl. She liked to call her Pearly. She was destined to become the master of the Kurain channeling technique. She would always channel Mia when Nick was in trouble because she knew how smart Mia was. She was the assistant at the Wright and Co. Law Offices. She liked to relax. She liked to be the goofy, fun girl who always kept everybody's spirits up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down again. Those robes felt so much more... right. Those were hers. They always were. She was a fool to think otherwise. The magatama radiated with power. That power was hers. She felt her presence in space. This body was hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was Maya Fey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Pearl was absolutely right about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl just watched as Mystic Maya stood there, slackjawed, eyes rolling around in their sockets, for what was probably only 30 seconds but felt like 10 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mystic Maya's brain looked to be switched on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember... I remember everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clapped her hands together and gave a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much, Pearly! I think that did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was nearing it's end. They decided together to stop by the local burger place, where Maya wolfed the down the largest one they had in record time, and get straight to bed. Pearl was trying to keep Mystic Maya well rested for her profession of her love tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was sleepless, though. Obviously, Phoenix currently believed he was Maya, but if he didn't, he'd realize that the place he'd felt this way before was when he first met Dahlia Hawthorne. What a cruel irony that his love was based in lies yet again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the night, Maya was as energetic as ever that morning. She hopped on the train, rode it back to the city, and stepped into the Wright &amp; Co Law Offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoenix Wright\" was inside, watching the Steel Samurai finale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... uh... how was Kurain?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya\" suddenly felt like she had a decision to make. Was today the day she finally came clean? Or should she hold off until a better time comes? Maybe she could find out how he feels about her somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

What the hell was it that Pearly drilled into his head today!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was a dumb question. It's pretty obvious what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... still! It's only been a few hours and he's already into men!? How malleable a brain does he have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was absolutely not going to let this continue. She didn't care if he got his memories back at this point, this was NOT happening, she was not going to let Phoenix fall in love with HIMSELF as her. That wasn't just stupid, it's probably not even legal in a few states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what does Maya do to try and fix this problem?</span></div></div>",

He looked down at himself and instead of his own body and clothes, he saw Maya's. He initially began to freak out, but he began to think about the day. For some reason, as he thought about what happened today, he was filled with memories about talking to himself and being referred to as 'Maya', but it wasn't as if he remembered his whole life as Maya and only thought of himself as Phoenix now. He could remember his entire life as being Phoenix Wright and only today as Maya Fey. This could only mean one thing, he ended up in Maya's body at some point today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked himself up off the ground, he had a bit trouble with balance due to the fact that he had just gotten hit in the head. He looked over to his own body, which was currently talking to itself about Steel Samurai episodes '<i>Guess that answers whether or not Maya is in my body'</i> he thought to himself. The fact that Maya was in his body now meant that she was in it all day. Phoenix could remember that all day his body kept referring to him as Maya and had taken him to a burger joint. This meant that Maya wasn't concerned about the swap. She must know something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Phoenix was about to say something and confront Maya, she turned around \"Ah, Maya, you're awake! Is your head okay?\" Maya asked, both to make sure that hitting Phoenix on the head again gave him amnesia again and to make sure she didn't damage her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm feeling just fine.....Maya\" Phoenix said, a bit angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha...haha\" Maya began to laugh nervously. She immediately realized her plan to hit Phoenix over the head again didn't work, in fact, it had done the complete opposite of what she intended, he had regained his memory! Which sadly meant that her fun was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix tapped Maya's sandaled foot impatiently. He crossed his arms and asked \"Well, Maya, how'd you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, do what Nick?\" She said, trying to play innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this.\" Phoenix said and gestured to the body he was currently in. \"How did you swap our bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya wondered whether or not she should come clean and tell Phoenix about that remote. On one hand, if she told him, he might not let her do whatever she wanted with it anymore. Nick could be an old grump sometimes and might make her use it 'responsibly' or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, it may be nice to have a partner to use the remote with. Using the remote might get a bit boring if she was the only one who knew about it. Well, if she aware swapped other people technically she wouldn't be the only one to know about the swaps, but she would be the only one who would know what caused it, so the point still stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Maya tell Phoenix about the remote?</span></div></div>",

He chose to play dumb about the swap until either Maya accidentally spilled the beans about how she caused this swap or something a little more 'devious'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had no idea where to go in the village and I didn't want to go and ask some strangers for directions. Even if I did know these people before, I can't remember if I did\" Phoenix came up with an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Maya said, a bit disappointed that Phoenix didn't get to sink into his new temporary identity as Maya Fey. \"Well, you can stay here for the night if you want to.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Phoenix said and began to go over his plan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Phoenix kept up the amnesia ace long enough, Maya would eventually get worried. She was probably just pretending to be him for now as some kind of joke, but he imagined that she would get worried if she thought she had permanently given him amnesia and she would have to keep up her 'Phoenix Wright' act for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Phoenix didn't plan on keeping up the amnesia act for too long, not only did he think that Maya would crack after not too long, but if there someone came with a case he would immediately demand to switch back. He doubted Maya could accurately act like him while either investigating or in the courtroom. She could keep up this whole 'I'm Phoenix Wright' thing for now, but there was no way Phoenix would sit back and let her ruin someone's defense, even if it was unintentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Phoenix was a bit mad about Maya lying to him when he had amnesia, he was a bit thankful he had amnesia in the first place. He imagined that he would be much more uncomfortable with being in Maya's body if he hadn't thought that it was his own body for several hours today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix's mind drifted to wondering how long he would have to wait before Maya either revealed how she did this or got worried about Phoenix's amnesia the door to the office opened.

There was a searing pain on the back of his head, he figured he must have hit it on something earlier. He had the strangest dream earlier, he dreamt that he was in Maya's body. It was certainly a strange dream, he couldn't even remember when he had fallen asleep. After he had fully waken up, he sat up and suddenly he felt strange, yet slightly familiar sensations. It was then that he looked down at himself and realized what he had feared. It wasn't a dream, he was in Maya's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his panic, Phoenix felt all around his new body making sure that it was all real. He stood up and nearly fell over again due to his new center of gravity. Thankfully he caught himself this time. He mind raced as he tried to think of how this could have possibly happened. As he tried to think, he suddenly heard his own voice call out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooood morning Nick! Oops, I mean Maya.\" Maya in Phoenix's body said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's mouth was agape as he saw how nonchalant Maya was acting to this situation. \"Maya, How, What, Why?\" Phoenix struggled to speak due to the shock of the situation, but soon made a coherent sentence \"How did this happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, I'm not telling!\" Maya decided to play around with Nick for a while instead of telling him about the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down a bit, Phoenix asked his next question \"Are we stuck like this?\" He asked, afraid of being stuck in Maya's body forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! I wouldn't want to be this old forever, that would just be terrible.\" Maya began. \"I can switch us back whenever I want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then switch us back now!\" Phoenix practically demanded.</span></div></div>",

But then, her hand stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing first!\" Maya said. Before Phoenix could tell what was happening, he was in his body, with a throbbing pain in his left jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you hitting yourself, Nick?\" Asked Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">(Ha ha. Very cute.)</span> Phoenix put a hand up to his jaw.

So, was there any reason why I woke up in your body just now or were you just trying to screw with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya shrugged. \"Nah.

I just- I just teleported for no reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You win this round.\" Maya finally conceded. \"But, now that you know about it, whaddaya think? Think it could be good for something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for switching you with someone better-behaved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix smirked. A few jokes at her expense was a good enough payback for that little mishap. Actually, thinking of that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, how's your head, Maya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not any worse than your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his jaw again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the reminder. Ugh. Why did you even do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be funny.

What do you think of the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix pondered the question for a moment. There were a lot of things you could do with that thing, but there was a pretty short list of ethical activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it could be good for something. But the question still remains of what that 'something' could be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything legal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What counts as legal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignoring the fact that one of your ideas probably involves switching with a pizza delivery guy for free food, switching with someone without their consent in the first place is theft, so that's the line I'm drawing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya put her hand to her cheek and looked away for a second. Then she turned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm out of ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My point exactly, Maya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo either of them think of an acceptable use of the device, or does Phoenix not approve of the device's usage?</span></div></div>",

Anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly explained the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, after working as long as you have on solving mysteries, I would expect you to be more skeptical of these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly it, though! That's the favor! I want you to help us test it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Fey, I was in the middle of an important discussion. If all you want to talk about is some ridiculous body-switching remote control, we can speak some other time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Chatting up your boyfriend?\" Maya made her way over to the laptop to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth closed the laptop before Maya managed to get more than a peek at it. \"Ha, ha, you're very funny. Now, if you could please go, before I find a way to cut your salary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quick peek at the screen she got was all she needed to force an ultimatum on the good prosecutor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, Mr. Edgeworth. For you see... Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what truth is that, might I ask?\" Edgeworth asked, his very real worry only noticible by the most perceptive of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple. I heard the contents of your phone conversation before I came in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the Serenade Arc all too well. It's the third arc of the Steel Samurai reboot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! Pure coincidence! Nothing more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it? Because you closed your laptop just a little too slowly just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth jolted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I use that forum, too, you know.\" Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth started to sweat profusely. \"I can... erm... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I know we've talked more on there than in real life! I know, because your computer was on the Steel Samurai FanForum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not another word, Ms. Fey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's pointing practice in the past few weeks proved useful, if only just this once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. No bluffing your way out of this one, ProsecutorSushiSlice1992!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngooooooohhhhhhh! Where did you learn my username!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere. As long as you help me test the remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Very well, Ms. Fey. You win. Now, where is this remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's back at Nick's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth crossed his arms. \"Well, I can't well test the device without it here, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're coming with me! We've already got the other test subject there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a chill ran down Edgeworth's spine. He wasn't switching with Wright or Ms. Fey? Then who? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Dare I ask who it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya leaned forward. \"<i>Ex-squeeze me</i>? I didn't catch that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Not him! Anyone but him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!?!?!?!?!?!?\" Edgeworth screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good guess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to give Larry Butz control of my personage! The deal is off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'll give you two choices. You come with me, and let Larry take your body, or I reveal the true identity of Mr. Slice. Your pick!\" Maya sat on the couch and leaned back into it, arms crossed, smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never would I have imagined things would turn out like this, Ms. Fey. I'm shocked at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and pick something! I've got a deadline to meet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Miles agree to let Larry use his body?</span></div></div>",

Blackmail has to be in writing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In California, it does not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you two, what's happening here?\" Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your subordinate is blackmailing me into your body-switching experiment, Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not blackmail!\" Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have a very low opinion of me to think that a prosecutor would not know what qualifies as blackmail in his own district.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll look it up, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked it up, and here's what they found:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn California, blackmail only applies when the person forced to commit an act is a public official. And also in California, members of the judicial branch are not considered public officials, legally. That includes prosecutors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth slapped his face with his hand. \"Oh, what happened to this country?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my condition was that she couldn't break the law, so she's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Ethical violations of any kind weren't included in the discussion in any way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Too late now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for God's sake. Fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix chuckled. \"Are you mad about losing a legal battle to a teenager, Edgeworth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm a legal adult!\" Maya insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix chuckled again. \"She's right, Edgeworth, don't try to argue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry took this opportunity to break up the arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, about time to switch, right?\" Larry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nodded. \"Both of you stand on opposite sides of the room and face each other so you can tell me if it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you two.\" Phoenix said. \"It's time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna be Edgey!

You can only become the other person I chose, but don't worry, I know you'll love being this person.\" Maya said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was a bit confused. \"So, who did you manage to convince to let Larry have their body?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya had a sly gin \"Oh, you'll see.

The unaware swap option was also a no-go: only she would have been able to tell that Franziska was in Larry's body, and even Nick would simply see Franziska as if she had always looked like Larry. This left only one option: the very button she pressed after pointing the remote at Larry. But not before taking the opportunity to shout out something like Nick always does in court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">TAKE THAT!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix gawked as he witnessed his longtime friend quickly transform into a person who was his polar opposite in pretty much every way conceivable. \"Maya, how in the world did you convince HER to let Larry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHH! Nick! You'll spoil the surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Larry had been paying attention to Phoenix's exclamation, he wouldn't have learned anything new about what had happened to him. He was marveling at his new form. The remote really did change him into a woman, and he quickly recognized the outfit and, more importantly, the whip that was right within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FRANZY! I'm her now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! How's it feel to be a perfect Von Karma, Larry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression of happiness on what looked like Franziska's face amused Maya to no end; at the same time, Phoenix was beginning to sweat as something popped into his head. \"Maya, you didn't swap their bodies, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Nick! I don't think I ever could have gotten permission for that. I just turned Larry into copy of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you even get her permission for this anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told her I could make Larry less of a fool and as perfect as her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she actually believed that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..no.

Larry must have ran out of the office why she was talking with Nick. \"Oh no\" Maya said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was already on his way out of the office. \"Come one Maya, let's go after him.\" He said, he wanted to get Larry back before he caused any damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya grabbed Phoenix's sleeve. \"Hold on, Nick. Maybe we should just let him do what he wants for now?\" Maya said with a devious grin. \"After all, Franziska did technically give us permission to make Larry her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix frowned at Maya \"You know very well that she wouldn't have given you permission if she knew what you meant, you practically tricked her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya shrugged \"At least Larry's having fun. Maybe Franziska's public image will get better if people see she can be less grumpy I'm public\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure Larry could ruin anyone's public image in only 5 minutes, we need to hurry.\" Phoenix said and turned back toward the office door, he needed to find Larry quickly. He didn't want to think of what would happen to him if Franziska found out he and Maya let Larry run wild in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya on the other hand, grinned and slowly walked out of the office. She knew she wouldn't be able to convince Phoenix to let Larry go, but she knew she could stall him for at least a few minutes. Maybe a few minutes of having Larry control her reputation would teach Franziska not to whip Maya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix walked out of the front door of the building, he looked to the remote and saw that the Shapeshift button had registered Larry's form as well as Franziska's. That must have happened when Maya turned Larry into Franziska. This gave Phoenix an idea, instead of just turning Larry back to normal when they got back to the office, he'd just turn him back to his usual self the second he ran into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix walked down the sidewalk, something caught his eye. There was a pair of shoes on the sidewalk, they looked familiar to Phoenix, but he couldn't remember where he'd seen them. He decided that there were more important things for him to do than look at shoes and moved one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Larry's perspective----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry was meanwhile have the time of his life. The second Maya had transformed him into Franzy, he had run out of the office. After all, why turn him into her then lock him up in the office? Maya and Nick must have been planning to let him go out as her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the first thing he had done when he was out of the office was trip due to Franziska's heels. Thankfully for him, he landed in some grass and not the hard concrete. He picked himself up of the ground and wiped himself off. There was now several grass stains on the front of his clothes, but Larry shrugged it off. It wasn't like Franziska's actual outfit had gotten dirty, only a copy. That's when Larry had an idea, he kicked off the heels and continued running down the sidewalk, after all, it wasn't as if Franziska's actual shoes were being left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry wondered where he should go, that's when he got an idea. He had been selling Samurai Dogs down by Gourd Lake, he was sure that if he started selling them as Franziska, he would have a lot more sales than usual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----Phoenix's perspective----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was getting worried, it had been nearly an hour since Larry had left the office and he was getting worried. That's when he turned a corner and saw what looked like Franziska von Karma walking down the street. Phoenix assumed that this was Larry. Thankfully there didn't seem to be anyone nearby, the street was completely silent save for the sound of Franziska's heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix readied the remote and aimed it at who he thought was Larry. He prepared the Shapeshift with Larry's form and prepared to press it<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then again, he would almost certainly be whipped for daring to approach her outside of a case, and if she found out that he had had a hand in Larry potentially damaging her reputation...</span></div></div>",

Upon closer inspection, the Larry-Franziska also had some mud on his clothes, telling the two apart was very easy close up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix got closer to the two, Franziska's yelling got louder \"You foolish fool! What made you think that parading around with my identity was acceptable!?\" The real Franziska yelled at Larry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Phoenix was right in front of them, he spoke up. Mostly to interrupt Franziska's shouting before she made both of them deaf \"Alright, Larry. I'm going to turn you back now.\" Phoenix said and held up the remote, pointing at Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moment before Phoenix turned Larry back to normal, Larry pointed behind Phoenix and began to shout \"look! Gourdy is behind you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the proclamation of Gourdy seemed ridiculous, Phoenix turned around anyway to see what Larry was shouting about. Phoenix saw nothing behind him, but he did hear a large this on the ground as he turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turned back around. What he saw confused him. Both Franziska's were on the ground. This was probably a last second trick by Larry. It wouldn't work though, after all. Larry didn't have any shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phoenix pressed the button, he noticed that both Franziska's actually weren't wearing shoes now! The shoes were sitting in the mud. Larry must have pulled them off of Franziska as he knocked her down. The same mud that the shoes were in was now all over both Franziska's. They once again looked identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Franziskas stood up and picked her whip off the ground and whipped the other \"fool! Why would you attempt something as futile as knocking me over! To think you soiled my perfect looks with this mud\" That personality convinced Phoenix that this was the real Franziska.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to turn the other's body into Larry when suddenly, \"You dare whip me? Fool! You wear my body all day and now you try to take my identity?!\" The other Franziska yelled and whipped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix could tell what was going on. Larry was trying to confuse him into turning the wrong person back into him, but which Franziska was the real one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Phoenix Wright! Turn this fool back now!\" The Franziska on his left shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be fooled by him, I'm am the real Franziska Von Karma\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich person did Phoenix Shapeshift into Larry</span></div></div>",

Quit pretending to be Franziska or things are going to get worse for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Franziskas raised eyebrows at that statement. \"Just turn that foolish fool back now already, Phoenix Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit being foolish and turn him back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your funeral. Just one question. How did you like the taste of Becky's \"sandwich surprise\" back in seventh grade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Franziska at his left looked completely perplexed, the one on his right gave him a furious look. \"NICK! YOU SWORE NEVER TO TALK ABOUT THAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\" With the press of a button, Larry had been turned back into himself. \"And that's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRACK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska immediately began laying into Larry. \"This is for daring to take my identity, pushing me into the ground, and daring to use a whip against me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! OW! OW! OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix winced at the sight, remembering how Franziska had treated him after he had handed her first courtroom defeat defending Maya. After about forty lashes, he figured Larry might need a reprieve. \"Erm...maybe you could let up a little now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRACK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEOWCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just why should I stop now, Phoenix Wright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...all he ended up doing was trying to sell hot dogs. Looking around, I don't think that worked. So...at least there's no lasting damage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska narrowed her eyes. \"You are digging a rather large hole for yourself, Phoenix Wright. You may have helped me stop this fool from taking his impersonation of me any further, but I haven't forgotten the fact that you let Maya Fey change him in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this wasn't good.

Franziska was already impatiently waiting for him. \"Is the remote undamaged?\" She asked, tapping Larry's foot impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked at the remote, still dripping wet.

He opened it and found inside something that shocked him. A remote just like the one that Phoenix had had! Along wth a note that read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>`Since the previous owner was unable to responsibly keep the remote. Three more have been sent out. One to Larry Butz, who was the cause of the events that caused the break of the first remote. The other two sent to people unrelated to the breakage of the first one. Cody Hakins and Dick Gumshoe. While these three remotes all have the same functions as the original, they each have 1 special function of their own. Yours has the function to swap clothing. Use the remote however you wish`</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry's eyes beamed up. He realized what this meant. The remote that had turned him into Franziska was now broken, but he got his own because of it. He imagined all he could do with it. He read through the remotes manual and got a general idea of what all the functions did, including the remote's 'Command' function. <i>`I can probably use that to get Franziska and Nick off my back if I run into them` </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry's mind also wandered to the other two people the remote had been sent too. While Larry knew who the Gumshoe person was from the several times he had run into him and Edgeworth. He had no idea who that Cody person was. He wondered f he should look for them and see if he could have fun using the remote with them, or if he should just go on his own and do what he wants</span></div></div>",

The small box didn't have a name for who sent it, and the note inside only described the effects of the item within: a remote with the ability to change anything. It could swap people's bodies, leaving them aware of it or not, let her possess people, shapeshift anyone into anyone else, force people to follow her commands, switch people's personalities around, and make the entire world shift around as if two people had the life of the other. Not only that, but the pointer was just for convenience: if she had a person's name and face in mind she could use the remote on them from anywhere. It gave her almost unlimited power...and how should she use it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[I'm aware Personality and Life Swaps aren't a part of this story's rules, but I got the author's okay for just this storyline. Basically, Personality Swap works exactly like it does in Ace Attorney Changing Remote: both participants get the other's personality, skills, interests, etc but remember that it's not normal. Life Swap is another aware swap, one where the universe reshapes to make each person have the life of the other without changing their personality.

Her and Nick were such polar opposites, it would be so funny to see him as her! The idea of Nick as the perfectionist, violence-happy and quick tempered prosecutor was ridiculous to the max! Even sillier, this would mean Franziska would wake up as Phoenix! Not wanting to waste more time, Maya pictured both of them in her mind, plus their names, and used the remote to swap around their lives, their personalities, and their bodies. Excited to check in the next day, Maya had a hard time sleeping that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing Phoenix Wright did not enjoy dreaming of, it was failure. Another dream in which he watched in terror as his client was sentenced to prison with a guilty verdict meant he woke up in a cold sweat. Frowning coldly, he rose from his bed and marched into his bathroom, only to be greeted by the mirror within not by the body he knew quite well, but by the petite, mature form of Franziska von Karma. For a moment, Phoenix saw his frown become a smile as he looked himself over, and thought to himself how interesting it would be to live in such a perfect body. Such vanity was unbecoming, of course, so Phoenix snapped out of it and made himself perfectly presentable for the day, his light blue hair groomed to perfection, his elegant face not requiring any make-up at all, and his body clad in the same suit it knew all to well, his defense attorney's badge in his pocket, so as not to damage his clothes. Unlike Phoenix Wright, Franziska von Karma had a perfectly working car and driver's license, and Phoenix knew he had a good grasp of the wheel.</span></div></div>",

Weren't you curious about who did it? Well it was me, Maya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of any anger or resentment, all Phoenix found himself feeling was curious. \"Oh, really?\" he asked, a smile curving onto his face. \"Well thank you, I must say it has been quite interesting so far. How did you manage this feat?\" It was odd to admit to himself, but Phoenix realized as he spoke that he really didn't mind the changes, despite knowing he should have. Something about being Franziska was just...intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm still in Kurain.

What was the harm in seeing things from a different perspective? Of course, that raised the question on what to do with Maya when she arrived. As interested as Phoenix was with this new body, he was quite peeved that Maya Fey, upon gaining some sort of world-bending power, immediately used it to mess with his life. He wasn't surprised at all, but definitely annoyed. Perhaps when she got to the office, Phoenix would take whatever allowed her to do this and see how she liked having her life flipped upside down. Then again, she could use work with Maya to teach a fool a lesson. Larry perhaps? That man did need a good thrashing from time to time...</span></div></div>",

It was enough to make Phoenix feel guilty for how he\u2019d reacted, if only just a little. \u201cMay I come inside, Defense Attorney Franziska von Karma?\u201d he asked, and Phoenix nodded. They sat on opposite sides Phoenix\u2019s desk, and after a short pause where neither said a word, Edgeworth asked, \u201cHave I done something to offend you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout having to think, Phoenix immediately responded, \u201cNothing more than usual, fool.\u201d As Phoenix considered how to even try telling Edgeworth what was going on, he also had to reflect that this was an odd insight into how Franziska and Edgeworth interacted when he wasn\u2019t around. But...wasn\u2019t this also a chance to get more info about this new reality? \u201cI\u2019ve had a...challenging morning,\u201d Phoenix began, hedging his bets. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been thinking of our first courtroom battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a clumsy attempt to fish for information, but considering the person Phoenix was talking to wasn\u2019t aware he even needed to, it should have worked perfectly. Edgeworth nodded, looking pensive. \u201cIt has been almost four years since that day, hasn\u2019t it? After rebelling against your father, our teacher, and running off to study under Mia Fey, you defended the person accused of her murder. I couldn\u2019t understand why, or why you\u2019d turn against my own teacher. Of course, that became more clear after what we went through that Christmas...\u201d So, Phoenix reflected, in this reality, Franziska von Karma had quit studying prosecution at a young age to instead be a defense attorney, and learned from Mia like he had. It was interesting, sure, but should he fish for more info, or ask for Edgeworth\u2019s help in the mystery of the change?</span></div></div>",

Instead, Phoenix decided to search for more information, but from a different angle. \u201c...tell me, Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, have you heard from Phoenix Wright recently?\u201d If Phoenix was living the life of Franziska von Karma, then what had occurred with his original body? Was the real Franzy stuck in that body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Phoenix\u2019s surprise, Edgeworth\u2019s immediate response was to smile cryptically.

I thought such a man would be beneath your attention.\u201d The implication was clear to Phoenix, and he wasn\u2019t liking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly blushing, Phoenix stammered, \u201cO-of course he is! Such a worthless fool...but it is better to be aware of what such a creature is up to, is it not?\u201d No matter how badly Phoenix wished he had better control of his voice, it was obvious to both of them his answer was a lie. Still, Phoenix couldn\u2019t believe Edgeworth had said such a foolish question. As if Phoenix would be romantically interested in his own former body, it was far beneath his standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d was all Edgeworth deigned to say regarding Phoenix\u2019s defense, before deciding to actually answer her original question. \u201cLast I heard, he was still working with Interpol. I believe he\u2019s in France, at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Phoenix could remember of Franziska von Karma\u2019s general position before the swap, he assumed that \u2018Phoenix Wright\u2019 had completely taken the roles and obligations of the original Franziska von Karma. But that raised a new question: why was \u2018he\u2019 a prosecutor, and how had \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018Franziska\u2019 battled in court in the years prior. \u201cDid that fool ever tell you why he sought me out in court in the first place?\u201d Phoenix asked, as if it was a question he knew a partial answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth turned his attention to the window, looking through it at the Gatewater Hotel across the street. \u201cYes, he did.\u201d That was all Edgeworth said at first, and Phoenix was forced to wait for the fool to finish reminiscing to hear the rest. \u201cAs you know, we were childhood friends, he and I. After...my father\u2019s death...he became interested in following my path, to try and help me. Of course, your father never would have accepted him as a third apprentice, so he found his own way as a prosecutor. It took him longer, but he eventually came to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to be my friend...only to find I was gone. With that avenue gone, he faced you in court, hoping to learn where I had gone.\u201d Obvious affection touched Edgeworth\u2019s face as he finished, \u201cHe never was able to beat you, of course, but his idealistic beliefs, I hope, helped soften your obsession with perfection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome small part of Phoenix was touched to see how much Edgeworth cared about Phoenix, even in this other reality. But the vast majority of him was consumed by a different emotion: jealousy. Did Edgeworth think he owned Phoenix Wright? No! Phoenix was a fool, but he was Franziska von Karma\u2019s fool, not his! \u201cThis has been a pleasant talk,\u201d Franziska told Edgeworth, looking at him with harsh eyes that matched her barbed tone. \u201cBut I think you should leave.\u201d Edgeworth knew better than to argue, and rose from his seat with a brief farewell. It was only once he was gone that Franziska realized she\u2019d slipped further: she wasn\u2019t even thinking of herself as Phoenix Wright anymore. She remembered being him, but her affinity for that past was slipping.</span></div></div>",

The idea of Phoenix in her body and using her brain to try and work was hilarious, and she knew Phoenix wouldn't find the situation funny in the slightest, which is exactly why it would be hilarious to Maya.

It was like his brain was stuffed with clouds, or cotton candy. His thoughts were slower, duller, and he wondered if it was just the early morning doing that to him. Once he looked in the mirror, however, he knew that was not the case. Staring back at him was not the manly form he once knew but instead the shapely body of Ini Miney, clad in witch-themed pajamas. <span class=\"clblue\">(Wow, these are, like, super cute.)</span> It was halfway through a halfhearted morning routine of fixing up his hair and putting on some light make-up that he realized he was doing all that like it was second nature to him, like it was something he was used to doing.

After rummaging around in his purse, he found a key that unlocked the car with a click of a button. Sure, the car was fairly old and not in the best of shape, but apparently it was Phoenix's. He sat in the driver's seat, took out his wallet and found not the California State ID he had before but a genuine driver's license staring back at him. An airy smile on his face, Phoenix turned on the car and headed to the office, the drive seeming to take little time at all thanks to the radio. Phoenix had never been a big pop music fan before, but something about the music made him so happy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the office, Phoenix entered to find it looking mostly the same, with a few exceptions. Charley was still there, and looking as good as ever, but the poster on the wall was now of <i>The Ring</i>, and next to Mia's dusty law books were a few well-read tomes on the occult. <span class=\"clblue\">(Wow!

The feeling it gave him was a good one, though. Pearl looked up at him, beaming. \"How's your day going, Ms. Ini?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix answered the question without thinking. \"Oh, it's, like, been going pretty good. Still no clients though, so that, like, totally sucks. What're you two up to?\" The somewhat vapid, overly conversational style of speech came easier than expected to Phoenix's lips, and it was even difficult for him to notice that it was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Maya who answered his question. \"We just felt like coming into the city today. Besides, the office TV has cable and we don't get that in the mountains, and I wanted to catch the new episode of <i>The Steel Samurai</i>.\" Something about her tone struck Phoenix as odd, though his brain was having trouble pointing out what exactly the problem was. Sure enough, the Magatama in his suit pocket moved slightly, the world around them turned black, and one Psyche-Lock appeared before Maya's heart, surrounding by chains. Phoenix was unsure if she should try to break the lock.

The pink-obsessed, flirty as hell lady who had almost gotten Maya convicted of murder had struck a plea deal when she testified against her former employer Redd White, and last Maya heard she was a secretary somewhere more reputable now. With her hot temper, curvy body, and tendency to flash her goods to get out of trouble, Maya was sure that she would be the last person Phoenix would want to find himself as. Plan ready, Maya focused on Phoenix and April's names and faces as she pressed the Life Swap button, then the Personality Swap button, and last but not least the Aware Body Swap button. It was difficult for Maya to fall asleep that night, her thoughts constantly turning to she silliness of her prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of irritation burned through Phoenix's brain as his alarm clock went off, his beautiful face twisting into a scowl as he thumped the machine with a thin and feminine hand. Unable to bring himself to go back to bed, no matter how much he tossed and turned, Phoenix finally forced himself to get out of his luxuriously soft, comfortable bed with pink sheets and a pinker comforter. He slowly walked over to the bathroom, long-lashed eyes still half open, and looked at himself. Staring back at him was a gorgeous woman of short stature and generous curves, with wavy pink hair that Phoenix thought desperately needed to be brushed and groomed into the perfect shape. It took a few seconds of staring before he blew a gasket, a vein popping on one side of his face and his eyes going from beautiful to dangerous. \"What the hell?! Why am I a woman?!\" Then he got a better look at himself. \"Why am I Ms. May?! Whoever did this is gonna pay!\" It took a lot of willpower, but Phoenix forced himself to stay calm. Woman or not, Phoenix had to get to the office, which meant he had to get ready. His body on autopilot, Phoenix prepared for his day with a rigorous hair routine, a perfect application of make-up, and wearing a stylish but sexy pink suit that showed off her assets with an unbuttoned top and a tight skirt.</span></div></div>",

His apartment was in the same location, so he knew when and where the nearest bus was going to be, and when it stopped for a pick-up Phoenix was there. Once his fare was paid and he was safely on the bus, Phoenix began to consider what exactly had happened. So, he was clearly in the body of April May now, and yet judging by the Attorney's badge sparkling brightly on the label of his suit he was still a defense lawyer. Once he got to his office, he was going to figure this whole thing out. It was halfway there that he realized with a start that not only were many men, and a few women, leering at him, but he was leaning into their attention, unconsciously giving them peeks of skin here and there along the way. Part of Phoenix wondered what the problem was, after all he had an amazing body now, right? Why not show it off a little? It's not even his, after all. Phoenix forcefully shut down that line of thinking and focused on the window to the outside for the remainder of his journey, catching sight of a great sale at a local clothing store that he made a mental note of to check out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the stop closest to his office, Phoenix stopped the bus and exited, blushing a little as he wondered exactly how different his office was going to be. After a lonely elevator ride to his floor, Phoenix used his keys to unlike the office door and found it was mostly the same, to his relief. Charley the plant, the poster, Mia's law books, they were all still there. Sure, some interesting looking fashion and gossip magazines were scattered around the office, and the chair behind the desk looked a lot more comfortable than the cheap one he's used previously, but still, it was home sweet home. Now then, what to do? Should he call Maya, see if she remembers him? Should he try to find out what happened to his own body? Or should he call Gumshoe, and fish for information on his new life?</span></div></div>",

Phoenix felt his temper rise, but forced it back down, knowing that snapping at callers was generally a bad idea. \"Hello, May and Co Law Offices, this is April May, how may I help you?\" Answering the phone with his sultry, seductive voice just came naturally to Phoenix, and he didn't spare a thought to why he was calling the office May and Co.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is April May, right? I need your help, really bad!\" came a voice on the other end. It was a high, feminine voice, carrying in it a lot of fear and anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his heart fall at the pleading coming at him over the phone, Phoenix replied, \"Yes, this is Ms. May. Are you at the Detention Center?\" A quick affirmative sob came as a response. \"Okay then, sweetie, you stay there and I'll see you soon. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore muffled crying came over the phone line before the woman managed to reply, \"Dawn, Dawn Trodden, ma'am.\" Then the call ended. Phoenix let out an annoyed huff. He'd been wanting to spend his day investigating this complete alteration to his body and mind, but someone needed him. It was a quick thing to lock the office behind her and head out to the Detention Center, which was only a few blocks from the office. The winter air was cold, and Phoenix looked down in annoyance at his bouncing cleavage. Why didn't he own any suits that covered his chest properly. The answer came immediately. <span class=\"clblue\">(You've got to show off the goods to get what you want, honey.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting with the client, a young little geek just out of high school, went fairly quickly. She was accused of murdering her coworker, and the crime scene was the office of their comic book publishing company that they'd founded together. Phoenix was confident Dawn didn't commit the crime, not just because the Magatama, which he still carried in his suit pocket, made it clear that she wasn't lying when she said she hadn't killed anyone. Something about the girl just made Phoenix know she was innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that it was off to the crime scene, where...</span></div></div>",

Good to see you again, pal!\" the familiar voice of Detective Gumshoe pulled Phoenix's attention, his gruff voice having an odd effect on his new body. Phoenix started breathing a little heavier, and his body was filled with an odd energy. The detective was waiting just outside of the door to the small studio apartment where the crime occurred, and something about the detective's tall frame and muscular body made Phoenix smile a little wider as they met. \"So, you took the perp's case, huh? Well, you've got a good heart, and she's a sweet kid. Too bad she definitely did it, pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout really thinking about it, Phoenix closed the distance completely, pressing his feminine form up against the detective's chest and looking up at his scruffy face. \"That's not the only good thing I've got, detective,\" he found himself saying, adding a wink to punctuate the words. <span class=\"clblue\">(Gumshoe's such a sweetie. All I've got to do is lay it on a little strong, maybe make out a little, and I'll be in the crime scene with all the information I need.)</span> Following those thoughts, Phoenix stood on the tips of his heels and kissed the detective's lips, and he reciprocated the action. The kissing was hot and passionate, but it only last a few seconds before they pulled away, both participants flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking conflicted, Gumshoe reached into his coat without looking further at Phoenix, then handed him an autopsy report as well as photos of the crime scene and all the relevant pieces of evidence. It looked like Phoenix didn't even have to investigate himself this time, a nice treat. As Phoenix looked through the evidence, he heard Gumshoe ask shyly, \"So, uh, I was wondering if you'd want to go out to dinner tonight. With me, I mean. I know you're busy, you've told me that every other time I asked you, but I was just hoping...\"</span></div></div>",

Not only had he woken up that morning in the body of April May, but he had just kissed Detective Gumshoe, a man, on the lips! And now he was asking Phoenix on a date, and...and...part of him was excited by the idea, was interested in the rugged looks and wide shoulders of his friend. But while Phoenix was thinking all that in his head, his mouth replied, \"Y'know what, detective, it's a date! Pick me up from my office around six, okay? Take me wherever you want.\" Then Phoenix stretched up and gave Gumshoe another kiss, this time a peck on his cheek, before he turned around to head back to the office. Once out of view of the detective, he ran a manicured hand through his bright pink hair. Why had he said yes? He was a man, a man! <span class=\"clblue\">(Then again, Gumshoe has been so patient with me, endured all my teasing and flirting, why shouldn't I give him a chance?)</span> Regardless, he'd said yes and was too embarrassed to go back on his word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back at the office, Phoenix went into the other room and found a make-up area and several outfits hung up. After spending a few hours going over evidence and putting together a case for tomorrow, Phoenix sat down in front of the mirror and did his make-up. The process took nearly a full hour, but once he was done his already gorgeous face looked to die for. <span class=\"clblue\">(Gumshoe'll be speechless, just the way I like my men.)</span> Then Phoenix got up, stripped out of his work clothes, and looked around at the other outfits available. It didn't take much thought to go with one that looked just like the outfit April May had worn when Phoenix first met her, heart buttons and all. <span class=\"clblue\">(Men won't know where to look, the front or the back.)</span> By the time Phoenix was all ready to go it was fifteen minutes until six, and he waited patiently at his desk, part of him still very nervous to be going out on a date with Gumshoe of all people.</span></div></div>",

He opened it to find the detective not wearing his typical work outfit but instead a blue and black plaid button of shirt and a worn but not bad looking pair of slacks. Phoenix gave him a once over as he did the same for Phoenix, and when their eyes met Phoenix's heart was beating quite fast. <span class=\"clblue\">(Gumshoe cleaned up quite well. Phoenix likey.)</span> \"You look beautiful, Ms. May,\" Gumshoe said, his eyes alight with passion. He held out a single lily, which Phoenix took with a smile. <span class=\"clblue\">(It's gorgeous.)</span> Gumshoe rubbed the back of his head with one hand. \"I remembered you said lilies were your favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix took the flower and set it into an empty coffee cup, he'd get a vase for it later. Then he joined Gumshoe at the door. \"So, where are you taking me?\" Without saying anything, Gumshoe led Phoenix into the elevator, down to the ground floor, and into his car. It was a junker, to be sure, but it looked like it had been strenuously cleaned in the last few hours, leaving the inside and outside of the car as nice as it was ever going to look. They sat in quiet companionship on the way there, and it didn't take long for Phoenix to realize where they were headed: People Park. It was less than a minute drive from the office, and after finding a place to part they made there way to the shade under a tree, where Gumshoe laid out a quilted blanket and set down a genuine picnic basket. Phoenix quirked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's pretty cheesy. Still, with my salary...\" They sat down on the blanket, which Phoenix found quite soft and comfortable, and Gumshoe opened the basket and pulled out two plates wrapped in foil. Curious, Phoenix unwrapped his and found a pork chop with mashed potatoes. Part of him worried about the calories, but he shoved that thought aside, grabbed a fork and knife, and tasted the food. To his surprise, the pork chop was perfectly cooked and excellently seasoned, and the mashed potatoes were fluffy, buttery, and just salty enough. They both ate at a reasonable pace, finishing around the same time. \"So, uh, how are things going for you, Ms. May?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Phoenix's surprise he found himself going over the last week or so of his life, censored to fit the new reality as best he could, with relative ease. Gumshoe was a good listener, asking questions at just the right times to make it clear to Phoenix he was really listening to her. After they'd been sitting there for a full hour, Phoenix felt much fonder of Detective Gumshoe than he ever had before.</span></div></div>",

You made me that nice dinner, the least I could do for you is a cup of coffee.\" The invitation came out sweetly, but it was clear to everyone involved there was more to it than just a cup of joe. Nonetheless, Gumshoe followed Phoenix inside, sitting on her soft, pink couch while she moved into the kitchen to put together their coffee. As he worked on it, Phoenix's mind raced. Gumshoe was in his apartment. Phoenix had invited him in. And down below, under his clothes, Phoenix was ready and waiting for what happened afterwards. Was he really going to go through with that?

It would be a...waste...not to use it.)</span> That made up, Phoenix put an extra sway in his step and a sultry smile on his face as he sashayed over and set the coffee down on the table in front of the couch, but before the detective could reach over and grab it, Phoenix came closer and straddled the detective, feeling his erect, warm cock tenting inside his slacks. Phoenix leaned in closer, pressing his breasts against the man's chest, and whispered in his ear, \"Let's that cool down, alright sugar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sex was passionate and lasted for nearly an hour.

Putting on a confident, yet alluring, face, Phoenix walked into the trial, ready to win for her client. Luckily for her, and Dawn Trotten, the opponent this time was just Winston Payne. This time, he wasn\u2019t facing someone on their first case with no info, or someone who\u2019d just contracted amnesia. No, he was facing a beautiful attorney with a record full of evidence and a keen sense of how to win the Judge over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing how different things were, as the trial started and quickly went into Gumshoe\u2019s testimony. Not only was Gumshoe still quite cooperative, likely happy with her for last night, but the Judge couldn\u2019t say a bad word about her, even when she fumbled around a little, and the prosecution knew it. Payne was a lot more careful in what he said, because any time he jabbed a little too hard against Phoenix, he was the one to get a penalty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter poking through Gumshoe\u2019s usual testimony for all the extra info she needed, Phoenix waited for the first witness, the co-founder of Dawn\u2019s company, Illy Straitor. He was a tall, thin, geeky looking guy in a black leather jacket, carrying quite a few different kinds of pens in his pocket. He gave his testimony about finding the body, but there was something clearly wrong with it: the timing. It didn\u2019t match Dawn\u2019s own testimony, and while normally that wouldn\u2019t have fazed the Judge, when Phoenix brought it up now, looking cute and adorable to the old man, he agreed with her point right away, despite Payne\u2019s objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little bit of quick thinking, Phoenix figured out and proved that Illy was the killer, having used the thermostat to alter the time of death, which had been based on rigor mortis. The nerd confessed to his crime after Phoenix jabbed him more than a little for being a pasty geek, Payne was furious at losing once again, and the Judge was satisfied enough to give a verdict of Not Guilty. Phoenix walked out of the courtroom amazed. That had been, without a doubt, the smoothest trial she\u2019d ever had. And she felt like a lot of it came down to her new body. What if every trial was this easy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter congratulating Dawn on being acquitted, even if it meant learning one of her best friends had tried to frame her for his own murder, Maya pulled Phoenix aside. \u201cHey, April, can I talk to you real quick?\u201d Not seeing anything wrong with that, Phoenix followed her into a courthouse hallway, where she pulled out some kind of remote. \u201cYou were amazing in court, but...I know this was weird for you. Being in a different body and all.\u201d That shocked the hell out of Phoenix, but Maya just kept on talking. \u201cI have this magic remote, it lets me swap people around, so I swapped your body, your life, and your personality with April May. It was supposed to be a quick prank...but it looked like you were really acting like her in court. I can change you back now though, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Don't be so mad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill enraged, Phoenix hissed out, \"What part of me killing you do you not understand?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went quiet, and when Maya spoke again her voice carried anger as well. \"Oh, really? Well, Phoenix, I'm afraid that's too bad. Now then, I think I should let you know that the same thing that let me do this to you can also force you to obey my commands.

What was his deal?  He's never yelled at me before, it's almost like he's got a different personality...oh yeah.\"  Maya hit herself in the head as she remembered the obvious reason for Phoenix yelling at her.  While Nick would probably never really yell at a Maya no matter what crazy thing she did, Nick with the personality of a flirty woman with a very nasty side to her probably wasn't as forgiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably call him back and say I'm sorry and tell him I can...eventually swap him back.\"  But before Maya could dial the thought of Phoenix with April May's body, life, and personality was just too good for her to pass up.  \"Yeah, I'll probably fix him later maybe.  After all, the new episode of Pink Princess is about to start and it's not going to watch itself.\"<br>\r\n______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix heard the click of Maya hanging up on the other end and slammed the phone down in a very un-Phoenix like fashion.  Phoenix took a few deep breaths causing his large chest to noticeably ungulate up and down.  Phoenix caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and saw a very harsh look in his face, it even looked like a pink heart on his suit had turned upside down.  \"How dare she?  How could she do this to me?  I'm calling her back right now!\"  And so Phoenix picked up the phone, dialed the number and when it picked up Phoenix said, \"Hey Larry poo, I was wondering if you wanted to take me out on a date tonight?\"  Phoenix couldn't believe the words that had come out of his mouth, that was certainly not what he wanted to say.  He wanted to yell, but why would he yell when he was asking someone out on a date?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clblue\">But I don't want to do that.</span></i>  Phoenix thought as a flabbergasted voice came through on the other end.  \"April?  Old buddy old pal is that you?  Asking me out?!  Pinch me I'm dreaming!  YOUCH!\"  A scream came through the phone that made Phoenix pull the phone from his ear for a second, \"Guess I'm not dreaming, of course I'll go out with you!  Just give a me a minute to break of my date with Francesca!  I'll even give you her gift, do you like chocolates!  Oh wait, that's a surprise.  Forget I said anything, I'll be by your place in just a few minutes!\"  Phoenix could hear Larry give out a celebratory scream before he hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Maya wasn't lying about the whole command thing,\"  And then with an assist from April May's personality Phoenix had a very un Phoenix like thought as he began to pretty himself up for his date with Larry.</span></div></div>",

Phoenix looked over the website, surprised at the seeming upgrade since his May-wakening, so to speak. The site was a definite upgrade over his previous basic HTML mess, and even had a cute little slideshow of satisfied clients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy at the unforeseen bonus that living a life in Miss May's incredibly high-heeled shoes could bring, Phoenix's eye suddenly caught a weird little tab at the top reading 'Other Services'. Putting a nail to his newly plumped lip in curiosity, he directed his cursor to the new option and clicked, to discover a fascinating new twist on this life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that the new April-Phoenix ran a little modeling business on the side! Phoenix scrolled through the countless example pics of his new body with horror, taking note of the typical ensembles that his new voluptuous body was hired out to do. practically poured into a little swimsuit here, into a lingerie set there, and some where he was wearing some slutty Halloween version of Edgeworth's regular attire. Phoenix was about to close down the window in horror when his eyes came across the new base rate that April would be paid for each photoset. His eyes nearly bulged out of his new womanly head when he compared it to his previous salary. Doing the numbers in his head, it seems that the new May had done MUCH more pictures than even the previous him had done cases. In his excitement at the sudden windfall, he pumped his manicured fist to the sky, quickly regretting it when the force cause his bountiful chest and buttocks to jiggle for a good five seconds. But not letting the feminine reminder faze him, he thought about all of the renovations he could have done to his apartment, all the meals that he could pay for the gluttonous Maya, all of the new <span class=\"cpred\">new outfits</span> <span class=\"cpink\">she could go splurge on</span>, and the <span class=\"chotpink\">cute new makeup that she caught a bus ad for on the way he\u2014</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's girly train of though was suddenly interrupted by his own cell phone ringing, with a new rendition of the Pink Princess theme.

Neither did the level of hostility that was radiating from him over this. After all, he could rationalize it, when had Lotta done <i>anything</i> to actually help Phoenix, on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta\u2019s Studio was actually pretty cute, with yellow walls and an overall decor that screamed \u2018the world is lovely!\u2019 It actually calmed Phoenix down quite a bit, just being there. But then Lotta stalked up to him, looking as angry as she\u2019d sounded over the phone. \u201cThere ya are! Get in the changin\u2019 room and get dressed, I ain\u2019t got all day!\u201d Lotta pointed to a nearby door, and without a word Phoenix walked into it, not wanting to actually get into a screaming match with the Southerner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the room, she discovered what exactly she\u2019d be wearing for the shoot: a Pink Princess cosplay. It was very inaccurate, basically just a pink metal bikini and skirt that vaguely fit the show\u2019s aesthetics, and only the mask looked anything like the actual character. How Phoenix knew any of those details, he didn\u2019t question. In fact, before getting this new life, Phoenix had never paid any attention to the character aside from what Maya shoved down his throat. But April May seemed to be a closet fangirl, and Phoenix was gaining that sense without even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging into the clothing didn\u2019t take long at all, the only really annoying part being the mask, which really made walking around or seeing at all difficult. Plus, it was hard to breathe with it, and made Phoenix feel like he was going to suffocate. <span class=\"cpred\">(I swear, if I find out who made this stupid thing, I\u2019m going to <i>kill</i> them.)</span> Once outside, Lotta showed him the way to the photo shoot area, which had a Japanese castle backdrop. Phoenix started posing for pictures, very sexy ones, without even having to be asked, and Lotta got to snapping shots. The poses came naturally to him, but after a few minutes of it Phoenix had to ask, \u201cSo, remind me again, but who ordered this set?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Phoenix thought it would be Maya, but Lotta just let out a sigh between taking pictures. \u201cI swear, sometimes y\u2019all act like you\u2019re dumber than cat lookin\u2019 fer dogs. It was that fella who made the character, Salmon somethin\u2019 or other.\u201d Phoenix knew right away who she meant, and the shock stopped him from biting her head off about the dumb comment. Sal Manella? \u201cOh, and he wanted me to give you this,\u201d Lotta told Phoenix as the shoot ended. It was an envelope, tightly sealed. \u201cSee ya around, princess.\u201d Phoenix changed clothes, went back to his office, and opened the envelope to find a note for him: Ms. May, I\u2019ll pay quadruple if you come to this motel room tonight,\u2019 followed by an address and room number.</span></div></div>",

No! It was time he tried getting answers, but from who? Scratching his head, the only person Phoenix could think of as a possible ally would be Ema Skye. (<span class=\"cpred\">She was a science geek and whatever, right?</span>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing his purse, Phoenix locked up the office and hailed a cab. Just Phoenix\u2019s luck, the driver was a guy, and a cute one too.

But when I woke up, I was like this, and everyone remembered me having always been like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma clearly looked shocked to hear that, but instead of being suspicious, it seemed she was convinced. \u201cYou too?!\u201d were not the words Phoenix was expecting out of her mouth. \u201cMy case isn\u2019t as bad as yours, but I woke up this morning looking like this!\u201d Phoenix looked her up and down, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEma, you\u2019ve always looked like that.\u201d Weirdly developed for a teenager, sure, but the same body she\u2019d had when Phoenix first met her when she was defending her sister, who had the opposite problem with a smaller, less curvy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlapping her forehead, Ema tried explaining again. \u201cOkay, look, Apri-, uh, I mean Phoenix.\u201d His real name came out of her mouth awkwardly, like she wasn\u2019t used to saying it. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you not being like this, like everyone else. But I\u2019m in the same boat, meaning you don\u2019t remember how I used to be, get it?\u201d Phoenix was starting to, but it just sounded weird. This was how Ema was supposed to look. \u201cWell, my case is different, like I said. You still know me as Ema, and a scientist. I only switched bodies with Lana, not anything else.\u201d Phoenix got what she was going for, but was starting to get ticked off. (<span class=\"cpred\">Okay, blah blah blah, your problems.

The last recorded event was...\u201d Ema checked the small display on her device, then finished, \u201c...an hour ago, so we can try and head to where it was then, but there\u2019s no guarantee it will still be there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<span class=\"cpred\">Once again, little miss science geek is overcomplicating things.</span>) \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Phoenix explained, talking slowly and doing his best to mask his annoyance. \u201cEven if we track to where whoever did this used to be, we\u2019ll be closer, so it\u2019s better than doing nothing.

And if there was anyone Maya considered a risk-taker, it was Desiree DeLite. The shopaholic, motorcycle-riding thrill seeker herself. That was the kind of woman who parents were talking about when they asked their kids \"if she threw herself off a cliff, would you join her?\" There was also the fact that she was downright gorgeous and Maya couldn't wait to see how Nick handled being the apple of every eye on every street. Yep, switching Phoenix and Mrs. DeLite would certainly make Nick live a little for once instead of being such a Debbie Downer. Confident in her plan, Maya thought deeply about Phoenix Wright and Desiree DeLite before she pressed the Life Swap button, then the Personality Swap button, and last but not least the Aware Body Swap button. It was difficult for Maya to fall asleep that night, her thoughts constantly turning to she silliness of her prank<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix Wright woke up the instant the alarm went off, quickly tapping the off button and pushing himself out of bed. It usually took him at least fifteen minutes to force himself up in the morning, followed by fifteen minutes of stalling and then ten minutes of panic to make it to any appointments or meetings he'd forgotten about on time. Today? He felt wide awake and ready to take on the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for him to prepare for the day. He hopped into the shower within the minute, enjoying the sensation of the hot water on his hourglass body. Exiting the shower, he combed through his long tresses of hair in one hand while applying some make-up in the other with expert skill. The only pause in his momentum was picking an outfit to wear among his extensive collection. That one would really bring out his eyes... but that one might be good for riding on the road. Eventually, he decided to pick one of his flashy jumpsuits, resolving to buy another dress later in the day. It could be pricey, but it was only a bit of money after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only as Phoenix was zipping up the jumpsuit to his cleavage that he finally recognized that something was off about the situation. In the mirror was a bombshell of a woman. The kind of gal who caught everyone eye within a mile radius but didn't have the time to pay attention to a single one of those eyes. As far as Phoenix could recall, he'd been a pretty average man the night prior. He hadn't been a woman and he certainly hadn't been Desiree DeLite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven stranger, Phoenix had some serious trouble working up any alarm or concern over the bizarre turn his morning had taken. In fact, he was kind of excited. An honest to goodness supernatural mystery, dropped right into his lap! Who knew what kind of weird, thrilling things might happen with oddities like this to wake up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix fastened the rest of his jumpsuit, caring very little about the depth of the cleavage he was showing off. He was a little worried about gaining too much attention, but a larger part of him couldn't be bothered to think about how other people looked at him. With earrings fastened to his lobes and an aviator cap in hand, Phoenix took one more look around his astonishingly expensive apartment. Before an exciting day of work, maybe there was something of interest for him to absorb. He was kind of itching to ride his motorcycle for the first time, a thought he had never had before today.</span></div></div>",

That didn't stop her from making this visit a surprise, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed to the office building across the way from the Gatewater Hotel, and stepped inside.

Inside was a remote, and a set of instructions implying it had some sort of ability to switch people's bodies. <span class=\"clblue\">(Hmm. Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing it off as a scam or a practical joke, Maya pocketed the device for another time and opened up the door to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" Maya said, bursting into the crowded and cluttered room. How could a room be crowded and cluttered with just four people, including Maya? Ask Mr. Wright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Fey?\" Said Athena, her necklace glowing yellow with a tinge of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya!?\" Phoenix asked, his eyes brightening at the sight of her. \"You didn't say you were coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I said 'surprise', Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well, yeah, but... That's not important. What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a month since I last visited!\" Maya said. \"We're all gonna hang out together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you caught me at a great time, Maya! I'm pretty sure all three of us were waiting on something interesting to fall from the sky on us,\" said Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! This'll be fun!\" Trucy said. \"I think Daddy was about to die from boredom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, speaking of boredom, a pretty foolproof solution to that would be to use that body-switching remote in some way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maya decided to keep the remote to herself for now. Of course, that didn't mean that she wouldn't be using it right now. Nick, Trucy, and Athena all said that they were feeling bored right now. What would be a better way to cure boredom than to swap some bodies around? Of course, that brought up the important question. Who to test the remote on first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was an easy one. Her first 'victim' was sitting across the room at his desk \"Hey Nick! I have an idea for something fun we could do!\" Maya called over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix had a bad feeling about this. Whenever Maya had suggested some 'fun' for them to do, it always ended in either his wallet or various parts of his body being hurt. \"No waterfalls.\" He laid down a rule before Maya suggested anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We won't even need to leave the office to do this. Just sit right there, don't move.\" Maya said. As she talked, she subtly got the remote ready. She made sure to keep the remote in her sleeve, so that no one would notice what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the question of who to use the remote on first was answered, there were two more questions Which button to use on Nick and who, if anyone, to swap him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first option on the remote was the 'Aware Swap'. That was the simplest one. It would just put Nick in one of their bodies and the second person in his body. With this function it would lead to some pretty good results if she switched him with Athena or Trucy, heck, she could even get herself involved with the fun if she swapped herself with Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was the 'Unaware Swap' Because she was the only one holding the remote, only she would notice the effects of this swap. Of course, even if she was the only one who could see it. It would be pretty funny to see an old fart like Nick have a young female body, even if he couldn't tell that he did. This was of course another swap that she could involve herself in if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third option was the most risky. 'Possession'. With this option, Nick's body would act like normal, but he would go into some sort of ghost form and be able to take over someone's body. This was risky for Maya because there was a chance that Nick could possess her, and she didn't want that to happen. She deals with spirits using her body enough as the Master of Kurain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final option was 'Shapeshift', With that, she could transform Phoenix's body into an exact copy of anyone else's, this was pretty much a body swap with only one person's body being changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had thought about and went over the options in her head, Maya chose to use the....</span></div></div>",

She clicked the Possession button and waited for a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor everyone else in the room, nothing happened, but for Phoenix, something impossible had just happened. He was floating over his own body! He had no idea what had just happened or even what he was right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of panicking, Phoenix found out how to move around the room by floating. Something odd was that his body was acting as if nothing had happened. While the smart thing to do here would have been to try to interact with his body, he was panicking too much to think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he floated over to one of the girls in the room and tried to talk to them about what had happened, However, he was not expecting what happened when he touched their shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix blacked out for a second, but he soon regained sight.

Widget was around his neck and was bright yellow. He ran his hands through Athena's long orange hair, just to make sure that he wasn't dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he made sure he wasn't dreaming, he went back to the main room of the office. \"Is something wrong, Athena?\" His own body asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no.

Although Phoenix couldn't tell what, he didn't hear anyone tell any jokes or anything when he was in the bathroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought about whether or not he should tell everyone that he was in Athena's body. That may be the best thing to do, maybe the Maya, Trucy, and who seemed to be him would be able to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, that may be risky. While he might be able to convince them that he is who he says he is, there is also a chance that they'll all just assume that he is crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing he wanted, although, he was beginning to wonder if he was crazy. After all, his own body was acting completely normal. There wasn't even a hint that it wasn't him.

While she <i>could</i> side with Phoenix and tell the other two that he is telling the truth, she decided to take this little joke one step further. She took a few steps back up to the others and began to speak \"They're right, Athena.\" She made sure to refer to Phoenix as Athena \"If you really were Nick, then who would he be?\" She said, Pointing at Phoenix's former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um, I don't know.\" Phoenix said. He honestly couldn't figure it out. He was almost positive that he was Phoenix Wright in Athena's body, but at the same time, his own body wasn't acting in anyway that he normally wouldn't. <i>'If only Apollo were here, maybe he could perceive if my body was acting differently.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own body began to speak \"Athena, maybe you should go home for the day. Maybe that will clear your head.\" His own body suggested. While it was supposed to come of as 'Phoenix' caring for 'Athena' and suggesting that she get some rest. To the real Phoenix, it served to only hammer in the possibility that he actually had gone insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy chimed in \"He's right. Maybe if you go home and take a nap, you'll wake up feeling normal again.\" Trucy then knocked her hat a pit to the side and began to make a joke. \"And if you really are daddy, then maybe you'll wake up in your own body tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Phoenix wanted to do right now was go to Athena's home and leave his own body here, but he had little choice. Not only did he have no idea to how he got in Athena's body and even less of an idea to how to get back to his own. Then their was the possibility that he really was Athena, and he had just gone mad. He didn't want to even consider that until their was no possibilities left. He wanted to stay, but he saw the looks on his own body's and Trucy's faces. They were both clearly worried about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that there was both nothing else he could do here for now and that he didn't want to worry the others anymore, he walked out of the office and began to make his way toward Athena's home. He was still positive that he was Phoenix Wright. He looked through his memories and he could remember anything about life as Phoenix Wright and knew nothing about the life of Athena Cykes, he didn't even know the first thing about psychology!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Maya had a huge grin on her face. Yeah, she had pretty much trapped Phoenix in Athena's body for the time being, but she was planning to put him back in his own in a day, or a few.....<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">weeks.</font> as long as this stayed funny, and it wasn't as if he was any danger of forgetting who he really was, as long as he didn't hit his head really hard or something silly like that.</span></div></div>",

She really should be used to these early mornings by now, but instead, she was sick of it. She had traveled all the way to Europe to study to become a forensic scientist, only to fail to meet the requirements, and end up getting hired as a detective instead. The fact that she was forced to work with that glimmerous fop of a prosecutor certainly didn't make things any better. Complaining wouldn't do anything, though. All she could do was do her best, and hope she'd eventually get the job she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma got out of bed and started getting ready for work. Tardiness would definitely not be a step in the right direction if she wanted to get the right job. Everything was proceeding as normal, until she went to check the mail. Along with the usual bills, spam, and the like, there was a strange package addressed to her. She furrowed her brow as she brought it inside, racking her brain for anything she might have ordered. She couldn't remember any forensics kits she was currently waiting for, which would have been the most likely candidate for the package's contents otherwise. She plopped it down on the counter with the rest of her mail as she continued preparing breakfast. Once she was done with that, she finally got around to opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost spat out the toast she was eating when she read the instruction manual that was inside the box. \"Swapping bodies? Are you serious!?\" There was no doubt in her mind that this must be some kind of dumb prank. After all, swapping bodies was scientifically impossible. Who would even come up with something this ridiculous, though? She tossed the manual back in the box, and continued having breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma's morning routine continued as usual, but the thought of the remote that was in the package occasionally gnawed at the back of her mind. \"It's just a dumb prank, forget about it,\" she kept telling herself. But with her morning routine done, she found herself drawn back to the strange package, pulling the remote out and looking at it. If this was just for a prank, whoever had made it had certainly done well. Ema's mind struggled to reconcile the idea that this remote may somehow be capable of swapping around people's bodies. On one hand, it should be scientifically impossible. But if it did work, the possibilities it opened up were endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could decide what to do with the remote, however, Ema's phone rang. She checked the number before answering; it was her boss. She sighed, and answered the phone.</span></div></div>",

Apparently there was a crime reported earlier today and she was needed to investigate it. She'd be lying if she said that she was excited to investigate it, but she knew that she had to do it. She also decided to bring the remote along with her. She didn't believe that it would work, but somehow she tempted to bring it along with her, probably her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ema's car arrived at the crime scene at people park, Ema let out a groan once she saw who was already at the crime scene. The Glimmerous Fop himself, Klavier Gavin. She did NOT want to deal with him today. As she thought of excuses for how she could stay on the complete opposite side of the crime scene as him, she remembered the remote. She could use that to deal with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to think about ways she could use the remote right now. The first option was the Aware Swap. The first thought of a use for this option was to swap herself with Klavier. Although if she were to swap herself with Klavier at the crime scene, she would still have to deal with him, only he would be in her body. Though maybe he would annoy her less knowing she was in his body. Ema shivered at the thought of being Klavier. Another use for aware swap that she thought was to swap Klavier with a random passerby, then he wouldn't be at the crime scene to annoy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next choice was Unaware Swap, this option was probably the most useless option in this situation. Although it may be pretty humorous to either have a different body or swap some other people around without them noticing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third choice was the Sossession function. If she used this she could possess Klavier, if she did that then she wouldn't have to deal with him at all. Plus if the manual was right then her body would act on it's own, she wouldn't even have to do her work. The only disadvantage would be that she would have to be Klavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth choice was the Shapeshift function. this one was also pretty useless in this situation. It wasn't as though she could shapeshift into someone right now, she had a job to do. Maybe she could shapeshift Klavier into someone, but she had no idea who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute or so of thinking Ema had made her choice and decided to use the.....</span></div></div>",

Ema couldn't help but smirk at both the fact that the remote worked and that her plan to get Klavier away from the crime scene was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier was looking down at himself with shock and terror, how did he suddenly become Trucy Wright?! He wasn't given much time to think about what had happened before a police officer walked up to him and told him that he had to leave the crime scene. Klavier attempted to explain to the officer that he was supposed to be here, but he was ignored and escorted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma was happy that her plan worked, she was free from Klavier for the day. She made her stuffed the remote into her bag, making sure that it would be safe while she investigated and made her way to the main investigative area of the crime scene. She made a mental note to turn Klavier back sometime later today. After all, it would be horrible for Trucy if there was two of her running around. With that mental note in place, she began to do her job and investigate the crime scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier was walking down the sidewalk, away from the crime scene, still confused on how his body changed and why did it become Trucy's? He knew there was no way he could do his job like this, so there was no point in trying to sneak into the crime scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also considered going to Trucy's home to find out if she also became him, but there was risk in that. If Trucy hadn't become him, he would somehow have to explain to her and Herr Forehead that he become her and that could be complicated. If she had to become him, then not only would he have to explain this to her, but the two of them would also have to act like each other to avoid suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, it would be a lot less stressful for Klavier to go home and wait for a least a day to see if this wears off. He decided to walk to his home. Unfortunately for him, his car keys were in his pocket when his body changed and they were now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should the story follow?</span></div></div>",

Even longer than when her first dad ran away, crazily enough. Either way, the trip was a pretty big disruptor to the status quo, and having Apollo and Athena as de facto guardians was unsurprisingly hectic. But that was nothing compared with what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne unusually quiet night, Trucy heard a sharp, singular knock on her bedroom window. She glanced at it, only to find a cardboard box slip just out of view and hit the ground below. She went outside, found that it was labeled with her name and address, and brought it back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly looking over the contents, she found a strange remote-like device and an instruction manual. She put her finger to her chin. <span class=\"clblue\">(What could this be?)</span> she wondered, examining the remote with her free hand. She checked the instructions and all became clear. It was a body-switching remote! Whatever that meant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she found a sleeping Athena (who was staying with her for the time being) and attempted an \"unaware swap\", which switches their bodies without anyone noticing a change,  just to see if it worked. One look at her feet and it was clear that her blue pajamas had been swapped out for Athena's yellow ones. One look at Athena's now awfully Trucy-esque face and the remote's power was confirmed. She quickly switched back and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Trucy had a magical remote control with the power to switch bodies. What did she plan to do?</span></div></div>",

After all, if everyone who watched her trial knew of the secret behind the trick, they wouldn't be amazed by it. This remote would be a suitable replacement for that trick. Trucy had a show tomorrow, so she had the rest of the night to think of a trick with the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy spent the next hour or so think of a way she could use the remote in an act, eventually, she thought of something. She called it \"The amazing transforming assistant!\" She would transform her assistant (Either Apollo, Athena, or one of the Famme sisters) into other people, right before the audiences eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy had even practiced how she would use the remote during the show! She would point her wand at the person she wanted to shapeshift, but that was merely to distract both the audience and her assistant. The remote itself would be in Trucy's other hand, concealed by her cape. During the trick she would quickly pull the remote out of her bag and quickly put it back in after the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practiced the trick while looking in the mirror for quite a while, she wanted to make sure she had perfected the trick before tomorrow. After she was satisfied with herself, she finally went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, everyone was preparing and helping her set up her show, Trucy made sure to remember to bring the remote with her this morning and, before she went to the show area, she made preparations for her trick. The 'Shapeshift' button could register the forms of multiple people, all you had to do was select which person you wanted the target to shapeshift into. Trucy spent most of her morning running around and registering people's bodies for the shapeshift. She had around 15 bodies saved, more than enough for the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was, who would be her guinea pi- lovely assistant for this brand new trick? </span></div></div>",

Don't worry, all you'll have to do it stand still and watch me work my magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show went great for the most part, the audience liked Trucy's magic panties trick and everyone loves Mr. Hat. However, the show wasn't over yet.

This is my new trick, The Amazing Transforming Assistant! No tricks, no gimmicks, only real magic!\" Trucy announced her trick to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed her wand at Apollo, while simultaneously secretly pointing the remote at him and pressed the Shapeshift button! Within a few moments, Apollo began to shrink and his clothes changed. Before he could even process what was going on, he had changed into an exact replica of the Famme twins. He was understandably shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience clapped at Trucy's trick. \"Thank you, thank you, but I'm not done yet! I have plenty other people to turn Pollu into, but first, let's ask Polly how he feels!\" Trucy said and motioned for Apollo to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Trucy, what did you-\" Apollo began to speak, but stopped once he heard the unfamiliar voice exit his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're speechless, I see! Well, without further ado! Let's change even more!\" Trucy said and pointed the remote at Apollo again and pressed the shapeshift button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo once again began to change, he had regained his height, but sadly not his gender. He was now an exact copy of Athena. However, Trucy pressed the Shapeshift button to register Athena while she was asleep, so Apollo was now dressed in Athena's pajamas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like Polly's ready to go to bed! Too bad there's no sleeping during my show!\" Trucy said and pointed the remote at Apollo again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo once again shrank half a foot, once this shapeshift had finished, he could barely see a thing. The only source of light was two tiny holes in front of his eyes. He was wearing a cardboard box over his head! He couldn't look down at himself to see who he had become, but he had a good guess about who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now he's trying to hide from my Magic! That won't do!\" Trucy said and turned to the audience \"Maybe if he was an amazing magician, he would appreciate the magic more! What do you say folks? Should I make him a magician?\" The Audience cheered in agreement with Trucy, who once again pointed the remote at Apollo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Apollo Shapeshifted into and exact copy of Trucy. As with the other shapeshifts, the only thing he could do was stand still with his mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Polly, now that you're the magician, I'll let you say bye to the audience!\" Trucy said and practically skipped off stage, trying to hold back laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo attempted to end the show in the way Trucy normally would, but he just ended up running off stage after Trucy. The audience clapped the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo confronted Trucy \"Trucy! How did you do this?!\" Apollo practically yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic.\" Was the only thing Trucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, turn me back!\" Apollo said, not wanting anything to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Polly!\" Trucy said and once again pointed the remote at him</span></div></div>",

Jinxie had been helping with the clean-up. As Trucy made her way into the manor, she bumped into Phineas Filtch, the caretaker.

She told her all about the magic show she had this morning and how Apollo was currently an exact copy of her.

No, she remembered bringing it with her right after she tried to change Apollo back. Did she drop it? No, it was in her bag the whole time and she never dropped anything that was in her bag before. Was it stolen? Who would have....Trucy then remembered who she had passed on her way into the manor.

However as she turned around, everything began to go dark and within seconds, she couldn't feel anything. She had been possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy's body blinked for a few seconds before immediatly looking down at itself in shock. Filtch had just pickpocketed the remote from Trucy. He had no idea what it did, so he just pressed one of the buttons and the next thing he knew, he was a ghost! In his panic, he flew over to the remote's owner for help , but the second he had touched Trucy, he went into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trucy, is something wrong?\" Jinxie asked who she though was her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiltch looked up at Jinxie, he knew he couldn't just tell her bout what had just happened, he'd be treated like a crazy person. \"No, everything's fine\" Filtch said with a fake smile while rubbing his hands together. As he rubbed his hands together, he noticed he was holding something, the remote! It must have followed him after the possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness, after you stopped moving and starting staring off into the distance, I was afraid you had been possessed by a Yokai\" Jinxie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, you were half right'</i> Filtch thought to himself. He wondered what he should do now, with this remote he could do anything! There was no way he would be giving this thing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the remote's owner, perhaps he should just stay in Trucy's body for now. She was the only one who knew of the remote, so if he stayed as her, he wouldn't have to worry about her taking it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could just use the same function that he used earlier to float into another body, one that Trucy wouldn't be able to notice was acting differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither option was equally viable, but which one did Filtch decide to do right now?</span></div></div>",

The more she thought about it, the more she thought it was outright silly that she kept it secret in the first place. She walked over to Apollo, who was still walking around backstage with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Apollo. You probably already know this, but I lied about how I caused your body to change.\" Trucy began to explain \"The thing that caused it was this remote, I'm sorry for not telling you.\" She said and show Apollo the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo eyed the remote in fascination. He thought it was amazing. \"So, if that remote can change bodies, you can turn me back to normal at any time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in fact, I'm going to turn you back to normal right now.\" Trucy said and pointed the remote at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! do I have to turn back right now? I barely had any time in this body.\" Apollo protested, he didn't know why, but despite really wanting to go back to his own body a few minutes ago, he now really wanted to stay as Trucy, something about being a magician really seemed to appeal to him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy thought about it for a minute, Apollo seemed to really want to stay as her for now, but the more she thought about it, the more risky it seemed for there to be two Trucy Wright's walking around and no Apollo Justice. \"Sorry, Apollo, but that won't do. I can't have two of me running around. Plus, you have your job as a lawyer to think of, what if a case pops up while you're in my body? I'm going to turn you back right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're no fun.\" Apollo said with his head down. Trucy pointed the remote at him and pressed the 'Undo Shapeshift' button. In a few moments, Apollo was back in his normal body. \"Well, I guess I'll head home now, since you won't let me have any fun.\" Apollo said and began to walk away. Trucy noticed that he walked the way that she normally walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy wondered what to do with the remote now. The more she thought about using it for the magic trick she had done today, the less it appealed to her. In fact, the entire idea of putting on magic shows didn't appeal to her at all. She thought that it was most likely a result of the 'Personality Swap'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wondered what to do, she thought of two ideas. The first was the most obvious, swap her personality back. Everything would be back to normal and she would be her true self again, but did she really want that right now? She currently had Apollo's personality and was thinking a lot more rationally and acting more mature than she normally did. Did she really want to go back to being her usual, childish and spontaneous self?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other idea she had was to 'Aware Swap' with Apollo before he got too far away. The thought of being a defense attorney was suddenly very appealing to her. At least, more appealing than being a magician. Plus, Apollo wanted to be her a few seconds ago, it wasn't like she was stealing his body against his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Trucy decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Absolutely!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy pointed the remote at her, then at Apollo, pressed \"aware swap\", and suddenly found herself looking out through Apollo's eyes. This felt right.

Here, get this thing away from me,\" she said, passing the remote to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Apollo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm sick of the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... thanks! I'll see you!\" Apollo said, running off with Trucy's body. Besides his memories, there wasn't really any way to tell a clear difference between him right now and Trucy normally.

He was no longer Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, he was Trucy Wright: Magnificent Magician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she also gave him the remote! With this he could do whatever he wanted! He examined the remote to see what buttons it had. Each of the buttons were labeled with one word. 'Aware', 'Unaware', 'Possession', and 'Shapeshift'. The shapeshift button had a small screen with pictures of bodies (Some of which Apollo recognized as the ones he had been turned into earlier) and a small 'Undo' button. He flipped the remote over and saw that the battery hatch was left open and their was a small unlabeled button next to the batteries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind wandered with the possibilities of what he could do with it. Obviously he would continue to use the Shapeshift button for Trucy's Amazing Changing Assistant act, but there were other things he could try out in the meantime! His wondering about what to do was interrupted however, by an argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must let me in! I need to know how Trucy Wright accomplished that feat!\" A familiar voice yelled.

I merely need to look through her belongings! I need to know how she accomplished that transforming act!

Despite his initial apprehension towards manual labor of this nature, it occurred to him in a flash of wisdom from the heavens that he could take advantage of this situation to examine the props he had been instructed to handle and to, in doing so, find any measure of trickery involved in their construction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe auditorium was completely empty, save for the stray props he'd been tasked with putting away. This was his chance! He first chose to examine the magic panties once again, simply because that meant he'd have it out of his sight more quickly. He learned nothing new, as expected, and put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't what he was interested in anyhow. It was that insane shape-shifting trick! He had earlier suspected real magic, but he had now decided that there was no way. No stage magician would be so cruel to trick-spotters such as himself as to use real magic in their act, would they? Of course not, it was utterly inconceivable in every respect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe located an odd-shaped shoe mark from when Apollo's shoes changed in place, and searched the area for some sort of hologram or melting clay or... something at all. But there was nothing. Not even a hole in the ground! Maybe it really was real magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonny! Have you only put away one prop this whole time!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley turned to face the voice behind him. It was Bonny's twin sister, Betty de Famme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... my apologies,\" Wesley said, struggling to think of an excuse. \"I was sidetracked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty clenched her fists. \"'Sidetracked' isn't going to get us home in time to watch the Castlevania reboot, you lazy bunny! Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat scared Wesley into focusing on the cleanup, but considering how long she was gone, he couldn't help but wonder what <i>she'd</i> been doing all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she being brought up to speed on the body swap?</span></div></div>",

If they had an ounce of sense, they would implement some way to prevent situations from becoming so unbelievably convoluted that it would require an eternity to fully untangle the effects of a few days of what would seem at first to be harmless pranks. Anyone who would design this remote without a reset feature is frankly, a complete and utter buffoon who should not have such powers, much less give it to an underage magician with a penchant for pranks. Without it, lives could and would be destroyed irreparably if the remote were lost, damaged, stolen, or otherwise tampered with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the designer of this device was somewhat competent when they had the bare minimum amount of morality required to place just such a feature on the remote, well hidden enough that it wouldn't be noticed at first glance by those malicious enough to remove it. The button's text had long since faded away, likely due to many, many former users of the remote having remorse for their actions and ha, no. It was usually the victims forcing it away and mashing that button to high hell and back. Fortunately for Trucy, the remote was also designed sturdily enough to withstand those impulses of the madly driven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Apollo, Trucy had the impulse to press said \"reset\" button. As Trucy pressed the button, Apollo's form shifts up a few inches (though not as many as he'd claim it did), and his clothing shifted back to its former pristine white button up shirt and boldly striped vest. The cape melded into his back, changing into a deep burgundy backing, and a teal tie (aka fashion noose). The hat as well shifted along with his body, its threads moving along Apollo's torso in a surely unpleasant experience to provide the extra material necessary to create some pants with a length longer than the knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Apollo was back to normal, he looked down at his now ungloved and rebraced hands. He was shocked and surprised that Trucy got on the ball so quickly! He knew she would eventually, she was a good person like that, but he did think that she would've taken her sweet time getting him back to his former form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow comes the real question:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Trucy want to shift him back, or is she going to leave him be for the time being?</span></div></div>",

The Shapeshift button already had an undo function, which meant that this new button must have been a reset button. One that could undo everything that the remote had done. Granted, she may have been jumping to conclusions, but it was the first logical thing she thought of. More importantly, this meant one other thing. She could do whatever she wanted with this remote and not have to worry about going around and individually undo everything she had done! This would save her so much time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, onto the matter at hand, Apollo. As Apollo looked around for Trucy (So he could say thank for turning him back to normal and then get as far away as possible) He suddenly felt another change, this felt familiar \"Oh no-\" Apollo began as his body once again morphed. He once again lost his height and gender, his clothes also changed. In a few moments he was once again an exact copy of Trucy Wright. \"-Not again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing him, Trucy walked up to him with a large smile on her face. \"See, I changed to back to normal, no problem at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you immediately turned me back into you!\" Apollo practically yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh! People are staring!\" Trucy urged him to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn me back to normal......and let me stay that way!\" Apollo demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, C'mon Polly! What's wrong with being me?\" Trucy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of way too many things to count.\" Apollo said in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you put it that way.....nope!\" Trucy said and stuck out her tounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo just stared at her angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to go around and use my magic on other people, but since you're already here, why don't we both have fun with this?\" Trucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were going to do this to other people too?!\" Apollo asked, shocked that Trucy was haphazardly using this on anyone she felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Don't worry, I can turn everything back to normal at anytime! So, you wanna join in the fun?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo considered Trucy's offer, his answer was obvious. He had to go along with her, just to make sure that she didn't do anything potentially dangerous with this power. \"Fine, I'll go with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Trucy said happily as she hugged Apollo. It felt strange to hug herself. \"Oh, it may be weird for there to be two of me walking around. Want me to change you into someone else? There's plenty of people I can turn you into! Or do you want to stay as me?\" Trucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I have my own body back?\" Apollo asked, desperate to be himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Trucy said and once again stuck out her tounge<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Apollo choose?</span></div></div>",

We need to get some more batteries for this thing.\" Trucy waggles the remote a little, \"I am <i>not</i> having our fun cut short again! Now with these,\" Trucy grabs the batteries and throws them all in her magic panties. As she does her usual hammerspace routine to make them disappear, her smile grows wider, \"These'll last us at least a whole day of fun! Imagine it Apollo, the limitless possibilities! Anything is possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no kidding. Anything is possible.\" Apollo parroted back at Trucy, though with a far less enthused tone whilst raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said, Polly! Glad you're getting the picture!\" Trucy seemed to have missed the tone that Apollo was speaking with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy was suddenly distracted by an idea she had. Apollo could see the lightbulb going off in her head, and only put his arms down in a futile attempt at self-defense when he saw her put the remote down to start combing through her dressing room's closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mumbles to herself, \"Where did I put that thing? I know I left it around here somewhere... C'mon... Ah, there it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo walks forward, somewhat concerned by Trucy's sudden and manic search through her belongings to find some unknown outfit that he had no clue about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-dah!\" With perfectly practiced bravado, she twirls around to present Apollo with an old outfit of her. It was practically a palette swap of her stage magician's outfit, right down to the little bangles at the end of each point of her cape. The only differentiating factor was that the primary color of choice was red, not blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you might like this outfit, Polly! It's in your favorite color~!\" Trucy sang as she rocked it back and forth a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, don't you wanna be twinsies~?\" Apollo replied, his singing unintentionally devoid of the sarcasm he meant to place in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y'know, you are absolutely right! The type of magic we could get up to would be way better if we just dressed the same! We would be able to do magic that would knock the socks off even the Femme twins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what Polly, why don't you make the call again? Do you want to have a little originality in your act, make this a duo? Or do you want to make this a synchronized solo so we can make some magic? It's totally up to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Apollo do at this juncture?</span></div></div>",

Trucy truly was changing everyone, be it man, woman or child. Apollo felt a bit bad about leaving all of these people in shock, but he calmed down a bit due to remembering that Trucy said she can change everyone back to normal at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy looked around at her handiwork and smiled. \"Looks like we change everyone around here, let's go somewhere else!\" She said as she playfully marched off. Apollo followed close behind, he didn't want to lose track of the real Trucy in this chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta hand it to you Polly, you actually had a fun idea for once.\" Trucy said with a laugh. Apollo gave her an annoyed look, if you asked him, he'd say he was always a pretty fun person. Although, this situation was the complete opposite of fun in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Someone who looked and sounded exactly like Trucy yelled and ran up to them, they almost tripped during their run over due to now being used to Trucy's body. \"You're the real Trucy aren't you?!\" They said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Who are you?\" Trucy asked cheerfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it and what did they want?</span></div></div>",

In a mere moment, Apollo suddenly had a blank look on his face and stopped moving entirely. Trucy watched, waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. She walked up to Apollo and waved a hand in front of his face. \"Hello? Earth to Polly.\" She said, but got no response. He just stood there like a statue. This made Trucy worried. \"Say something Polly!\" She practically yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something.\" Apollo said, he suddenly looked confused \"Why did I say that?\" He wondered aloud. He seemed not to notice that he had been unresponsive a few seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy let out a sigh of relief, glad that nothing was wrong with Apollo. She was still confused as to what the button did though. It didn't seem like Apollo's body changed at all. He was still acting like himself too. She wondered what changed. Thinking back on what happened a minute ago, she had a vague idea. She pointed the remote at Apollo again and pressed the button again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Apollo's expression went blank and he stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, 'I'm Trucy Wright, world's greatest magician', Oh, and say it like how I would\" Trucy commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Trucy Wright! World's greatest magician!\" Apollo said, doing a perfect impersonation of Trucy. After he said that, a look of fear appeared on his face. \"Trucy! You need to change me back fast, I think your body is starting to make me act like you!\" He said, clearing not remembering the command Trucy had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy smiled, she now knew what the new button was. 'Command'. It seemed that whenever the button was used on someone that person would have to do whatever they were told to do. Trucy's mind began to wander when thinking of the possibilities, but first, she would need to test this button's limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed the remote at Apollo and he was again entered the vacant state. \"Polly, tell me something you would never tell me.\" Trucy said, testing out how vague she could be with commands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep my money inside my law books.\" Apollo gave away a secret, he suddenly began to freak out \"AHH! Forget you heard that! Why do I keep saying weird things?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy made a mental note of some books she'd have to read later as she pressed the button again. It was clear that this remote could control what people said, but could it make people do things? \"Polly, for the next two minutes, run around in circles making airplane sounds!\" Trucy commanded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo began to do exactly what she said, but not without getting looks from people around him. While doing what she said, he didn't say anything, he was unable to due to one of the things she ordered being \"Make airplane sound the whole time\", but he was mentally aware of what he was doing '<i>Why can't I stop?!'</i> He thought to himself as his body refused to listen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two minutes were up, Apollo sat on the ground and tried to catch his breath. Trucy could hardly hold back her laughter. It seemed that this command button would lead to a whole lot of fun. The question now was, should she keep testing it out on Apollo? Or should she go find a new person to try it out on?</span></div></div>",

Why waste time looking for someone else to test it out on? \"Hmm, what to try now?\" Trucy thought before she got another idea. She pointed the remote at Apollo and once again pressed the command button. \"Apollo, you can only refer to yourself by the body you're in\" She said. Apollo seemed to go back to normal, but there was only one way to find out \"Hey, Polly. Who are you?\" Trucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was very confused by the question \"What are you talking about Trucy? I'm Trucy.\" He said, his eyes going wide at the end of his sentence \"Why'd I say that?! I'm not Trucy, I'm Trucy!\" He shouted, once again getting his name wrong. \"I'm Trucy Wright, I'm a magician!\" He said, losing his patience<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, Polly. I didn't know you liked being me so much. Trucy said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trucy, I'm not in control of what I'm saying. You have to change me back fast!\" Apollo practically begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll turn you back, if you can tell what your body looks like.\" Trucy said. She already knew that Apollo couldn't say his name, but could he describe who he was to other people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I look like! I'm a girl, I have brown hair that I keep in a pony tail, I always wear a magician outfit.\" Apollo began to attempt to list things about himself, but due to the command, his sentence was twisted so he described what Trucy looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case. You're already in the right body! You're exactly how you described!\" Trucy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I'm not in control of what I'm saying!\" Apollo yelled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy couldn't stop giggling at the results of this command. She wanted to go further with this? How much could he have Apollo do at once? Could she have him act like her? If she did that, it would be like having a twin. Of course, on the inside Apollo would probably be screaming and trying to protest against acting like Trucy, did she really want to do that to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea she had was to make Apollo think he was in the right body. Sure, to everyone else he would still be Trucy Wright, but he would think that everything was normal. He'd go about his daily routine, just with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, those were only the first two things that popped into her head. She was sure that if she put her mind to it, she'd think of plenty of fun uses for this function. So, what did she do?</span></div></div>",

Luckily, Apollo's body was one of the many she had saved earlier, so she was able to select his body as the one she wanted to turn into without issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change only took a few moments. In a few moments she was no longer Trucy Wright: Magnificent Magician. She was now Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. The change felt strange. On the positive side, she was now taller. On the negative side, she was now a boy. The change in gender was the most obvious part of the shapeshift, and also the hardest to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Trucy, you just changed.\" Apollo said, shocked that Trucy transformed. Before he could say anything else, Trucy pressed the 'Command' button and once agaim caused Apollo to have a blank expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Polly, as far as you know, I've always looked like this\" Trucy ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's regained his composure and continued walking, seemingly forgetting what he was shocked about a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy giggled under her breath. She couldn't believe that worked! Now she can watch people's reactions to 'Trucy' doing Apollo's daily routine without people questioning why there was two Trucys<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Trucy, we have to hurry. Apparently there's a lot of paper work I have to take care of at the office, and I don't want to be there all night.\" Apollo grumbled under his breath, not excited about doing paperwork all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoez anything happen on their way to the office?</span></div></div>",

She wished she hadn't turned down those first two ideas, but she'd already committed to a new one. It seemed like it would be a while before she thought of something, so she messed with Apollo in this state a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed the remote at Apollo and blanked his mind again. \"Okay, I want you to forget that last conversation, but keep only referring to yourself as the body you're in. Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo grabbed his forehead. \"Ugh. I feel funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy tapped him on the shoulder. \"Well, maybe if you did some Chords of Steel, it would help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo nodded, balling his fists. \"Good idea. Here goes! I'M TRUCY WRIGHT AND I'M FINE! WHAT!?\" He said, nearly tripping upon the realization. \"Okay, enough games. I think this body's messing with my brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Polly. I'll change you back right now if you can answer any one of these questions. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Question 1: What is the most iconic part of your appearance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine!

No, wait-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong again! Last question: Are you or are you not a member of the Gramarye lineage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Not again!

It's time for the loser's penalty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy pulled out the remote and blanked Apollo's mind again before he had a chance to respond, this time refusing to wake him until she had a plan ready. That was a fun time-waster, but she was hoping it would give her any ideas. She had no such luck, so it was back to the drawing board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, something hit her. One potential command, she thought, could be to make him obey literally any command he's given from anyone. It was a bit risky, but it might just be worth it. Maybe this one wasn't one of those half-decent-but-not-really-good-enough-to-use ideas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was?</span></div></div>",

He woke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Polly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Apollo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking, what if we took advantage of this opportunity so I could look at a few other costumes in third person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, like a fashion show!\" Trucy remarked. \"It'd be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It absolutely would not be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Trucy said, running over to her closet and grabbing an outfit that resembled what her normal outfit would be if she were an actual Magical Girl. \"At least put this on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo stared at it for a moment. After a few seconds, he began to twitch, but before it started looking extremely noticeable, he caved to the mental pressure, grumbling while he did it. \"Okay, fine. Just this one,\" he mumbled, grabbing the outfit out of Trucy's hand as he walked by her and into the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came out in the full set. Trucy wanted to spend the whole time laughing at him while he posed like some kind of runway model, but she switched gears when she realized this could be legitimately valuable. After watching closely for a few moments, she decided it looked the part. Was the range of motion free enough though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo decided to answer that question by doing a particularly mobile dance, something his subconscious apparently associated with modeling. Either way, it definitely had enough range, and Apollo had had enough, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, are we done? Can I change back now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Polly, I don't think you get it. This is going to be the rest of our day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...WHAT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Here, look!\" Trucy said, grabbing what looked like a spirit medium acolyte outfit, but in her color scheme. \"Now put this on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo grumbled loudly. \"FINE,\" he said, forcefully grabbing the outfit from Trucy as he stomped back into the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould this \"research session\" finish without interruption?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I`m gonna look for some more outfits for you to wear!\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I at least take this one off first?\" Apollo asked. He was currently dressed in a black Gavinners t shirt and a black skirt. Both seemed to be covered in glitter as they kept sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Trucy said not looking away from the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo sat down the modeling had worn him out. He didn't WANT to wear any of the outfits Trucy kept picking out, but for some reason he felt like he HAD to wear them. After each outfit he would tell both himself and Trucy that it would be the last one, but for some reason he couldn't refuse whenever she asked for one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trucy looked through the closet he noticed a remote placed on the table next to her. Strange, she didn't have a t.v. here. Why did she have a remote? Curiosity got the better of him and he went to investigate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Trucy was too busy looking through the closet to interrupt him as he picked up the remote. As he expected, the buttons on the remote were clearly not for a television, but he couldn't tell what they were for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, he had a vague memory in the back of his head, one of Trucy pointing the remote at him and saying some things. He couldn't remember much, but he felt that this happened very recently. Just as he began to think about it, he heard Trucy`s voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! That`s mine, give it back Polly!\" Trucy said as she practically lunged for the remote and grabbed it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo kept a tight grip on the remote, it was clear that Trucy badly wanted this remote.

If she made him enjoy it, that would practically be a reward, he wouldn't feel embarrassed about wearing any of the outfits. Her second idea on the other hand, was much more of a punishment for Apollo. He'd still have the same feelings about modeling her clothes as he had now, but he'd have to be in public while doing the modeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed the remote at him and once again pressed 'Command' \"Apollo, whenever you finish modeling an outfit for me, you'll go outside for fifteen minutes and model for as many people as possible. Oh! Plus, if you see anyone we know, make sure that they know that it's really you in my body!\" Trucy added that last part in order to add some embarrassment to the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo snapped out of it and looked down at the De Famme outfit he was wearing, he didn't remember changing into it. He figured he must have blacked out, he wished he could black out for this whole modeling session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Polly, do you feel like going outside?\" Trucy said, making sure the command worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo looked disgusted at the idea \"No way!\" He yelled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy figured this was because he had him change into the De Famme outfit before she put in the 'Go Outside' command into his head. She looked through her closet and looked for another outfit. She quickly found one. It was a uniform very similar to the ones worn at Themis academy. \"Put this on Polly! I bet I would look better in it than Juniper.\" Trucy said as she held up the outfit to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo once again grabbed the outfit from her and headed for the closest to change. He came out dressed in the outfit and once again posed around and modeled for Trucy, but Trucy was a bit more concerned with the next part. \"Good Polly, but I want to know what other people think about it? Do you want to head outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, no way.\" Apollo said, thought didn't yell this time. As he stood there, his eyes kept twitching between the closet  and the exit door. It was clear which one he wanted to head toward, but he found himself walking outside anyway. Trucy giggled, she was worried for a second, but it was clear in the end that the command had worked. She followed closely behind Apollo to see how he acted in front of other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy laughed at the commands effects. Whenever Apollo saw people, he would pose for them the same way he had done inside. Most people had no idea what he was doing and a few thought he was putting on some kind of show for them. What they thought didn't matter though. What mattered to Trucy was the look on Apollo's face, and how much redder his cheeks got with every pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy looked around and thought she saw someone Apollo knew, perfect! If the command was working perfectly, he would convince whoever that was that he was actually Apollo. Trucy couldn't wait to see the look on his face after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Much to Apollo's relief. Unfortunately for Apollo, the command would not let him stop unless Ema believed it was him. \"Here, I can prove it.\" Apollo said, he walked around the corner and dragged the real Trucy to Ema, \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma's eyes went wide at seeing two Trucy's, but she still didn't believe one was Apollo. \"I have even more proof!\" Apollo said and held out his and Trucy's hands. \"Take our fingerprints, they'll be exactly the same.

This will prove that I'm someone else turned into Trucy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma was still skeptical, but she never turned down the chance to take fingerprints.

She turned to the real Trucy \"Please explain, Trucy.\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just give me a second.\" Trucy said as she took out the remote and aimed it at Apollo. \"Hey, Apollo.

He remembered Trucy pushing a button on the bottom side of the remote and telling him to do things. He also remembered doing everything that she said against his will. He then realized that was why he was wearing all the outfits Trucy made him wear. He got mad over this. Trucy was controlling him against his will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Trucy's footsteps nearby. He quickly ran out from under the stage and pointed the remote at her. He pressed command button and suddenly she stopped moving. Was this what happened to him whenever she used it? \"Trucy, you will stand still and only talk when answering my questions.\" Apollo gave a test command, and it seemed to have worked. Now for the interrogation \"Trucy, where did you get this remote? and what does it do\" He asked her. Trucy told Apollo everything she knew about the remote. He now had a good understanding about what was going on. \"Okay, so. How often did you plan to use it on me?\" Apollo asked, wanting to know how close he came to dodging a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime I got bored.\" Trucy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's gritted his teeth. She planned to do embarrassing stuff like this to him all the time. Well, two could play at that game. He may be stooping to her level, but there wasn't exactly any other way he could get back at her. He thought of embarrassing punishments for her. He needed to think of something big enough that she would never even consider using the remote on him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first idea that came to his mind was using the 'Command' function on her and having her do embarrassing things, like she had done to him. Of course, as Trucy told him, this had a limitation. She would only do the things he said, so any unexpected event could help her fight off the command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other idea came to him as he looked down at his current body. To the rest of the world, he was Trucy Wright. He had access to everything. He had her magic career, her friendships, her home, her love life. If he worked hard enough, he could mess those all up for her. Not in a major way, of course. Just enough that she wouldn't want anything to do with the remote. The only problem would be that he would have to do all of that himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trucy stood motionless, Apollo thought the two ideas over. In the end he decided to....</span></div></div>",

Whether that was a compliment to Trucy or an insult to himself is up to debate. He elected to go with plan B instead, take advantage of the fact that she put him in her body. He pointed the remote at Trucy and shapeshifted her into an exact copy of him. He then pressed the command button. \"Trucy, for the next 3 days you will act exactly like me. You also won't let anyone know about this swap. Head straight for my home and get ready for my daily routine tomorrow.\" He ordered her and she walked off, walking exactly how he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo looked down at himself and wondered if he made the right decision. Sure, he would get the chance to mess with Trucy, but he also just condemned himself to being her for three days. \"This better convince her.\" Apollo told no one in particular. He looked at the clothes he was currently wearing and wondered if he should change, he opted against it, he had seen that closet far too much today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what he should do to mess with her life. The first thing that came to mind was her magic show, he was sure she had another coming up soon. If he wanted, he could ruin the show with a horrible performance or something like that. Maybe even doing something on stage that people would forever judge Trucy for. He wouldn't do anything too major of course, he wanted to teach her a lesson, not ruin her entire career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part of her life he currently had access to was her home, Mr. Wright was currently in Khura'in and Trucy as staying with Athena. If he went to her home and did a bit of <i>'Re-arranging' </i> to her bedroom, no one would bat an eye. He may even look around a bit and see if he could find any secrets Trucy might be hiding from everyone. That would get back at her for the \"Tell me where you keep your money\" command Trucy had given him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third thing Apollo thought of was messing with her relationships with her friends. Apollo had to admit, he didn't know much about Trucy's private life. He would just cause a few little fights with some of the friends he did know she had. Once again, nothing too major.

She had been doing this a lot lately, she had gotten used to messing around with Apollo during days when she didn't have a magic show, but now that he was living in Khura'in, she had no one to mess around with. She wished she had something interesting to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she wished she had something interesting to do, there was a knock at the door. She went to answer the door, but found no one there, just a package addressed to her. There wasn't anyone in the hallway either, it was as if the package had appeared from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the package inside and looked at it's contents. Inside she found a remote and a manual. The remote had four functions 'Aware Swap', 'Unaware Swap', 'Shapeshift, and 'Possession'. The manual that came with the remote covered in detail what each of these buttons did. Trucy was always one to not believe in the impossible, so she immediately believed that this remote could do what it claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what to do with it? The first thing that came to mind was to simple test the remote out at home. Her dad and Athena were both here and she was sure that the two of them would like to help her test out the remote. However, another thought came into her head. She missed hanging out with Apollo and she couldn't just leave home to go to Khura'in, but with this remote, there was a way she could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could register the remote with herself via the 'Aware Swap' button and then mail it to Khura'in and have Apollo point it at someone and press the same button, then she'd be in Khura'in! No plane necessary! Of course, this plan did have a lot of risks, did Trucy really want to try this?</span></div></div>",

She point the remote at herself and pressed the 'Aware Swap' button. She then put the remote back into it's package, she neglected to put the remote's manual in the same package. She then began to write a letter to Apollo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dear Polly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been really boring without you around.<br>\r\nI've wanted to visit you in Khura'in for the longest time, but obviously I couldn't<br>\r\nBut I think I found a way that we can hang out.<br>\r\nInside the package is a remote, we'll use this!<br>\r\nIt'll make a lot more sense after you use it.<br>\r\nOh, but make sure to call me before you do!<br>\r\nI don't want it to happen while I'm in the middle of doing something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom - Trucy'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the letter into the package and went to the post office to mail them to Apollo in Khura'in. Hopefully they didn't get lost in the mail, that would be a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----2 Weeks later-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next two weeks Trucy had done nothing worth noting. She had been eagerly waiting a phone call from Apollo. As luck would have it, today was the day she finally got that fateful call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Trucy asked eagerly over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Trucy, it's me Apollo. I don't quite understand what you meant in your letter.\" Apollo said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it'll make more sense after you use it!\" Trucy said with excitement. \"All you have to do it point the remote at someone and click the 'Aware' button! Then I'll be in Khura'in with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trucy, that makes no sense at all.\" Apollo sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it! C'mon Polly!\" Trucy was getting impaitent, she want the swap to happen already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, give me a few seconds.\" Apollo said, he didn't hang up the phone. He kept it with him as he took the remote out of the box and aimed at the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Trucy was no longer looking at the ceiling of the Wright Anything Agency. She was now looking at the scenery of the foreign country of Khura'in. It was clear the swap had worked!

Of course, Trucy was the boss, so surely their work could be put on hold for a magic trick. \"Hey guys, want to see a new trick I've been working on?\" Trucy said with a smile on her face, holding the remote behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo didn't look up from his work \"Sorry, Trucy but we're- Ouch\" Apollo was interrupted by Athena elbowing his side. \"We'd love to see your magic trick, Trucy\" Athena said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, close your eyes for ten seconds!\" Trucy ordered them to do. Athena listened to Trucy without issue, Apollo didn't want to do it, but complied out of both a desire to make Trucy happy and a fear of Athena getting mad at him. Once Trucy was sure that both of their eyes were closed, she aimed the remote at Apollo and hit 'Aware Swap' and then proceeded to point the remote at Athena and press the same button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy couldn't tell if the swap had actually worked. Neither Apollo or Athena had reacted yet. \"Alright, open your eyes!\" Trucy ordered. \"Okay? what did-\" 'Athena' began to say, but stopped talking and put a hand at 'her' throat. Seemingly surprised at her new voice. She looked over at 'Apollo' and just stared speechless. Once 'Apollo' opened his eyes he pointed at 'Athena' and screamed. It was clear that the swap had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo in Athena's body was covering his ears, that scream combined with Athena's sensitive hearing wasn't exactly a good combination. Once he had recovered, he turned to Trucy \"How did you do this?\" He asked, both scared due to the sudden body swap and curious as to how Trucy was able to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Polly. You know a magician never reveals her secrets.\" Trucy said playfully. She had considered telling both of them about the remote, but she decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo rolled Athena's eyes \"Alright, can you swap us back now?\" Apollo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD IT!\" Athena yelled in Apollo's voice, causing Apollo is Athena's body to once again cover his ears \"Oops, sorry\" Athena apologized \"But, as I was going to say, whats the rush? Trucy can switch us back anytime! Let's stay like this for a while!\" Athena said, practically jumping up and down from excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. We have a case to work on, I have more important things to worry about than the difficulty of being in a girl's body.\" Apollo immediately turned down the idea of staying swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Apollo, it will be fun.\" Athena said then turned to Trucy with a devious smile. \"It's up to Trucy anyway! Well, Trucy, do you want me and Apollo to stay swapped or do you want to spoil the fun and turn us back to normal?\" Athena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Trucy do?</span></div></div>",

After all, getting to really know each other would probably clear out any lingering misgivings the two had after everything with the Phantom.

Odds were that it would demand every ounce of their concentration, and Trucy didn't want someone else to be adversely affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Athena, but I don't think Daddy would be happy if we risked a client's freedom over this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo looked relieved. \"Thank goodness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena pouted, which Trucy thought looked funny on Apollo's face.

But right now, I'm going to need you to close your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena did so, as did Apollo. It was then when Trucy remembered the unaware swap option the remote's manual had described.

Apollo noticed Athena was wearing his bracelet and Athena noticed widget around Apollo's neck. They must have followed us when our bodies got swapped!\" Athena said as she quickly removed widget from Apollo's neck and handed him his bracelet. Apollo thought about what Athena just said. Something didn't feel right about that, but he didn't have time to think about that. They had other things they had to focus on. He slid on his bracelet, strange, was it always this loose on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Vamanos! We need to hurry and settle this case! I want to get back and experiment with Trucy's body swap trick more when we get back!\" Athena said and nearly dragged Apollo out of the office.

Without her special hearing, Athena wouldn't be able to properly use widget and Apollo would hardly be able to notice his bracelet tighten on Athena's smaller wrist. Trucy was sure they would be fine though, even if they were unable to use their special skills, they were still capable enough to solve one small case.

Or, more accurately, it was up to the police, but Detective Gumshoe has let her help out, much to Mr. Edgeworth's dismay. Helpful as Kay could be sometimes, she was more than a little reckless and overenthusiastic. Regardless, she was determined to help out. As the Great Thief Yatagarasu, it was her job to seek out the truth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right now, nothing seemed to be happening. In fact, she was beginning to think Gumshoe and Edgeworth might have sent her here to keep her out of the way while the real crime was taking place somewhere else. \"Where are they anyway,\" Kay said to herself. Not only was there no sign of criminal activity, but there was no sign of any police either. Either they were doing a very good job of hiding, or her hunch about being sent here to make sure she was out of the way was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tucked her binoculars away back into her pouch, ready to climb down the tree she was sitting in and find out what was really going on, when suddenly, something fell onto the tree branch she was sitting on. It startled her, but she managed to keep her balance and not fall out of the tree. Looking over at where it fell, there seemed to be an unlabeled cardboard box sitting amongst the tree branches. \"What the heck?\" Kay mumbled, slowly inching her way across the branch to reach out and get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" she exclaimed as soon as she had it in her hand, quickly scuttling back towards the trunk where the branch was more stable. She couldn't help but wonder how the box had gotten up here. Had someone thrown it up to her? Was it already up in the tree, and her moving along the branches had shook it down? Who put it there in the first place? But most importantly, and most answerable, what was inside? Not even considering that the box might belong to someone else, Kay quickly opened it up. Inside, she found a strange-looking remote, as well as a sheet of instructions explaining what the buttons did. Good thing too, because with how the buttons were labelled, Kay would never have been able to tell what the remote was actually for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, once she read it and found out what it was for, she didn't really believe it. Body swapping? Possession? Yeah right! But then again, what if it wasn't. Kay already had some formidable gadgets as the Great Thief Yatagarasu, but this could be more powerful than any of them! Being a thief would be a walk in the park if she could become anyone she wanted to be. This was too good an opportunity to pass up, she had to try it out and see if it worked. But how to test it? She could go and try to find Mr. Edgeworth and Gumshoe. They had sent her on a wild goose chase after all. Perhaps a little payback was in order. Then again, if they weren't here at the lake, Kay wasn't exactly sure where they'd be, so maybe it'd be better to just try it out on a random passerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay hopped down from the tree, and headed off to try out the remote.</span></div></div>",

I've been here alone all day.\" She said, a bit annoyed with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe seemed to be thinking of an excuse, but Edgeworth cut him off. \"The crime we were investigating today was a robbery, having a thief on the scene of a robbery might not have been the smartest of ideas, lest more items be stolen.\" Edgeworth bluntly told the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay got a devious grin on her. \"Yeah, well it's actually a good thing I didn't go. I found something a lot cooler than anything you probably found during your investigation.\" She said as she subtly got the remote ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe was clearly curious however Edgeworth was unamused. \"Yes, yes. We do not have time to spend talking around. Me and detective Gumshoe need to go interrogate a suspect. This may take a while, so we came to tell you not to wait around the lake for us. And no, you cannot come with us.\" Edgeworth said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Edgeworth Turned around began to make his way back to his car, Kay got the remote ready. The question now was who to swap herself with and if she  wanted to use a swap button at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could either swap with or possess Edgeworth, he had been a stuck up jerk, well, more than usual, today. So maybe swapping with or possessing him would be a nice bit of payback for not letting her come and investigate with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could also swap with or possess Gumshoe. He could have told her that she couldn't investigate earlier, then she wouldn't have been looking around the lake for nothing all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother, more amusing option was to swap Edgeworth and Gumshoe with each other. It would be a funny bit of payback on both of them, having them both be in a job that they knew nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning out time to make her choice she chose to...</span></div></div>",

Okay, business wasn't as good as it could be, but he was sure people would come in crowds to buy his art soon. After all, who wouldn't want a painting from the artist who helped solve a murder case? Too bad he couldn't keep the painting from that trial, he could have sold it for a ton of money, but the judge had taken it away from him saying \"It would be better if no one else ever saw this.\" Larry took that as a compliment, the Judge must have loved his painting so much that he wanted to keep it for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry thought to himself about ways to increase business. He had wanted Frazny to model for him, but every time he would ask her, she would whip him and needless to say, it was very hard to paint with an angry woman whipping you. He wished he had some way to get her to model for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Larry looked through his art supplies, he noticed a strange package laying with his stuff. Odd, he hadn't picked up any mail today and he hadn't been around anyone who could have given this to him. On the package was a note <i>'To the striving artist'</i> it read. \"Striving, But I'm not hungry.\" Larry said after reading the note. Inside the package was a remote and a manual. Larry skimmed through the manual \"Blah blah blah word. Blah Blah Blah big pages. Ooh! pictures!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking over the pictures in the manual, Larry had a basic understanding of what the remote did. It seemed to be some kind of 'Body Swapper' although it could also let you take over someone else's body or turn your body into an exact copy of someone else's. Larry immediately believed that the remote could actually do what the manual said it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was amazing! With this remote he could become anyone and do anything! the question now was, what to do with it? The first thing that came to mind was using it to help with his art career. If he took Franzy's body, he could have her model for him. After all, she couldn't say no if he was her! Heck, he didn't even need to take Franzy's body, with this remote he could take anyone's body and have them be his model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he could also use this remote for something much more important than his career...fun! He could be anyone and do anything as them, walk a mile in someone else's socks or whatever that saying was. Over the years he had taken many random jobs and done various things, how hard could being someone else be? Heck, he didn't even need to be the one in someone else's body, if he wanted to he could swap other people around and have fun watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Larry use the remote for?</span></div></div>",

Larry grabbed the remote and left his home. He had a good idea of where Franziska would be at this time of day, he way on his way to the local courthouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Larry too long to get there and when he did, he thanked his luck. It seemed that Franziska was just arriving at the courthouse. Larry couldn't believe how lucky he was, he was sure that he would have had to find an excuse to go into the courtroom or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the remote out of his pocket and wondered what button he should use. He ruled out Aware Swap for now, he knew that if Franziska found out that he had taken her body, she would get mad and whip him like crazy, he didn't want to deal with that right now, so he'd have to rely on the other buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up was 'Unaware Swap', if he used that, he would have Franziska's body and she would have his, but he would be the only one to notice. If he did this the only thing he would have to do is look in the mirror and paint what he sees. The 'Shapeshift' button would provide a similar result. The only difference would be that people would see him as Franziska and there'd be a slight risk of Franziska finding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other button he could use was 'Possession', if he used that, he would take Franziska's body and his would act without him as if nothing happened. If Larry did this, he wouldn't even have to paint, he could have the second him paint for him! Of course there'd be the problem with that trial that Franziska was going to right now, but Larry was sure that he could just skip it if he took her body. What damage could missing one trial do anyway? It would be just like skipping school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter and extremely careful two seconds of thinking, Larry chose what button he would use. Which one did he press? </span></div></div>",

Franziska Von Karma was walking up the stairs of the court house, when she suddenly stopped in her tracks, a few seconds later she seemed to regain her composure, but for some reason she turned around and practically skipped down the steps and back into her car!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Franziska's car, Larry was looking in the rear view mirror with amazement, the remote had actually worked! He was actually inside her body! He could do whatever he wanted! Of course, the first thing on his to do list was get '<i>Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip'</i> done and painted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry's body now had a complete copy of himself in it, it had no knowledge of either the remote or why it was now standing on the sidewalk by the court house. It began to walk back to Larry's home when suddenly something out of the view happened. 'Franziska' drove up in 'her' car and began to talk to the Larry copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, cutie, want a ride?\" Larry in Franziska's body asked, Larry knew that Franziska would never say something like that to him, but as long as he had control of her voice he was going to have her say things he could dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Larry copy practically jumped into the car when offered. The Larry copy didn't say 'Thank you' per say, but it was nodding up and down rapidly with a huge smile on it's face, driven speechless. It was a perfect copy of Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Larry in Franziska's body drove the car toward Larry's house, he began to speak. \"You know Laurice, I'm very sorry. I don't know why I ever said no to modeling for such a great artist as yourself.\" Larry began to say \"Can you every forgive me? I'll model anything you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry's body's heart was practically beating out of it's chest! The duplicate in his body must have said 'Yes' at least a thousand times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry in Franziska's body was similarly excited, not only were his paintings going to get finished, but he was also going to be and to pose and model Franziska's body in any way he wanted! He wished he had someone he could share this with, that's when Larry realized, he did have someone he could share this with, himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second him in his body was still a person after all, the remote should still work for him. Larry could just explain to the second him what the remote is and how to use it. It could be really fun to have two, or maybe even three, of him possessing the bodies of people and having fun! After all, why have one girl model for you when you could have two?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, maybe he should wait to tell himself about the remote, if he got sidetracked and went on a body hunting spree for his duplicate, he could end up completely forgetting about the modeling and go off to do something else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Larry decided to</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to accidentally hurt himself. The best thing to do here was obviously test it out on other people. That way, if something bad happened, he wouldn't be involved! Of course, just because he chose to test it out on other people now didn't mean he wouldn't get in on the fun himself at a later time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Larry decided what to do he needed to figure out two other things. Where to go and what button on the remote to use. The question of what button to use was easy, since Larry wanted to get the most fun out of seeing people's reactions to a sudden body swap, so Aware Swap was the best option there. Now he just needed to know where to go. He decided that to make these swaps completely random her should swap people in completely different locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the first thoughts that came to mind was to go to the nearby film studio, Global studios. Global studios was full of actors. If he were to select an actor as his first target and then go somewhere else then he would be putting some random person in an actor's body, which could be fun to see. He could also use it on one of the studio staff and see how a random person would deal with being staff on on movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea that came to mind was to go to a nearby park. There were two parks nearby, People Park and Vitamin Square. While he had no idea what to specifically do or who he would find at either of those parks, but at the same time that added to the fun of things. He would have no idea who he was switching with who and he doubted that the people he was switching would know either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even if he didn't go to either of the locations, there were still plenty of other place in town that he knew about and could go to at anytime. Off the top of his head there was the Courtroom, the Circus, Tres Bien, Gourd Lake, Gatewater Land. The possibilities were endless! All he had to do was go there and use the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Larry go to test the remote?</span></div></div>",

Of course, it being the first thing that came to mind might be a good thing. There was probably plenty of interesting people at that studio, he would just have to look hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short walk toward the studio. Once he arrived, Larry was greeted by a closed gate. He tried negotiating with the guards to get through, but they wouldn't let him in. Apparently something big was being filmed today and the general public wasn't allowed inside. Of course, whether or not they let him in didn't matter to Larry, he could just sneak in or he could even use the possession function on the remote and just float into the studio, temporarily take someone's body, select the first target for his swap, and float out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Larry thought about what to do, a little kid ran by him and almost knocked him over. \"Hey, you jerkface!\" Larry yelled at the kid, using the biggest insult that he knew. Larry figured that because he was an adult, he should at least talk down to the kid, after all, there weren't many adults that Larry could talk down to \"If you're mean, a magical thing called karma will get you!\" Larry gave 'advice'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid turned toward Larry and stuck his tongue at him before turning around and continuing to run wherever he was going. Upon closer inspection, it seemed that the kid was sneaking into the studio. Larry had an idea, he could tell the guards that the kid was sneaking in the studio as revenge! As Larry began to walk toward the guards, another thought came to mind. He came here looking for the first person to use the remote on, why not use this kid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Larry's original plan was to use someone in the studio itself as his first subject, did he really want to use this kid? He didn't have much time to think about it though, the kid was starting to sneak in and would be out of sight soon. What did Larry do?</span></div></div>",

He had already crossed the film studio off of his list of place to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he racked his mind for places to go, he made special effort to think of a place that the kid who he had selected would feel out of place. That's when it hit him, the Courthouse! Everyone in the courthouse always acted all professional and boring like. No kid would fit in there!

The stuff in the room must have been small though, he was taller than both the potted plant and the couch in the room and he was on eye level with a painting on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cody stood still, trying to figure out how he got into this room, a security guard suddenly walked up to him. Cody raised his arm up in shock as the guard walked up to him, but as he did, something long in his hand swung and hit the guard. It seemed to be a whip. Cody knew he wasn't carrying a whip around before, how did he pick this up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard was obviously in pain from the whip, but he still talked to Cody. \"Ms. Von Karma, the trial's about to begin, you're needed in the courtroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms?! Do I look like a girl...to...you?\" Cody began yelling at the guard, but his voice got weaker to more he heard his voice, that wasn't his voice! He looked down at himself and what he saw practically terrified him. This wasn't his body! He was panicking too much to get a good look, but this was definitely a girl's body! He was wearing girl's clothes, his whole body felt different, and as he looked down this lady's hair went into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cody was freaking out, Larry walked up to him. \"Good luck out there 'Franzy', I'll be rooting for you!\" Larry said, holding back laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked at Larry's face and nearly screamed \"You're that loser who was at the studio!\" It didn't exactly take much brain power for Cody to put two and two together \"What did you do to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cody can get any answers from Larry, another person came up to him \"Ms. The Judge is waiting for you, this will have to wait until after the trial.\" The person said and practically dragged Cody into the courtroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I goofed up.\" Larry said, now that the kid knew that he had caused to swap, he'd probably come to him for answers \"Unless.\" Larry said with a devious grin as he pointed the remote at himself and clicked the possession button. <i>'I doubt Maya would mind if I was her til the end of the trial.'</i> Larry thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Global Studios, Franziska was being carried out by security guards. \"Get your hands off me! I am Franziska Von Karma and I will make you pay for this disgrace.\" She yelled, but was ignored. She had no idea how she had ended up in the body of a small boy, but she swore she would find out and make whoever is responsible pay</span></div></div>",

The first of which was the Steel Samurai, warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo, The second was a rabbit character in a children's exercise show, and the third was the strangest of all, the Pink Princess. While Will was plenty capable of playing these roles, he felt he was unsuited for them. More specifically, he thought his physical appearance was unsuited to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was an extremely kindhearted man, but you would never guess that from his face. His face would always give off the wrong impression to other people, and in the case of children, would often scare people. That is why he felt unsuited to the television roles he played. He knew that many children looked up to the characters he played, and he didn't want these children to be upset when they found out who was under the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly that day, Will had received a package. The package was labeled as Fan-Mail. Due to the type of shows that Will worked on the things he usually received as fan-mail were knick-knacks and small arts n crafts things that children made, which Will treasured regardless of their quality. However, what he had received today was extremely odd. It appeared to be some kind of remote and manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick read through of the manual revealed that the remote was some kind of 'Body Swapper', although it also had other functions such as Possession and Shapeshifting, what was written in the manual was completely absurd, but Will was a gullible guy and believed what was written in the manual was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave some thought on what to do with the remote, but it didn't exactly take him long to figure out what he wanted to do with it. He wanted to use the remote to get a body that the children of the world wouldn't be afraid of. The Steel Samurai should look like a handsome man, the Pink Princess should be a beautiful woman, the big rabbit should look like....well, something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't like he could have three bodies at once and have a perfect body for all three roles at the same time, as far as he knew. He would have to focus on getting a good body for one role right now. It wasn't like he was going to be stuck in whatever body he took forever, he could go back to his own body at anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat role did Powers focus on getting a good body for?</span></div></div>",

Ever since the big trial of the ringmaster's murder, the circus had gotten a big boost in profits. Apparently all that publicity from the murder had convinced a lot of people to visit the circus for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that free publicity could only bring them so far, every week Max and the other members of the circus were thinking of new ways to spice up their acts and generate interest in the audience. Although they had been successful in bringing in profits, it wasn't enough for Max. He wanted to make the Big Berry Circus the most fabulous circus in the world! He wouldn't be satisfied til it was a household name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he really needed right now was a new way to improve his magic act! Sure, the audience loved his fantastical flight around the tent and his amazing card tricks, but he needed something more! Something big! Something never done by any other magician! Max sighed, how was he supposed to think of an act like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's money counting was interrupted by a knock at the door. Who would be knocking this late at night? Max opened the door and to his surprise, no one was standing there. He was about to head outside, but he noticed something on the ground, a package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, one of my darling honeys must have dropped off some fan mail. They were probably to shy to hand it to me in person.\" Max justified the packages appearance as he picked it up and brought it inside his room. He put it on the table beside his money and opened it. Inside the package was a remote and a manual, Max's eyes widened as he read through the manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it! I've got my new got!\" Max shouted, probably loud enough for people staying in the other rooms at the circus to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote was allegedly some kind of 'Body Swapper' It had four buttons and a small screen. The four buttons were labeled 'Aware Swap', 'Unaware Swap', 'Possession', and 'Shapeshift', the manual described all of the buttons functions and each one of them seemed to be able to swap around or change the bodies of it's targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax couldn't believe what he was reading! With this thing he could have an act that no other magician could replicate and no viewer could explain. An act where he could manipulate and swap around the bodies of his audience! With every second he looked at the remote and manual, his brain began to work on what kind of act he could do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, before he could use it in an act, he had to find out whether or not it worked. He needed to test it. He should probably test it out right away, he was only a door away from his fellow performers, any one of them would be glad to let him test it on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even if it did work, he would need to explain that to all of his fellow performers in the circus and discuss the plan of his act and get all of their approval. He should probably wait until tomorrow to do that, no need to wake everyone up in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax couldn't wait to find out whether or not this remote worked, he would put the Big Berry Circus on the map with this!</span></div></div>",

His father was apparently giving up the gangster life and trying to convert the family into running an honest business, Wocky hated that idea. He wanted his family to keep living the gangster life no matter what. Apparently Wocky's father had also scheduled for all of them to have medical exams tomorrow, Wocky certainly wasn't looking forward to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wocky sat around at home being bored, he heard the sound of the doorbell ringing. He went downstairs to answer it, but was greeted by nothing more than a package. The package wasn't addressed to anyone, so Wocky took it up with him to his room. Once in his room he opened up the box and found a small remote and a set of instructions. According to the pamphlet, the device was a body swapping machine, capable of turning the user into someone else through a number of functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Wocky thought the remote sounded completely crazy, but, at the same time, he lived the gangster life, crazy was his middle name. He chose to believe in the remote for now. His mind filtered through the possibilities for it. The first thing to come to mind was to use it to convince his father to keep the family away from being a legitimate business, either by taking his father's body for a while or using someone else's body to convince him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis second idea had much less purpose, but was focused more on some fun he could have with the remote. He could try using it on his fiance Alita Tiala. He was madly in love with her and he was sure she felt the same way about him. He was sure she would't mind swapping bodies with him, or letting him borrow her body for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky knew that just sitting around his room thinking wouldn't do him any good, so he decided to use the remote to...</span></div></div>",

'Unaware Swap' would put them in each others bodies, but Wocky would be the only one who would notice it.

He looked out the window and saw Alita about to knock on the door to the Kitaki mansion. He stuck his arm out the window and aimed it at Alita before once again pressed the 'Aware Swap' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Wocky's entire viewpoint changed. He was no longer looking out the window of his room, he was looking at the door to his home! He looked down at himself, one look told him that the remote had worked! He was now in Alita's body! As he began to feel around and take stock of his body, he heard something hit the ground by him. He looked to his left and saw the remote on he ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the remote, he had a good idea what happened. When he swapped with Alita, he was sticking his arm out the window, once they swapped Alita probably wasn't expecting to be holding something and dropped the remote. Wocky looked over the remote, it didn't seem to be damaged at all, thankfully. The remote being on the ground gave him an idea. Alita had no idea how this swap happened, Wocky had planned to tell her after he swap, but now he waned to keep it a secret from her. If he kept it to himself he could have fun and swap with her at random times without her knowing how! He hid the remote in a nearby bush before he entered the home and headed up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he entered the room, he saw his body standing and looking at the door. The pose it was standing in made it clear Alita was in his body. \"Wocky, what happened?\" Alita asked, her voice was mostly scared, but there was a faint hint of anger in it that Wocky didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alita-baby. I switchero'd our bods!\" Wocky said with a smile, this was the first time he had spoken with Alita's voice and he enjoyed the feeling of someone else's voice leaving his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you swap us back now?\" Alita asked \"I can't stay in your body, it, it would be improper for your future wife to stay in your body for too long.\" to anyone else, this would seem like an excuse made within a few seconds, but Wocky believed she was being sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, babe. I'm a G! Improper is how I live!\" Wocky refused to swap back, they had only just swapped a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlita was panicking internally. Not just because Wocky had broken all laws of nature by swapping their bodies, but because of something much worse. She knew very well about Wocky's body's condition. half a year ago it was determined that he had half a year to live. He would be alive for at most a few weeks, maybe even less. If the fated time that the bullet moves to his heart happens while she was in his body....she didn't want to think about it. She needed to get him to swap them back, as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlita was about to say something to Wocky, when suddenly someone else entered the room. It was Wocky's mother, Plum Kitaki \"Ah, Alita, I didn't hear you come in.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Wocky a few seconds to realize that she was talking to him \"Ah, yeah, jus' got here a few seconds ago.\" He said, he tried his best to at least try to sound like Alita when talking to him mom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alita, since you will be my future daughter-in-law, I was hoping the two of us could go out today.\" Plum offered. Wocky rolled his eyes, he had no interest in hanging out with his mom, he was about to say no, when suddenly his mom slightly removed her sword from her broom \"Let's hurry now.\" She said, almost threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky followed his mom out of fear for his life. Leaving a similarly panicking for her life Alita behind</span></div></div>",

After his trial, he finally gotten the surgery he needed for the bullet trapped in his chest. However, it was a rather invasive process with a significant recovery time. He\u2019d been lying down for what felt like weeks and had lost a lot of weight too; he hadn\u2019t felt this bad since he got shot in the first place. The only shining light to come out of this was that the court seemed to turn a blind eye to his attempted assault of Dr. Meraktis in the wake of his operation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a court trial would at least be interesting. All he had to do at home was watch TV and read; it wasn\u2019t gangster at all! His parents backing out of the gang life made things all the more boring as well, even if he was starting to sympathize with their motives. <br>\r\nRing Ring Ring<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the doorbell, Wocky supposed. Deciding to test his legs, he pulled himself out of the bed and stood on the floor, wobbling a bit. \u201cAlright Wocky, just down the stairs and back\u2026\u201d he muttered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, no one else in the house managed to beat Wocky to the door. It was definitely strange, but Wocky figured his mom would get on his case for walking around anyways, so he was grateful for it.

In a split second, however, the her eyes fluttered and the broom clattered on the floor, replaced with a remote that suddenly appeared in her hands. She seemed off-balance, looking all bout the room before holding her hands up to her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Woah</i>!\" she cried out as she examined her thick arms. \"This is whack - it really worked!\" Plum - possessed by Wocky - turned her head downwards, looking over her whole self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky felt at the fabric of his mom's kimono, shocked to be wearing it. He wasn't just wearing the outfit, he was using her body. He ran a hand though her hair, pulling black and grey fabrics over his eyes. He patted down his waist and legs just to confirm his new proportions. Everything was different but one major thing was apparent: he was <i>heavy</i>. His mother's body was very wide, and she didn't have much of a chin either. However, despite her weight, Wocky knew for sure that her body felt a heck of a lot better right now than his did. The prospect of waiting out his recovery in another body became real and appealing all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbalanced, Wocky bent over and picked up the broom in his off hand, looking to the device in the other. \"It worked, for real! Ahahaha!\" He laughed with Plum's voice. It sounded a lot like her own characteristic chuckle. He put the device down on the table for a second, and used his freed hand to crack open the broom, revealing the sword underneath. He grinned as he saw the sheen of the metal. \"Well ain't no one gonna tell me what to do now,\" Wocky declared, \"I'm the boss-lady now, after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky didn't really have a plan in mind, he was just thrilled to have some freedom, even if he had to take his mom's body to get it. She was assertive and intimidating; people wouldn't boss her around! He looked back to the device for a moment. He supposed he would have to figure out what to do with that first. He could bring it with him, wherever he decided to go, but it might get in the way. He didn't have very many pockets at the moment, after all. He could likely find a safe place to hide it away in the house until he wanted to leave this body. However, Wocky had the suspicion he'd want to leave Plum's body soon enough anyways. His mother's body was novel, and he had the advantage of knowing things about her, but he felt it wouldn't be long before he found a better body to jump into. If he left the remote here, he'd likely be committing himself to this form longer than he'd prefer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat'd he do with the remote? </span></div></div>",

Not wanting to wait, he lumbered out the front door, glad to soak up some sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Finally, suffocating in there,\" he said to himself as he walked the grounds of the compound, taking a deep breath of the fresh air. Plum's body was heavy and slow, but she was atleast in good health. Wocky's body would've been winded just getting down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Still, outside isn't all that more exciting than inside. I got to find something to do,'</i> Wocky reasoned. With the remote, he could make any situation interesting so long as he had people. The first couple people to jump to mind were his legal team - Apollo and Trucy. They had barely visited him at all since his surgery! Some defenders they were. He bet it'd be fun messing around with them some as a bit of revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, he could just go anywhere in town and use the remote on random people. It had tons of settings and functions, after all. Not to mention, it'd be fun to try out new bodies while he was out and about.

He couldn\u2019t wait to see the look on Apollo\u2019s face as Plum walked into the office to castigate him for his negligence. After all, a lawyer\u2019s got a duty to ensure the well-being of their clients after all right? Shouldn\u2019t that count even after the verdict? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere to, Ma\u2019am?\u201d the cabby asked, weirding out Wocky a decent bit. He didn\u2019t really like the sound of \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo! That\u2019 \u2018sir\u2019 when you\u2019re speakin\u2019 to me,\u201d Wocky told him off, sounding ridiculous from his mother's body. He either didn't realize this or didn't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabby raised an eyebrow in confusion. \u201cEr, uh, sorry sir, where to?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky thankfully remembered the street name for the law office from a card Trucy had given him a while back. It was apparently the \u2018Wright Anything Agency\u2019. Thankfully, the driver recalled the location, and got Wocky there without much problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be $8,\u201d the driver said as Wocky pulled Plum\u2019s body out of the car.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cPffft, yeah right, not after that disrespect!\u201d Wocky spat back while awkwardly straightening out his body's kimono. \u201cGet outta here before I get my posse on you,\u201d Wocky yelled, turning around and leaving the driver confused and empty handed as Wocky approached the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease young lady, you must tell me how you perform this trick! I can\u2019t sleep at night with the curiosity gnawing away at me!\u201d As Wocky entered, he encountered a familiar face that he didn\u2019t expect to find: Wesley Stickler. He was the weirdo University student who was also outed as a panty thief at the trial. Specifically, he was outed as having stolen Trucy\u2019s panties\u2026 as well as Plum\u2019s. Wocky wasn\u2019t particularly fond of the man for this transgression, and he could fairly assume Plum wasn\u2019t either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said no! Magicians don\u2019t reveal their methods! Especially to weirdoes,\u201d Trucy replied, turning her head away as she cross her arms. Wocky could see that Apollo was also present looking over some papers while sitting, apparently blocking out Stickler and Trucy. \u201cNow if you can leave us alone, we have an important guest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right!\u201d Wocky pitched in. \u201cShut your mouth sick-o, I gotta word or two for Shorty and Mr. Law over there!\u201d Wocky said, gesturing towards Apollo in the corner. Apollo raised his head from the papers, suddenly at attention when his name was addressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Uh, hello, Mrs. Kitaki,\u201d Apollo said as he pulled himself up from the chair. \u201cHow are things? Is there anything we can help you with?\u201d He seemed nervous, which Wocky liked. When he was in his old body, Apollo only seemed annoyed. Finally some respect! Stickler also seemed nervous, shuffling around to put himself behind Trucy. It seemed he recognized a former victim of his \u2018curiosity\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky realized he had a colorful cast of people laid out in front of him. Aside from Apollo, Trucy, and Stickler, he also had Plum\u2019s body as a possible target for all sorts of mischief. Having authority was nice, and it'd be fun to keep up the act, but he could imagine a lot more possibilities if he pulled the remote now. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, why bother bringing it along with him otherwise?

Trucy blinked a few times from Wesley's body. Wesley, meanwhile, took a look downwards at himself, realizing all of a sudden how much shorter he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Th-th-that's me,</i>\" Trucy suddenly realized as her eyes settled upon her own body, which was busy scanning itself over. She reached out an arm to point, but recoiled in shock when she saw it wasn't really her own. \"Ack! How the- my voice?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo turned around towards 'Wesley', clearly annoyed. Wocky took the opportunity to catch him off guard, registering him with the 'switch' button. \"Look Wesley, I think it's time you went home. Mrs. Kitaki probably-\" He didn't get a chance to finish as Wocky clicked the switch button again behind him, this time aimed at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Apollo suddenly said, his perspective suddenly switching. He was standing behind... someone? Everything felt heavy to him and he wasn't sure why. \"What just...?\" He trailed off as he heard his voice, definitely not sounding like it usually did. He looked down, his of his own feet blocked by Plum's chest. <i>'I think I'm going to faint.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right a Apollo realized he had something in his hands that the person in front of him turned around. Trucy was shouting by this point, demanding her body back. Wesley, for his own part, seemed more entranced than anything. Wocky's jaw just about dropped though when he saw his own face staring at him, a cocky grin accompanying it. His body didn't say anything but merely reached out, attempting to swipe away the device from Apollo's much smaller hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo instinctively pulled away, holding the remote up high. He didn't know why but he felt it was important. \"Yo! Give me that!\" his own voice shouted, as it reached up to pry the device away. Apollo tried to fight back, but he didn't have any sense of balance, and found himself tumbling backwards. The device clattered on the floor next to him. Wocky as Apollo snatched it up, quickly stowing it away in his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sick-o!\" He suddenly shouted, addressing Trucy-as-Wesley. \"Leave Shorty alone and go help the old lady here out, alright?

Apollo, it's me, Trucy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, and I'm a gangster,\" Wocky replied, snickering to himself. \"Now get outta here for real though and take her with you, before I change my mind,\" He said, gesturing his thumb towards Apollo and the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated and frightened look on Wesley's face, Trucy inched towards Apollo-as-Plum and struggled to pull him from the floor. \"Come on, uh, Ms. Kitaki, we should go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, wait, how did...?\" Apollo mumbled, equally taken aback as he was escorted out the door. When it shut, Wocky gave a victorious smile, idly turning his hair as as he looked over to Wesley-as-Trucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh, what's next, Mr. Justice,\" Wesley awkwardly asked, a sheepish grin on Trucy's face. </span></div></div>",

Wesley didn't seem to mind having nothing to do, he was far too interested with his new body. Wocky also began to take stock of his new body. While his mom's body was definitely better than his own, he still felt off due to the different gender and body shape. Apollo's body on the other hand felt much more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky's thinking was interrupted by a loud crashing sound on the other side of the room. He turned around to see Wesley in Trucy's body searching through a pile of Magic tricks and trinkets on the ground. \"The hell was that noise?!\" Wocky practically yelled in Apollos voice. <i>'Woah, Lawyer-man's voice is loud' </i>Wocky thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stood up in surprise at 'Apollo's' shouting. \"I was just inquiring the location of one of my magic tricks when the large assemblage of trinkets fell over.\" Wesley explained. He put a cheerful tone to his voice in an attempt to sound like Trucy, but his large vocabulary and way of speaking sounded incredibly odd with Trucy's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky had a feeling he knew exactly what 'Magic Trick' Wesley was looking for. Although he chose not to confront him about that. Wocky thought about what to do next, however before he could think of anything he heard a cellphone ringing. After hearing it ring for a few seconds, he realized that it was 'his' phone ringing. He pulled Apollo's phone out of his pocket. \"What?\" He snapped as he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person on the other end of the phone wasn't someone Wocky knew, but their voice sounded like that of an older man \"Hey Apollo, come down to the detention center. There's someone asking for you. It's a small case, but who knows, if you do a really good job you <i>might</i> actually get paid.\" The man on the other side of the phone joked before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the thought of doing Apollo's job for him wasn't the most appealing to Wocky, he didn't exactly have much else to do. So he may as well do it. Wocky was about to tell Wesley to come with him, when he suddenly heard another phone ringing. Although this one had a much more girlish ringtone. It must have been Trucy's. It was clear that Wesley was to focused searching through Trucy's stuff to hear the phone. \"Hey! You gonna answer that?!\" Wocky yelled toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Wocky yell, Wesley went over to a table in the middle of the room where Trucy's phone was placed. He answered it nervously \"H-Hello?\" He said. Wocky couldn't hear the entire phone conversation, but from Wesley's reactions, he put together what the call meant. Trucy had a magic show today. Wocky couldn't help but smile at the thought of Wesley in Trucy's body doing a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the phone call had ended Wesley turned to Wocky and said \"I have a Magic show today, I h-have to go and get ready.\" Wesley said as he made his way toward the door. It seemed that all the joy he had at being in Trucy's body had turned into nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Wesley had left Wocky pulled out Apollo's wallet and looked through it for his address. He was going to be doing his job, but he was definitely not going to be wearing a suit all day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wesley was panicking internally as he made his way to the show venue. It was some kid's birthday or something apparently. Wesley honestly had no idea how to be a stage magician. Sure, he had spent a lot of time STUDYING how magic tricks were done, out of academic curiosity, but he didn't possess the dexterity to pull most of them off! He didn't have a lot of confidence in his showmanship either. Trucy was loud and personable, while Wesley himself was usually pretty quiet and reserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he had to atleast present SOME effort at being Trucy. He had no idea HOW they swapped, but he didn't want to give himself away yet. He needed to find out her secrets, after all! He'd worry about getting back to his body later; a true man of learning would pursue this experience for all it was worth! Jittering with nervousness, he made his way to People Park, where the party was being held. When he got there he was at least thankful that Trucy's equipment had been dropped off ahead of time. <i>'Wait, no. If it wasn't here I could call it off!'</i> he realized. Either way, he had to perform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing on to the stage, he stared owl-eyed down at the audience looking to him expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello,\" he said to the people owl-eyed. \"I am Trucy, a magician. I have come here to entertain you with my legerdemain, illusions, and other various forms of tricks and showmanship. I hope this is amusing to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear the kids and some of the adults muttering to eachother in the audience. <i>\"What is she talking about... is she okay? ...I don't know what those words mean.\"</i> He suspected he was already messing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, for my first trick, I will make an item seem to vanish from your sight,\" he explained, as he reached for an item from the crate. He hoped he could pull this off. Maybe Trucy's body would have the reflexes to make it work? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Examine this card!\" He explained, pulling the ace of spades from the top of the deck. \"I will shuffle this into the deck, and upon examination, it will seemingly have disappeared from all existence!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prayed for his and Trucy's sake that this body worked for him as he began to shuffle through the cards up, looking down on the confused and murmuring crowd. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Wesley shuffled the deck of cards, his hands slipped and accidentally sent the cards flying everywhere. The audience whispered among themselves about 'Trucy's' failed trick. Wesley's panicking intensified as it sunk in that Trucy's body's natural reflexes wouldn't be able to help him with this magic show. Attempting to fix the situation he tried to transition to the next trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, now let me introduce you all to the 'Amazing Mr. Hat'!\" Wesley said. It wasn't hard to figure out that the mechanism for activating Mr. Hat was behind Trucy's coat. However, what Wesley didn't expect was for Mr. Hat to come out so fast and with so much force. The combination of the shock and the force of the wooden puppet caused Wesley to fall over. The short dress that Trucy was wearing made the position Wesley fell into look even more unprofessional to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stood back up and attempted to do the trick again. However it was clear he had no ventriloquist skills, he needed to open his mouth as wide as he could to say some of the large words in his vocabulary and whenever he did try to close his mouth his sentences came off more as muffled humming than actual words. Eventually he gave up all together<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the 'show' went on similar to that. Wesley would try tricks, only to mess them up horribly. It didn't take long for the audience to start booing him and demanding that he get off the stage. It didn't take much convincing for Wesley to obey. He doubted that these people would ever hire Trucy again after his horrible excuse for a performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wesley packed up the magic tricks he had taken out during the show he suddenly realized something. He quickly began to look through the box of tricks and trinkets that Trucy had prepared for the show and he soon found what he had been looking for. \"Yes! The elusive magical panties!\" He yelled aloud. Trucy must have brought them here in advance for the show, which would explain why he didn't find them when he was searching the agency in Trucy's body earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had completely botched the magic show, he had still got something out of it. Now that he had them, all he had to do was figure out how the Magic Panties trick worked. Satisfied, Wesley began to make his way back to the Wright Anything Agency to study the panties. Unfortunately for him, as he began to leave People Park he encountered someone, who was it?</span></div></div>",

He could barely get up; everything felt so heavy and unbalanced. <br>\r\n\"Come on, uh, Ms. Kitaki, we should go,\u201d the voice was Wesley\u2019s but something seemed a bit off to the tone. Wesley extended a hand to help Apollo up, but Apollo wasn\u2019t sure why he was addressing Mrs. Kitaki as he did it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, wait, how did...?\" As he rose to his new feet, realization began to overtake him. He was Mrs. Kitaki. His own body, whoever was operating it, didn\u2019t seem to care, and merely gave a smirk and a wave as \u2018Wesley\u2019 walked him out the door and down the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs uh, everything alright?\u201d Wesley asked when they reached a streetcorner, looking distinctly uncomfortable. Apollo didn\u2019t piece together why though; Wesley had good cause to be afraid of Plum after all. Apollo wasn\u2019t too fond of the guy, so he decided he\u2019d leverage that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yes! Just go!\u201d He yelled in a frazzled tone, shaking a fat arm at \u2018Wesley\u2019 who ran off in shock. Apollo sighed, and leaned against the bus stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018[i]What on earth am I supposed to do now? This shouldn\u2019t be possible! I\u2019m just dreaming all this, right?![/i]\u2019 While his body wasn\u2019t acting normal, it didn\u2019t seem like Plum was in it. Could he really just go back and confront\u2026 himself? Trucy and anyone else watching would think he was nuts if he called himself a body thief! He gave his new form another look down, realizing he couldn't even see Plum's feet from this angle. How was he going to adapt to this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Apollo know, it was Wocky who was using his body, and had swapped him into his mother\u2019s possessed body. Were there any adverse effects since Apollo was swapped into a body that still had an occupant? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t move anything!\u2019</i> The voice rumbled again. Apollo could feel some slight pressure on his arms, like they were trying to move, but he managed to keep them still through his own will. It seemed he still had dominant control, but someone else was in this body with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d Apollo asked aloud, looking around, suddenly nervous. Was someone watching him? He couldn\u2019t interact like this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018It\u2019s me, P-plum! Or, well you!\u2019</i> The voice, distinctly feminine, continued. \u2018[i]Why is there another me in my body?![i]\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. \u201cYou mean, you\u2019re in here with me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Of course! Who is this? Give me my body back!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only raised a million more questions for Apollo. Why was he in Plum\u2019s body, and if she was in there with him, then who had taken his own body? For now though, he knew that if he kept talking to the air like this, he\u2019d make Mrs. Kitaki look like a crazy person, he had to find somewhere private to keep up this conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know how I got here,\u201d Apollo explained, \u201cbut its me, Mr. Justice!

Who knows what might have happened to my family! I don't even know how long it's been.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Apollo by surprise. She wasn't conscious when she came into the office? Someone else really must have been using her body then, which was worrying. Was that person in his body now? If so, then why was he now conscious in Plum's? It was all pretty confusing to wrap his head around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Mr. Justice! I demand you get me home this instant! I need to make sure my family is okay!</i>' Apollo didn't really want to go to Kitaki Manor, it felt like it'd be a detour to him. What if the person who was in his body was running amok right now? Still, Mrs. Kitaki was right to worry about her family, who knows what this person did in her body. Not to mention, it might yield some clues. He had a sneaking suspicion as to what who was using Plum's body back at the office, but a lawyer always needed evidence to prove their claims. It wasn't like he was in much a place to confront them alone anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned, Apollo hailed a cab and had the driver take him down to Kitaki manor, which was temporarily his home. This seemed to placate Plum, who didn't make more noise along the way, opting to keep her thoughts to herself. Apollo opted to do the same and ignored the driver's attempts at small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Okay, we can talk now Mr. Justice,</i>' Plum said as they entered the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo shook his head. \"I need to check Wocky first,\" Apollo said firmly. \"Where would he be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's on the second floor,' Plum replied. She seemed to agree with Apollo's decision, although her reason was more for concern than suspicion. Apollo trudged up the steps, with a hand clenched tightly around the safety rail to keep his balance. Every movement in Plum's body just felt like he was bouncing. She was so heavy that he was throwing her weight around constantly, he couldn't imagine who would want to steal her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he made it up the steps without tripping, and Plum guided him to Wocky's room. Apollo slowly lifted a hand and knocked on the door, \"Uh, Wocky. Are you in there?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a cough on the other side of the door. \"Yeah mom,\" a quiet voice replied, \"I'm fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo turned the door knob, going in to the room to find a sickly looking Wocky sitting at the side of his bed. \"What's up? Need somethin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I just wanted to make sure you were okay, uh, son,\" Apollo mumbled in the most motherly tone he could muster. \"Do you need anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah nothin' right now. Where'd you go earlier, by the way?\" Wocky asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, just went to the park for a walk,\" Apollo lied. There was a moment of quiet. \"Just, yell if you need me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing mom, I'm going back to sleep.\" With that he plopped himself back down in bed and threw a sheet over him as Apollo-in-Plum left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Apollo didn't understand. Wocky was really still in his body? He wasn't acting weird, other than being thinner than before. Who on earth was that at the office then? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh thank heavens he's alright! It'd be horrible if something happened right after the surgery!</i>' Plum exclaimed. Apollo was reminded of Wocky's operation to get a bullet removed from his chest a while back. That must've been why he seemed so weak, he was likely still recovering. He didn't seem to be acting like a different person at all though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Now, before we do anything else, we need to share our stories,</i>' Plum said. '<i>I need you to tell me everything you remember today! We need to get you out of my body as soon as possible!</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo gave a nod in agreement. Hopefully one of them had an important detail that could lead them in the right direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's all that happened to me until you started talking at the bus stop,\" Apollo finished explaining, seemingly to no one, as the two sequestered themselves away in Plum and Winfred's bedroom. Apollo was very uncomfortable being in the couple's room, it felt like an instruction, but he supposed that Plum's mind gave him permission at the very least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Well, we need to find your body again,</i>' Plum replied. '<i>It pulled something out of our hand, right? Maybe that was important! If we can catch him by surprise, maybe we'll find it</i>.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense in principle, but it wasn't like they really had a body equipped for such an encounter. \"Are you sure we can do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Ugh! Don't be a weakling. Do you even know who I am? Go find my broom, and I think he'll crack.</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a worrying suggestion. After all, it was still Apollo's body! If they hurt it, he'd have to deal with the consequences. He didn't want Plum screaming at him in his brain anymore though, so cowed to her order. He opened the bedroom door and...</span></div></div>",

With how horrible he felt in this body, even if he did confront the person who was currently in his body, he didn't know what he would do. They could easily just push him out of the office again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to Apollo, he could go and get some help in confronting the body thief. While he was sure that most people would think he was crazy, he was sure he could prove to some of close friends who he really was. He could head straight to the office right now and try to convince Trucy right now, he didn't know if she was either aware or affected by whatever had caused him to swap bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he had other friends he could go to and ask for help, a few that came to mind were Clay and Vera. Of course it may be a bit hard to convince them who he was, but he was sure he could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did he go to for help?</span></div></div>",

Vera was more shy and withdrawn. Despite her anxiety though, he felt like he'd probably have an easier time getting her on his side.

It was going to take a long time to explain what had happened, and it would be incredibly awkward and embarrassing as well. He\u2019d rather get this all done with and move on. Therefore, he settled on Vera. She was more withdrawn, but at the same time a bit more agreeable. She\u2019d keep quiet when the whole thing was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was well acquainted with Vera\u2019s home thankfully, since it had been a crime scene not that long ago. He drowned out Mrs. Kitaki\u2019s protests and eventually she went silent. He worried that she was probably plotting her revenge during this time, but it was something he would have to deal with later. He needed to leave this body, hopefully she\u2019d come to understand.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was a long and tiring walk to Vera\u2019s home. His legs hurt, and he could feel the sweat on Plum\u2019s back as he breathed heavily. By the time he got there, the sun was hanging low. He needed to act before the body thief did something else to throw him off his tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVera, are you home? This is important!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent. The Misham home was dead enough as it was, but it had only been exacerbated after Vera\u2019s father was killed. She was a lonely person already, and was hesitant to meet new people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVera, please! Apollo sent me!\u201d He hoped that would get her attention as he continued knocking. The door then cracked open slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVera! Thank God, I need your help.

Furthermore, her outfit was different too. She had grabbed a white tanktop from somewhere and had thrown a blue jacket overtop it. Her jeans seemed looser and cut up as well, one hand vacantly in her pocket. She eyed Apollo with a mixture of shock and suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! What do you want from me?\" She asked roughly, catching Apollo off-guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, er,\" Apollo stumbled and muttered, not sure what was happening. She was never this confrontational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well? Is <i>this</i> really who you thought could help us?'</i> Plum asked from within their head, obviously annoyed. <i>'You just wasted both our time!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?!

But I need your help! What's wrong with you right now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera suddenly seemed relieved for some reason, giving a smirk and then a laugh in response. \"<i>HA</i>! What, really? That's why you're here? You want me to help? Hmmmm.\" he put a hand to her chin, as though in deep thought. Apollo was beginning to get really worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, 'Apollo', come on in,\" Vera said, turning around and heading back in, gesturing with her hand. \"Must've been a long walk after all, you need to sit down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo hesitantly followed behind her with Plum's body, and took a seat on the living room couch. He didn't really <i>want</i> to sit, but he was far too exhausted to keep standing. Vera threw herself down on a chair on the opposite side. Her position wasn't very ladylike, her legs splayed out and her arms behind her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vera, before I go on, are you feeling...okay?\" Apollo felt like he had an inkling as to what was happening here, although he didn't want to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera gave a snicker, \"well...\"</span></div></div>",

Ya hear me?\" They said, trying to get a reaction from Apollo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo had a vague idea of who was in Vera's body, but what he saw back at Kitaki manor went against this idea. \"Who are you and why are you in Vera's body?\" Apollo asked in a demanding way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Vera' rubbed the back of her head, seemingly disappointing, but then a smile appeared on 'her' face \"C'mon Lawyer man, can't you tell? It's me, the OG of your law career, Wocky Kitaki!\" Wocky said and crossed his arms, which looked very odd from Vera's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was going to say something, but he couldn't think straight with Mrs. Kitaki screaming internally <i>'Oh no! My little boy is stuck in the body of some strange girl! We need to find whoever's doing this and get him back to normal!'</i> While Mrs. Kitaki was convinced that Wocky was a victim of the same person who put her and Apollo in the same body. However, Apollo had a different thought of Wocky's role in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you do all of...this?\" Apollo said, not having any word to describe the situation other than 'this'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Jus' what make ya think I did this?\" Wocky said. He was pretending to be offended by the accusation, but he wasn't that very good of an actor, Apollo could tell right away that he did it, but he chose to present his evidence anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Trucy both had suspicions when <i>'Mrs Kitaki'</i> showed up at the agency. She wasn't acting anything like herself. We were going to confront <i>'her'</i> on it, but before we could I was suddenly put into her body and before I could even react my own body was pushing me out of my own office.\" Apollo began his case by recapping the events that occurred earlier at the agency. \"Then, when I was outside I heard Mrs. Kitaki's voice in my head, she said that her own body had been taken and she had no memory of anything that happened all day.\" He then went over what had happened outside the office. \"That would mean, whoever the body thief was had access to inside Kitaki manor! The only people that leaves to be the thief are you and your dad, and unlike you, he doesn't have a motive!\" Apollo pointed his finger at Wocky, however with Plum's huge arms, he felt it didn't have as much impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! A'ight I'll bite, why would I want to take my mom's huge body?\" Wocky said, he was feigning confidence, but Apollo could tell from the sweat on his forehead that he was getting nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy. You were bedridden after your surgery, you could barley move! So you went and took the closest body, your mother's! I don't know how you did it, but you're the only one with a motive!\" Apollo finished his case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky was taken back by how Apollo figured this all out, but he kept his cool. Couldn't have his G image ruined afterall. \"A'ight, you got me I did, But I a'int tellin' you how I did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was going to reply, but suddenly he felt his control of Mrs. Kitaki's body slip from him. \"Wocky!\" Plum yelled, now having regained control. \"You are going to return everything to normal this instant and when we get home, you are going to be in so much trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky laughed \"Man, lawyer man, you're even sounding like my Mom now.\" Once he was done laughing he looked at Plum's face and realized from her expression, that wasn't Apollo, that was actually his mom. \"Oh no.\" He said, his facial expression changed as he began to panic for the first time since Apollo got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum's angry expression disappeared as Apollo regained control of the body. \"Listen to your mother, Wocky\" was all he had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Apollo was back in control, Wocky began to beg. \"You gotta help me out here lawyer ma- Apollo. Ya got no idea what Mom's like when she's mad!\" it seemed that Apollo was unfazed with Wocky's begging, so Wocky made an offer \"I'll s-s-share the body swapping thingy with you, ya can have any body you want, anytime! Ya jus' gotta help me find a way to get away from my mom until she calms down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Apollo knew that it was actually Wocky, he was in Vera's body, he could help but feel compelled to help Vera. Also, he couldn't deny that he was curious to find out about, and possibly use, whatever Wocky had used to do all of this. At the same time however, Apollo was already on Mrs. Kitaki's bad side, and he wasn't sure if he should make her even madder.</span></div></div>",

She's your mother after all, you can't avoid her forever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need forever man, just a week or so!\" Wocky replied, giving a wry smile with Vera's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Mr. Justice I swear the moment I get my hands on you, it will be the last thing you ever-'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo wasn't sure exactly how he did it, but he shut his eyes tightly and clamped down all his concentration on the part of his mind that Mrs. Kitaki was using. Suddenly, Mrs. Kitaki just went silent. Apollo kept his eyes closed for a moment, before opening them slowly. As far as he could tell, Plum's consciousness had been suppressed for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo?\" Wocky asked nervously from the chair, leaning forward in suspense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its me,\" Apollo replied, suddenly feeling like a pressure had been lifted from Plum's body. If he had to guess, their consciousnesses both sharing one body probably put undue strain on it. Even when they weren't trying to, one of them was probably putting some resistance on the other. \"I think I've put your mom 'to sleep' for now, but I don't know how long that will last. Now are you going to tell me what's going on or not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Alright, well, I guess I owe you twice now, Law-man,\" Wocky exclaimed, back to his old self now that the tension was broken. Thrilled to be safe, Wocky began to detail his whole day out to Apollo, beginning with finding the remote and using the possession function. He then detailed how he had used his mother's body to get over to the law office to steal Apollo's body. He decided to leave out the fact that he gave Trucy's body to Wesley though; he didn't want to have Apollo turn on him <i>now</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are you Vera all of a sudden?\" Apollo asked, wanting to know what happened to the real Vera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boss said I should go visit her,\" Wocky replied, shrugging. \"I didn't really care to listen to him, but when he mentioned a babe was involved I figured I'd check it out! I liked what I saw, so I left your bod and took hers! Shame you and my mom came by and had to ruin it though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was definitely disturbed by how casually Wocky was willing to take over someone's life, but he had to admit he was just a bit curious as well. He didn't care much for Plum's body, but that was largely because she was older and heavier, and also he wasn't <i>expecting</i> to become her. If he knew he could turn back to normal whenever he wanted, it'd be a lot less stressful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'm definitely not going to be able to stay in Vera here much longer,\" Wocky continued, running a hand wistfully through Vera's long hair. \"Mom knows I'm here now, so I'm going to have to float along and go somewhere she won't find me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll let me use the remote first though, right?\" Apollo asked, reminding Wocky of their deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! Right. Who's bod do you want then? You could head back to being your own boring self, or you could try out someone new. Vera here is pretty cracking! I'd recommend it, but I guess I can get it if you don't want one that's already been 'used', so to speak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo thought it over. It wasn't really right to take someone's body the way Wocky was, but it could be a valuable learning experience, right? If Wocky had used the possession function to take Vera's body, then that meant Apollo's original body was just on auto-pilot now. He could take a vacation while it handled his work for him. Besides, if he just went back to being himself, who would keep an eye on Wocky? </span></div></div>",

First though, I need to use it, to find somewhere to lay low for a while. So I'll need you to point it at me and press the 'possession' option.\" Wocky put the device in Apollo's - technically Plum's - small hands and pointed towards the proper function to use. \"Once you click that, Vera will be back to normal, so I'd suggest making yourself scarce quick! I don't think she'll be happy to see some strange lady sitting in her living room after all. Get my mom far away and then use possession on yourself, should fix you up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo looked up at Wocky uncertain. \"And whose body will you be taking?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky seemed to think at this. \"Dunno yet! I'll figure that out. You'll have the remote though, so I'll need to come to you when I find one. Whose body do you have in mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo mulled his options over. Who would he pick? He supposed Vera herself would be the closest choice. It felt a bit wrong to take her body right after Wocky had just stolen it himself, but he was curious. Maybe he could help her out better if he understood her more? Otherwise, he had a list of people he knew that he could choose from. Trucy was right back at the office, so he could keep an eye on his own body, and the same could be said for Mr. Wright as well. If he wanted to avoid Plum though, he could also pick from any other acquaintance he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be in...\"</span></div></div>",

Ema was a friend of his, although he'd be lying if he said that he knew her well. Perhaps if he became her he could get to know her better? Plus, he was tempted to try out being a detective for a little while. While he did feel a bit bad about possessing Ema and taking over her life, he got over the guilt by telling himself it was only temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I know who I want to become.\" Apollo told Wocky<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took ya long enough, so, who you gonna be?\" Wocky asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend of mine called Ema.\" Apollo went on to explain what Ema looked like so Wocky could find him later, however it soon became clear that his description of her wasn't going to help. \"Just meet me at People Park in a few hours, I'll be the girl wearing the labcoat.\" Apollo explained to Wocky. It was a bit strange to he that he would 'be the girl' but, after this long day, nothing seemed that strange anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'kay, I can remember that. Now get me out of here before my Mom 'Wakes up' again.\" Wocky said, ready to go out and possess another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo approached the door to Vera's home, pointed the remote at Wocky in Vera's body and clicked the possession button. He then quickly opened the door and left, leaving behind a confused Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo then began to walk away from Vera's home, he had no particular destination in mind, but he wanted to get Mrs. Kitaki as far away from Vera's home. He knew that when he left Mrs. Kitaki's body she would go to Vera's home to confront 'Wocky'. Apollo wanted Vera to at least get over the shock of being in the clothes that Wocky had dressed her in and the fact that she won't remember part of her day before Mrs. Kitaki came to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Apollo was at People Park, he had walked a good way across town and was now exhausted. He figured that this was far enough and then proceeded to point the remote at himself. In a instant he was above Mrs. Kitaki's body and was in some sort of Ghost-like form. He looked down at Mrs. Kitaki, she was confused at first, but that confusion was soon replaced by anger as she stormed off in the direction of Vera's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in this ghost form, Apollo floated through the park. He realized his mistake of choosing to possess Ema, he had no idea where she lived or where she would even be this time of day. He figured that he should at least look around People Park for her and hope that he found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, through the most improbable of coincidences, Ema was at people park. She didn't seem to be investigating a crime. Apollo quickly flew into her body and possessed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, all Apollo saw was darkness, but soon his senses began to come back. He tasted something in his mouth, he soon realized what it was and spit it out. \"Ugh, how does she eat these things?\" Apollo said as he wiped some lingering Snackoos off of his tounge. He threw away the opened and half eaten Snackoo bag in a nearby trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was done dealing with the Snackoos, he looked down at his new body. After spending most of the day as Mrs. Kitaki, he was happy to be in any body that was semi-athletic, Although it did feel strange to still be female. Thankfully, Ema's clothes were pretty unisex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's attention was once again grabbed as he heard a voice yell out \"Yo lawyer man! That you?\" he heard someone yell right by him. It didn't take much imagination to figure out that that was Wocky. Apollo looked over to see who Wocky had possessed, he saw that the body that Wocky had currently possessed was...</span></div></div>",

A few feet away was a young man with blonde hair, that went past his neck and curled into a drill past his shoulder. Klavier Gavin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You know how to pick a nice one, eh law man? Or should I say law-girl?\" Wocky asked with an annoying grin as he twirled a finger around Klavier's hair. It was like Apollo's two least favorite people had fused into one extremely annoying person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo considered pretending he had no idea what Wocky was talking about, but realized he wouldn't be able to pull that off. He already told Wocky he'd be wearing a labcoat, and it suddenly occurred to him that the device had materialized in Ema's hand as he took her body. \"Y-yeah. It's me, Wocky,\" Apollo replied, trying to mask his disgust. '<i>Please let me out of here soon...</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Guess I know your type now. She was the cop back in the case, right?\" Wocky asked. He probably knew the answer to that as he continued talking anyways. \"I recognized this pretty-boy as the g-man who prosecuted me! Figured he could let me use his body as payback. You see his bike yet? It's pretty sick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo shook his head. \"No not really. I was just going to give you the device and go for now,\" he said, trying to make an excuse to leave. He wanted access to the remote, but he didn't really know if that was worth sustained interaction with Wocky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, lighten up!\" Wocky shot back, suddenly moving in close and throwing an arm over 'Ema's' shoulder. Apollo could feel every hair standing on end, bristling at the violation of personal space. \"'Sides, if we split up then one of us might get stuck! Wouldn't want that now, would we? Come with me and we can find something fun to do! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo reflexively threw Wocky's arm off of him and awkwardly shuffled a few feet away. \"Do you even know how to drive a motorcycle?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! What kinda G don't know his way around a bike? C'mon law-girl you'll need a better excuse than that!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the short time that Wocky had the remote today, he had not only hoped into multiple bodies himself, but he had also swapped around other peoples bodies. If he was left alone again, he may cause even more havoc and confusion. Not to mention, if Wocky went into a different body, Apollo would have no way of finding him later when he wanted out of Ema's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine. Where is the bike?\" Apollo asked, his bitter tone to the situation made him sound like how Ema normally sounded around Klavier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Knew you'd come around, follow me Law-Girl!\" Wocky gestured for Apollo to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the motorcycle came into view, Apollo realized what riding together on the motorcycle with Wocky meant. There was only one seat, they'd have to share. Apollo was screaming internally. Why was nothing turning out well for him today?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky was clearly enjoying Apollo misery as he pulled out the keys from Klavier's pocket. \"I'll be the one drivin'\"  He said as he hoped on the bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo decided to suck it up and get the ride over with as soon as possible. He got on the bike and held onto Wocky's/Klavier's shoulders. There were two ways Apollo could think about this, either he was holding onto Wocky or he was holding onto Klavier. Which one was worse was a philosophical question that Apollo would have to think about some other time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of what seemed to be driving around aimlessly, Apollo asked Wocky the obvious question \"Where are we even going?\" He asked, patience running thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky seemed to pause to think briefly before he answered......</span></div></div>",

Apollo himself launched Vera's body forward in an attempt to snatch the remote as well, attempting to push Wocky-as-Plum's heavier form aside.

She seemed to be thinking. Apollo figured that she was mentally talking to Wocky in the same way that he had been talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUm, Mrs. Kitaki?\u201d Apollo said, hoping that he hadn\u2019t just interrupted her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can I use the remote? I need to get back to my own body.\u201d He said, stretching out a hand,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unfortunately, Mrs. Kitaki pulled the remote away.\"No.\" She began. \"If me and my precious Wocky are going to have suffer with this out of body experience. Then you'll have to suffer with us.\" She put the remote into her sleeve. \"No one is going to use this remote until I am alone in my own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was going to argue with her on that point, but then he saw the look in her eyes and knew that there was no way he was going to convince her against this. \"I swear that as soon as I think of what to do, you'll be the first to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final exchange, Mrs. Kitaki stood up and left Vera's home. Apollo was exhausted both mentally and emotionally. He wondered if helping Wocky out would have been a better solution than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around Vera's house and soon came upon a mirror. Despite the face that he was in Mrs. Kitaki's body all day, the fact that Vera's face was staring back at him in the mirror was still unbelievable. \"I swear I'll find out what to do as fast as I can, Vera\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Apollo realized something. The reason that Mrs. Kitaki's mind was with him earlier was because Wocky did a possession and then used a body swap. Did he possess Vera's body or did he use an Aware Swap? If Wocky possessed Vera then the Aware Swap a few minutes ago should cause both Apollo and Vera to be in this body. However, if Wocky had used an Aware Swap to get into Vera's body in the first place, then Vera should be in Apollo's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo chose to find out whether or not she was in this body with him <i>'Hello?

From the stuttering and lack of confidence he could hear in his old voice, he could tell his hypothesis was correct; his old body was currently being occupied by Vera Misham. However, he supposed he should confirm it first, just to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vera? Is that you?\" Apollo asked. Anyone observing would have found it a little ridiculous that Vera was asking if she was talking to herself over the phone, but thankfully, Apollo was alone in Vera's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-!?

S-So... we swapped bodies s-somehow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something like that.\" In reality, it was a bit more complicated, but for the time being, Apollo figured it would be fine to let her think that. He could explain further in person. \"Where are you right now? I'll come over so we can talk this through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm at your I apartment. I found your address in your wallet. I d-didn't want anyone else to see me and mistake me for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be right over. See you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Apollo hung up. At the very least, Vera had had the sense to get out of the public eye while in his body so that people wouldn't notice him acting strange, which is more than he could say for Wocky. Now he could head over to his apartment and explain the situation to Vera, and hopefully the two of them could come up with a plan to get Wocky back into his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left, though, his attention was once again redirected to his attire. Wocky had dressed Vera's body in an outfit that was rather unlike anything he'd seen her wear. If anyone who knew Vera saw her like this, they'd certainly be suspicious, just as he was when he saw Wocky in Vera's body. He'd have liked to avoid confrontation on his way back to his apartment, but putting on a more Vera-like appearance would mean getting changed into a different outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo could already feel his face heating up at the thought. It felt like a massive breach of her privacy, and he wasn't really comfortable with the idea of undressing Vera's body and putting on another set of clothes. However, as far as Vera knew, the two of them had simply swapped body, with no involvement from Wocky. If he showed up to his apartment looking like this, she might assume he'd been the one to dress her up like this, so maybe she should try to find the outfit Wocky had taken off and put it back on? Either way, he should probably make his decision quickly, so as not to keep Vera waiting too long.</span></div></div>",

He sat down on Vera's bed and took off the shoes he was wearing. After taking a deep breath, he looked up at the ceiling, before pulling of the jacket and tanktop, and slipping out of the jeans. He tried not to think about the fact that he was currently naked, save for Vera's underwear, but he could feel his face heating up regardless.

He put on her sweater and overalls, before finally lowering his head as he looked for her socks and shoes. Once that was done, he did his best to tied his hair up like Vera usually did. Having finished getting dress, Apollo observed himself in the mirror again. He was still Vera, but now he looked more like the Vera he knew, and not the twisted version Wocky had created. A bit red in the face from embarrassment, but otherwise indistinguishable from the real Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad that the ordeal was over, Apollo left Vera's house, heading over to his apartment as quickly as possible.</span></div></div>",

He had worried this would be the case; Wocky had possessed Vera instead of switching. It wouldn't necessarily be <i>better</i> if she was trapped in his body, but he also wasn't thrilled at the prospect of sharing a body with another person again. Still, she was a victim in this, and he owed her an explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vera, don't panic. This... is going to be impossible to explain...\" he said. \"Alright, so it all started earlier today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's where we are now,\" Apollo finished. \"I'm really sorry; I don't know how you got dragged into this at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Mr. Wright was busy,'</i> Vera replied, her voice a bit shaken. <i>'He couldn't get a hold of Trucy, so he said he'd have you come over to help me with something. I answered the door for you and then everything went black.' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've been Wocky...\" Apollo muttered. \"Vera listen, I can't stress how much I regret this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of quiet before Vera replied. <i>'It's okay. You only meant to help. Better you than him.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo nodded, glad that she was at least still keeping it together. Vera was a rather fragile person; he was worried that the stress of all this would be too much for her. \"Knowing Plum, he's probably worse off than us right now. We're going to need to brainstorm ways to help Wocky though to get us out of this.\" Apollo though for a second, before a question popped into his mind. \"Oh! What did you need help with when you called Mr. Wright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh... well, I guess since you're here I'll tell you,'</i> Vera replied slowly. <i>'I needed your help because...'</i></span></div></div>",

Are you alright with that?\" At the very least, Apollo could maybe find a way to salvage the day for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Are you sure? It's a long walk... I don't want to go there by myself.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, technically you won't be alone,\" Apollo reasoned. He knew that wasn't what she meant, but he wanted to give her some assurance. \"I'll be with you, right? Just... imagine I'm walking next to you.\" Maybe it'd be good practice for her in the long run? She'd have to get more independent eventually, especially if she wanted to make new friends. If he was going to be stuck in her head for a couple days, he ought to atleast do something nice for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Okay... can you just handle it for me though?'</i> It seemed she was dedicated to dodging the problem. Apollo sighed and scratched the back of his head, brushing away Vera's longer hair as he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's fine,\" he replied, unwilling to fight it out. \"Just watch me and you'll see it's no big deal, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo had to admit that he was getting pretty sick of walking. He wasn't physically tired anymore, since he switched out of Plum, but he was getting mentally exhausted. Vera might've picked up on this, as she was pretty silent during the walk down to the crafts store. Thankfully it wasn't as long as she made it out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the store, Apollo had to admit he <i>was</i> feeling nervous. Maybe Vera's personality was rubbing off on him? He picked up a basket and walked through the aisles slowly. It was hard enough interacting with Mrs. Kitaki's husband; being out in public as someone else was rather stressful, especially when that person was spectating everything you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Vera's instructions, he gathered the paints and canvases that she needed, trying his best to avoid eye contact with the various strangers he passed by. <i>'I'm not being a great example right now, am I?'</i> Apollo realized a bit sullenly as he waked down to the cashier. <i>'I ought to do something. Help her realize that talking to people isn't that bad...'</i> Scanning the store, he searched for someone who might be easy to speak with. Either someone he knew or someone who looked to be around Vera's age, just so long as he could strike up a conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'There! Perfect,'</i> Apollo thought to himself as his eyes caught a young man waiting in line at the register. He was dressed in a red tracksuit with an apron splattered by paint. He had a strange bracer around his chest, but otherwise seemed like a normal enough person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Uh, I think that's everything,'</i> Vera suddenly chimed in. <i>'I think we can leave now...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" Apollo whispered, \"we'll leave in a bit.\" Vera seemed to accept the response, and quieted down as Apollo walked over to the line. </span></div></div>",

He looked at the man and saw he was purchasing what seemed to be clay \"So, do you make pots and such?\" Apollo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was expecting a somewhat normal response, but he got anything but. \"YEAHHH!.\" The man shouted as he turned to Apollo. \"I'm in the fine arts club at school! I ran out of clay and needed to get some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo heard Vera mentally shriek as the man kept yelling at them <i>'Don't worry, he may be a bit scary, but he seems to be nice. Plus, he's an artist just like you, you might get along'</i> Apollo tried to mentally reassure Vera. Although he was thinking to himself <i>Why?! Of all people who I could've talked to, it had to be the guy with no volume control?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's neat. I like to paint at home often.\" Apollo said, attempting to salvage the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH! Paining's are cool, I like to look at them. Although, painting is nowhere near as MANLY as crafting ceramics! So, I would never do it myself\" The man said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your name?\" Apollo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin Newman! I'm a second year at Themis Law Academy! I'm studying to be a PROSECUTOR!\" The Robin introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo winced when Robin mentioned the Prosecutor part, he wouldn't fully be one for a few years at least, but Apollo dreaded the day he would have to face off against this yelling maniac in court. He chose to stop thinking about that and introduce himself \"I'm Apo- Vera, Vera Misham.\" He introduced Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH! You're that lady who was in the newspapers, you're that forger!\" Robin said, Apollo got a bit disheartened, he should have expected that someone buying art supplies would have heard of Vera, but he was pleasantly surprised by what Robin said next \"That's AWESOME! You have to be a really good painter to make EXACT copies like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo had a bit of a better picture of what kind of a person Robin was. Although he had no sense of an indoor voice, he didn't seem like that bad of a person. Their conversation was cut short as it was Robin's turn in the checkout line. After Robin and Apollo checked out, Robin began talking to Apollo again. \"I gotta go, it was NICE TO MEET YOU, Vera. Do you want to exchange PHONE NUMBERS?!\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'How about it Vera? He may be a bit scary, but who knows? You might become friends with him. It's up to you, do you want to exchange phone numbers?'</i> Apollo asked Vera. He was okay starting a conversation for her, but it was completely up to her if she wanted to do anymore. Did Vera agree to do it?</span></div></div>",

He decided to run with it, and pulled out Vera's phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" he replied, trying to keep a friendly smile. \"Here's my number.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL RIGHT!\" Robin shouted triumphantly, garnering strange stares from around the room. \"We should compare artwork sometime! Maybe I'll introduce you to my friends! KEEP IN TOUCH!\" He shouted with a smile as he made his way out of the store. Apollo let out a sigh of relief as the boy left. He was worried that Vera's body was going to go deaf at that rate! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Vera, the stares died down after Robin left, and Apollo checked out Vera's supplied without another delay, and began walking back down to her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that Vera? He might introduce you to some friends of his,\" Apollo said optimistically as the two of them entered the Misham's living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'It was hard to hear anything else.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe they'll be quieter?\" he suggested as he placed the shopping bag down on a table in Vera's art studio. \"So, what do we do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I was going to start painting again, but I'm tired now,'</i> he heard her voice reply. <i>'Too much has happened today.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo frowned, but could sympathize. He was as much a victim in this as she was, but he still couldn't help but feel guilty about her involvement in the whole thing. \"Alright, uh. We'll hit the bed then I guess?\" His face was running red - he had been trying to push the implications of their predicament out of his mind, but it was a bit inevitable that he was going to have to broach her privacy if he was going to use her body. He'd need to use her clothes, her bed, her home... everything as long as Mrs. Kitaki refused to give him the device. What would sleeping even be like while two people were sharing a body together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo walked over to Vera's bedroom a bit uncertainly. It was rather empty for the most part; there were some cabinets for clothes, a make-up table, and a bookshelf. Apollo couldn't help but notice how lonely it all felt. Walking to the closet, he examined their body in the mirror. Vera was still wearing the outfit Wocky had chosen for her earlier. <i>'I think that man ruined my pants...'</i> Vera pointed out as Apollo examined what looked like random tears in her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was about to reach down to pull them off as a matter of reflex, but he managed to stop himself as he remembered whose body he was in. Not only was he Vera, but Vera was still there with him! It would be incredibly invasive to start changing clothes <i>now</i>. Instead, he just threw off the jacket that Wocky had dressed her in and opted to lie down on the bed with the rest of her clothes still on, hoping Vera didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow we'll try to come up with a solution for Wocky,\" Apollo said in an attempt to sound assuring. \"Then we can put this all behind us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera didn't reply. Apollo awkwardly closed their eyes, and after a few silent moments they fell asleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Apollo had no idea where he was. He seemed to be standing on some sort of cliff somewhere, but the sky was completely black. Before he could get a good look at his surroundings, though, a gigantic figure seemed to rise up from below the cliff. Apollo's jaw dropped when he saw who it was. It was none other than his former boss, Kristoph Gavin, looking more like a demon than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIIIIIIISHAAAAAAM!!!!!\" he yelled, as he reached towards the cliff. A screw coming from near him told Apollo that he wasn't the one Gavin was reaching for, he turned to see Vera, cowering in fear from Kristoph's towering form. Thinking on his feet, Apollo leapt into action, grabbing Vera and pulling her out of the way, just as Gavin's hand collided with the cliff face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vera realised she hadn't been grabbed, by Gavin, she seemed incredibly surprised to see who had actually grabbed her. \"Apollo? What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" Gavin's voice boomed once more. He seemed annoyed that Apollo had gotten in the way. \"NO ESCAPE THIS TIME!\" Before Apollo could even question what Gavin was talking about, the ground behind him crumbled away, leaving him and Vera isolated on a pillar. Gavin raised his fist up above his head. \"YOU. WILL. PAY!\" His brought his fist down, Apollo and Vera unable to do anything but watch as it got closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera's body sat up in bed, screaming. Which of the body's occupants had caused the scream, neither could say, but silence followed, leaving them to contemplate what had just happened. As their breathing slowed back down to a normal pace, Apollo broke the silence by asking aloud, \"What... what was that nightmare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was meant to be a rhetorical question, but he heard Vera answer in his mind regardless. <i>\"It's been happening for a while now. Not all the time, just, sort of, on and off. Although, normally you aren't there.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's another side effect of us sharing a body.\" Apollo looked down at himself, as if to confirm that he was still in Vera's body, regardless of the fact that he had already spoken in her voice and heard her in his head. He frowned, seeing that he was still dressed in the outfit that Wocky had worn when he was in Vera's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to peek through the blinds, so Apollo figured it was probably time to get up. He could use all the time he could get to figure out how to get Wocky back into his own body, and thus get him back into his. He was about to go out into the kitchen and make breakfast when he heard Vera's voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Um, shouldn't we, uh...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed incredibly sheepish about whatever it was she had to say, and Apollo had a feeling he knew why. He had stopped right in front of the mirror, and through their shared eyes, Vera could clearly see herself. Apollo hadn't showered last night, nor even changed his clothes. Apollo knew what she was getting at, and he was probably feeling just as embarrassed about it as Vera was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, thought that would probably be a breach of your privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, yeah, but... I don't know.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed neither of them really wanted to do this, but both of them felt it might be a good idea to not just keep wearing the same clothes Wocky had put their shared body into.</span></div></div>",

Hopefully we'll be back to normal by tomorrow, so it won't even be a problem then. Is that okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Y-yeah. Simple.'</i> she repeated back, somehow stuttering even when she didn't really have a voice to speak with. <i>'Just, go ahead. I trust you.'</i> Apollo had the feeling that there'd be a lot of lingering discomfort after this was all sorted out; one more strike against Wocky on the off chance the guy ever needed a lawyer again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetouring from breakfast, Apollo instead entered Vera's bathroom, taking a moment to look around, their face burning red. Apollo imagined that the same would be happening even if he handed control off to Vera. He looked around for a moment, trying to ignore any clothes or personal items scattered about and managed to find a simple pink towel in a cabinet by the sink. He looked to the shower, and then back to the mirror, examining their body again. Vera's hair <i>had</i> gotten a bit tangled and messed up overnight. The stress of fighting Mrs. Kitaki and then walking back and forth to the store probably had some effect too - they had gotten a bit sweaty. He supposed a shower was warranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Keep it simple,' Apollo reminded himself. He looked down and saw the shirt Wocky had dressed Vera in, a simple tank top with no sleeves. 'Just go fast.' It'd just be weirder if he took his time. Thinking ahead, Apollo spun the faucet and let the water start pouring down. While it began to heat up, he closed his eyes and threw off his top, feeling a cold breeze over his mostly exposed torso. The jeans followed. After disrobing, Apollo hopped into the shower, eyes still clamped shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, Apollo kept it short. He washed out Vera's long hair the best he could, scrubbed her arms and legs, and then promptly exited the shower. It was only about 10 minutes, but probably the most awkward of his and Vera's lives. He could only hope that she'd be willing to forget about it later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with a towel wrapped around their torso, Apollo went back into the bedroom, eager to find a change of clothes. Vera walked him through the more troublesome articles; Apollo would never have thought two days ago that he'd need to know how to clasp a bra. it seemed that Wocky had unfortunately ruined her last clean pair of jeans, though. Looking through her closet, Apollo instead had to throw an old dress - striped blue and white - that went down to about their knees. He threw a jacket overtop and pulled on a pair of long socks, as per Vera's instructions, to finish the outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hm, uh, good job. Now for the hair, you'll need to, um-'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just cheat on that one,\" Apollo interrupted, opting instead to just tie her hair behind her head. He looked into the mirror at the full image; they skipped makeup completely, but he doubted they'd need it. \"That wasn't bad, right? We look presentable.\" Apollo said, trying to assure  both himself and Vera that everything was going well, even though he was wearing a dress. 'Really hope Trucy doesn't hear about this one...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'So what do we do now?'</i> Vera asked. It was honestly a pretty good question. 'Do you think you have a solution yet?'</span></div></div>",

He had gambled in court before, so he was no stranger to risks. If this didn't work then he'd just have to try something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What if it doesn't work?'</i> Vera asked, clearly nervous about the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was quiet for a second before shrugging. \"Then we just steal the remote I guess?\" he said with a nervous chuckle, running a hand through Vera's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you sure? That women sounded dangerous...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo shook his head. \"She talks a big game, but she and her son owe me. Not to mention, she wouldn't hurt you without any reason. We'll be fine if we mess up, don't worry!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt wasn't a fantastic plan, but it was all they had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a much longer walk to Kitaki Manor than Vera would've cared for. After they got a mile out from her home, she went totally quiet. Apollo felt sorry for her, but he felt bad to admit that it was a little bit of a relief too. He didn't want her second guessing his plan along the way. He felt a bit frightened himself, having to walk so far out alone in a strange body, but pushed through it. After all, he had to do this for himself <i>and</i> Vera. She deserved to have some privacy after all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock Knock* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo stood uncomfortably outside the main door of the mansion. After a moment or so, the door creaked open slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Justice?\" The voice of Mrs. Kitaki could be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo nodded, \"yes, it's me. Can I come in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door moved open a bit further, giving Apollo some space as he entered Kitaki Manor. Plum was looking a bit worse for wear herself after the night. Her clothing was the same but her hair was rather messy and the headdress she usually wore was nowhere to be seen. Her eyes had some rings underneath them, making it look like she didn't get much in the way of sleep either after the last night. She gave Apollo a quick scan before shaking her head, \"well, you certainly adapted quick haven't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Mrs. Kitaki?\" Apollo asked, feeling concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum shook her head, \"no, not particularly. Wocky hasn't exactly been quiet in here. If I rest, I'm worried he'll just take over and take that device. My husband's out right now - I told him I wasn't feeling well, so we should be fine for a few hours. I hope you're here because you have an answer for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo nodded. \"I have a solution that might work. Wocky's body is still here, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum nodded, \"right in his room. He's still recovering after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thoughts are that, if he is in your body with you, his body has to be, I guess, 'empty',\" Apollo began, unsure how to describe it. \"It's just acting on autopilot. Therefore, if we tried to switch him with you, maybe Wocky's consciousness would just be sent back into it? And since he's recovering, he wouldn't be able to steal that remote again. Are you willing to try it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and shook her head. \"I'd try anything for some quiet.\" She fished around her pocket, and handed Apollo and Vera a key. \"I'm going to trust you to handle this Mr. Justice. Don't disappoint me, or you will likely regret it.\" Apollo gave a nervous nod in response. Plum guided Apollo to a chest hidden in her bedroom where they retrieved the device. Apollo pointed it at Plum's body and clicked 'Aware Swap'. The two them then walked down to Wocky's room once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, uh, wait right here, alright?\" Apollo suggested. \"Let me know what happens once I press the button.\" Plum, thankfully, complied, as Apollo turned the doorknob and stepped into the bedroom, facing Wocky's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Mom, what's this chick doin' in my-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo didn't care to hear the fake Wocky keep speaking, and immediately clicked \"Aware Swap\" once again. </span></div></div>",

Apollo could guess that Wocky was likely back in his own body. Letting out a sigh of relief, he closed the door to Wocky's room, and headed back down to where Plum was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say anything, Plum spoke up the moment he was in view. \"Oh, Mr. Justice! I can't thank you enough! Is Wocky alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo nodded. \"He's back in his own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness. It's so good to have my body to myself again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, I think it's about time I get back to my own body.\" That had been the end-goal of this endeavor, after all; to get out of Vera's body, and back into his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Um, Apollo?\"</i> Apollo heard Vera's voice inside his head. <i>\"Could we go back to my place before you get out of my body? I don't really want to walk home alone.\"</i> Apollo figured he should have expected that. It was a rather long walk from Vera's house to Kitaki Mansion, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could answer, however, Plum said, \"Before you do that, I think we should talk about who's keeping this device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Apollo hadn't really thought about that. He was mostly just focused on getting back to his own body that he hadn't thought about who was going to be keeping the device afterwards. Although if Vera wanted to head back to her house, he'd probably have to ask Plum if he could take it with him. It was probably better that it was far away from Wocky, anyway.</span></div></div>",

He was walking a bit quicker than he had been when he first headed to the mansion earlier today. Just a little longer and he'd be able to get back to his old body. After spending about a day in two different female bodies, both times with another person inside his head, he couldn't wait to be himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's finally going to be over,\"</i> he heard Vera say inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is,\" Apollo said aloud, as there was no one else around to hear.

First she had been possessed by Wocky, and once she regained consciousness, Apollo was the one in control of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left was for the two of them to walk home before they could finally be separated again.</span></div></div>",

You are not taking it with you,\" Plum replied in a very forceful tone. \"Now, hand it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he didn't want to leave Vera in an uncomfortable situation (after a very uncomfortable day yesterday), Apollo knew better than to argue with Plum, especially while he had Vera's body. \"Sorry Vera,\" he mumbled, \"It looks like we'll have to do it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, just talking to Vera,\" he said, tapping one of his temples to indicate who he was speaking to. Speaking of which, Vera seemed to have gone quiet. If Apollo had to guess, he'd say she was probably mentally preparing herself for the walk home. He begrudgingly handed the remote to Plum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, which one of these will let you out of that girl's body?\" Apollo pointed out the button which Wocky had originally pointed him towards the day before, and without another word, Plum aimed at him and pressed the button. \"Well?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...He's not in my body anymore,\" Vera said quietly. Even without knowing Vera personally, Plum could definitely see the difference in personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to hide this away in my safe,\" she said before heading off deeper into the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera, on the other hand, went back to the front door of the mansion, and took a deep breath. \"You can do this. You can do this,\" she told herself, before stepping outside and walking home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnseen to both of them, Apollo had been floating in the room in some sort of ethereal form, watching the scene unfold. He did feel bad about making Vera walk home herself, but he needed to get out of her and back to his own, and this was the only way Plum was going to let them do it. Well, he was out now, so that was half the battle over already. Now he just needed to get back to his own body. Considering the time of day, he guessed it was probably at the office, doing his job. He floated through the door, finding his ethereal form to be slower than expected. This was going to be a long trip home.</span></div></div>",

The ghost-like form that he was currently in was slow, but Apollo himself was partially to blame for how slow he was going. While he could go slightly faster, he decided against it to avoid accidentally flying into someone and possessing them because he was going to fast. While he could avoid that possibility by flying upward into the air, he didn't due to his fear of heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way to ward the office, he couldn't help but think about the past day. If he hadn't experienced any of it first hand, he wouldn't believe any of it. He thought about the remote, he wondered if it was okay to leave the remote at Kitaki Manor. After all, Wocky was still there and if he ever got his hands on it. then this whole situation could start up again. Apollo would just have to hope for now that Mrs. Kitaki would be able to keep it away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing he wondered about the remote was what the other two buttons did. He knew that 'Aware Swap' swapped two people bodies and the 'Possesion' button would send him into the ghost form he was in now, but he wondered what the other two buttons would do. Wocky had only explained those two when he wanted Apollo to help him leave Vera's body. Apollo figured that the reason he hadn't told him was because those two wouldn't help him get away from Mrs. Kitaki, but that only made him wonder, what did they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an hour, Apollo was only a block away from the Agency. It had only been a day since he had last been there, but it felt like forever. In his excitement to get back to his body, Apollo began to speed up. However, as he reached the corner, everything suddenly went black. It was only black for a moment and once Apollo got his senses back he realized what happened. He was once again in a body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in <i>'A'</i> body, but it wasn't <i>his</i> body. Apollo felt like screaming out of anger. He made it so close to the agency only to mess up on the last block! Now he was going to have to walk all the way back to the Kitaki Manor and hopefully convince Mrs. Kitaki that he was really Apollo so she could let him out of this body, and once that was done he would have to do that long float over here again. He supposed he should at least find out whose body he was in before he began the walk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose body was Apollo in?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Apollo looked at his reflection and sighed. His was once again in a girl's body, however, unlike the last two female bodies he was in, he had no idea who this girl was. From the look of her reflection, Apollo guessed that she was around his age, but that wasn't good enough for him. He began to rummage through her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick search through the girl's bag, Apollo found various things. Among them was a cell phone, a card which had two wings and three crow's feet on it, a strange device labeled 'Little Thief', and most importantly an ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to this ID, the girl's name was Kay Faraday. Apollo was pretty on the mark in guessing her age, she was only two years older than him at 24 years old. Strangely, on her ID the words 'Great Thief' were written below her name in what looked like marker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo gulped, he had no way of knowing whether or not this girl was actually a thief, but if she was, he wanted out of her body as soon as possible. He didn't want to be sent to jail over another person's crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, throughout his search of her bag, Apollo found no car keys or anything similar, meaning he would have to walk his way back to Kitaki Manor. He sighed and began his walk over. As he walked, he couldn't help but feel bothered by the breezy that blew between his legs. The dress he wore earlier in Vera's body at least went to the knees. Kay's skirt was really short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of walking, Apollo heard something that made his heart stop. The ringing of a cell phone. Normally a cell phone ringing wouldn't be a big deal, but the ringing was coming from Kay's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo opened Kay's bag and pulled out her cell phone. The caller ID said the person calling was someone named 'Edgeworth'. Apollo recognized the name Edgeworth, but he couldn't remember from where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath and answered the phone \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the phone, a man spoke \"Ah, Kay. You said you would be visiting today. I was wondering why you were running late. I know it's been a while since you visited, but I doubt that even you could get lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo had no plans on going anywhere in Kay's place. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot where I said I would meet you. in fact, I may not be there for at least another hour.\" Apollo made up an excuse as to why 'Kay' wouldn't show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You forgot that you were meeting me in my office at the prosecution headquarters?\" The man on the phone said, clearly not believing the excuse Apollo gave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the word 'Prosecutor' was said, Apollo realized where he had heard the name 'Edgeworth' before. He was the prosecutor Mr. Wright had faced many times before he was disbarred! The man was a famous prosecutor, and unlike a certain rock-star Apollo knew, Edgeworth's reputation was solely earned by his abilities in court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Kay? Are you still there?\" Edgeworth asked over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Apollo knew that he should just hurry to Kitaki Manor and leave Kay's body, he couldn't help but feel curious. Mr. Wright was a very...strange boss to say the least, Apollo couldn't help but wonder what kind of man the prosecutor the Mr. Wright had faced in court was. After all, old court videos could only tell him so much. He could just drop by Edgeworth's office for a little while and go to Kitaki Manor later tonight. The prosecution building wasn't very far from where Apollo currently was, it was a very large building and very hard to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was also some minor risk if he stopped by Edgeworth's office. He was already in for some major explaining to Mrs. Kitaki about how he had ended up in Kay's body, he didn't want to explain why he also took much longer than he should have to get back to Kitaki Manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Apollo go straight to Kitaki Manor or stop by Edgeworth's office?</span></div></div>",

This Kay Faraday looked like she had labelled herself as a \"Great Thief.\" What type of person was Prosecutor Edgeworth if he seemed to treat her like an old friend? Perhaps he simply took the strange people that seemed to pop up in L.A. in stride. If he played his cards right, Apollo might even be able to get his help when he asked Mrs. Kitaki to let him out of this body. Or he may secretly be a criminal who will silence him for discovering his connection with Kay. Well, what's life without taking a few risks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mr. Edgeworth,\" Apollo said. \"I haven't been feeling like myself lately.\" Well, it was true.

Apollo had decided to jog for a bit to save some time, and he soon found that he wasn't getting tired at all. By the time he reached his destination, only fifteen minutes had passed since he had hung up on Edgeworth, and he still didn't feel winded. <span class=\"clteal\">(It is kind of nice to not get tired when I need to be somewhere quick. Though I'm not sure I want to know why this woman is in such good shape.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed through the entrance, a thought occurred to Apollo. How was he going to convince the security guards to let him into a prosecutor's office? On the one hand, he found it unlikely that the security guards would simply let someone like Apollo through without asking questions. On the other, Prosecutor Edgeworth seemed familiar enough that maybe there was a chance that Kay actually worked with the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">(I'm already taking a risk coming here. I may as well go all in. And I need to stop making poker references. Mr. Wright might be rubbing off too much on me.)</span> Apollo approached one of the guards, deciding to be completely honest with his intentions. \"Excuse me, sir. I need to see Prosecutor Edgeworth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man actually seemed to lighten. \"Hey, Kay. Mr. Edgeworth was expecting you. Oh, and he decided to keep his old office on the twelfth floor, so you know exactly where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Apollo said, thankful the man both let him through and told him what floor the office was on. He decided to walk at a brisk pace, looking in on some of the offices as he searched for the elevator. It was easy, for instance, to tell which office belonged to Prosecutor Gavin. The rock memorabilia was out of place with what a professional environment would look like. Though, Apollo wasn't really in a position to criticize considering he worked at the Wright Anything Agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he made it to the elevator and got to the twelfth floor, Apollo decided to look in at the office with its doors still open. Room 1202 had a large bookshelf full of both books and legal documents. Across from it was a burgundy...or maroon...or pink sofa beneath a regal looking suit. He then noticed a chessboard with many...definitely maroon pieces surrounding a single blue piece. <span class=\"clteal\">(That probably means something, but hell if I know what it is.)</span> Perhaps the strangest item in the room was a figurine Apollo recognized as the Steel Samurai, the protagonist of an old kid's show he watched growing up. <span class=\"clteal\">(Wonder what something like that's doing here.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice of you to finally show up, Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's eyes widened as he turned around. The figure could perhaps be best summarized as what he was not: he was certainly the exact opposite of Mr. Wright in almost any manner. The man carried himself with a dignified air, even if the glasses made him seem a bit old. The suit he wore was perhaps the furthest thing away from Mr. Wright's normal outfit. And the look on his face conveyed a very serious nature, which often seemed not to define Mr. Wright except when it came to Trucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mr. Edgeworth,\" Apollo said. \"It's nice to see you again.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure thing, Mr. Edgeworth!\" Today seemed to be all about taking risky gambles. Apollo would try to pretend to be Kay; hopefully when the truth came out, Prosecutor Edgeworth would at the very least be inclined to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, let's start with what you've been up to lately. Have you made any headway into your career as the Great Thief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, Apollo was worrying about the possibility that Edgeworth was a criminal mastermind like Kristoph Gavin turned out to be. \"Huh? What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was evidently the wrong answer, as Edgeworth simply stared at him, crossed his arms, and tapped his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">OBJECTION!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk. Coming to a contradiction so soon. You deny any connection to the Great Thief, but the evidence is plain as day. Surely, you've noticed the badge on your scarf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That badge is the shape of the Great Thief Yatagarasu, worn proudly by the one who inherited the title.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">(Damn, I can't believe I made such an easy mistake!)</span> \"Ehehehe...I'm just teasing you, Mr. Edgeworth. Of course, I've been doing great as a thief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, now? You do realize that admitting to such a crime is not a very good idea since I'm a prosecutor. In fact, I was recently named the new chief prosecutor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you even congratulated me over the phone the other day. But enough about that. If you're so intent on confessing your crimes, why don't you tell me all about your exploits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...\" <span class=\"clteal\">(What would a thief even brag about?)</span> \"I've been getting everything from everyone! Why, I bet you haven't even noticed you're missing anything yet, Mr. Edgeworth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're exactly right, I haven't noticed anything missing. Because nothing is missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For shame. Do you not even know why you are the Great Thief? Such petty crimes are beneath you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, of course! I've obviously taken extremely valuable things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But haven't you taken the most valuable thing of all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, this might jog your memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">TAKE THAT!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A newspaper article about a confirmed theft by the Great Thief Yatagarasu. The articles taken were later found to be crucial evidence in a trial. Do you see yet? The most precious thing, the only thing worth stealing for a Great Thief, is the truth! That is the creed of the Yatagarasu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" <span class=\"clteal\">(Even if I'm really bad at hiding that I don't know stuff, it's still kind of cool to see...Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth in his element.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, your predecessor told you of this fact and of the rules of being the Great Thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cIteal\">(I'm still not sure what he's trying to do, but I guess I'll fall into this trap.)</span> \"Well, of course she did! I just...forgot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...you seem to be forgetting a lot of important things. You don't happen to be having amnesia right now, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's it. You got me. Sorry, Mr. Edgeworth, it was embarrassing to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it should be embarrassing to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all, you really did have amnesia once. In fact, a man high in law enforcement sought to take advantage of your state by framing you for a murder you even came to believe you committed. The Kay who had amnesia most certainly did not act like you; she was afraid she was a bad person because of her identity as a thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every statement you've made up to this point has been trying to convince me you are Kay Faraday, the Great Thief Yatagarasu. But the truth is, you are an imposter. The real Kay, if arguing about her predecessor, would remember who HE is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though the original Yatagarasu was in fact a group of three, there was one person who stood above the others. The one whose path Kay wanted to follow in. And that person was her father, Prosecutor Byrne Faraday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, then. Who are you, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know I can't just say it. Now that we're on this path, it's actually kind of cool watching you do your thing, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...you seem to know nothing of Kay Faraday, yet you make a claim that you know about me. I wonder, are you a person involved with the law?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike a certain prosecutor, I'm not very well known beyond legal circles. I may have a high position now, but to the public at large, I may be as interchangeable as a Payne. So, tell me. How do you know of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. When you called over the phone, I didn't actually recognize you at first until you mentioned you were a prosecutor. Then, I remembered about that brilliant prosecutor who stood as Mr. Wright's rival when he was a lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How very illuminating! The person you truly follow isn't me, it's actually Wright! That narrows down the possibilities quite a bit since his reputation is down the drain ever since he was disbarred for his forgery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I...he was proven innocent of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes he was. In fact, I never believed that he had done so at all, but there were many jealous of Wright, eager to pounce when the opportunity arose. I'm even hoping to convince him to return to law, though he has been hesitant since it might mean less time spent with his daughter. But I believe just now you gave a very important clue to your identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You protested about that forgery, leading with 'Hey, I.' That sounds to me like you personally had a role in proving his innocence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I can think of very few people you could be. If I didn't know Wright like I do, I would have easily dismissed the possibility. But with him in the picture, the unplausible is most certainly not impossible. But I have one more piece of evidence. Tell me, what do you think of that object at the end of my bookshelf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo turned to where Edgeworth pointed. \"I don't get it. That's a ladder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's not a stepladder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. It's a debate that has been going on for ten years with Wright. He has corrupted his daughter with his thoughts on the subject, but the attorney who works under him has vehemently resisted the argument.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo had to give one last effort to deceiving Edgeworth, even if it was weak and rather embarrassing to say. \"But,...I'm very clearly a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You very clearly have Kay Faraday's form...perhaps it's even her body. But I never mentioned the sex of Wright's student. Of course, you would know about him. He proved Wright's innocence after seven years of injustice. Wright even believes that his student will soon grow to surpass his legacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really?\" <span class=\"cItea\">(Mr. Wright...he really believes in me that much?)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reaction...it tells me that you were not sure that Wright believes in you that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm really that readable, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are, Mr. Apollo Justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...\" Apollo sheepishly put a hand at his neck. \"You really are amazing Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. You took apart everything like it was child's play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. What a strange situation you must be in. But for now, it's checkmate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At one level, he could sympathize with the young Kitaki getting stir crazy from enforced bed rest. All his other actions, however, wiped out most of that sympathy as it was clear the young man had no qualms about what he had done to his relief. He considered Apollo rather lucky that his ideas to fix everything ended up working, perhaps he had some of that strange luck that allowed Wright to emerge from situations that would kill ordinary men relatively unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mrs. Kitaki let me out of Vera's body before storing that remote somewhere. I headed for the agency, hoping to get back to my body, but I accidentally ended up in Kay's body right when I almost got there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" It was a lot to process, even for him. He wondered how such a device had made its way into Wocky's possession, but he supposed he had to fix one problem at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mr. Edgeworth, you aren't mad at me for taking over your...friend's body, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would if I had any reason to believe you were trying to take advantage of her body.

You're not in the middle of something, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Is something wrong?\" Wright seemed very serious and very worried about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes.

What's the matter?\" Edgeworth saw concern appear on Apollo's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I went back home last night, Trucy seemed different. She didn't greet me or tease me about staying late. She didn't even seem to regard me at all until I got right in front of her. I thought she might just be tired after a long day, but she was still out of it in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you describe her behavior further?\" At this point, Edgeworth put the phone on speaker, hoping that Apollo would be able to glean something from his boss's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went to go get some magic props. Kind of easy to do that when the office is full of them. But she seemed like she was trying to look for something in them, not practice magic. A friend of hers called earlier, but she didn't notice her phone go off at all. After the third time, I picked it up myself and gave an excuse for why Trucy was busy. I asked her why she didn't remember setting up a meeting with her friend, but she just waved me off like she had more important things to focus on. I'm really worried, Edgeworth. It's like she's an entirely different person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Edgeworth remarked as he put the phone off speaker. It seemed like he had given Apollo enough information to work off of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was processing his boss's words. None of those things sounded like Trucy's behavior at all. She loved Mr. Wright and certainly wouldn't be dismissive of him. Like an entirely different person...what if Mr. Wright was correct about that? The fact that he was currently not himself was evidence of the possibility, but then who could possibly fit that description Mr. Wright gave? <span class=\"clteal\">(Forget it. It's not about thinking about who fits that description. The only thing that's important is who had the chance to take Trucy's place?</span> Wocky was the only one who had the remote, and it was clear that after he had taken Apollo's body, he moved on to possess Vera. If Wocky himself didn't take Trucy's body, he might have swapped her with...the other person who was in the agency...Oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!\" Apollo exclaimed as he came to a horrifying realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, are you with someone, Edgeworth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just an associate of mine. Could you wait for a moment?\" Edgeworth muted his phone's microphone. \"So, Mr. Justice, have you figured out what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wocky swapped her with Wesley Stickler! That sicko's been in her body...and that means she's been stuck in his.\" Another horrifying realization occurred to him. \"Oh, God. When we were forced out of the agency, I...I pushed her away from me. She was just as confused as me...and I...Trucy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth became distinctly uncomfortable as Apollo seemed like he was on the verge of tears. \"Calm down, Mr. Justice. Now that we know what happened, we can do something about it. First, I have a concerned father I have to deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that Apollo was not about to emotionally break down, he turned his attention back to his phone and unmuted it. \"Wright, I have a feeling I know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your situation seems to be very similar to something that's going on right now, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Are you still at your office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to have a talk with your 'daughter' and find out the truth yourself. Leave no question off the table, and call me back when you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edgeworth, this isn't funny. I'm the one who gives cryptic hints.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turnabout is fair play, Wright. I expect to hear from you soon.\" Edgeworth hung up and led Apollo back into his office. Inside, Edgeworth retrieved a laptop and booted it up quickly. \"If you recall, Mr. Justice, Wesley Stickler appeared as a witness in court during one of your cases. We took down his contact information in case he was needed for further testimony. I should be able to retrieve that information, and hopefully we will be able to contact Ms. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words seemed to shake Apollo out of his stupor, though he still looked emotionally vulnerable. A few minutes passed before Edgeworth found the information he needed. He dialed the number into his phone and awaited a response.</span></div></div>",

You have no idea how relieved I am to hear from someone who knows who I really am! How did you figure it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very simple: I didn't.

Really, it was touching that the young man cared a lot for Wright's daughter, almost as if they were siblings. He knew from talking with Wright that the young lawyer often ended up as a guinea pig for the magician's acts, but when push came to shove, he could tell that they both would stick by each other. It almost reminded him of himself and Franziska.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm fine now, Trucy. You hear me? I'M APOLLO JUSTICE, AND I'M FINE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth thought he was also very loud, but at least the young man had returned to his emotional equilibrium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Apollo handed the phone back to him. \"Trucy wanted to speak to you, Mr. Edgeworth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth nodded as he took his phone back. \"Good job getting Mr. Justice to settle down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, Polly gets worried about me so easily.

Trucy is on her way back to your place of employment. We should get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. And really...thanks for everything, Mr. Edgeworth.

Well, all the craziness in excess of his usual life. During the car trip to the Kitaki's, Apollo still had guilty feelings about leaving Trucy all by herself in the mess. He had even forgotten to get Edgeworth's story about why he seemed to keep in touch with a thief. It was on the ride back that he learned about the girl whose body he was currently using. Apollo knew that he really shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but everything Edgeworth told him about Kay's morals and altruism made him feel bad for worrying about time in jail for crimes he didn't commit. Of particular note was that incident of amnesia Edgeworth had mentioned previously. The lengths the chief prosecutor had gone to in order to defend her in her most vulnerable state, believing in her even when she didn't believe in herself, heightened the already great respect the attorney had for his boss's former rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Mr. Edgeworth. To wager your profession and freedom so you could pursue the truth and save your friend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mere badge for a dear friend. I didn't even have to think about it. And I think you would be the sort of person who would do the same, Mr. Justice. Otherwise, I doubt Wright would have put his trust in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think I only knew about you because you had gone up against Mr. Wright so many times in court...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really that surprising, especially for someone who followed Wright because of his own beliefs in fighting for the truth. After all, I didn't always place value on such things in my youth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really? After everything you've done for Kay, I can't imagine you as someone who wouldn't fight for the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, my early career revolved around a very different set of priorities. Back then and even still among a lot of prosecutors today, the predominant goal of a prosecutor was exactly what was stated in the job description: to get defendants found guilty. Even I subscribed to this belief for many years, and it wasn't until later that I had relearned what was truly important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...is a story for another time. We have already arrived at our destination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo turned away from the chief prosecutor to find that Edgeworth had parked right outside the agency. He breathed a sigh of relief as they headed for the entrance.</span></div></div>",

Inside, he and Edgeworth found both Trucy and Wesley tied up and cuffed. Wesley appeared to be trying to figure out how to escape, but even though he had a magician's body, he was still no closer to understanding a magician's tricks. Mr. Wright meanwhile had an exasperated look, as if containing Wesley had put him through the wringer. It had probably been years since he had to deal with a situation remotely similar to this one, though Apollo couldn't imagine what such a situation would entail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Edgeworth, you're here!\" Trucy exclaimed as the first to notice them. \"And is that Polly with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe...hey, Trucy. Hey, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shifted his attention to the new arrivals. \"Trucy filled me in on everything you told her over the phone. Heh...so you really did get dragged into this, Apollo? I'd make a joke, but there are more important things that need to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, Daddy. I think Polly looks super cute now! I bet he'd be way more popular and get a lot more clients like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat teasing smile was kind of unsettling on Wesley's body, but Apollo was glad that Trucy was so resilient. <span class=\"clteal\">(She sure is a tough girl.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be the case, Trucy,\" Edgeworth opined, \"but I for one would prefer to have Kay in control of her own body again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First though, let's get my daughter back in her body.\"</span></div></div>",

The two seemed to be disoriented for a moment, but it immediately became clear that the swap had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank goodness!\" In a flash, Trucy broke free from the bonds and cuffs before running up to Apollo and giving him a hug. \"Thanks, Polly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo stiffened for a moment due to the suddenness of the gesture but soon reciprocated. \"I'm just glad you're safe and alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright? I'm better than that. I'm fine! In fact, I'm feeling very fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that, Trucy?\" With his daughter back in her body, Phoenix finally relaxed. \"I don't seem to recall Wesley making any effort to take care of your body. He seemed to have single minded focus on figuring out your tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mention of her body's needs, Trucy let go of Apollo, frowning and crossing her arms. \"...Daddy, why did you have to mention that? Now I feel like I didn't sleep well or eat anything, and I also suddenly need a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha...sorry Trucy. Why don't you freshen up first? I'll make you something to eat, and then you can take a well earned nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thanks, Daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Trucy rushed off, and the smile on Phoenix's face fell too. \"So, what are we going to do with you, Mr. Stickler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Wesley seemed unconcerned about the danger staring him in the face. \"To think that there is a way to simply undo these material bindings and trick cuffs with such ease! Yet another mystery I must uncover. Such a task may seem so daunting: to unravel the tricks and gimmicks that defy all bounds of logic. But I, Wesley Stickler, will find out how to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">HOLD IT!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was covering his ears. \"I don't know about anyone else, but I couldn't take any more of his talking. I already got more than enough of that in court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concur, Wright. But before you start anything, please remember that Mr. Stickler too is a victim of Mr. Kitaki's gross disregard for consequences. At least he did not violate your daughter's body in any manner approaching Mr. Kitaki's disregard for Ms. Misham's image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix paused to consider his old friend's words. \"Fine, then. I'm going to let you go, Mr. Stickler, but I'm not going to let you just come by whenever you want to hassle my daughter over her magic. In fact, I'm going to file a restraining order against you on behalf of Trucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat to his inquiries finally caught Wesley's attention. \"You...you can't do that! It is beyond the pale of human comprehension that such tricks should remain a mystery. Inquiring minds everywhere need to know everything about the lengths to which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">OBJECTION!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been awhile since Phoenix had last uttered a good, courtroom style \"Objection,\" but he felt the circumstances warranted it. He slammed against a nearby table to accentuate his point. \"I don't think you truly understand why magic is so important to Trucy. These aren't mere \"tricks\" that you're talking about; they're the accumulated legacy of her birth family. They are the positive memories of her birth father, mother, uncle, and grandfather. The performance rights of the Gramarye's most celebrated tricks are what Zak sacrificed everything for to pass onto her. The secrets are hers alone to share with those she believes are worthy. To try and take the secrets from her amounts to theft. And in case you haven't noticed, I have very high friends in law enforcement. This is your only warning. If you continue to try and steal the magic, there will be hell to pay.\" With that, Phoenix quickly undid the restraints and handcuffs. \"Now get out of my agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether Phoenix's angry father shtick truly sunk into Wesley or not remained to be seen. Still, he did seem to get the memo enough to immediately run out the exit. The smile returned to Phoenix's face. \"Well, I think I got my point across.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Edgeworth remained impassive, Apollo was not. <span class=\"clteal\">(I don't even think Mr. Wright was really that angry at him, but his presence was overwhelming. I'd hate to see what he's like when he's really pissed off.)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that this bit of unpleasantness is over, I would like Kay to have her body back, and I'm sure you would prefer your associate to be back in his as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know, Edgeworth. I agree with Trucy. He is a lot cuter like this, and he might actually get paid for his legal work too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo drooped. <span class=\"clteal\">(And there's the boss who jokes at my expense.)</span> \"Gee, thanks, Mr. Wright. I'm glad I currently fit your bill of cuteness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth gave his patented glare at Wright, arms crossed with a lone finger tapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix merely chuckled at the sight. \"Alright, alright, Edgeworth. Gee, I thought you might have mellowed out with age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wright, I very much doubt you would be as amused if it were Ms. Fey being possessed. Or if it were Ms. Fey being the troublemaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chuckling stopped. \"Don't even joke about that. I can only imagine how crazy things would get if Maya got her hands on that remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've made your joke at Mr. Justice's expense. Now where is his body? I'd like to be done with this as soon as possible.\" Despite being able to roll with the punches, Edgeworth did not like any of the logical implications the remote had. As soon as this was over, he would box away the whole experience into the corner of his mind which contained the psycho-locks he had once had to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny thing you should mention that now...\"</span></div></div>",

He flew toward the door as it opened and possessed the person on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Apollo was looking at Kay. His eyes immediately shot downward however, as he examined the body he had ended up in. He was finally back in his own body! After the days he just had, he never felt happier to be himself.

Who knows, maybe one day we'll find ourselves reliving the good old days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. Come along, Kay.

Now that he would be free to return to his body at anytime, he could even test out the different functions available on it.

It was a long process, but he was thankful that it was all done. It helped that he had some new friends to lend a hand - especially since these new friends included the royal family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Am I technically related to the Royal Family now? Nayuta's my step brother, and the princess <i>is</i> his sister...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill. however, there was one item that he couldn't let anyone else handle but himself: the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wright Anything Agency had largely left the device untouched since Wocky's little rampage with it. As far as Apollo could tell, Mr. Wright hadn't even told Athena about it. Trucy had goaded him into letting her try it once or twice, but even she agreed it was too dangerous to share with others after what happened between herself and Wesley. Apollo DID find a certain thief digging through his office one afternoon looking for it, but she quickly fled the scene and a quick call to Edgeworth dissuaded her from trying again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, the question remained as to what to do with it with Apollo gone from the office. Phoenix decided, it was best left with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'My faith in you has only grown over time, Apollo. If I thought it was safe with you back then, I feel so now too. Take it with you to Khura'in - who knows, you might need it.' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mr. Wright and Mr. Edgeworth arranged to have it flown to Khura'in privately, so that Apollo himself could personally retrieve and bring it to his new office. The building was a rebel safe house for quite some time, so Apollo reasoned he could find sa good hiding place for it there as he made his way to his workplace, hauling the box that contained the device the whole way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as he pushed open the door to his office, he found someone expecting him in the waiting room. </span></div></div>",

It had distressed Apollo to see the prosecutor so stern and unlike the boy he had known back when he defended Trucy in court. The barbs Nahyuta had thrown at him hurt, but the ones thrown at Trucy were still something he wouldn't forget. The awkwardness between the two surfaced sometimes, even though Apollo had come to accept and forgive the total change of face Nahyuta had undergone in order to keep Rayfa from being expelled from the royal family. Besides, he knew that one day Trucy would pay Nahyuta back in full, and it would probably be funny when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahyuta made a move to dismiss his guards. Apollo knew that the guards would still be very close by, but he felt it was sufficient for a private enough environment. \"Father's office...it's nice to see it in working condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...sure was a lot of work cleaning away decades of dirt, but it really looks like it paid off. I think Dhurke would have liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder, though, is it really wise to have half the building still in a decrepit state?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahlbi and Datz made sure that it's safe enough.

Between her training as a spirit medium, her time learning about the various government ministries, and her services in court, Apollo found it quite unusual for Rayfa to come visit in her rather rare spare time. The future ruler of Khura'in was a young woman that Apollo still didn't know quite how to act around apart from a. Personality-wise, she was a typical teenage girl, with a moodiness that Apollo was quite glad that Trucy lacked. There was a childish side of her that surfaced whenever discussions surrounding the Plumed Punisher arose (a ripoff of the Steel Samurai, but no one would dare say that to her face). Yet she understood quite well the weight of the power she would step into when the time came, and she was earnestly working her hardest to become the best queen she could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards.

He was always the prankster of the bunch, stirring up trouble for Apollo and Nahyuta to reign in. The man had a very carefree, joking personality normally, but he had been attracted to Dhurke's cause and had proven himself to be one of the most valuable members of the Defiant Dragons.

For one, he had promised the late Tahrust Inmee that he would look after the abbot's wife and son after his death, the tragedy which had ignited the movement against the Ga'ran regime. In memory of Dhurke, he helped Ahlbi manage the part of the office which had been preserved as the former headquarters of the Defiant Dragons. And for those who ran into trouble in Khura'in, he directed those who needed legal help to the part transformed into the Justice Law Offices, as most of the attorneys that were still alive to be freed following Ga'ran's fall largely decided not to return to law. The precious few considering to continue as lawyers still needed time to be recertified, so Apollo was still the only practicing lawyer in the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Datz didn't abandon his penchant for troublemaking despite his many roles. If anything, he seemed to have upped his pranking to keep spirits up as many still mourned the loss of Dhurke.

The man was often busy with all sorts of work, as expected from being the temporary head of state on top of his duties as a prosecutor. Datz wondered when was the last time Nahyuta did anything unrelated to all his duties and figured that his old friend needed something to spice up his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Yuty would appreciate a change of pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot entirely sure what he would do, Datz nonetheless set out to find Nahyuta. He typically kept to a very rigid schedule, and right about now would be the time when he investigated past cases up for imminent retrial with his investigative partner, Ema Skye. Datz didn't really know much about Ema besides her role in the police and that she was a friend of Apollo. Yet even he could tell from his limited encounters with her that she had chemistry with Nahyuta. Maybe getting her involved somehow would help Nahyuta loosen up some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDatz soon found the two discussing something about whatever case they were working on. He found a place to hide and put some more thought into how he would use the remote. The whole point of this was to mess with Nahyuta and get him out of his ordinary routine. As such, he immediately rule out the unaware swap function. Sure, it would be entertaining to see the two act normally despite being in each other's bodies, but that wouldn't really do the job. What remote function did he plan on using?</span></div></div>",

While he had been at the palace a few times because of Shah'do, he was pretty sure he wasn't <i>supposed</i> to be there any of those times. Because of that, he made extra sure to never be seen whenever Shah'do came running here. He made sure to hide in a bush when he arrived, no one should be able to see him from here. As he hid in the bush, Ahlbi thought about who to use the remote on. There were three potential people living at the palace who he was willing to switch with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was prosecutor Nahyuta Sahdmadhi. Nahyuta was not only a member of the Khura'in royal family, he was a respected monk. Ahlbi wanted to be a monk when he grew up, why not use the remote on Nahyuta and try out being one for at least a day. The privileges of being a member of the royal family would be a nice bonus too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second person was the princess, Rayfa Padma Khura'in. Rayfa was one of, if not the most, beloved people in the entire kingdom. If he became her, he would become the princess of the kingdom and have all the respect that comes with it. The thought of going from a poor citizen to being successor to the throne was very tempting for him. An added bonus that swapping with Rayfa is that Rayfa was much closer to his age than the other two choices, so he wouldn't have to adjust to being much older<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third option was Queen Amara. She had only recently been revealed to be alive. She was currently helping Rayfa rule the country until Rayfa learned how to channel spirits. If swapping with Rayfa was tempting because he'd become successor to the throne, then swapping with Amara was 10 times more tempting, because swapping with her would make him ruler of the entire kingdom. However, part of him didn't want to swap with Amara. He felt too much respect for the beloved queen, using the remote on her felt wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of thinking, Ahlbi chose to use the remote on...</span></div></div>",

Earlier he had been at the Wright Anything Agency trying to inquire the secret of Trucy Wright's magic panties trick. She was instantiate on keeping it to herself, but he was persistent. However, before he could inquire the panties secret, there had been a strange flash in the room and he had suddenly found himself in the body of Trucy Wright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had all happened earlier in the day. Wesley had spent most of the day as Trucy Wright. This had truly been a mysterious day, however, this situation could be full of opportunity. Not only could he attempt to find out the secret of her panties without any risk of getting into trouble, but he could end up being the first person to ever academically study 'Body Swapping'. Of course, he was sure that he was the only person that 'Body Swapping' ever occurred to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went and located the Magic Panties inside the Wright Anything Agency a little while after he had been put into Trucy's body. Unfortunately, despite many hours of trying to figure out how she did it. The secret to the magic trick was still out of his grasp. Of course, he wasn't going to give up yet, he would study these panties until he found all their secrets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the day, Trucy's cell phone rang several times. Wesley had been so persistent in his studies that he didn't realize that it was technically his phone now. Once he had checked it he noticed that their were several missed calls from numbers labeled 'Daddy' and 'Vera' Wesley reasoned that the first one was Trucy's father's number, however, he had no idea who the second number belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked out of a window of the Agency and noticed how late it had gotten, he had completely forgot to keep track of time. He supposed it was time to head home, or rather, head to Trucy's home. He knew where it was......for academic reasons. He headed out the door and made his way to the her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there he was greeted by Trucy's father, who was worried since she hadn't picked up is phone calls. Wesley assured Mr. Wright that he was fine and made his way to Trucy's bedroom. He had no interest in associating with Mr. Wright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was in Trucy's bedroom, he made a way for her bed and laid down. While the day hadn't been particularly long or exhausting to him. He had an odd feeling that tomorrow would be a long day, since it would be his first full day in Trucy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Wesley had woken up to a semi-familiar ringtone. It was that of Trucy's phone. He figured that after not picking it up at all yesterday, he should at least answer a few of her phone calls. \"Hello? Wes- Trucy Wright speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was on the phone?</span></div></div>",

It was only natural that many reporters wanted to question her. \"So, you wanted me and Trucy to come over and help you?\" Apollo asked her.

No, not at all dear, I'm fine,\" she replied with a smile, \"just a minor headache is all. Spent too much time out in the sun today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinfred gave a glad smile back, \"well, you'll feel better after tonight. I've already arranged for someone to keep an eye on Wocky, so we'll have the night to ourselves to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's lovely dear,\" Plum said back, \"I have to go get ready and freshen up. I'll be back in just a moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Mrs. Kitaki, you can't be serious right now!'</i> Apollo complained mentally as she quickly maneuvered into the bedroom. <i>'This is a dire situation!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush yourself,\" Plum said aloud, turning her head towards a nearby mirror in order to address Apollo more 'directly'. \"This has been a nightmarish day for me, and now that I have control over my body again, I'm not about to give it back over to you so you can ruin my anniversary. I know my husband and son are safe, and for now that's all I need to know, and I need you to be quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Apollo had no option but to watch from Plum's eyes while she prepared herself for her night with her husband. Having his (well, technically her) body move outside of his power was a surprisingly frightening experience. No matter how much he seemed to focus, it didn't seem like he could turn the tables back around like Plum herself did. To his displeasure, Plum took the time to disrobe and shower herself off, forcing Apollo into silence again when he tried to object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, finally. Needed to refresh after all that walking around,\" she said with a relieved sigh after she stepped out of the shower, quickly putting on a robe. \"I don't think you appreciate what I've gone through today Mr. Justice. All these different people walking about in this hot weather using my body like some sort of jogging suit, I swear...\" she murmured as she sat down in front of a large makeup table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I think my day has been just as bad, thank you very much,'</i> Apollo replied sardonically, already rather traumatized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum gave a sharp laugh in reply as she applied makeup to her eyebrows. \"Oh don't be so dramatic.

He had every reason to freak out and panic right now, what with him suddenly becoming a woman, losing 20 years off his life, and gaining more weight than he dared to estimate. However, panicking wasn't going to get him back into his own body, so despite the oddity of the situation, he did his best to remain calm and think things through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever was in his body right now, and was previously in Plum's, was clearly behind this. Plum had already been acting rather strangely before the swap occurred, and that same odd behaviour had been coming from his own body after the swap. There was also the fact that whoever it was didn't seem surprised or shocked by what had happened, and immediately reached for that strange device Apollo had found held in Plum's hand. That device must have been what caused the swap. Apollo couldn't help but wonder how far down the chain he was. The person who swapped with him wasn't acting like Plum, so it seemed clear that whoever it was had swapped with her first, before coming to his office and swapping with him. But then, where was Plum now? How many other swaps had this person performed, displacing everyone into incorrect bodies along the way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo knew he needed to get that device back from this body snatcher. He had no intention of spending the rest of his life as Plum Kitaki. That said, he couldn't just waltz in and demand his body back. There wasn't much he could do with Plum's hefty frame to combat his old body, but perhaps intimidation could work. Although he didn't appear to have it with him right now, Apollo knew Plum typically carried a broom with a hidden blade. Perhaps he could threaten the body snatcher with that? Of course, he had no intention of actually cutting his old body, but he didn't really know how else he'd be able to get that device so he could get his body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo guessed the broom was probably back at Kitaki Mansion. It wasn't too much of a walk over there from the office, but Apollo had a feeling it was going to feel a lot longer in Plum's body. With a heavy sigh, Apollo began to walk off, hoping the body snatcher wouldn't leave with his body before he could get back.</span></div></div>",

No one in the home had any particular reason to look in there, so Wocky figured it was safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed the drawer and looked up, Wocky caught a glance of his new reflection in the mirror.

The last time he'd gone to the park, he ended up being tried for a murder, but he figured that his luck was turning around with this device. <i>'After all, won't be Wocky walkin' 'round the park,'</i> he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating outside, Wocky noted that the sun would feel great if he actually had skin. Eager to get some air, he began to scan the field for some potential candidates. His eyes were drawn to what seemed to be a crowd assembling around a small stage, people clapping and cheering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for my last trick!\" a voice shouted, \"I'm going to saw my assistant <i>in half</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was familiar. Floating over, Wocky caught sight of who it belonged to. It was Trucy, that girl who kept following his lawyer around. He had taken to calling her 'Shorty' while they were acting as his defense though. Speaking of his lawyer, he caught sight of the guy looking resigned as he climbed into a big, wheeled box. Wocky guessed that when there were no cases to solve, he was <i>her</i> assistant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople oo'ed and awe'd as the girl took the saw through the box. Apollo, for his part, seemed anxious about the whole thing. Wocky supposed it was a neat trick, but it was hard to be amazed by anything she was doing while he had this in his hands. Either of them could make acceptable targets, if only for the fact that Wocky actually knew their names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the crowd, he managed to catch a few more faces he recognized from his court trial. One in particular was the lady who served as the detective, clad in a white coat with those weird red glasses over her forehead. She seemed to be off duty, clapping politely along with the crowd. Wocky would have laughed if he had a voice; the idea of him possessing a cop was hilarious. The irony of it was hard to pass up; not to mention, she was pretty attractive in her own right.

Everything went black for a second, but when he came to he was standing where the detective lady was. He looked down at himself and saw that it had worked. He was in her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything felt different. He felt her long hair touching the back and the completely different proportions of her body. There was a purse on his shoulder, he wouldn't be caught dead with a purse if he was in his own body. He felt the pink glasses on top of his head. In his hand he felt the remote, it must have came with him when he used the possession button. He put it in the purse that was now on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trucy finished her show she ran up to Wocky. \"Thanks again for coming to my show Ema! I told you I could get Polly into the box if pestered enough!\" She said with a tip of her hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky was thankful that Trucy came to talk to him, it gave him a chance to figure out the Ema's name. \"Tru dat, Shorty. Next time ya put Attorney-man in a box, make sure I'm around to see.\" He said. He new nothing about Ema, so he didn't even attempt to act anything like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy was taken aback at 'Ema's' strange behavior and way of speaking. \"Are you okay Ema? You're acting a bit...different.\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, nothin' wrong with me. Same as I've always been\u2026You know what I\u2019m saying?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no.\" Trucy said. \"But it you say you're okay, who am I to question it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy and Wocky's conversation was cut short as Apollo yelled for Trucy. \"Oh yeah, I forgot to take Polly out of the box. See you later Ema!\" Trucy said with a wave as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky stood around for a few seconds wondering what to do now. He couldn't go back to his home right, since he wasn't himself right now. He could go to Ema's home, she probably had her address written down somewhere in her purse. Alternatively, he could stay at people park for now. Not much to do here, but Trucy and Apollo were here, so he may be able to find something to do with them.</span></div></div>",

Shorty was fun and all, but he was willing to bet that his lawyer would bring down the mood the moment he got out of that box. Apollo helped him get out of a jam, but Wocky didn't like attorneys as a rule. They're all sticks in the mud! Not to mention they're all a bit too keen on following the law. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited at the prospect of going on an excursion, he opted to go to the parking lot to track down Ema's car. To his disappointment, however, Ema's vehicle was actually pretty standard. He had been hoping for a cop car, but he guessed that it would be silly for a detective to drive a police vehicle while technically off-duty. He had been wanting to blare the sirens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick shuffle through Ema's purse revealed her car keys, in addition to her police badge and her driver's license. \"Sweet! All pretty useful,\" he said as he climbed into the driver's seat, ready to take Ema's car for a joyride. Another upside: no one could charge him for taking this lady's car if he was her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, until they passed a law against body theft.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short drive later, Wocky found himself in Ema's home. It was modest, but still decent. He guessed she must be paid a fair wage by the size of the apartment. It was brightly colored, but rather messy. Ema had little nick-knacks ornamenting the main living area, and bags of weird powders and liquids were strewn about her kitchen. A brief smell of it was enough for Wocky to realize they weren't for cooking. He didn't recognize most of their labels, but their names sounded like something out of a lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't for the badge I'd think she was a scientist,\" Wocky said to himself as he looked down at the white labcoat she had on. Her whole getup was starting to bother him the more he thought about it. \"About as tight as she probably is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsently, Wocky tossed off the labcoat and the tie that Ema was wearing, leaving them on a couch with her purse. He began to remove the vest too as he entered the door to what appeared to be her bedroom. Looking in a mirror, he began to examine Ema's face, wowed by his new form. \"Damn, she looks fiiine,\" he muttered, laughing at the sound of his voice. \"Could get used to this I guess,\" he said as he crossed his arms. By this point, he was wearing her button up and slacks, and his attention went down to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could take or leave the shoes though,\" he said aloud as he kicked off Ema's heels, breathing a sigh of relief. He didn't realize how much they were bugging him until they were gone. It was surprising he had managed to go for so long without getting rid of them; might've just been the wonder of the remote distracting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, Wocky couldn't help but think that Ema's look was overall just too plain and uptight. \"I bet I could make a G outta her,\" he announced as he fiddled with her hair. He didn't regard her privacy much at all as he began to rifle through her wardrobe, looking for something more his speed to wear. He had to be true to himself even when he was someone else, after all. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ema's clothes were generally plain, but he soon found some clothes that he could wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a pair of jeans with ripped holes with them. He spent a while looking for a T-shirt with the Bad Badger on it, unfortunately it didn't seem like Ema owned one. In fact, she didn't seem to own any kind of shirts that he liked. Shrugging it off he grabbed the closest thing he could find to his Bad Badger shirt, a Pink Badger shirt. He didn't want to wear it, but there wasn't exactly many things he could choose from. In terms of shoes he found some sandals, much better than the heeled shoes that he was wearing a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off the clothes that Ema was currently wearing and put on the clothes that he picked out. He took a few looks at Ema's body in the mirror as he changed clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was all changed he went over to Ema's purse with the remote in it. He didn't necessarily want to take a purse, but the purse had plenty of useful stuff in it, like Ema's car keys and the remote itself. He decided to take the purse, but make it a little more his style. He looked around Ema's apartment for a pair of scissors. Once he found some he began to cut up holes in the purse, not big enough for anything to fall out though. He made it seem worn out. He didn't particularly care what Ema would think after he left her body, it wasn't his purse after all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done he put the purse over his shoulder and looked at Himself in the mirror again, satisfied with his handy work. Now that he had changed Ema's look, he thought about what to do next. As he thought about what to do....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Knock Knock</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Wocky asked as his head turned away from the mirror, hearing a knock from the other room \"The hell could that be?\" Ema had only been at the park like, a half hour ago before Wocky took her over. Was she really expecting visitors so soon? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat frustrated, Wocky left Ema's bedroom and made his way to the front door. He looked through the peephole and saw yet another familiar face: that blonde pretty-boy from the trial. The prosecutor! Wocky remembered now - the guy was some sort of pop star/attorney combo or something like that. It sounded a bit wild, and honestly lame at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ignorin' me in their Fraulein?\" the voice called from behind the door? \"C'mon! You said you'd go, right? Don't back out on me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh gross,please don't let this guy be her boyfriend,'</i> Wocky prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be the last concert the Gavinners do as a band,\" Klavier continued, \"I wouldn't want a friend to miss it, even one with a temper like yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat calmed Wocky's fears a little bit. Looking down at himself, he supposed he had inadvertently dressed Ema in more concert appropriate attire anyways. With a sigh, he called out, \"yeah yeah jus' a sec man.\" He unlocked the door and opened it up to face Klavier, who seemed surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Fraulein Detective, you certainly look different off duty,\" Klavier said with a thumbs up as he looked Wocky's new outfit over. \"Didn't think you had a fun bone in your body. Heck, you're even wearing one of those silly mascots shirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky leaned Ema's head back and spoke a bit disdainfully, \"what of it? Can't dress however I like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlavier just laughed in response. \"Nah, I think the look suits you. Now c'mon, let me give you a ride.\" For some reason, Klavier's approval was making Wocky uncomfortable. He guessed that he didn't have any real plans to follow through in this body though, and reluctantly followed the prosecutor out to his car. Luckily enough, his hostility was apparently the norm for this woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like ages, the two arrived at the concert hall, and Wocky couldn't be more grateful. He swung his feet off the dashboard and immediately jumped out the vehicle after it was parked. This guy was bad enough when he was trying to put Wocky in prison; he was worse when trying to be Wocky's friend! He babbled away the whole car ride about music and other topics Wocky didn't care about. Wocky was now sure he wasn't Ema's boyfriend, but he felt Klavier was getting a bit too flirty during that car ride. He might've been using a girl's body, but he didn't care to have a guy ask him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait up there!\" Klavier called as he walked to catch up with Wocky. \"I got the passes, you need them to get backstage,\" he continued as he pulled a small ID card from his pocket for Wocky to use. \"Now follow me, I know where to go,\" he said confidently with a snap of his fingers as he pointed towards the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he put the pass away in Ema's purse, it suddenly occurred to Wocky that he didn't have to put up with this guy to enjoy the concert. He had the pass now, so he could just go where-ever! Not to mention, he had the remote. If he wanted, he could just leave Ema's body and go for a different target. He'd started to acclimate a bit after changing around her outfit, but he was sure there were better candidates anyways. He could also just mess with Klavier and use the remote on him directly. It didn't particularly matter which, so long as he got the pretty boy out of his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wocky had no idea what he'd do on his own as this lady, so he hovered around the park as Trucy and Apollo cleaned up the stage. It took Trucy a minute or so just to get Apollo out of the box, much to the lawyer's frustration and Wocky's amusement. That guy had helped him out of a tight spot, but Wocky couldn't help but laugh at him from Ema's body. Lawyer's were uptight! He needed some levity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the two had everything taken down and put away. \"Hey Ema, you mind helping us carry these back to the office?\" Apollo asked as he wheeled away the box he had been trapped in a moment before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Uh, sure man,\" Wocky replied with Ema's voice. \"What'cha need done?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo raised an eyebrow, more than a bit confused by Ema's tone, but pushed it aside. \"Uh, well, there's a crate full of props over there,\" he said, gesturing to the steps leading up to the stage. \"If you can grab those for us, we won't need to make a second trip.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right, whateva,\" Wocky said as he headed over to the box, heaving it up with Ema's arms. It wasn't a particularly heavy object, but if he were in his real body right now he bet he would barely be able to carry it all the way back to his room let alone some office. It felt good to do something physical! \"Lead the way G!\" he called to Apollo as he followed behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk later, the three of them ended up at the Wright Anything Agency. Wocky had never been here before, despite being a client. His former fiance had hired his lawyer for him, in fact. He was examining the messy place with curiosity, placing the box in the center of the room without much care. He was surprised that someplace like this would be a law firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong Ema?\" Trucy asked, \"this shouldn't be the first time you've been here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky turned his head back at them, Ema's hair flicking over her shoulder, \"yeah yeah its coo'. Just, uh, looking at your props and all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're feeling fine, Ema?\" Apollo asked. \"You're... speaking strangely. Something up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo raised Ema's arms up defensively. \"Yo! I'm fine, now step off, for real. I don't 'preciate you guys gettin' up in my grill. So, what're we going to do now that the stuff's all packed off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Apollo mumbled as he ran his hands through his hair taken aback, \"we were about to head over to the Borscht Bowl for a bite to eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy raised up a hand in excitement, \"Daddy's playing piano there tonight! We figured we'd visit him. You're welcome to come along.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Wocky replied, glad to get the chance to go eating somewhere other than the home. He let Apollo and Trucy lead the way out of the agency as he thought over his plan of action. He could keep accompanying these two, lying low so that he could keep using this lady's body - maybe have some fun later as a cop- or he could have some fun now with the remote. These two were getting all over his case about acting strangely, how about he use the device on them to see how they like it? He didn't even have to reveal who he was if he did, he could just switch them around and play dumb about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich did he decide to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He clicked the aware swap button at each of them. In an instant both of them stumbled where they stood. It took them a moment to notice what happened. Once they did they looked down at themselves and then each other in silence. It was obvious that the swapped had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! You two okay?\" Wocky said, pretending that he didn't know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring at each other in utter shock for a few more seconds Apollo in Trucy's body spoke up \"Um, Ema, me and Tru-Apollo forgot something at the office. Can you wait here for a minute?\" He said as he began to pull Trucy in his body by the arm to the office. Leaving Wocky alone in the hallway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went into the office, Wocky couldn't help laughing. He had a feeling that tonight was going to be pretty interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the office Apollo and Trucy were freaking out. \"What happened Polly!?!\" Trucy yelled at him. She was feeling around herself, shocked to have a male body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was acting similarly \"I have no idea!\" He said, equally shocked. What could have possibly have made him swap bodies with Trucy? He had heard that Mr. Wright had worked with ghosts or something like that, maybe that was the cause? As much as he wanted to swap back he had no idea how to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they kept thinking about the situation, five minutes passed. \"Ema's still waiting for us in the hall.\" Trucy said. \"Should we tell her what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo thought about it for a few seconds, then he shook his head no \"Would she even believe us if we told her? Let's just continue the day as normal as we can, acting like each other, then ask Mr. Wright for help when we get back, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy didn't particularly like the idea, but she didn't exactly have any choice. \"Fine, hopefully daddy can help us.\" Trucy said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went back to the hallway where Wocky in Ema's body was waiting for them. \"Yo! What took ya' so long. I'm hungry!\" He said impaitently. This was going to be a long day</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully, the possessed Ema and an uncomfortable Trucy and Apollo made it to the Borscht Bowl without being impeded. Wocky found himself snickering the whole way at how awkward the two were acting in eachother's bodies. Trucy was walking as stiff as a board, as though every movement was creeping her out. Apollo, for his part, kept pulling at the hem of Trucy's skirt, feeling excessively exposed with his legs to the wind. Wocky wasn't in a huge place to critique their acting, as he wasn't behaving like Ema at all, but they were far too distracted to notice Ema's strange behavior anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe switched up trio got a few odd looks from the waiter as they were sat at a table. Wocky was tripping up on Ema's heels, Trucy kept fidgeting about with Apollo's hair, and Apollo himself struggled to straighten out Trucy's dress as he sat down in his chair. Wocky looked up to the stage and eventually managed to catch a glance at another familiar face; that scruffy guy who seemed to hang around Apollo. Was that his boss? He was dressed in a hoodie and a loos cap; hardly seemed like something a lawyer would wear. <i>'Why couldn't I get that guy? Seems more laid back.' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wright's piano playing was, however, mediocre at best. Wocky did his best to ignore it, and instead focused on his menu. Trucy and Apollo didn't even give theirs a glance, and instead waited intently for Wright to finish his 'performance'. The moment the piano stopped playing, they got up from their seats and made their way to the stage, leaving 'Ema' behind at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Grape juice' huh....\" Wocky muttered to himself as he continued to flip through the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy and Apollo reached the stage just as Phoenix was stepping down to greet them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there! You two come to visit?\" Phoenix asked with a grin as he approached. \"Its a pleasant surprise either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wright, can we talk in another room? This is important,\" Apollo said in a low breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wright? Why are you talking to me like I'm your boss sweety?\" Phoenix asked confused at who he thought was his daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry, 'Daddy',\" Apollo recovered, \"but we need somewhere private to talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked to 'Apollo' who silently nodded in agreement with 'Trucy'. Phoenix shrugged, \"alright then, follow me. Move quickly though,\" he said as he led them down to one of the Borscht Bowl's secret room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am are you sure that you need another drink?\" The waiter asked as 'Detective Skye' ordered another bottle of grape juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! I don't come into your crib to tell you how to live yo' life!\" Wocky shot back. \"Now bring me my order!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, right away,\" the waiter replied, not willing to escalate the encounter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky grinned as the man scurried off. It was nice being back on the town, even if he wasn't himself. Getting to throw some weight around as this cop lady was fun! Ema herself probably wouldn't be all that pleased with Wocky's behavior, but that was partially why Wocky took her body in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd Shorty and Law-man run off to anyways? Was fun watching them freak out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying you switched bodies?\" Phoenix asked, his tone becoming more serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Trucy-as-Apollo exclaimed. \"You believe us, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought about it, \"I've seen a lot of crazy things in my day. It'd be hypocritical to not give you two the benefit of doubt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you know what might be causing it!?\" Apollo asked loudly. \"What if there's a case? Trucy doesn't have a law degree! And I can't saw people in half!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix covered his ears at that. \"Okay, I definitely believe you guys now. Only Apollo would yell like that.

Not only that, but the remote had vanished! \"Where'd it go?!\" He shouted. Being in Ema's body for a while was fun, but being stuck in it because the remote was gone was not something he even wanted to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, Apollo and Trucy were both freaking out. It didn't take a genius to figure out that the remote was what had swapped them. All three of them searched the table and the floor around it to make sure that they didn't drop it during their struggle. None of them took notice to the fact that Phoenix's body looked at them strangely and had walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile above them, Phoenix was freaking out. Somehow he had become some kind of ghost and his own body had just walked away without him. After calming down he thought the situation through. He figured that Wocky in Ema's body must have planned to use this to escape. He probably used this to get into Ema's body in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the mis-bodied trio below him looking for the remote. Where did it go? He was sure that he was holding it when he and the other were struggling for it, how did it vanish? Deciding to help them search for it he flew toward his own body and was about to repossess it, but he hesitated. If he just went back to his own body for now and helped look for the remote and ended up finding it, then they would just end up in the same struggle for the remote again. He thought, unaware that the remote would appear with him when he possessed a body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he got an idea, he could possess someone else while helping look for the remote. If he was someone else and Trucy and Apollo convinced his old body to help look for the remote along with them, then that may turn the tables if they ended up in another struggle with Wocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, Phoenix saw there was really only one person that he could really possess right now. Olga Orly, who had taken a job at the Borscht Bowl after being a witness at his trial. While possessing her would help him with his plan, it did seem like a breach of her privacy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thinking quickly, Phoenix settled on possessing Olga. It would give him an element of surprise over Wocky and might also help him get some control over the situation since Olga was an employee. Patrons were staring at the 4 others struggling and fighting amongst themselves, and Phoenix worried that Olga would go look for a manager or something if he left her to her devices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She owes me one anyways,'</i> Phoenix reason, recalling the poker game she tried to rig. He pushed himself towards her body as she watched the scuffle, causing her to shudder as his consciousness took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened as he took Olga's body surprised Phoenix... other than being a woman. As he took stock of her body, nearly tripping on her heels, he realized that Wocky's device was now in his hands! Had it left his body with him? However it happened, this dramatically simplified things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three!\" he called out to Wocky, Trucy, and Apollo, \"why don't you come with me.\" He held up the remote, making it clear to them where it was. All of them seemed simultaneously surprised and worried to see the remote in Olga's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Orly,\" Apollo began cautiously from Trucy's body, \"we - we need that, please just hand it over to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Hell naw, give it to me,\" Wocky asserted from inside Ema, pushing Apollo aside. He approached Phoenix aggressively, only stopping once Phoenix pointed the remote at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about not,\" Phoenix replied coldly, \"like I said, you three follow me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wright?! That's you?\" Apollo exclaimed, surprised as 'Olga' explained what happened to the three of them now that they were all back in the bar's basement room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... right,\" Phoenix replied. \"Somehow the device was used on me, and I got thrown out of my body. I ended up taking over Olga's,\" he gestured downwards towards his current form. \"My own body seems to be acting almost deliberately ignorant of all this, so I guess we're all displaced.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them managed to subdue Wocky-in-Ema, tying her down to a chair at the poker table. Thankfully, there were all sorts of props left around the room for ambiance, a big coil of rope being one of them. \"Yo! This is whack, let me out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shot Wocky a glare, \"We know its you in there now, Wocky. I've already used the device.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky turned his head away with a scowl. However, his face went a bit smug as he kept on talking, \"well so what? What are you going to do about it now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'What are we going to do about it?', we have your remote thing!\" Trucy shot back. \"We'll just push you out of her body!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a grim look overtook Phoenix's borrowed face as he considered Wocky's words. \"It might not be that simple, Trucy,\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not Mr. Wright?\" Apollo asked, feeling a bit weird addressing a con woman as his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he used the same function as me,\" Phoenix explained, \"then all we could do to him is send him out of Ema. But we can't control where he'd go after that - he could take over one of us or someone else entirely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo seemed frustrated, \"well, what do we do then?! We can't just leave him there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, we should fix the two of you,\" Phoenix replied as he turned to the swapped Trucy and Apollo. \"I'd prefer my daughter and my protege separate after all,\" he said with a wry smile as he looked over the remote. He found a function labeled 'aware swap', and used it on Apollo and then Trucy. The two of their faces went blank for a moment, but when they collected their senses, they both breathed a sigh of relief to be back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Phoenix continued, \"I get the feeling that Wocky here didn't intend to stay as Ema.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I won't leave until I get that thing back!\" he shot back defiantly, struggling with Ema's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo moved back to hold him down while Phoenix thought over the situation, idly rubbing the back of his neck. \"Actually Wocky, I think we could outlast you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Both Apollo and Wocky replied at the same time. \"Mr. Wright, you aren't just going to let him stay in her body, are you? He can't be trusted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix nodded, \"no, we just give him some of his own treatment. The device makes your body operate without you in it, so one of us could use it to take over Ema's body while he's still in it. It's not a great solution, but I'm sure she'd prefer one us in her body compared to him walking around with it. I'm sure after a few missing days - maybe weeks! - Wocky'll crack. If not, well, we'll have time to come up with a new solution.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah wait!\" Wocky shouted with Ema's voice, \"that ain't cool at all! You can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should probably get to talking about the device and how it works!\" Trucy bumped in, \"unless you want to be stuck in there! Why'd you even take over Ema's body? What did she do to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky gritted Ema's teeth for a second. In all reality, he didn't care that much for Ema's body, but he was often defiant for the sake of it. If he backed down now, they'd probably find a way to put him back to normal, and he might never get the remote back. Not to mention, he'd seem weak! The idea of getting possessed and essentially being a prisoner in Ema's body was almost enough to make him consider giving up though. They had to be bluffing though - they wouldn't really do that... right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately Wocky...</span></div></div>",

He also told them all about the remote's buttons and what each of them did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to his story, Apollo couldn't help but feel some sympathy for Wocky's situation. He was very lucky to even get the bullet removed and he couldn't even enjoy that. However, that didn't give him any right to take Ema's body. Who knows how long he would have stayed in it if Mr. Wright hadn't figured out he had taken her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's thoughts were interrupted as Trucy spoke up. \"What do we do now, Daddy? How are we going to get Wocky out of Ema's body?\" She asked Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's the problem. From what I understand the only way to control who Wocky would possess if we used the possession button on him is his own choice of who to possess.\" Phoenix explained, trying to think up a way around this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dat's right and I ain't goin' back to bein' me til I'm I want to!\" Wocky said smuggly, although his smugness had less effect due to him being tied to a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix, Apollo, and Trucy all tried to think of what to do. There was no way they could convince Wocky to go back to his own body with because of it's current state, but they couldn't let him stay in Ema's body. With how he was acting as her, it was only a matter of time before he ruined her career as a police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence, Trucy spoke up with an idea. \"Maybe we could compromise?\" She began to say, getting a curious looks from Phoenix, Apollo, and Wocky. \"Wocky can't stay in Ema's body, so we could just have him leave it and possess someone else. Someone we can keep an eye on to make sure he dosen't ruin their reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the idea wasn't exactly the best possible scenario for them, Phoenix and Apollo couldn't think of any other idea. \"But who should we let him possess? We can't have him take of the body of anyone we know, we wouldn't be able to keep our eye on him then.\" Apollo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that leaves one of us.\" Phoenix said. \"One of us could give up our body for Wocky to possess.\" He turned to Wocky. \"That sound good to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky clenched his teeth, knowing he didn't have any real say in the matter. \"Fine, I'll be one of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now just sit there while we decide which of us you'll possess. Also, don't think about possessing someone other than us, we still have the remote and we know that you don't want to lose it.\" Phoenix told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Mr. Wright,\" Apollo interrupted Phoenix \"Were you serious about Possessing Wocky for weeks earlier?\" He asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix put a smile on Olga's face. \"If there's one thing I've learned in my seven years of poker playing, it's that whoever has the best bluff, wins the game.\" He said with confidence \"Now there's the important question, who's body should we let Wocky take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over for a while, one of the three of them volunteered themselves, who was it?</span></div></div>",

You can use my body so long as you leave Ema.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky's eyes lit up, \"really Shorty? You'd do that for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so much for you as for Ema,\" she retorted. \"But sure, however you want to look at it. Go ahead and untie him Apollo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short period of time later, a confused Ema was walking out of the Borscht Bowl, not sure how she arrived there. Olga Orly similarly woke up, apparently having dozed off for a few minutes. She was a bit startled by it all, but quickly got back to work when she noticed the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were back to normal, but now there was a new thing different. \"Yo Attorney Man, you really got to be tailin' me all the way back home?\" 'Trucy' asked, annoyed while a disturbed looking Apollo followed behind. They were a few blocks from the Borsht Bowl now, having left Phoenix behind while Apollo showed Wocky the way to Phoenix and Trucy's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wright wouldn't exactly like it if I let a stranger run off with his daughter's body,\" Apollo replied dryly. \"Besides, 'Trucy', you're only 16. You shouldn't be walking home alone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky replied with a grunt, pulling his arms behind his head as he kept on walking, knocking Trucy's hat to the side. \"You're no fun at all, lawyer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Apollo, now hurry it up, it'll be dark soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the Borscht Bowl, Phoenix was staying behind to help out Olga, feeling a bit sorry for taking that time from her. He was stacking up chairs and putting away dishes as they closed up for the night. The remote was still safely in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, appreciate it, Mr. Wright,\" she said, a bit uncomfortable around Phoenix due to their brief past. \"I'm not really sure what happened back there - I've never blacked out like that before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Phoenix said, \"these things happen. You're okay and nothing was broken, so its fine, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess so. You have a good night, I guess,\" Olga said as the two parted ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Olga out of sight, Phoenix turned his attention back to the remote. He had opted to help Olga so that he'd have an excuse to split off from the two of them. Trucy's body would keep him occupied, and Apollo could keep him under control. He could now use the moment alone to figure out how to use the remote and investigate its functions without Wocky trying to potentially sabotage him. \"I guess the best place to look would be Kitaki manor,\" he muttered to himself as he thumbed through the buttons. \"There could be more information he's not telling us. Maybe there's a function that's not obvious on the device... I have to look to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually Apollo and 'Trucy' made there way to the Wright residence, an apartment not far off from the office. Apollo suppose the two didn't need a whole lot of living space since they spent so much time at the office anyways. It was essentially just a kitchen and two bedrooms. The walls of the kitchen area were a rather bland off-white, without much in the way of decoration at all. It seemed rather tidy as well. Apollo was sort of surprised, given the way they treated the agency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I guess that place really is home to them,'</i> he thought idly as he looked around for any personal touches either of them might've put down. He would've thought he got the wrong apartment if Mr. Wright hadn't given him the keys to the place. His focus, however, was cut off as he heard a door shut along with a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Uh oh,'</i> he though as he walked down to the bedroom door. He tried to turn the knob only to find it locked. \"Wocky, what are you doing in there?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relaxin' in <i>my</i> room, take a chill,\" Wocky shot back from the other side in Trucy's voice. \"What'cha still doin' here anyways? You got your own place to be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wright, you 'father', told me to watch you,\" Apollo replied. \"Come one out and wait in the living area for him to get back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah!\" Wocky said, \"I'll wait here instead. You can run along.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was still shouting something at him from the other side of the door, but Wocky tuned him out. Trucy's bedroom was a bit less barren than the rest of the apartment. The walls were colored now - mostly pink - with a few posters here and there. Some of them seemed recent - one of them was for a band called the 'Gaviners' and even had a signature on it. Others seemed more vintage, mostly focusing on some old circus troupe or something called the 'Gramaryes'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Shorty must be a big fan, she dresses just like them,'</i> he thought to himself, looking down at the big cloak Trucy wore over her shoulders. It was beginning to annoy him, so he lifted it up and threw it on the bed along with the hat, surprised to hear a thud as it landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck?\" he looked through the cloak to find was seemed to be a wooden figure in the shape of a person...wearing its own cloak. \"Why on earth... how does she even wear that all the time? Shorty's definitely dedicated if nothin' else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky shook his head, turning over to the mirror. He couldn't believe he was wearing a dress, bu he supposed he would have to settle for whatever body they gave him while they had the remote. Without the cloak, it was clear that Trucy's dress lacked shoulder straps, and stopped just past the knees. \"Ha! Without the magician stuff on, Shorty looks like she could be ready to party,\" he said as he threw off her gloves too. He spun around to get a view of the dress from behind; other than the diamond studs, it was pretty normal overall. \"Wonder if there's anywhere around town a 'girl' can have some fun...\" he muttered, beginning to feel the boredom of this place set in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, Apollo's knocking on the door was getting harder to ignore. Couldn't that guy lighten up? Wocky was willing to bet that Apollo would lighten up if he also used the remote, but it'd be hard to talk him into it. The guy seemed way too stressed out! Was really a buzzkill. With a mischievous look, Wocky moved over to the window, looking down at the street below. The sidewalk seemed empty, and he was only two floors up. Trucy's body seemed acrobatic, probably as a result of the tricks she'd have to perform, so Wocky was willing to bet he could get down there without hurting himself. Once he was on the town, he could have some fun! Only problem was the attorney and Shorty's dad: they still had the remote. He wasn't sure what they'd do to him if he got caught while out, but he had stalemated them before, right? He could probably just pull the same card he did when he was in Ema's body. </span></div></div>",

The pose looked very uncharacteristic of Trucy, especially with the short dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo took a seat over by the kitchenette, since Wocky was taking up the whole couch, still holding a distrustful look on his face. \u201cWell do it faster next time.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAttorney man, you need to chill,\u201d Wocky replied, waving a hand dismissively. Suddenly, a smile came to his face as he got an idea.

I bet a new body would help you chill out. There ain't nothing in the world like it! Shorty's body feels great \u2013 lots of energy! Not a care in the world either.

Forget him! So long as you got the remote it don\u2019t matter what he thinks.

His wonder at the situation was cut short when he heard Pearl once again knock at the door \"Hello? Mr. Nick? Are you home?\" He heard her asked. He flew through the door, ready to possess her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl began to knock again, but her knock was cut short when Apollo's ghost like form flew into her body. Everything was black for a short while as Apollo's senses began to take over her body. Once Apollo was completely in control of Pearl's body, he felt the same unfamiliar sensations he felt when Wocky had swapped his and Trucy's bodies earlier in the day. He noticed that the remote had materialized in Pearl's hand after the possession<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had time to think about the differences in his body however, his own body answered the door. \"If you're looking for Mr. Wright, he should be down at-\" His own body began to say, but it was cut off by Wocky in Trucy's body running in front of it. \"Ah! Yo' finally here Pearl!\" Wocky said, he eyed the remote in Apollo's hand and gave a smile. He turned to Apollo's auto-pilot body \"Sorry 'Polly', but me and Pearl are goin' to have a, um, uh, a 'Girl's night out. Stay here, we'll be back late! Don'tchu think about leavin' my 'daddy' would be mad if he found out you didn't 'stay and watch us'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Apollo in Pearl's body could say anything, Wocky had grabbed his arm and was pulling him away from the door. Apollo took one glance back and saw his body closing the door, clearly annoyed by the situation as much as the real him was. He firmly planted his feet on the ground to make Wocky stop pulling him. \"Why would you do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky put his arms behind Trucy's head and gave out a chuckle. \"That apartment was cramped and boring with just the two of us. If I had to be stuck in there with two of ya, I woulda went crazy from boredom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just where are you planning to go right now?\" Apollo said, he crossed his arms over his chest, but put them down as he accidentally felt Pearl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know.....yet. Right now we're both teen girls. There's gotta be someplace around here we could have fun.\" Wocky mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo desperately wanted to go back right now, but he knew Wocky would not be satisfied with that.

Somehow, local criminal organizations thought he was an associate of the Cadaverinis ever since he had proven Furio Tigre's guilt in court over seven years ago. He had been worried at first that he might become a target of crime, but none of them had tried anything during that time period. He figured it was useful to have a seedy reputation if it could give him clout when he needed to deal with a less law-abiding crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Mr. Wright?

I just thought I'd stop by and make sure he's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum didn't buy that excuse for a second, but she didn't really want to mess with the man. Even if he decided not to involve his contacts in the legal world, Shelly de Killer still owed that man a debt, one she would rather not be called against her family. \"Fine, Mr. Wright. But please don't stay long. He needs his rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Kitaki. Could you show me the way to his room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum obliged, leading Phoenix to a room on the second floor before knocking. \"Wocky, are you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice came from inside. \"Yeah, Mom.

Phoenix Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lawyer-man's boss, right? What're you doin' here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something I need to get from here.\" Phoenix spotted an unusual looking pamphlet. \"That looks like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky looked at it suspiciously. \"Eh? When did that get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue, but it's exactly what I need. Do you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky seemed to tired to care. \"Do whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Wocky. Hope you get better soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix stepped out just as Plum came back. \"Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. Kitaki. Wocky seems like he'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum merely nodded, not trusting anything about the former lawyer. \"Are you leaving now, Mr. Wright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think I've stayed up past my bedtime. My daughter will probably be worried about me. Have a good evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix made his way back to his apartment he read through the manual to learn more about the remote.

Perhaps he shouldn't try to make Wocky go back to being himself, but make him want to <i>stop</i> being other people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option would be to experiment with the remotes functions and find a roundabout way to get Wocky back to being himself. Of course, the flaw with this play was that Phoenix would need to get someone else involved with the remote. While Phoenix considered getting Apollo to help him with this, the only reason Wocky was currently Trucy was because Apollo had his career to focus on and they couldn't have someone like Wocky going around in his body. Phoenix thought about who he should have help him experiment with the remote's functions. He had made quite a few friends over the years, he was sure that at least one of them would believe this insane story about a remote that switches bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Phoenix decide to do?</span></div></div>",

I suppose I'm not currently using it anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove them, they could hear the sound of the piano stop playing, followed by lukewarm applause. \"That was my last song for the night. Don't have any cardgames to tend to either, so I suppose now is the time,\" Phoenix said with a tone of resignation in Olga's voice. He had Apollo untie Wocky, who breathed a sigh of relief as he stretched Ema's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ema will probably be confused, so to minimize it, you guys go sit back at your table and act like nothing was wrong,\" Phoenix instructed, with Trucy, Apollo, and Wocky all nodding in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ema shook her head, confused. \"W-wasn't I at the park a second ago?\" she asked, her head spinning as her surroundings changed. Why was the taste of grape in her mouth? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, came out with us for dinner,\" Apollo said, suddenly to her left. \"After helping us carry the supplies back to the office, we invited you to the Borscht Bowl. You dozed off after a few bottles though - you seemed tired.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma looked to the table, seeing a few bottles of grape juice lying around. \"That's weird... I was feeling fine before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're glad you're okay now,\" Trucy interjected, all smiles. \"You worried us for a moment there. Anyways, we were all about to order.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" A new voice came in, belonging to a blonde woman in thick blue coat, a white apron draped down the front. She seemed to be the waitress, holding a notepad in her hand. \"Take your time though if you're tired.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'll need an extra moment to look at the menu,\" Ema replied, as she shook her head, very confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Mr. Wright, thanks for hearing me out man!\" 'Phoenix' said to 'Olga' excitedly as the 4 of them left the Borscht bowl after closing. Ema chose to part ways on her own, saying she needed to go clear her head. This was helpful, as Trucy, Apollo, and Wocky needed to wait for Phoenix to close up, seeing as how he was the waitress for the moment. \"You won't regret it, fo' real!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. No problem,\" Phoenix replied in an unenthusiastic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit silent until now, Apollo suddenly spoke up, \"well, what are you going to do now, Mr. Wright? If Wocky's using your body, that leaves you sort of out in the cold. You can't keep using Olga's body, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought it over as he looked down at Olga's gloved hands. \"Not sure how this woman doesn't die of heat stroke...\" he muttered. \"But on topic, I don't know, Apollo. Wocky's already using my body, so I don't have many places to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy leaned in to whisper, out of range of Wocky's hearing, \"if you do keep Olga, though, then we can keep the remote away from Wocky. If you possess someone close to the office, he might try to snatch it back up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix nodded a bit grimly at this, realizing it was a good point. They had gone out of the frying pan and into the oven - now Phoenix was the one short a body. What did he decide to do? </span></div></div>",

Is it really okay to take her body for awhile?\" Trucy asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it that much either, but it's not like we have much of a choice.

We can stay there tonight.\" Phoenix said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, boss-man.\" Wocky said. \"In case you didn't notice, you ain't yourself right now.\" He said using the same words Wright did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix had a bad feeling about this \"What's your point?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want no strange Russian lady in MY crib tonight\" Wocky mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny Wocky, now come on, let's get moving.\" Phoenix said as he continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No man, I'm serious. If ya gonna make me follow the rules of your body. Then yo are gonna act like that waitress chick! That means stayin' at her crib.\" Wocky said, although the real reason he didn't want Mr. Wright around tonight was so he could have an easy time sneaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was going to object to Wocky's demands, but he was interrupted by an unexpected remark. From Phoenix \"Dah!\" He said, imitating Olga's fake russian accent. \"I'll play your game.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy and Apollo just looked at Phoenix shocked. \"Are you sure Mr. Wright? You don't have to listen to Wocky you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Apollo. It'll be fine. We'll meet back up at the Borsht Bowl tomorrow .\" Phoenix assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did you agree to do it?\" Apollo asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Wocky will have more incentive to act like me if I do the same thing. Plus, I haven't had a poker game in a while. Maybe trying a different type of gamble will be fill in the void until more people want to try playing against me.\" Phoenix explained as he began to separate from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wright parted ways from the others, he looked in Olga's pocket and found a wallet. Inside was what seemed to be her address. He began to make his way toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth groups knew in their head that this was going to be one of the most confusing nights of their lives.</span></div></div>",

He set the device itself down on a small coffee table. \"How on Earth does she put up with that thing!\" He complained as he collapsed onto her couch. Looking around, her apartment was a rather small space - she clearly lived alone. Decks of cards were strewn all about, as were books and guides that explained various tricks and sleights of hand. There was a small TV across from the couch, but overall it was a rather spartan place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess being a con-artist doesn't give a great paycheck,\" he observed as he pulled off Olga's boots, only to frown when he found heels underneath them. \"Not that gambling is much better,\" he continued to himself as he pulled off the second pair of shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off the couch, Phoenix managed to find a cramped bedroom with a mirror. There, he undid the bow-tie and unbuttoned the the collar. It'd been so long since he had to wear a tie! It was suffocating. The bandanna came off as well, freeing up Olga's hair. As Phoenix reached for her vest though, it dawned on him that he was essentially undressing her. It was an uncomfortable realization; her clothes were just so layered and overdone that he had wanted to change without really thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked over Olga's body in the mirror with more detail, he began to worry that he might've gotten a bit in over his head by accepting Wocky's challenge. He didn't really have any experience being a woman at all, could he handle it? The long walk in the oppressive outfit left him feeling tired and more than a bit sweaty. His natural impulse this time a day would be to take a shower and change clothes, but that just seemed horribly intrusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably something I'd need to get used to though if Wocky is really going to stay in my body...\" Phoenix muttered. Even if he ultimately left Olga, that'd leave him jumping to someone else's body. Breaches of privacy might just be a thing he has to adjust to if it means keeping Wocky contained, as worrying a thought that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just sleep this all over first before rushing in...\" Phoenix wondered aloud as he began to run Olga's hands through her hair. The proportions and sensations of her body were all beginning to enter his mind as he stood there, looking at his current reflection. \"This is all nuts, I've only known about the thing for a few hours. Maybe I should just slow down before doing anything rash, its not like I don't still have the device.\"</span></div></div>",

Before he laid down he took off Olga's vest. Leaving him in just her shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Phoenix woke up and let out a loud yawn. Initially confused by the high pitchness of his voice, he looked down at himself and recalled the event's of last night. \"Guess it wasn't the most confusing dream ever.\" He joked to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took another look at Olga's body in the mirror, still shocked that this was him now.

An idea came to mind though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up Olga's vest that he had taken of last night and put it on. Next he folded up her sleeves. He then patted down her hair.

On one hand, if he brought the remote with him, he could test out it's functions and get a better understanding of it.

It seemed that the device wouldn't let him totally override someone who was already possessing a body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Phoenix and Trucy descended down the stairs. \"Apollo? Is that you?\" Phoenix asked hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, you think I'm that-\" Ema's body began but was cutoff. \"Mr. Wright! Something went wrong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWocky shook Ema's head in confusion, but suddenly realization dawned on him as well. \"Oh don't tell me we're sharing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo resumed, \"We're both in control Mr. Wright, you got to fix this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy was wide eyed, taken aback by the seemingly schizophrenic Ema in front of them. Phoenix-as-Olga, however, processed the information quickly however, and pieced together his options. \"Well,\" he said, \"we might have to leave you that way for now Apollo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why!?\" It was hard to tell which one shouted that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because if we just used the possession button again, it might release Wocky too, and then we're back to square one, right? This way, you're atleast present as a sort of restraint in Ema's body. You can keep him under control.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's whack man!\" That was obviously Wocky. \"Mr. Wright, c'mon, I didn't even really volunteer for this!\" That was Apollo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought it through. It was crazy, but it might be worth it. Having to fight for control of Ema's body might wear down on Wocky's resolve. He didn't strike Phoenix as someone with a plan - he was probably just doing this because he thought it was fun. He was contrarian for sure, but if they made the situation as unbearable as possible for Wocky, he might surrender. If not that, Wocky would maybe learn a valuable life lesson about cooperation and sharing or something similarly corny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do, Daddy,\" asked a concerned Trucy.

During the trial for the murder of Romein LeTouse nearly a year ago, Machi was sure that he would end up having to suffer the Borginian penalty for smuggling. Even after the trial, he hadn't given much consideration of what he would do with his life<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that bit of exposition out of the way, here comes the strange part. Once Machi had been released from prison, he had discovered a strange package along the side of the road. Inside was a remote and some kind of instruction manual. Machi took the package off the road and attempted to read the manual. Unfortunatley, although he could speak basic sentences in English, he could barley read a word of it. He could make out a few things, such as the remote effect people and it had something to do with bodies, but he couldn't figure out exactly what it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all a few days ago and while Machi attempted to put the remote out of mind and focus on other things, however his curiosity eventually got the better of him and he was tempted to test it out. The question was, on who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few people who he hadn't been able to see yet since he had been released from prison. The very first person to come to mind was Lamiroir. He had been planning on seeing her even since he had been released from prison, but he had been unable to since Lamiroir had been out of town for various reasons. He knew she would be back tomorrow, maybe that would be a good time to simultaneously meet up for the first time in a year and test the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next people to come to mind were Apollo Yoostis and his assistant Trucy Wright, they had defended him in court a year ago and while he had wanted go see them, he had trouble gaining the confidence to face them. They had done so much for him then and he had caused so much trouble for them. Perhaps he would have an easier time going and seeing them if he convinced himself he was going there for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did Machi decided to go and see</span></div></div>",

A lazy day for a cop usually means a safe day for the community so long as everything was going okay. Detective Gumshoe was enjoying his lazy day at his tiny cubicle when the mail-room guy came through with a cart of parcels and boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Package for you detective,\" he said, interrupting Gumshoes' game of computer solitaire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? From who?\" he asked, not sure what it could be. He didn't have the cash to order anything at the moment, and he doubted anyone would send him a gift at his work address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't say, but it apparently passed security clearance. Maybe you have a secret admirer?\" the man suggested with a laugh as he tossed the box on Gumshoe's desk and wheeled the cart away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe couldn't help but smile at the idea. \"Let's see what we have then!\" He said excitedly as he began to pull the box apart, finding a small remote and a set of instructions accompanying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the instructions, Gumshoe was a bit glum. He was sure that someone was just playing a mean joke on him; there was no way such a device could be real at all. He idly wondered who would send it to him though, it was an oddly specific joke. He couldn't recall doing anything to make anyone want to send him a phony body swapping machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like Gumshoe had anything better to do than try it, though. He was bored and there wasn't much crime going on. If it worked, then his day would become much more exciting, and if it didn't then he managed to kill a couple of hours. The way he saw it, there were three places he could test it. The first was the prosecutor's office, which was a stones throw away; if it worked then he'd certainly want Mr. Edgeworth to know. Gumshoe would be really useful on investigations with something like that. The second person who came to mind was Maggey; the two of them were close, so he figured she wouldn't mock him just for testing it out. Finally, the cell blocks for the prisoners were also pretty close, and Gumshoe had access to most of them. He knew that most of the people Mr. Edgeworth and Wright put away were pretty rotten fellows. He figured it wouldn't really be a big deal to use them as guinea pigs since most of them were murderers of some kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did he go?  </span></div></div>",

If this thing really worked, he wanted Edgeworth to be the first one to know. It didn't take very long for Him to get to the prosecutor's office. He was allowed right in, after all, he was here very often to either see Edgeworth or clean Edgeworth's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gumshoe walked up the stairs to the floor that Edgeworth's office was on, he had a thought. Edgeworth wasn't the kind of person to just believe in something just because he's told, especially if what he's told sounds impossible. The only thing he believed in was evidence. How would he convince Edgeworth that the remote was real? That's when Gumshoe had a great idea. He would go to Edgeworth's office as someone else! Edgeworth wouldn't believe him i he just said what the remote did, but there's no way he wouldn't believe him if he someone else. Not even Edgeworth could think of a better explanation for why someone else was acting like him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question was, whose body should Gumshoe take? He was already at the prosecutor's office, so why not take the body of another prosecutor? Gumshoe gave some thought about what other prosecutors he knew and then he realized...he didn't really know that many prosecutors. The only to that came to mind were Franziska Von Karma and that Payne guy. There was no way he was going to take the body of that Payne guy, he was at least 20 years older than Gumshoe! He guessed he could switch with Von Karma, but if he somehow messed up, then he would be on the receiving end of a whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he didn't have to take the body of a prosecutor. Edgeworth had met many people over the years and Gumshoe was with him when he met those people! Unfortunately, Gumshoe didn't know where any of those people lived, but it was entirely possible, though improbable, that Gumshoe could run into at least one person that both he and Edgeworth knew on the way to Edgeworth's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gumshoe got closer to Edgeworth's office, he realized he had to make his choice.

Today is a slow day for me and I don't have any-\" Gumshoe was interrupted by Franziska's whip hitting his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool! There are crimes going on every day!\" Franziska said with another crack of her whip \"A detective cannot afford to take a day off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween whip cracks, Gumshoe reached for the remote in his jacket, for once he didn't need to just sit still and take the verbal (and physical) abuse. He clicked the Aware Swap button while pointing at himself, then swiftly pulled it out of his jack and pointed it at Franziska.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Gumshoe's view switched around. He was now staring at his own body, and the whip was in *his* hand. His own body was staring at him confused. Gumshoe noticed that the remote was still in his body's hand. He needed to act fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly whipped forward \"Fool! Listen to what I say! Go out and find some crime to investigate!\" He did his best Franziska impression. The shock from being whipped caused Franziska to drop the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is going on?! Why are you-\" Franziska began to demand answers, but was whipped again by Gumshoe, who was very happy not to be on the receiving side for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska wanted more than anything to confront her own body about what was going on, however everytime she spoke she was met with the force of her own whip! She eventually gave up and bregrudidly walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe breathed a sigh of relief as he picked up the remote from the ground. If Franziska had payed less attention to him and looked down for even a second, the how ruse would've been ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, got a new body.

She bent down and picked it up. \"Who could have sent this to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe shrugged \"Heck if I know pal, only thing I know is that it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we know it works, do you want to switch back? You're body feels so weird.\" Maggey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe thought about it. On one hand, it was pretty weird being in Maggey's body. On the other hand, it felt so strange being someone else, maybe he should wait before asking Maggey to swap them back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he decide to do?</span></div></div>",

All Maggey had was a tank top and jeans, Gumshoe wasn't used to having no sleeves, especially with arms as scrawny as hers. \"So what do we do now?\" he asked, his voice quiet due to discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggey darted her (his?) eyes away from Gumshoe's gaze for a second. \"Well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe gestured to the device, \"do you want to switch back now?

I-I mean it might help us understand each- uh, the remote, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe smiled and gave a nod, glad that Maggey wasn't <i>too</i> put off by the experience. \"Sure, pal!

Just sorta... blanked out for a second there... what were we talking about again pal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit concerned, Maggey told Gumshoe to sit down for a second, as she went off to get some water for him. Little did she know, Gumshoe himself was actually floating up above, watching the scene unfold. <i>'Holy smokes, I'm flying!'</i> He floated behind Maggey, trying to follow her in the kitchen to get her attention, but she couldn't hear him at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'C'mon pal, turn around!'</i> He pushed himself forward towards Maggey, trying to get her attention, but instead of making contact he floated through her, and suddenly his perspective began to spin. He was thankfully physical again, but that's where the similarities stopped. Looking around the room, Gumshoe immediately realized he was about a foot shorter, and all the sensations of his body were different. He realized he was much thinner, wearing glasses, and his arms were bare in a tanktop. In his left hand was the device from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart pounding, Gumshoe sprinted from the kitchen to Maggey's bathroom, stumbling due to his new center of balance. Looking in the mirror, his fears were confirmed: he was in Maggey's body. \"<i>It- it's real</i>,\" he shouted, stunned to heat Maggey's voice and see her face move at his command. He began poking and prodding himself all over; it was definitely real. His shock slowly turned to amazement as he looked down to the remote. He was Maggey for real! He could be <i>anyone</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, pal?\" Gumshoe heard his own voice call from down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Gumshoe as Maggey called back, disturbed at hearing his own voice, \"my, uh, stomach hurts!\" He looked down one more time, examining his new arms and hands. Maggey gave him permission to test the device, but that wasn't necessarily permission to stay once he knew it worked. He looked to the remote and supposed he ought to return to his own body for Maggey's sake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't worry about me, I'm feeling fine now,\" Gumshoe's body continued. \"I just got a call from Mr. Edgeworth though, he needs me for an investigation, so I gotta head out right away. Thanks for talking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe realized that if he wanted to return to his body, he ought to do it right away. But if he did, he wouldn't be able to explain what happened to Maggey! his body seemed fine without him, it could probably handle the investigation while he found some way to explain things to Maggey without his body. On the other hand, maybe the device could help Mr. Edgeworth? Certainly, becoming anyone would aid an investigation.</span></div></div>",

He was pretty sure that his body would be okay on it's own during the investigation, although he'll have to ask Mr. Edgeworth what happened today when he comes into work tomorrow. He looked in the mirror one more time, just to make sure that it was all real. After double checking that every one of his senses wasn't lying to him, he walked out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe went to Maggey's living room and put on a blue coat, not because he was cold, but because he felt naked without one. He sat on Maggey's couch and thought about what to do. The sensations of being in a different body being even more apparent as he sat down, It was weird to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could wait around Maggey's place until his body was done helping Mr. Edgeworth, but who knows how long that could take? His body could be out for most of the day. Alternatively, he could go outside and possess a random passerby, but there were two problems with that. One was that if he left Maggey's body and took someone else's, would Maggey believe that it was him in someone else? The other problem was the other person, Maggey gave him permission to use the remote on her, he would feel bad if he took the body of some random person without their consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the third option, he could leave Maggey's place and go somewhere as her. Although he didn't really know where he would go, although it would be interesting being a different person and go to the places he would usually go. At the same time though, he didn't want to violate Maggey's privacy and going around town as her would definitley be a huge breach of privacy. Plus, he could risk running into someone who knows Maggey, and he would have no idea how to act like her if that happened, he could end up embarrassing her if he messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over he decided to....</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to freak her out by just leaving, and he didn't want to risk leaving the apartment in her body either. Flipping through channels on the television, he resolved to just let time pass without paying much notice to his current form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective managed to do this for about thirty minutes before his patience wore thin. No matter how hard he tried to keep his attention on the TV, some sensation would drag him away from it and focus himself back to his new body. Either the glasses on his nose, hair tickling the back of his neck, an itch on his legs, or some other thing offered a distraction whenever he felt like he was nearly engrossed in what he was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need a different outfit or something,\" he told himself as he got up from the couch. \"Will only take a moment,\" he muttered, walking over to Maggey's room. It was a pretty small an sparse area; just a mirror, some drawers, and the bed. Gumshoe through off the coat he had put on and looked in the mirror, now just in a tank top and shorts. He rubbed at his arms a bit, feeling weird at having them exposed. His hands moved downwards over Maggey's stomach, astonished at how skinny her body was compared to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He looked from left to right nervously, as though he felt he was being watched, as he pulled out the front of Maggey's shirt and looked down. He quickly looked away, embarrassed that he did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he mumbled, his face red at the action. \"Let's just... see what there is to wear...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there, pal!\" Gumshoe exclaimed with a smile and salute to the mirror, \"how can I serve you?\" It took a short period of time for him to get over his previous trepidation. After searching through Maggie's closet and finding her old waitress outfit, he quickly went out of his way to throw it on. The outfit looked great on her, but he assumed she preferred not to wear it due to bad memories associated with the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely a breach of privacy, but Gumshoe decided he would try to have some fun to relieve his stress while he was stuck here. Besides, it wasn't every day he would be using a woman's body. Why not try out something different while he was here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was fiddling with the ribbon, trying to tie it in the back of Maggey's hair, when the cell phone rang. He took a moment to finish it up and then grabbed the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey, this is Maggey,\" he replied uneasily despite his prior confidence in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was on the other end? </span></div></div>",

'<i>I'm not dead am I?!</i>' The silence was brief but felt like a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't want you to worry,\" Edgeworth continued. \"Thankfully, the detective was rushed to a hospital right away. He's out like a light and might need a crutch for a bit when he comes too, but the doctor's say he'll be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe breathed a sigh of relief, even if it wasn't great news. He had no idea what he'd do if his body had died without him in it! ...would the remote even work for him after that point? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, can I visit him?\" Gumshoe asked, regaining some composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" Edgeworth replied, \"the doctor's are saying they'll need a day - maybe two - to operate and let him rest before they'll admit visitors.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe nodded. \"Alright. Uh, thank you, Mr. Edgeworth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not problem Maggey. I'm sorry I had to be the bearer of bad news about this. My work on this case is done until the police catch the culprit, so if you need anything, feel free to give me a call.\" With that, the conversation ended, and Gumshoe was left to consider his options as he sat down on Maggey's bed, still dressed up in her Waitress uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely not going back into my body while the doctors are looking it over,\" he decided. \"What if I'm under the knife? That'd be horrible! Will at least have to wait until I can get visitors...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question stood: what would he do with Maggey's body until then? It didn't feel right to just keep it without her permission. This was supposed to just be a short display of the device's abilities - not a 2 day sojourn! It'd be a betrayal of trust to just steal her life, but then, would she even know? She didn't believe the remote worked, after all. <i>Being</i> someone was certainly the best way to get to know them, and he'd been wanting to improve their relationship. Not to mention, when she finally wakes up, Gumshoe himself will be in the hospital. Hardly like she'd be able to blame him for a prolonged blackout when he's injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of his decision, he realized that it'd be weird to keep wearing her uniform, so he got back to his feet and began to change back into a normal outfit.

Gumshoe briefly tried to lounge about and just watch TV, but it failed to take his mind off of things. He kept noticing strands of hair out of the corners of his eyes, or a stray itch would remind him of his different proportions. 'Is Maggey even awake at all for any of this?' he wondered, eventually forgetting what on the television as worrying thoughts entered his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can atleast try to talk to her somehow...\" Gumshoe muttered in Maggey's high pitched voice as he began to brainstorm ideas. He didn't want to take anyone else's body yet, but one idea did come to mind. Looking around, Gumshoe eventually found a stray notebook. Flipping through, he skipped to an empty page and began to write. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maggey, it's me, Gumshoe! The device worked, but my own body had to run off. I'm sorta stuck without one for now.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a bit hesitant, unsure as to how she would react, but picked up the device again and clicked 'possession', pulling himself out of Maggey's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggey seemed rather befuddled. \"G-gumshoe? Where did you go?\" she asked, getting no vocal response. She looked down and realized she had suddenly donned a coat, which she took off, rather disturbed. Looking at the clock, she noticed that about 10 minutes had gone by. \"Did... I just black out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Look at the note pal!'</i> Gumshoe silently urged from above. <i>'C'mon!'</i> Thankfully for him, she eventually did notice the message set out for her on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she didn't seem convinced. \"Detective, is this a prank on me all of a sudden?\" she asked, \"cause its not funny! Now come on out, where-ever you're hiding.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had lungs, Gumshoe would've sighed. It seemed that Maggey would require more proof. Reluctantly, he floated back down, taking over her body again. The first thing he did was have her put the coat back on, both to make a point and make himself more comfortable once again. He then picked the pen back up and resumed writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Its no joke! I'm not smart enough to pull something like this off, you gotta believe me - I used the possession button.'</i> This time, Gumshoe decided to take off Maggey's glasses, putting them on the counter on top of the note. His vision suddenly went blurry but he could still see well enough to hit the possession button once again, resuming ghost form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggey was much more confused this time. <i>\"What the - who - woah!\"</i> Gumshoe realized he might've went too far on that one, as Maggey soon fell backwards, landing herself on the floor. \"Oooow...\" she muttered, placing a hand on her back as she got back up. Thankfully, she could see well enough to locate her glasses on the small table, putting them back on and reading Gumshoe's addition to the note. She looked up around the room nervously before replying, \"okay, now I might believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Yes!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, uh, interacting with you is pretty hard if you don't have a body,\" Maggey said, still not sure she wasn't just talking to herself. \"Do you think you could... get another one? Just for a bit? If you do, come back here and knock on the door 4 times.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe figured this was the best option he had. He flew out of Maggey's apartment and down to the street below, hoping to find someone who didn't seem too busy to 'borrow' them for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Gumshoe only found a few candidates. First off, he found the strange sight of Mr. Wright in casual clothing (a hoody and a hat). Gumshoe had only ever seen him in the blue suit; he couldn't imagine Wright as anyone but a suit and tie attorney, but he supposed it was definitely a fortuitous encounter. If he wasn't dressed as an attorney, he probably was off work, right? He seemed to be alone, although the way he was seated at the bench made it seem he might've been waiting for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second candidate was one of the reporters he had seen on a case with Edgeworth not long ago. She was younger than the other one, and had spiky hair. She was still carrying that monstrous backpack and had her tape recorder hanging from her waist. She may have been on the job, but if the few encounters he had with her were any indication, she probably wasn't going to blow the lid on a big scoop any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich did Gumshoe pick? </span></div></div>",

While possessing Mr. Wright would have been more ideal since he would have been a man again, he had known Mr. Wright long enough to know that people almost always end up accused for murder when Wright was around, and Gumshoe didn't want to deal with that. While Nicole was involved with two of Edgeworth's cases, she wasn't involved with nearly as many cases as Wright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe floated toward Nicole and was once again in another person's body. He stumbled back an forth trying to get a steady balance. Between the large backpack and not being used to Nicole's body made it nearly impossible not stumble. After getting his footing he headed back to Maggey's apartment. He knocked on her door four times like she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds Maggey opened the door and had a shocked look on here face \"Is that you Gumshoe?\" She asked. Surprised to see that Gumshoe went into another female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Pal, it's me. There weren't many people walking by.\" He said, once again surprised to hear another person's voice when he spoke, as he walked into the apartment. Once he was inside he took off Nicole's huge backpack and set it on Maggey's couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who are you right now?\" Maggey asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. She was involved with a case Mr. Edgeworth worked on a while back, I think her name was Nicole or something, She's a reporter. Gumshoe explained to Maggey. After a few seconds of silence Gumshoe spoke up again \"So now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck if I know. I'm still freaked out by all of this.\" Maggey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe eyed the remote still in his hand. \"Well, we could try out the other buttons. We know that possession button works. Maybe we could try the others? Or we can go somewhere, I don't know about that though. Wouldn't want to run into anyone Nicole knows. It's up to you though.\" Gumshoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over Maggey decided to...</span></div></div>",

I guess she must be in here with me after all, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggey nodded, letting the thought of the possibilities overcome her apprehension at Gumshoe being in that weird woman's body. \"Yeah! Like, what would happen if we used one of the swaps? Would she carry over with you or just stay there? Or what if I tried to possess you while you're possessing someone else? There's a lot of questions! We should try stuff out first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that Maggey was probably way ahead of him, Gumshoe handed the device over to her. \"Well, alright pal,\" he said in Nicole's voice, \"try whichever you want. I sorta imposed this whole thing on you after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnxiously, Maggey looked over the options. The swaps immediately posed a lot of questions; if they did an aware swap, would Nicole's consciousness stay with her body, or would it carry over to Maggey's? And what of unaware? Where would she end up, and would she even know her body was out of place? Finally, she could just try to double layer a possession to see what it would cause. Its possible Gumshoe would just black out like Nicole did, but there was no way to know until they tried it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich function did Maggey go with?</span></div></div>",

He had just been caught sneaking in on the production of the Steel Samurai movie, he snuck in through his usual method of going through the vent, but there were apparently guards around the entrance to the vent to keep away kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to get in there and see what was going on! The Steel Samurai movie was the greatest thing to happen to any Steel Samurai fan, he needed to get in there and see the filming of the movie, but with all these guards doing that would be hard. If only he had some way of getting in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guards put him down outside of the entrance to the studio, Cody ran a block away and began to look through his backpack. He was looking to see if anything he brought would help him. He looked around at what he brought. Toy sword, trading cards, a exact copy of the steel samurai mask, and... a strange package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't bring any mail! Who put this here? This backpack is only for extremely rare steel samurai merch!\" Cody said, angry that someone put something in his backpack. \"Well, finders keepers.\" Cody said as he began to tear through the package. Inside was a remote and a instruction manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody read through it and rolled his eyes. \"Body swapping? As if!\" He thought the remote was just some stupid prank. Although, it wouldn't hurt to try it. If it did work, then he could use it to get into the set of the Steel Samurai movie. He could sneak back in and before he got kicked out he could switch with someone in the studio and be there without anyone knowing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, did he want that to be the first thing he did with the remote? He didn't even know if it worked, did he want to risk sneaking in the studio the same way again for a plan that might not even work? Maybe he should go somewhere else first and try it before he goes into the studio?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Cody decide to do?</span></div></div>",

If the remote didn't work, he didn't care; he would just have to improvise a way into the the movie without it. He looked over the directions once more, trying to find functions that could help him. Shapeshift seemed to be the thing he wanted; he could turn into anyone else and fall under the radar! Possession could be useful too, but Cody wanted to collect an autograph or a souvenir while he was there, so it wouldn't be as good. Body swapping would likely be too dangerous - he didn't want someone else in his body making noise or getting caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the box and instructions back into his bag, Cody skulked back towards the studio, this time taking a different path off to the west side of the building in hopes of avoiding the guards that caught him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, Cody found himself in a dressing room, although he wasn't sure whose. Filming had just started, so the rooms were a bit bare; for all he knew he was in the Steel Samurai's room itself! It was an exciting thought. He was about to dig around before he suddenly heard a rapping on the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Powers, are you in there?\" the voice asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's eyes widened as he realized his cover was about to be blown. Thinking quickly, he noticed a large, cardboard box off to the corner, just big enough to fit him. He ran over and scrambled to get underneath it just as the doorknob turned. \"I hear you in there! Open up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Powers? Weird, I though I heard something,\" the person spoke as they entered the room. Cody pulled the remote from his shirt pocket, seeing this as a great time to test the device out. He looked though a small hole in the box, only to see...</span></div></div>",

If he used the remote on her he would be able to go onto the set unnoticed and maybe even meet and get an autograph from the Steel Samurai himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny wouldn't have been Cody's first choice to use the remote on. He didn't want to become a girl, but who knows if anyone else would come into this dressing room anytime soon. He couldn't leave the dressing room, he might get seen and caught. Penny was the only choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what button should he press? Possessing her would be the easiest thing to do, but what would his body be doing? Would it try to sneak in on it's own and get caught while he was in Penny's body?  The next best one would be Shapeshift, if he did that he wouldn't have to worry about his body or anybody in it, but what if Penny saw him? Then there was Aware Swap, He would be in Penny's body, but she would also be in his, what would she do in his body and would it be a good idea to let a girl in his body? Finally there was aware swap, that really wouldn't help at all. If he used that it would only make it easier for him to get caught. After thinking it over he made his choice about what button to use on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pointed the remote, Penny began to leave the dressing room \"I guess I was just hearing things.

He felt the weight of a pair of glasses over his eyes and could feel longer hair tickling the back of his neck. Not to mention, he was a decent bit taller! Looking down - barely catching his glasses - he realized he did it! He was in that lady's body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he realized what had happened, so did she. The box he was hiding in suddenly began to shake and move as it's occupant shouted in confusion and surprise. \"What happened? Where am I?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on his feet, Cody suddenly had an idea. Using his new body, he walked over to the corner of the room, and threw the box aside. \"Wait, WHAT?! Are you me!?\" Penny shouted in shock. She suddenly looked down at herself, and became all too aware of her new body as well. Cody gave her no response, and instead swept up the device she had dropped on the ground, putting it away in one of his new vest pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards! A kid broke in to the studio!\" He shouted, a bit surprised by his new voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly, the guards who had thrown him out early marched into the room. Penny protested, insisting they didn't know what was going on, but they paid her no heed and dragged her off in Cody's body. Cody smiled victoriously, and pumped his arm. He imagined he'd get in trouble now; they'd probably tell his parents after kicking him out <i>twice</i>, but he'd worry about that later. He didn't really care for being a girl either, but it was a small price to pay to see the Steel Samurai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to take stock of his new body, Cody set off towards the bathrooms. His face was a bit red as he reluctantly opted to go into the women's restroom to look at his new body in the mirror. \"Wow! I'm like a real adult,\" he muttered in awe as he saw his new face repeating what he said in the reflection. Now no one would talk down to him like he was some little kid! He made a number of goofy expressions in the mirror, sticking out tongue and pulling at his cheeks, just to make sure it was all real. He also fiddled with Penny's glasses, a bit unhappy to find that she could hardly see at all without them. This lady would do for now, but he figured he might end up finding a different one soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I need to find the Samurai!\" he declared, as he rushed out of the bathroom, excited to have free reign of the studio. </span></div></div>",

Assistant lady wasn't very tall, but she was at least a foot taller than him. As he walked he passed by fixed up Mr. Monkey statue. he stood next to it to compare his height. He wasn't as tall as the statue, but he half the size! He took a few steps back and rubbed the bottom of his nose with his finger. \"Not so tall now, Mr. Monkey.\" He said smugly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he celebrated his small victory against Mr. Monkey's size he heard a familiar voice. \"Assistant!\" The person yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody turned around and nearly jumped when he saw who it was. It was that old security lady. Normally he would have to run as fast as he could when he saw her, but now he wouldn't have to. \"What do you want Oldhag?\" He asked with his arms crossed. He didn't bother acting any different than usual, he didn't know assistant lady enough to act like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOldbag seemed a bit confused by Penny calling her that, but she went off into one of her usual rants. \"You whippersnappers nowadays always getting names wrong. Back when I was a young lady, when I was told a name, I would remember it! Why, if you were born then and you-\" She ranted on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody rolled his eyes \"Bo-ring.\" He said in an obnoxious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assistant! Respect your elders and superiors!\" Oldbag yelled. \"Did you find Mr. Powers? Filming starts in fifteen minutes and he isn't on set! You were supposed to wake him up from his nap and get him to the set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no! Why should I do that, Lame-O?\" An annoyed Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's your job, but I guess you're useless at that too! I'll find him, take over at the front gate for me, and don't mess that up too!\" Wendy stomped her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I'll do that, Oldy\" Cody said and ran past Oldbag, nearly knocking her over. he didn't plan to actually go to the front gate, he just wanted her to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it! Or I'll report you to management and get you fired for harassing a poor old woman\" Oldbag yelled to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOldbag was being particularly nasty today. Cody wanted to get a bit of revenge on her. He could do that with the remote. He would never switch with her himself, he could switch her with someone else. But, using the remote could give away his cover, did her want to risk that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, if he wanted to really mess with her, he didn't even need to use the remote on her. The studio was filled with props and paint buckets, he could set up a prank on her. No one would suspect a thing, it would just look like the assistant was getting some props</span></div></div>",

Before Oldbag could get away, he point it at her and pressed \"Aware Swap\", the device registering her as the first target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn impish smirk on his borrowed face, Cody then set about finding a second target. He completely forewent checking the guard post, and instead ran towards what he knew was the employee area. It didn't take long at all now that he could take normal routes; he also could run faster with Penny's longer legs! <i>'This body isn't half bad!'</i> He opened the door, thrilled to be there without having to sneak about, and scanned the room for a target. Finding a body that was <i>worse</i> than Oldbag's was hard, but Cody had a target in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the Craft Services table, he found his mark: Sal Manella, the hefty and sweaty director. Only he could be grosser than the old hag herself. Obliquely, Cody raised the remote and clicked 'Aware Swap', scarcely holding back giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Sal dropped his fork, a confused look. He tried to pull himself out of his chair, but lost balance and fell to the floor. \"What - what on earth!\" Sal shouted with an uncharacteristic shrillness. Cody couldn't hold it back, and laughed out loud at the sight. Thankfully, \"Sal's\" fall had distracted most other people, so they didn't even notice. Cody stored the device back into Penny's pocket and decided to watch intently at what happened next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn assistant came by and helped a bewildered and angry Oldbag-as-Manella to her feet. She looked around, rather horrified at her new body. To add fire to the situation, another assistant came forward. \"Sir! You need to get yourself together, Mr. Powers is on his way and we're going to start filming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- I can't direct!\" Wendy responded in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do it all the time sir, a movie is no different, right?

That and the fact that she had no idea how to direct at all, brought her to the easy decision. Get away as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the assistants who helped her up out of her way and ran toward the door, stumbling and nearly falling the whole way. Every few second she had to stop because Sal's body would get tired out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody couldn't help but laugh some more at what just happened, although he calmed down when other people in the room were giving him looks. He could only imagine that Sal was acting he same way in Oldbag's body. This remote was a lot of fun, once he found the Steel Samurai and got an autograph, he was definitely going to have fun with it outside the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now? Without the director we can't film.\" One of the assistants said who helped Oldbag up said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to postpone until he get's back, hopefully that won't take to long.\" Another person said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Mr. Powers? Wasn't one of the assistants supposed to go wake him?\" The first assistant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second assistant looked toward Cody. \"Hey! Aren't you the assistant who was supposed to get him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was still holding back laughs from earlier. He looked at the other assistant. He remembered Oldbag saying something similar when he ran into her earlier. \"Uh, I don't know where to find him. How am I supposed find someone without knowing where they are?\" Cody came up with an excuse, as smug as usual<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first assistant looked at him \"He usually sleeps in his dressing room. If he's not there then he's probably at the trailer in studio two paying his respects to Mr. Hammer. Go tell him that the filming's delayed. We'll have to film the scene where he fights the Magistrate some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, whatever.\" Cody said on instinct, but then as he processed in his mind what the other assistant said he perked up. 'Scene where he fights the evil Magistrate' Only one man could stand to fight him, the Steel Samurai! Cody now knew where he was. \"I'll go tell him now!\" Cody said then ran off, once again toward Studio 2.</span></div></div>",

He remembered being here a year or so ago, sneaking in on the filming of the show, only to see what looked like the Samurai lose a fight! It was a traumatic event for him, but he wouldn't let that memory hold him back getting to see his hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Cody finally reached the set, and saw a man bent over by the trailer a few yards off. \"Jeeze... this girl... doesn't have much energy,\" Penny's body could've ran faster, but it definitely didn't have Cody's energy. Determined however, Cody took a deep breath, and approached the man by the trailer. looking down, Cody saw what seemed to be flowers laid out, around the place where he saw the Samurai lose last year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steel Samurai!?\" Cody blurted out, wanting to get his attention. The man leaped up and turned around, startled, and Cody finally saw his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny? Don't scare me like that,\" the large, gruff looking fellow exclaimed. Cody was in shock - this man didn't look like a hero at all! He looked like a villain, in fact! \"Also you know to call me Will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry Mr. Samu- Will?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I guess you're here to get me on set?\" he asked. \"Tell them I'll be there in a minute or two. I'm almost done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, uh,\" Cody was starstruck and shocked at the same time. \"Well, actually, filming is delayed for the moment. The director ran off, yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, I'll be back soon anyways. Are you okay Penny? You're staring at me like I have five heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody realized that 'Penny' must be the assistant lady's name. \"Yeah! I'm uh, fine. I just... have a question!\" Fishing around his pockets, Cody found the perfect thing, a Steel Samurai trading card! Penny must've been collecting them just like him. It wasn't a rare one, but it would do. \"I want your autograph!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers laughed, \"could've sworn I already gave you one, but sure why not.\" Powers fished out a pen and wrote a quick signature on the card. \"You happy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody just nodded in silence as he put the card away in his pocket. \"Uh, I'll go now!\" With that, Cody awkwardly left the studio in his borrowed body. He finally got the autograph, but it wasn't nearly as cool as he imagined. He totally blew it! He acted like a wimp in front of the Steel Samurai himself. \"I just wasn't prepared,\" he told himself. \"I didn't expect him to be so scary looking. I bet if I had a second try I could do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody slowly realized that he <i>could</i> have a second chance. All he needed was a different body and he could go meet the Samurai again! But then, he had already gotten his autograph and got some revenge on Oldbag. Maybe he should quit while he was ahead and just go home with his prize now? After all, he had an amazing device at his disposal. Not to mention, if he came back tomorrow, he could probably watch the Samurai fight the magistrate! Maybe he could even get some photos! </span></div></div>",

Without bothering to punch out or to fix Oldbag and Manella, he passed the security gate and left the filming set out onto the street. He walked three blocks back to his house before he remembered what he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I'm not me!\" he realized. Where did his body go? If he had to guess, the guards probably called his parents, meaning he was back home. He didn't really want to stay as this lady all night, but if he switched back now he'd probably be grounded or something, and he doubted he could go back to the studio if his parents locked him up in his room. \"Well, I just won't go home tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that left Cody unsure of where to go. He patted himself over and eventually found a wallet; the money was exciting but it also gave him Penny's address. \"I GUESS I could go to her house,\" he muttered, scratching the back of his head, feeling Penny's thicker hair. Penny had free access to the studio, so he'd be able to come back no problem once shooting began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did still have the remote too, however, even if he wasn't using it from his own body. With Aware Swap or Possession, he could go anywhere and easily kill time until tomorrow. He wasn't sure what Penny's body would do if he left it, or how someone else would react if he switched, but so long as he kept a hold of the device, it didn't really matter, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Cody decided to...</span></div></div>",

If he wanted to come back and see the filming tomorrow he could either just swap back into Penny's body or go into another body at the studio tomorrow. Now that he had decided to leave Penny's body, the question was, who should he become now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked around as he walked down the street with no particular destination in mind. He didn't have anything in particular in mind when it came to choosing what body he should switch to next, he just wanted a body he could switch into for the night and maybe have some fun in the meantime. It wasn't a very specific criteria, but for some reason Cody was having a hard time finding a body he wanted to switch into. This was due to a combination of a lack of people walking down the street and the people he did see didn't seem like they would be fun to be for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Cody saw a rather expensive looking car parked down the road. Cody was to young to drive but, like any kid, he really wanted to try and now that he had this remote he could, and he wouldn't get in trouble for it either. The only thing he had to do was become whoever owned that car. Then, as luck would have it, the person who owned the car showed up,and Cody had the expected reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Another girl!\" Cody said and stomped his foot. The person who owned the card was a woman who didn't look that much older than Penny, although other than age they had no similarities. This woman had either silver or light blue, Cody couldn't tell do distance. She was also carrying what seemed to be a whip. Her clothing was also a bit more girlish than Penny's. She was wearing a skirt, which to Cody was the equivalent to torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile becoming this girl wasn't the most appealing this to Cody, that car looked really nice. Plus, if that woman could afford that car than she must have a lot of money, money which Cody could use for fun. After a bit of thinking, Cody chose to become her even if she was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo there was one final question for Code, how would he become her? There were two choices. He could either use the same function he used when he became Penny, the 'Aware swap' or he could try out one of the other functions 'Possession' Either could work, but Cody at least had experience with the 'Aware swap' button.

Penny's body would make getting in there as easy as it was today. While he could just leave her body for the  night and go back to it tommorow, that could be risky. If he did an aware swap, then he would have no idea what the other person in Penny's body would do and he needed to keep his eye on it til tommorow. He could try possession, but he would have no idea how her body would act when he left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked at Penny's wallet again began to walk toward the address that was written down. Soon he outside an apartment building, he looked at the address again and saw another number next to it. That must have been the apartment number. He went up to the apartment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the apartment he looked around. It was an average apartment, it had a couch and a small T.V., nothing too expensive looking. He doubted Penny's paychecks were huge since she was just an assistant. Looking around the apartment he found something that really interested him. Penny had a huge Steel Samurai trading card collection! He figured she collected them too since he found one in her vest earlier, but he hadn't imagine that she had this many! It wasn't nearly as big as his, but it was a decent size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the cards and found some that he hadn't gotten yet. He picked them up and put them in Penny's vest, making a mental note to put them and the autographed one somewhere he could get them once he was back to his own body. After admiring the cards some more he went and laid on the couch. He had been running around all day and Penny's body was tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about what to do. He could rest around Penny's apartment until tommorow, but it was only around 5 o clock, he might get bored just staying at this small apartment. He could go somewhere else, but he wasn't sure where he could go. In the end he decided to....</span></div></div>",

He had been running around all day in Penny's body, and he could only imagine Penny herself had been busy with work before he swapped with her. Not in the mood to go anywhere, he opted to hang around her home for the evening and rest up for tomorrow. He lazily through off Penny's vest over the couch and looked around her kitchen for something to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much for cooking, Cody threw together a sandwich and some chips. He spent most of the night snacking in front of the TV, but without the confidence or energy to go out and about with Penny's body, he eventually decided to go to bed early, crashing in Penny's bed much earlier than he would in his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...huh?\" Cody muttered as he heard an alarm go off. It was summer, right? Why was there an alarm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed himself up from bed, and everything felt <i>off</i>. His sight was blurry, and his arms and legs were much longer than they were supposed to be. Looking down at his body, it all came back to him. He had found a device the day before, and he had taken a lady's body at the studio! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to his feet, he looked to the night stand, turning off the alarm and fumbling around for Penny's glasses. \"I can't believe that wasn't a dream...\" Cody muttered, looking at Penny's reflection in the mirror. To be honest, she looked a bit bedraggled. Her hair was askew and her clothes were wrinkled as well, since Cody slept in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, it dawned on Cody that he'd have to get ready to go to the shooting with Penny's body. <i>'Gross,'</i> he thought, <i>'I don't want to have to bathe as her!'</i> In his haste yesterday, Cody wasn't really thinking too far ahead about the logistics of body theft. He just wanted to watch the filming! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, Cody reasoned this was't <i>really</i> his body though. So what if Penny's coworkers think her hair looks rough, or that she smells bad? It'd be her problem in the long run, not his. With some resignation, however, Cody figured he ought to change clothes. Nervously, he looked to her clothing drawer and started searching for something to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's face was a bit red after his search, but he did manage to find a simple outfit. Cody flipped Penny's mirror around and closed his eyes as he undressed, changing out the long sleeved shirt and jeans for a plain yellow t-shirt and black running shorts. The process of undressing involved some uncomfortable sensations, but it was brief, and it'd be worth it to see more of the filming! He gave his body a look in the mirror and figured that it was good enough though; no one expected an assistant to dress nicely anyways. Satisfied with his small attempt, Cody went back out into the other room, remembering to grab Penny's vest as he hiked down the stairway of her apartment to head back to the studio.</span></div></div>",

Fix this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was a bit surprised to be seeing himself from this angle. <i>'Is my voice really like that?'</i> he wondered for a moment, gawking at Penny in his body. <i>'No wonder they want to kick me out of the place. What a loudmouth!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to say something?\" Penny asked, stomping a small foot on the ground, which Cody had to laugh at. He didn't know why, but seeing his own body act so demanding was funny to him! He hated it when other people treated him this way, but it was a lot of fun when he wasn't on the receiving end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't want to fix it right now,\" Cody replied with Penny's voice, resting his hands behind his head shrugging. \"I need your body to see the filming of the fight, after all! No one's going to let a little kid into the studio.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was shocked at the reply. \"Y-you can't just steal my body like that!

Now leave me alone, or I'll be late!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny sniffed the air for a second. \"Did you even shower?

It wouldn't be that bad, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked onto the set where the fight was going to be, people still seemed a bit scattered and lost. Apparently the director was still stuck in the throes of some sort of panic attack. He was yelling and howling about the whole studio, telling everyone how they were doing everything wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's acting like a cranky old lady,\" a stray staff member complained. \"Won't calm down even for a moment...\" It suddenly dawned on Cody that this was probably his fault, but he wasn't in the mood to fix it yet. His thoughts were focused back on Penny, and how she might get in his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where on Earth is the Nickel Samurai!? Get Engarde on set!\" the 'Director' shouted from his seat, \"actors these days have no punctuality!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'The Nickel Samurai is going to be in this?!

If he wanted to make sure she didn't interrupt his 'adventure', he'd have to find a way to either hide himself or hide the remote.

Even if Penny managed to break in, she couldn't force him to do anything <i>or</i> somehow steal the remote from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProud of himself, he strutted outside the locker room, intent on heading back to the location to watch more of the shooting, but a voice suddenly reached out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you!\" It was a woman that Cody didn't really recognize at all. She had long blonde hair that went down her back and a small, square pair of glasses, as well as a blue top. She had a phone in her off-hand, with a call apparently on hold. \"You have a moment?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get back to filming, so not really,\" Cody replied rudely. The woman ignored him and instead stared at him up and down. She seemed to be sizing up Penny's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get back to filming,\" she said, \"but we might be able to have something new for you today. I'm Adrian, in charge of casting. Mindy's body double can't make it on-set, and not too many people can fill the costume. The director's having a bit of a meltdown though and the producers will lose it if we delay two days in a row.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with me?\" Cody replied, eyes shifting about to make sure it was just them. <i>'Does she know what I did to Oldbag?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you'd fit the costume well enough,\" Andrews replied with a shrug. \"How would you like to jump into the costume and be the Pink Princess for a scene or two? We're in a bit of rush, so I bet the studio would let me fudge the rules for an afternoon. And if we need to do it again during the filming, well, maybe you can have them sign you on for a credit. So how about it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cody processed what she was saying, stars appeared in his eyes. \"Really? I can be in the movie!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady laughed, \"sorta. You'll be in costume the whole time though. We're in a rush but thankfully you don't need makeup. Just run over to Mindy's trailer and they'll get you a costume.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to tell him twice; Cody took the order literally and bolted from the building, rushing over to the trailer. It bummed him out that he would have to be the Pink Princess, the girliest character of them all, but he put that aside in light of getting to be on-screen. In light of this, being a girl didn't seem all that bad! Even if it wasn't his real body who'd get the credit, he didn't want to pass up the opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe if I do well, they'll let me do it again!'</i> Cody mused enthusiastically as he arrived at the trailer. </span></div></div>",

He regretted putting Oldbag in Manella's body in the first place, for the entire filming she was constantly shouting and making everyone do each scene over and over again telling them that \"If it isn't perfect, your not trying hard enough!\". The filming went on late too, Oldbag pushing everyone to finish all the work today, the only reason the filming stopped was because the guy playing the Nickel Samurai refused to film anymore and went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that annoyed Cody a bit was the costume, it was easily the pinkest and girliest thing that he ever worn in his life. He returned to the trailer where he got it and put it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the trailer he ran into Adrian. \"Ah, there you are.\" Adrian said. \"Thanks for filling in today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody let out a tired reply. \"Yeah, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian pulled out a small business card and handed it to Cody. \"I'll cut to the chase.

It didn't particularly hurt. \"Just give me my body back now! I don't want to be stuck like this; you could ruin my job!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody pushed her away and crossed Penny's arms indignantly. \"Hey! I'll have you know you might get a promotion because of me, so stop complaining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A promotion, like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like body double,\" Cody replied proudly. \"...for the Pink Princess,\" he mumbled a bit more embarrassed as he looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny seemed shocked, and was quiet for a moment as she processed it. \"R-really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! So just buzz off and let me keep doing what I'm doing, okay? I think I'm being you just fine,\" Cody said as he pushed back against Penny, sending her stumbling back. He continued walking towards the studio, doing his best to ignore Penny's presence behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! No, I don't care if you get me promoted to Director, I need you to switch me back! Don't just leave!\" It seemed Penny wasn't going to back down. Cody supposed he would have to do <i>something</i> about her to keep her quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe I can do something to keep her happy for a while? That might quiet her down. Today was rough, maybe her body isn't worth it in the long run...'</i> Cody considered as he pretended to ignore Penny. In truth, he was sorta just being contrarian for the sake of it. He had been considering giving Penny her body back since the filming finished, but it bothered him that she was trying to <i>make </i>him do it. He could just give her back her body, or maybe strike some sort of deal with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or I could just make it worse for her. Hah! Maybe I <i>could </i>promote her to director. Doubt she'd like that. Or maybe give her a job on security...' Cody thought with a mean grin as he patted the device in his vest pocket. He could switch Penny with anyone and threaten to leave her there if she didn't cooperate! He had barely tested the remote's other functions at all now that he thought of it. There were probably other ways he could use it to make her quiet down the more he thought of it.</span></div></div>",

With the combination of the annoyance of Penny in his body and the stressful directing of Oldbag it might be best to kill two birds with one stone and switch the two of them. That way he could keep Oldbag in his body away from the studio, and thus far away from him, and he could blackmail Penny with the threat of staying in Manella's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly pulled the remote out from Penny's vest and pointed it at her, pressed the 'Aware Swap' button, and quickly put the remote back in the vest. It didn't seem that Penny noticed what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to walk back to the set where the movie was being filmed. Penny was following behind him continuing to beg for her body back, he did his best to ignore her. Did he sound this annoying when he wanted something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reached the studio and luckily for Cody, Oldbag in Manella's body was still there. She was yelling to the clean up crew about something, Cody was too annoyed by the multiple rants she had given during the filming to listen in on whatever she was yelling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed the remote at her in Manella's body and once again clicked the 'Aware Swap' button. In a moment it was clear that the swap had worked. He looked at his own body which was looking around disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! No kids allowed on the studio, get out before I get security!\" He looked down on Oldbag in his body. It felt great to be the one giving her orders and threatening to kick her out of the studio for a change. He put the remote back into Penny's vest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOldbag just looked up at Cody, the realization of the situation kicking in. She just ran away from him, both in fear of security taking her away and in fear of whatever had swapped her body twice in the past two days would do something to her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody gave a confident smile as he saw Oldbag run away, but his grin turned into a grimace as he her Manella's body give out a scream. He turned around and saw Penny in Manella's body coming toward him \"What did you do?!\" She practically yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want to be me, so I swapped you again.\" Cody said, his smirk slowly returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be me again, give me my body back!\" She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nope! I don't wanna\" Cody smugly said. \"I think I'll stay you for a little longer.\" He said and rubbed a finger under Penny's nose. \"Oh yeah! I almost forgot, don't tell anyone about the swaps, not that anyone would believe you anyway, but if you do, there are plenty of worse bodies to put you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was completely dumbstruck, she looked like she wanted to say some, but nothing came out. Soon she just gave up and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left, some other studio employees came up to Cody. \"Don't worry about the director yelling about you doing something wrong, he's been doing that to everyone today.\" An employee said, not knowing what had actually just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was like he was like he was different person today.\" Cody giggled at his own joke \"But I have a feeling he'll be better tomorrow.\" He said and walked way from the studio once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was out of the studio again, he wondered what to do next. He supposed he could just go back to Penny's apartment like he did last night, but he was at 'his' job all day. He figured he had earned some fun. Although he didn't know where an adult could go to have fun, maybe he could spend some of 'his' money? At the same time though, he was tired, maybe he should go back to Penny's apartment and rest till tomorrow's shooting?</span></div></div>",

He opened up Penny's vest pocket to put away the remote as he walked across the street from the studio, but he stopped as he saw a distraught 'Oldbag' standing at the street corner. It looked like she was waiting for a bus, but the way she seemed to just stare off into space made it clear that a lot was on 'her' mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody of course, realized that this was a loose end he needed to tie up. Manella didn't know that Penny was now in his body, or that Oldbag was in Cody's body, but Cody wasn't sure how much Manella or Oldbag knew at all. At any rate, he <i>did</i> worry a bit at the prospect of the three of them teaming up against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis worry increased when Manella, seeming to grow impatient, walked away from the stop, returning to the studio. <i>'Oh no, is he looking for someone?'</i> Cody's mind began to assume the worst; Manella was looking for Oldbag in his body, and he'd soon find Penny instead. He couldn't let Penny tell Sal that <i>he</i> was the reason for the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked over the remote and its functions once again, examining the various buttons. <i>'There's the one! Please work.'</i> he thought to himself as he quickly clicked down on 'possession'. With this he could follow anyone without being seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Cody felt weightless. Right below him was Penny's body, just as he left it. For a second it seemed a bit stunned, but it quickly regained composure as it closed the vest pocket Cody left open and began walking away. \"Man I smell... need to go shower,\" Cody heard Penny's voice mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'It just acts like normal!'</i> Cody realized. 'Doesn't even know I was there!' He would smile if he could, but he didn't exactly have a face. This was good news for him though - it meant he was free to leave Penny's body and it would just take care of things in his absence. Cody's mind was brimming with all sorts of ideas for 'excursions' he could take, until he remembered the task at hand. He looked back to the entrance, and realized he had lost track of his target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dang it!'</i> he shouted wordlessly as he floated across the road, trying to make up for lost distance. <i>'Can't let an old lady beat me!' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took him a few minutes to get to the entrance to the studio. He probably should have waited till he got closer to Manella before he left Penny's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the studio Cody looked around and to his disappointment he didn't see Manella anywhere around him. Suddenly and idea came into Cody's head, he floated upward and got an aerial view of the studio. While the fact that he was flying was amazing, he tried his best to stay focused and find Manella in Oldbag's body. To his shock, he could see Oldbag's body was already halfway to the area that the filming from earlier today took place. Cody knew he took a while floating to and above the studio, but he didn't think he took that long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody quickly floated back down to ground level. He knew at this point that there was no way he could float over to where Manella was fast enough, he would need a body to catch up to him first. Thankfully for him, he saw three people nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was the actor who played the Nickel Samurai, his name was 'Matt Onnguard' or something like that, Cody didn't fully remember it. While becoming a guy again, even if it was just for a short time, was tempting. Matt's body did have a disadvantage, fame. If he possessed him there was a chance that either fans or staff might stop him on his way across the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person he saw was the Steel Samurai, or 'Will' as his name apparently was, but he would always be the Steel Samurai to Cody. While possessing him was extremely tempting, as he could become the Steel Samurai himself. His body would have the same problem as Matt's, maybe even more so since he was the star of the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third person he saw was that Adrian lady from earlier. While becoming a girl again wasn't something he particularly wanted to do, her body had less of a chance of being stopped then the other two. Although she seemed to be involved with the movie, she wasn't and actor like the other two were, so hopefully less people would want to see her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was wasting time thinking about who to possess, Cody quickly made his decision and flew into one of their bodies. Who did he possess?</span></div></div>",

He did a lot of sneaking around, and generally it was best to act like you weren't out of place at all! His time as Penny reinforced that; people wouldn't pay attention to him, so he'd have free reign of the studio in Adrian's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, he dived into the bofy of the unsuspecting talent agent, who was typing out an email on her phone. To Adrian, everything momentarily went cold and faded to black as her consciousness took a backseat. For Cody, sensations began to return as his mind moved in and he regained a physical form. His first instinct was to wrap his arms around himself, as he all of a sudden felt cold and exposed with Adrian's bare arms and shoulders out to the wind. \"Brrr... this body needs a t-shirt or something,\" Cody complained in Adrian's voice. He put the phone away in his left pocket, and realized the remote was now in his right. Glad that he still had it, he stowed it away in Adrian's right pocket. He realized it had been a while now since he heard his own voice come from his mouth, and it was starting to bother him less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Why would I want to go back right now anyways? Not like anyone lets my body do anything,'</i> he thought as he took stock of his new form. Adrian's body was even more different than Penny's! She still had glasses, but her hair was much longer. Cody found himself running his hands through it, amazed at how soft it was. Penny just kept hers tied up, and Cody didn't bother trying to undo it. Her clothes were tighter as well, an highlighted just how differently Adrian was shaped than himself or Penny. In addition to her shirt leaving much of her upper body exposed, her pants were a lot tighter than what Cody was used to wearing. He felt around her legs and hips, noticing how long her legs were as well as how different her body was overall. It was a little overwhelming for someone like Cody! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get back on course, he took off Adrian's glasses and shook her head, sending hair flying about, as he reminded himself of the task at hand. He could explore what a girl's body was like anytime, right now he needed to reach Sal again. Using Adrian's legs, he began to run to the area he saw Oldbag's body approaching, the filming shoot. As Adrian's chest bounced and his breathing got heavier, he began to feel like he may have made the wrong choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Adrian's body was still faster than Oldbag's, who seemed to just be walking at a grouchy pace. Using his experience sneaking around, Cody caught up with Sal and trailed behind, managing to stay unseen. Observing from a distance, Cody watched as Sal...</span></div></div>",

After that brief moment of relief however, he felt like slapping his forehead. Thinking it over, he did over react a bit, The only thing he saw was Sal in Oldbag's body walking toward the studio and he just jumped to the worst conclusion. \"It's his fault, he forgot his stupid purse.\" Cody made an excuse for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the back of his head, he wondered what to do next. He briefly thought about going back to Penny's body, but decided against it. Not only did being in Penny's body all day tire him out, but he also had to deal with the real Penny pestering him. At least now she would have no idea whose body he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also wondered whether or not he should stay as Adrian or go find a different body. The weird feelings he felt every time he moved around in her body weirded him out to say the least. However, her body had just as much, if not more free reign of the studio than Penny's did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted as he heard Adrian's phone ringing from her pocket. He pulled out the phone and answered it \"Uh, hello?\" He asked nervous<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian! What the heck?! I agreed to be in the movie, but I don't remember agreeing to having to deal with a director with that short a fuse!\" The person on the phone practically yelled at Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody recognized the voice as the Nickel Samurai. Weird, he didn't seem like such a jerk when he was acting on the studio with everyone. Cody didn't feel like getting scolded, he dealt with that enough when he was himself, so he hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was over with, Cody resumed thinking about whether or not he should stay as Adrian. If he did stay as her, he could meet the Nickel Samurai, it seemed him and Adrian were associated. Although, he seemed like he acted like a jerk toward Adrian, Cody didn't know if he wanted to deal with that. Although, if the Nickel Samurai was too much of a jerk, he could use the remote on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over for another minute or so, Cody decided to...</span></div></div>",

The only person within view was Sal, and he was using Oldbag's body! Gross. Not to mention, the only people after that were the actors, and a day of just being a double had tired out Cody enough. \"Guess I'll just keep this one for a bit. Might confuse Penny atleast,\" he decided, looking downward at his new, temporary body. He'd just have to try to adapt to the new sensations; as long as he had this device, it was a thing he'd need to get used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that filming was over, Cody decided he'd just make his way over to where-ever this lady lived. He looked over her ID, and realized that she lived further away than Penny did. <i>'Maybe she doesn't work here all the time?'</i> It was definitely inconvenient for him, to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through her limited pocket space, Cody realized that she didn't seem to have any car keys. \"Aw, I was looking forward to driving...\" he mourned. It was possible she had one somewhere in a bag or purse, but he didn't know where she would leave them. \"How do I get to her house then?\" he wondered aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody supposed he could try to get a ride somewhere. He'd been inside taxis before, so it probably wouldn't be hard to find one. Failing that, he could just ask someone who was leaving to give him a ride. He knew that a lot of the actors had cars, and Adrian seemed to know them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option was, well, to just stay at the studio overnight. He knew that there were beds set aside in some of the dressing rooms, and not every actor would be there tomorrow, so he could probably use one without getting caught. It probably broke some rules, but certainly sounded like fun. He could have full access to the studio without anyone telling him what to do! He could look at all the sets and mess with the props and the costumes and everything. </span></div></div>",

He made his way to a nearby dressing room, and after making sure it was empty, hid inside it. Cody figured that once everyone left the shooting, no one would check the dressing rooms. There weren't many security guards at the studio and, as he had learned from the multiple times he had snuck in before, most of them just stayed by the exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was inside he was relieved to find that this dressing room had a bed in it. As he went an sat down on the bed he realized something, he didn't feel as tired anymore. He didn't notice until now, due to him panicking over finding Manella earlier. Maybe it was because he went into a different body? After all, he went and did all that work and tired himself out in Penny's body. Adrian's body hadn't been doing body double work all day so it wouldn't be tired out, Or at least, that was the only explanation he could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's thinking was interrupted by the ringing of Adrian's phone once again. However, this time, he chose to ignore it. It wasn't like he lost anything if Adrian missed a few calls anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling wide awake and bored, Cody thought about what to do next. He supposed he could try to go to sleep, it was nighttime after all. However, his eyes were drawn to some costumes and other clothes that were in the dressing room, he could play around for a while to waste some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he decided to...</span></div></div>",

Lucky coincidence I guess.\" Cody couldn't believe the luck! The Steel Samurai costume itself was too small, but the next best thing worked. He had to stifle a giggle at the sight in the mirror; the Nickel Samurai costume from the neck down with this woman's face on top. Thankfully the costumes were all basically the same, so he knew how this one went on thanks to his time as Penny earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Cody put on the helmet, completing the costume. \"Stop right there! For I am the Nickel Samurai!\" he shouted, pumping an arm into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samurai kick!\" he followed up, swinging out a leg and accidentally knocking over a nearby wig stand. \"Whoops,\" Cody mumbled. He bent over to put it back up. As he pulled the wig off the ground, he realized something about it was a bit familiar. Its was black, with the hair tied up top in a knot. \"Hmm, where have I seen this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decide to peruse the costume rack a bit more to jog his memory. He took off the mask, since it was hard enough to see with Adrian's glasses anyways.  when he found what he was looking for; a set of robes that the woman who was following that lawyer guy around wore. He couldn't imagine what they were doing here. Maybe the director guy liked how it looked? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as he was looking over the robes that he heard the gate cling off in the distance. \"Uh oh,\" he mumbled. Did a camera catch the noise of the stand knocking down? He realized he had to act quickly; it'd be hard to explain what he was doing in the Samurai outfit. He quickly disrobed, opting to throw the costume off into the corner rather than set it back up, and then considered what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo thoughts came to him. He <i>could</i> try to pretend being Adrian. She seemed to be important, so she could probably go anywhere on set whenever right? He had barely been paying attention when she introduced herself though, so he couldn't really be sure. He had already forgotten her last name by this stage. The alternative option was to throw on another costume. If he put on the wig and took off the glasses just for a bit, Cody was willing to bet that Adrian would look reasonably different. If he had the bravery to try the robes, he could probably pass for an actress in the movie. He'd just lie and say he was running really late. No one would look too deeply right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he likely didn't have much time so he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the security guards knocked on the door he quickly put them on, he wasn't super positive that the wig was covering all of Adrian's hair or if he even put the robes on correctly, but it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door to find a security guard. \"The studios closed. All staff were supposed to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody rolled his eyes \"Well, I'm supposed to be here.\" he lied. \"The scene I'm supposed to be in couldn't be filmed today. So, we're going to do it tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security guard didn't seem to be buying it \"Is there anyone who can verify this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh. Of course there is. Her name was Adrian, I can't remember her last name, but she seemed to be very important.\" Cody gave and excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security guard seemed to begin to buy it. \"Alright, I'll beleive you for now, but rest assured I will be asking studio managment about his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Cody said and closed the door on the guard. He put his ear to the door and made sure to listen for the guard walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was sure that the guard was gone, he took off the robes and the wig. \"Ha! dumb guard! Maybe I should be an actor.\" Cody boasted as he rubbed Adrian's nose. He did briefly think about how he could have accidently gotten Adrian in trouble with his excuse, but he brushed off the thought, it wasn't like he was the one who would be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cody wanted to play around in the Nickel Samurai costume again. He knew that would be risky. If he made another loud noise there was a chance that either that guard would come back or another guard would come. Looking at a clock, Cody saw just how late it was getting. Cody decided to just lay on a couch that was in the room with him and get some rest.</span></div></div>",

He looked around, confused as to where he was at first, but then he remembered that he had slept at the studio overnight. He wasn't so surprised that he had woken up in a woman's body this time, after all, this was the second day in a row that the wasn't himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got off the couch and stretched his limbs. He looked out a window and saw that it was still pretty early in the morning. This was definitely one disadvantage of taking an adult's body, not being able to sleep in on a summer day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in a mirror and saw Adrian's reflection looking back. It defiantly looked like he had just crawled out of bed. Her hair was a complete mess and her clothes were all wrinkled up. He supposed he could get Adrian ready for the day, but he decided against it. He was only planning to be her until he could find a better body to take. Since people were already working, it shouldn't take him too long to find another body. Plus, there wasn't exactly much in the way of regular clothes in this room, and as much as Cody would love to walk around the studio in the Nickel Samurai costume, it would probably draw too much attention to him. He didn't want anyone to suspect he wasn't who he looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody left the dressing room and began to walk around the studio. He got a few odd looks from people, he ignored most of them, but would stick his tongue out and insult the occasional person. During his walk around the studio, Cody searched for a body to take, while he didn't find one immediately, he stumbled upon something very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face paled upon seeing them. His body, Oldbag's body, and Manella's body, all with misplaced occupants were talking to each other. He crouched down hid behind a nearby bush to eavesdrop on them. He couldn't make out the whole conversation, due to distance, but he was able to figure one thing out. Penny told them that he was the one that caused the whole body swapping incident to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was angry at first, he couldn't believe that Penny had snitched on him, but his angry soon turned into laughter when he realized that none of them knew what body he was currently in. As far as they knew, he was still in Penny's body. Right now, Penny's body was acting as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cody saw the three of them go off, presumably to confront 'Cody', Cody wondered what to do It would certainly be entertaining to watch the three of them confront and harass Penny's body while watching from the sidelines in Adrian's body. in fact, while he was watching them he could potentially use the remote on them and find a way to get them off his trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, following them had risk. If he were to be seen in Adrian's body, they might put things together and figure out that he was Adrian right now. He didn't want them to know that he could jump into other bodies without swapping two bodies around. This also had the risk of them telling Adrian what happened and her also wanting to stop Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the body swapped trio walked away, Cody decided to....</span></div></div>",

He had no idea when Penny last ate, but after running all about he had drained a decent bit of energy from her body. He got up from the couch, hand over his stomach, and began to look over the small kitchen Penny had attached to her living room. Unfortunately, there was nothing that he knew how to cook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he reached a hand over his pocket, \"she has money I guess. I'll go out for food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Cody grabbed Penny's keys and stepped out the apartment door to go find someplace he could eat for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later, after some wandering, Cody came across 'Eldoon's Noodle Stand'. He decided it was good enough and pushed back the curtain to take a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man with a bowl on is head and what seemed to be stringy hair came out to greet. \"Well hey there, young lady. What can I get for you?\" he asked genially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody replied with a scowl. \"Don't call me young lady!\" he shouted back, seemingly unaware of the irony that statement carried with Penny's body and voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the stand seemed surprised at the hostility, \"alright alright, jeeze. What can I get you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with himself, Cody proceeded to order two bowls of ramen for himself with Penny's money. He began digging in, glad to finally get something to eat after being preoccupied with the Samurai and the Remote all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny?\" A voice called from a few seats away. Cody ignored it and continued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny! Is that you?\" the voice asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh, yeah!' </i>Cody suddenly realized, <i>'that's me!'</i> He turned his head to the right to meet a somewhat familiar face; it was a woman about Penny's age with black hair tied in a not, and loose blue robes that went around her knees. It was the nice lady who had been with the mean lawyer way back during the trial. He remembered that she was also a fan of the Steel Samurai, which put her in his good graces. Thankfully, her lawyer friend seemed absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, hi!\" he replied, not recalling her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while, Penny! I never got to thank you for those Pink Princess cards you know,\" Maya continued. \"How have things been going for you. Still working at the studio?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" he replied excitedly between slurps of food, an excited look spreading over Penny's face, \"they're shooting a Steel Samurai movie now y'know? Its really exciting, tomorrow they're going to film the fight with the Magistrate and I'm going to watch!\" He bragged with a level of enthusiasm that seemed uncharacteristic of Penny, but he didn't seem to care at all for acting like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Really?\" Thankfully for Cody, Maya barely noticed. \"You're so lucky! I've been off training, so I don't get much time to do anything fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody ran a finger under Penny's nose, \"yeah, it's pretty great.\" Cody smugly crossed his arms before continuing, \"I bet I could get you into the studio!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya gave a laugh, \"that'd be great, but I gotta head back home tomorrow. I haven't had a lot of time to myself recently.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked over to Maya and began thinking. He had fun today, but it was a bit boring at Penny's apartment. He didn't really know any of her friends, but Maya seemed nice to him. Maybe he could show her the device? She seemed like she could stand to have some fun too after all. However, that ran the risk of her telling someone else about, like that annoying lawyer guy. Even worse, she might ruin his fun if she found out that he wasn't the real Penny. She was cool for a grown-up, but even Cody realized that she might not be okay with him stealing someone's body. She hadn't noticed anything suspicious yet though, so maybe he could keep his true identity a secret for a while? He wanted to do something to kill his boredom at any rate, so maybe he could just ask Maya to do something normal with him.</span></div></div>",

Wish I could though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody didn't understand half of what Maya said, he barely knew her, he didn't even know her name, so having a conversation about her was hard for him. He did understand one thing though, 'I wish I could. Cody pulled the remote out of Penny's vest pocket. \"I bet you could be in two places at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya laughed again. \"Nice one Penny. That would be nice though, too bad it's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody rubbed his borrowed nose again. \"No it isn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA puzzled look formed on Maya's face \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this!\" Cody said as he pointed the remote at her and did an aware swap. In an instant he was now sitting where Maya had been. Her body felt completely different from Penny's. Her hair was a lot longer then Penny's and the knot it was tied in felt weird. Her clothes felt completely strange. They felt so loose and he couldn't wrap his mind around not wearing pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya in Penny's body was freaking out, feeling around everything that felt different. She dropped the remote while she was freaking out. Penny's glasses fell off her face as she kept moving around in her seat so fast. \"What? How? What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody picked up the remote and showed it to Maya. He explained how the remote came from nowhere and what it did. He didn't tell her that he wasn't Penny though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was outright amazed at the device \"Wow! That's amazing!\" Was all she could say, thinking of all the things the device could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this you can come to the studio with me tomorrow, then we can both see the Samurai fight the Magistrate! We just have to either have you possess someone or swap your body with someone\" Cody said happily. He pointed the remote at Maya in Penny's body.

Penny's outfit was pretty unisex, which made it sorta easy to forget he was a girl, and he was starting to grow accustomed to the glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his stolen body, he turned his attention to an excited Maya. \"So!\" he said, pointing to the remote, \"now you can stay as long as you want, and I know a way to make it so that you don't miss your training either.\" He proceeded to explain to Maya the possession function, and how it would cause her body to act as normal without her. \"You can stay here and your body will do the training for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya seemed hesitant, \"but what about the person I possess?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody shrugged, \"it'll just be a day or two, right? Besides, you deserve a day off, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Maya said, thinking about it before snapping her fingers, \"yeah! You're right.

See'ya!\" She got up, straightening out her dress, and walked out of the noodle stand. Cody was a little worried for a second, being alone without the device, when suddenly the curtain to the stand opened up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!

Or, someone else\u2019s,\u201d she said with a grin and a shrug of the shoulders. \u201cDesiree was an acquaintance of ours from a case Nick and I investigated. I listened in on her phone call before swooping in, it sounded like her husband was going to be out of town for a few days. Means she\u2019s free as far as I know!\u201d Maya said with a smile as she crossed her arms under Desiree\u2019s chest. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely a pretty one, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody wasn\u2019t really sure how to reply. His face briefly went red, suddenly intimidated by the much older woman in front of him. For some reason, Penny and Maya didn\u2019t make him nearly as nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya tilted her head, looking concerned. \u201cYou okay there Penny? Looking a bit feverish.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah! Its fine! You look great!\u201d He replied, pulling up his hands in a bid to regain composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Cody, Maya brushed the gaff aside, too enthralled with her new body. She was running her hands through her hair, examining her outfit, and taking stock of her new proportions. She seemed overall thrilled at the prospect of having more time off, thrilled enough to not notice how \u2018Penny\u2019 was behaving.<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is your apartment?\u201d Maya asked as they entered into Penny\u2019s abode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!

Sound like fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Maya replied. \"I bet I could make a good you. Besides, it's your remote, right? You should be able to use it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited to finally get a new body, Cody gave a nod to Maya. \"Just wait here!

Sorry about that Penny, I think I might have dozed off there for a second,\" her body said to 'Penny'. \"I ought to get going, think I need to sleep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya-in-Penny's body just gave a nod, fascinated at seeing her body act independently of her. \"Uh, yeah, see you around Maya!\" she said with a wave. it was definitely uncomfortable leaving her body to just act on its own without her, but the idea of getting to leave her responsibilities behind for a night held a definite appeal. Maya got up from her chair and walked out the curtain of Eldoon's noodles, waiting for the person she thought was Penny to return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody, for his part, was thrilled to get the chance to use a new function. Possession was exciting, it was like he could fly! He floated upwards above the city and looked down at the blocks near the noodle shop as he searched for a new body to take. He had only chosen Penny because of her access to the studio and the fact that he had an opening. Now he was just limited by how many people were within a block or so! Although he supposed he had to pick someone Penny would be likely to pick, he figured he could maybe pick someone whose body had more authority than hers. For whatever reason, people kept trying to boss him around when he was her! He wanted someone people wouldn't mess with. This time, he decided to look for someone taller, or maybe a bit older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick survey of everyone who was within a block or so, Cody figured he would have to make a decision, lest he keep Maya waiting for too long. There were two people who stuck out to him. One was an older lady who had been walking with a bunch of older kids, they called her 'Professor Courte' and they wished her a good evening as they walked off. Cody thought she was dressed oddly for a teacher, wearing a green track suit, but he knew that people took Professors seriously! Not to mention she was taller than Penny by nearly a foot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other person appealed to Cody a bit more because he was a guy, but Cody realized that Maya might think it weird if 'Penny' took a man's body. He recognized him as one of the lawyers at the Steel Samurai trial. He was the one wearing a red suit with grey hair, although Cody couldn't really remember his name. He was the persecutor? Cody couldn't remember the right word for it. Cody thought he was a bit too stuck-up looking, remembered that everyone listened to him though, and would call him a genius. Cody was willing to bet that with his body, anyone would listen to what he had to say! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich person does he choose? </span></div></div>",

If Maya asked why 'Penny' possessed a guy, he could probably come up with an excuse. He flew toward the guy from the trial and possessed him. He stumbled a bit due to the man walking before Cody possessed him, but he quickly got his footing. After taking a few seconds to get used to the new body, Cody headed back to the noodle stand where Maya was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody made his way back to the stand and sat next to Maya in Penny's body. Maya was clearly shocked to see 'Edgeworth' at this noodle stand, she suspected it was 'Penny', but didn't say anything just in case it wasn't. Cody turned to Maya with a big smile on his face. \"The possession button worked!\" He told her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nearly burst out laughing hearing 'Edgeworth' talk in such an upbeat and happy tone. \"That's awesome Penny!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Cody and Maya were both in different bodies one question remained, \"what to do you want to do now? We'll have to wait till tomorrow to go and see the Steel Samurai filming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya actually did burst out laughing now. \"Sorry, it's just that the thought of Edgeworth being a Steel Samurai fan is way too funny.\" She said. \"I guess we could wait at 'My' place until tomorrow. OR we could go somewhere else, with this remote we could have a lot of fun!\" She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody thought about it. Going back to Penny's place seemed like a good idea, he was mentally exhausted from this complicated day and could use some rest. On the other hand, going around town with someone else as other people could be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over, he decided to...</span></div></div>",

In an instant, he could tell it worked as he felt a sudden, immense weight on his head. He pulled a hand upwards and ran a hand through Lotta's strange afro, and tugged a bit at her headband. The weight of the camera held his shoulders down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention: he was tall now! Cody could feel his heart pound with excitement at the prospect. Now that he was an adult, he could go where-ever he wanted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IN TARNATION!?!\" A loud voice tore through Cody's revelry. He leaped in surprise, and it took him a moment to realize it was his <i>own</i> voice, coming from underneath the box. Cody was about to rush over in order to reclaim the remote, when he was interrupted by two security guards rushing into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! You're not supposed to be here!\" exclaimed the scratchy and annoyed voice of a woman that Cody was very familiar with: Wendy Oldbag. \"I've already kicked you out twice today!\" Cody could have sworn she was talking to him for a second, but he knew that couldn't be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, the trespasser's over there!\" Cody exclaimed, trying to hide his shock at his own voice, as he pointed over to Lotta, who was struggling to get out of Cody's own hiding space from across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guard - a much younger woman with black hair adorned by several barrettes - gave a sigh. \"I'll go get the kid Wendy. Can you manage the reporter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman nearly spat as she grabbed Cody by his new wrist, \"bah! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Kids these days foisting all the hard work on their elders..</font> Yeah I'll get rid of her. Come on you paparazzo! You know the drill!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody shouted, fussed, and fought the whole way, but Wendy somehow had the stronger will. With a violent shove, Cody landed on his backside outside the gate to global studios, still in this strange woman's body. He couldn't believe it! How could they kick him out even after he was a grown up? Was this lady not involved in the movie? Not long after, Maggey brought his old body as well, who seemed too frazzled and confused to fight back. As she let Lotta in Cody's body go, Cody quickly ran over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Do you still have the remote?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta was like a deer in headlights, staring at her own body. \"T-the what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A small remote! I need it to fix this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, still baffled. \"I, er, the guard took something like that I think?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it for a second and replied </span></div></div>",

He would have to sneak back into the studio right now, but could he do it in this Lady's body? She was much bigger than him and he doubted he could fit into any of the vents he had used to sneak in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he had an idea, he could have the lady who was in his body now sneak in and steal the remote from Oldbag, because she was in his body, she could easily go through any of the ways that he went through and get that remote back! Although, Cody wasn't sure if he should rely on this lady, not only had she been caught too, but according to Oldbag, she had been caught once more than he was. Plus, she was an adult and Cody didn't want to rely on an adult to get something back for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody realized that he didn't have much time to think about this, he needed to get the remote back, and he needed to get it back fast. Not only did he not want to be stuck in this body, but there was one more important thing to consider. The remote is currently in Oldbag's hands! If she were to use the remote, or find out what it is, there was no way she would give it back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Cody wanted was for someone else to find out about the remote, he had already screwed up and got into a situation where he had to tell this lady about the remote, but Oldbag knowing about it would be a thousand times worse! He needed to find a way back into the studio, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he chose what to do, he looked through this lady's pockets, ignoring the yelling of her from right next to him about invading her privacy.

Needless to say, he hated her. He grimaced at the thought of using the remote on her. However, he soon came to the realisation that this was the perfect opportunity to turn the tables. He still didn't particularly like the idea of using it on her, but getting revenge for all the times she'd thrown him out would make it worth it. Not to mention, she worked here. If he used the remote on her, he could walk around the studios all he liked without being thrown out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was just a question of which button to use. If he used an Aware Swap, he'd be in her body, getting to walk around Global Studios as he pleased, while she'd be stuck in his body, getting thrown out the front gate. Although, that did mean he'd be leaving the security lady to do whatever in his body, and there was always the chance she'd screw this up for him. Using the Possession button would get he out of the way completely, and he'd be able to roam the studios while his body snuck around getting some pictures or something. The Shapeshift button would turn him into the security lady, but she'd still be herself, so she wouldn't suspect anything wrong unless she saw him. He might even be able to ruin her reputation by doing things as her. The Unaware Swap seemed the most useless in this situation, since everyone would still see him as a kid even though he had the body of an old lady, but at the very least, if they had each others bodies, she probably wouldn't be strong enough to drag him away like she usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Could have sworn I heard someone in here,\" Cody heard the security lady mutter. \"Must be my mind playing tricks on me. Better not be one of them whippersnappers.\" She stepped out of the dressing room, and was about to close the door, when Cody made up his mind, pressing one of the buttons just before the door was closed on him.</span></div></div>",

It felt weird being in a girl's body, and he could feel a bit of a pain in his hip, but the important thing was that the remote had worked. He was in the old security lady's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the-!\" Cody heard a voice call out from inside the dressing room. It took him a moment to realise it was his own voice, although not under his own command. He looked back into the room to see his own body bursting out of the box he'd been hiding in. \"What's going on here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a devilish grin on his face, Cody walked up to his old body, and snatched the remote right out of its hand while its current occupant was busy freaking out over what was going on. \"I'll be taking that,\" he said, already getting irritated by the old lady's voice coming out when he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-! You're-!\" the security lady said from Cody's body, not sure how to react to seeing her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of her confusion, Cody grabbed onto his backpack, saying, \"You're not allowed to be in here anymore,\" and started dragging the security lady out of the dressing room. That was when she finally found her tongue. She started rambling, way too fast for Cody to keep track of what she was saying, although he was pretty sure he heard \"whippersnappers\" and \"techno doohickeys\" come up a few times. She kept struggling and trying to fight back as he continued to drag her along, but in Cody's young body, she didn't have the strength to resist him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally reached the front gate, Cody literally threw the security lady out of the studio, not even considering that he'd have to deal with any injuries his body sustained when he swapped back. For the time being, \"his body\" was the security lady, and this was revenge. \"And stay out!\" he shouted, before heading back into the studio. He didn't see what she did after that, but she'd have to sneak back in if she wanted to have another go at him now that he was back inside the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he'd dealt with the security lady, he wondered what he should do next. He could explore the studio freely now, so he could probably find out where they were filming. He might even be able to get the Steel Samurai's autograph. However, after dealing with the security lady and walking around for a bit, Cody was starting to see the problems with becoming someone so old. The pain in his hip had gotten worse from trying to drag the security lady around with her constantly fighting back. He could sit down and have a rest for a bit, but he didn't sneak in and use some magical body swapping remote just so he could sit around and do nothing. Maybe he could use the remote again. Preferably on someone younger. That way, he could get rid of the pain in his hip, but since he was already in the studio, whoever he swapped with would still be someone who was allowed to be here. Of course, that ran the risk of whoever he swapped with freaking out and causing a scene, which might result in his body swapping antics to be discovered.</span></div></div>",

The girls robes and the lack of pants felt completely alien to him.

He put one hand to his throat, just as surprised at his new voice as all of the other changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought process was interrupted by a familiar sounding shriek. That was his voice! He turned around to see the girl who he had swapped with in his body. She was having a similar reaction to him, although her's was mixed with horror as she had no idea how this swap had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody decided that this was good enough for a test, he was ready to swap back now. It was then that he noticed. He didn't have the remote! He looked back over to the girl again and saw that the remote had stayed in the hand of his body, thankfully, the girl hadn't dropped it. <i>'Why would the remote stay behind, who's stupid idea was that?!'</i> Cody thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Cody saw that the girl was pointing at him with shock and horror. She began to run over to him, the remote still in her hand. \"W-W-W-Why are you me?!\" She asked, with tears forming in Cody's eyes. Cody couldn't stand to see his body acting so....girly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody knew that he needed to give this situation some thought. He needed to get the remote back and get out of this girl's body. The simplist thing to do would be to explain the situation to the girl and hope that she would give back the remote. However, Cody wasn't sure if he wanted to do that. This was his remote and he wanted to keep it to himself. He didn't have much time to think about what to do since the girl was standing right in front of him, waiting for him to answer her question. He quickly chose to...</span></div></div>",

Deciding he didn't want to test it right there in front of everyone, Cody then walked a few blocks away to an empty street, where he pointed the remote at himself and clicked the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, he felt his body and clothes change. Looking down, he found himself dressed in the odd robes of that girl before, with bare, pale legs. \"Ah!\" he shouted in a high pitched voice, jumping as he realized he was suddenly wearing a skirt. the sensation of walking around without pants was definitely different. The girl's odd, pretzel shaped hair also became apparent, weighing down on his head. The device must have worked! \"Wow... now no one will stop me from getting on set!\" Cody exclaimed in the strange girl's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was about to change back, when he remembered the remote's instructions. All he had to do was click \"Undo\", so he wasn't in a rush. Not to mention, the security guards would be looking for his regular body, but they wouldn't be looking for some girl. He could use her form to sneak into the studio, and then change into another body once he got there. Determined to meet the samurai, Cody began to make his way back to the studio in his new disguise, giddy at the possibilities.</span></div></div>",

If he was caught again as himself before he used the remote on someone in the studio then the studio might call his parents instead of just kicking him out. He didn't want to get grounded by his parents. He decided to stay as the strange girl a little longer, just until he switched with someone in the studio. The girl's outfit didn't have any pockets, so he just put the remote in the sleeves of her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way back to the building, it had been over an hour since he tried sneaking in before, so hopefully he wouldn't be caught as quickly as he was earlier. He crawled inside using the usual vent, thankfully it wasn't covered up. Once he was inside he was going to head for where they were filming, but he heard people talking and it sounded as if they were coming closer. Panicking, he ran to the nearest room to avoid being seen, a dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside he hid. After a few minutes of no one coming into the room, he decided to leave his hiding spot. He was about to leave the dressing room when something caught his sight, a mirror. It was on a table, it was probably there for actor's to get ready. He hadn't really taken a good look at the girl's body. He went over to the mirror, standing on a chair so he could reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was really in someone else's body, it was so strange seeing the girl's reflection do everything that he did. He messed around with the mirror  for a while. Moving his hands to the top of her pretzel hair, making silly faces, jumping up and down. He couldn't believe that this was all real. As he was messing with the mirror he heard the door begin to open. He tried to hid, but it was to late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho walked into the room?</span></div></div>",

He was looking down at Cody with an angry scowl, and he spoke with a gruff voice.<i> 'What do I do what do I do?'</i> He backed up from the place he was standing, and the man's face suddenly shifted to surprise, and it then took a softer expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah, don't worry little girl! I'm not going to hurt you,\" he said, suddenly sounding much friendlier. \"I just want to know who you are, is that alright?\" He took a step closer, arms in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody didn't actually know what his body's name was, so instead he just reacted with the first thing that came to his mind. \"I'm not a little girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gave a soft chuckle at that. \"Alright alright I won't call you that. Let me guess, you're here to see the Steel Samurai?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's eyes perked up at this, and he quickly bounced up and down as he replied, \"Yes! Do you know where he is!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers gave a smile and pointed at this chest as he continued, \"yup, I know exactly where the Samurai is. Tell you what, how about I get him for you, huh? And then you answer his questions. Sound like a deal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody wasn't sure how much to trust this guy, but he figured this was his best chance. He replied with a nod of his head and the man motioned for him to follow. To be safe though, he kept one arm tucked into the girl's sleeve. That way he could draw the remote at a moment's notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two stopped outside a dressing room with the name \"Powers\" emblazoned on the front, and the man motioned for Cody to stop. \"I'll go in there and explain to the Samurai what's going on, okay young lady? He'll be out in a second and'll ask you some questions. Don't worry, he's a lot cooler than me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody waited there in the strange girl's body, his heart pounding as he waited for the Samurai to come out. He couldn't believe how easy that was! It must be the body he used to get in; he had felt adults always went a bit easier on girls. He had to wear a skirt to do it, but he'd probably do it again if it meant he could get into the studio. Maybe this girl's body would be useful to him in the future...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about it, he realized a great opportunity stood before him. He'd get to meet the steel Samurai! If he wanted, he could BECOME the Steel Samurai. All he needed was to get a good click with the remote, and any of the functions could help him fulfill his desire. He just had to do it fast and slyly. However, the samurai was a good guy, right? Stealing his body would probably be something a bad guy would try to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door began to creak open, Cody's small hand gripped the device, and he decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had seen the Steel Samurai many times, but never this close before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Steel Samurai bent down to Cody's current height and began to talk to him. \"Hello. Who are you?\" The Samurai asked with a kind voice. He sounded a bit familiar, but Cody couldn't figure out where he heard the voice before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody didn't know how to answer the Steel Samurai's question. He didn't know the girl's name, so he couldn't answer with that. He couldn't say his own name, because he obviously wasn't a boy name 'Cody' right now. \"I'm, uh, I'm a huge Samurai fan!\" Cody said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Samurai chuckled \"Of course you are. Why are you here? Did you come to the studio with family?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here to see the Samurai!\" Cody said, hoping that if he stayed non-specific the Samurai would stop asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but are you here alone?\" The Samurai asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Uh, Um\" Cody stuttered. He did have any kind of answer for that. He couldn't say that he sneaked in, he'd probably get in trouble. He also couldn't say that he wasn't here alone, what if the Samurai tried to take him to the 'people' who brought him here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's stuttering was the only answer that the Samurai needed. \"So you're here alone. I can't just leave a little girl alone around the studio. I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to bring you to security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody couldn't believe it. The Steel Samurai was going to make him get in trouble. His hero was bringing him to security! Cody considered running away from him, but should he? If he ran away he might make the Samurai mad, and he didn't want to upset him. However, what would happen if he was brought to security? He wasn't himself, so would security just kick him out? Or would they try to figure out who he was right now and call this girl's parents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody decided to?</span></div></div>",

I thought I told you to wait for me near the train station.\" She said. \"It's a good thing I saw you on my way over there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody cursed his luck. Of course he would run into someone who knew this 'Pearly' girl on his way to the studio.

The remote got him into this situation, maybe it could get him out? He couldn't use shapeshift right now, if he changed right in front of this lady, she'd definitely notice and ask how it happened, Cody didn't want to share the remote with anyone. So that left the other three options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could use Aware Swap and just put himself into another body. Of course, that had the obvious risk of the person that gets put into his current body talking about how their body was suddenly swapped, but who would believe them if they did? The next option was Unaware Swap. If he got a body stronger than the one he was currently in, he could break free of this lady's grip and make a run for it. The fourth option was Possession, if he used that he could just go and get a different body without issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, all of these options would be pointless if he was seen taking out the remote, maybe he should just go along with this lady for now and wait for an ideal time to use the remote and get away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Cody decided to...</span></div></div>",

He was having trouble thinking of what the Pink Princess should do. He blamed his current writer's block on the fact that the current actor he had playing the Pink Princess didn't match his original vision. If only he could get someone who looked like the girl he saw when he first had the Pink Princess idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking of his current situation, he noticed a package on the floor. He went over to pick it up and read the label. 'To Mr. Director' it said. It was obviously for him. So he opened the package and looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the package was what looked like a remote and manual. He took out the manual and began to read it. Apparently this remote was some kind of body swapping device. It had four functions. 'Aware Swap', 'Unaware Swap', 'Shapeshift', and 'Possession' It seemed like something too unrealistic even for his shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, somehow, he felt compelled to at least try it out. What harm could come from It? But who should he try it on first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thought that came to mind was to use it to get a better actor for the Pink Princess show. With this, he could get anyone he wanted into the role. He wouldn't even need to ask them if they wanted the role or give then acting lessons. He would just need to put someone like himself or Will Powers into their body and bam, instant good performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was no reason he had to immediately use this remote for business. He could just take someone else's body and do whatever he wanted. He was constantly working on the show, he felt he deserved some time with someone else's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what did Sal use the remote for?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't use the remote at all during the show, he was far too busy making sure nothing went wrong. Once the show was over, he knew he had to make his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what would he do? He had two options at the moment. The first would be to take Maya's body himself. That way he wouldn't have to involve anyone else. Sure, this would mean he would have to act the role himself, but he was the director, no one understood his vision as well as him, he was sure he could pull off the role with little practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other option would be to have another actor take Maya's body. When it came to other actor's he had three choices. The first was Will Powers, the Steel Samurai. Will was an excellent actor and Sal was sure that he could play the role perfectly if he was put into Maya's body. The only downside would be that Sal would have to explain the remote to Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSal's other two options of who to put into Maya's body were....less good. He had two other people who he would have play the Steel Samurai and Pink Princess roles when he had no one else available. Larry Butz and Wendy Oldbag. Neither of these two were good actor's and Sal would have to spend a lot of time and effort getting them to act the role right.

He was practically a magnet for bad luck with how often bad things would happen to him; Getting his clothing stuck in doors, mixing up important police documents, the list of bad luck and mistakes just went on and on. That combined with how often he used his megaphone made him one of the most unliked and laughed at officers working here. Sometimes he wished he was more confident and likable, like his hero, Detective Dick Gumshoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Meekins was daydreaming, he noticed that their was a package at his post. Strange, why would a package be delivered here? He looked at it some more and saw that it was addressed to him. Thinking that thinking about the package wouldn't get him anywhere, he decided to open the package right now and find out what was in it. To his surprise, what was in the package was some kind of remote and a manual. After a quick read through, Meekins found out that this was some kind of 'Body Swap' Remote. While Meekins was a bit skeptical about it, he chose to believe it was real. After all, who would send him some fake remote for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was, who to try it on. The first thing to come to mind was to use it on someone else at the police department.There were plenty of different people here, both police officers and people of other occupations, he could use this remote to become any of them. Plus, If he swapped with someone here, then he could easily come back and get his own body back later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing that came to mind was to share the remote with his hero, Detective Dick Gumshoe. While Meekins was sure that if he shared it with anyone else  they would laugh it off and not believe him, but he had confidence that Gumshoe would believe him. Plus. he was sure that Gumshoe would use it more responsibly than he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeekins took his time and thought the choice over carefully, after a while he eventually came to the conclusion that he should...........</span></div></div>",

He aimed the remote at her and clicked the Shapeshift button. A little light on the remote lit up, signally that it had registered her form. Meekins then headed outside to look for a place he could use it. Thankfully, there was no one in the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put down his megaphone and gripped the remote with two hands, he then procceeded to point the remote at himself and once again clicked the Shapeshift button. He began to transform in Angel immediately. The process took less than five seconds, but it was easily the strangest five seconds of Meekins; entire life. He shrunk nearly a foot, his hair became blond and grew significantly, his general body structure became less blocky and more slim. His clothes changed too. He was no longer in his police uniform, but rather an exact copy of Angel's outfit. His handcuffs and other things he had on him had seemingly vanished, while at the same time he now had a large amount of lunch boxes with him all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for him, he had put down his megaphone before using the remote and it was still laying on the ground where he had put it. He picked it up, it seemed to be a bit heavier with Angel's body, but he was still able to carry it with general ease. As he struggled to fully comprehend the fact that he was in a completely different body, Meekins realized that he couldn't stand around in the parking lot for long. If Angel were to come outside and see him, that would cause a commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeekins headed to his car and prepared to drive home, but then he realized something. He had let his car-key in his pocket when he used the Shapeshift button. It must have vanished along with the rest of his stuff! There was no way he could drive home now, he would have choice but to walk. He prayed that when he Shapeshifted back to his own body that his keys would reappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe once again exited his car and began to make his way toward home, with Megaphone and Lunchboxes in hand. As he walked he opened one of the lunch boxes that Angel had brought with her and began to eat what was inside. At least that was one advantage of Angel's body, maybe if he was lucky there would be more lucky advantages to this whole remote thing.</span></div></div>",

One thought immediately came to mind, Tres Bien. He had been banned from the place, so maybe if he swapped with someone inside the restaurant he could enjoy himself in there, though not for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, why waste the opportunity on at a low and in debt place like Tres Bien?

He was currently flying on a plane toward the United States to deliver some art. For some reason he chose to fly via ifly airlines, despite all the troubles he had during his last flight. Trusting the airline this time was a grave mistake. His flight was scheduled to arrive at 2:00 sharp, however it didn't arrive until 2:05! Money is time and this delay could potentially cost him 300 cents! Not only that, but the on flight move was late, or real this time! He had gone to a flight attendant to complain, but they had given him the pathetic excuse that 'because the flight was 15 minutes late, he movie would start 15 minutes later'. Zinc was not one to accept excuses, especially ones that went against his schedule! Unfortunately, there was nothing that he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went to return to his seat, he saw that there was a strange package on it. \"Bah! Some flight attendant forgot put some of my precious art with the cargo!\" He took the package as another reason to be angry. He picked it up, fully ready to put it into the cargo hold himself. If this art had been damaged, he'd make ifly pay! As he stormed toward cargo, he looked at the package and realized that it wasn't a piece of art that he had brought along on the flight, but a package that was addressed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to his seat to examine the mysterious package? How was it delivered to him during the flight, he severally doubted that any flight attendants would have put it there mid-flight. He opened it and discovered a remote and manual. After reading through the manual, he was ready to toss the remote into the trash and move one. It claimed to be some sort of 'Body Switcher' although it also had 'Possesion' and 'Shape-Shifting' functions. \"Bah! someone is pulling some sort of practical hoodwink!\" He complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had planned to immediately toss the remote away, he came to the decision to test it out anyway. It was still going to be quite a while before the on flight movie was going to start, at least 10 minutes. he figured that it was better to waste his time on this remote farce than to waste it doing nothing, although he would have preferred to not be wasting any at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had chosen to use the remote, the question was, who else to use it on? His first thought was the flight attendant, he believed her name was Ms. Teneiro, or something like that. Of course, there were plenty of other people on the plane he could test it out on. He doubted that any of those other people had anything as important to do with their time than he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did he decide to test the remote on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zinc chose to have flight attendant Rhoda Teneiro be the first person he would test the remote out on. The reason he chose her was simply because she was the closest person, he didn't want to waste any of his precious time looking around the plane for other people to switch with. He doubted that switching with her would disrupt her flight attendant duties in any meaningful way. After all, she was already late when it came to serving him, there was no way she would be on time with the other passengers anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he didn't have to search very long to find Ms. Teneiro. She was walking up and down the aisle of the plan, allegedly doing her job \"Bah! A job done to slow is a job not done at all!\" Zinc complained about her to no one in particular. How well or how bad she was doing her job did not matter at the moment though. What mattered was what button on the remote he would use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAware Swap seemed to be the most basic, it would simply put him in her body and her in his. It seemed natural to test the most basic function first, however, he wondered if it was a good idea to put Rhoda into his body. The next option was Unaware Swap, which was the second most simplest option, that option would give him Rhoda's body, but everyone would still see him as himself and vice versa. It was simple, and there was no risk of Rhoda doing something while in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third option was Possession. With that he could possess Rhoda and while he was in her body, his own body would act as if nothing happened. This option would give him the advantage of being in two bodies at once. With that, he could get work done twice as fast and make double profits! Of course, before he could think of making profits off of this device, he needed to test the possession function on Rhoda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth option was ShapeShift. Rhoda herself would not be personally involved with the swap at all. Zinc's own body would simply be turned into an exact copy of Rhoda's. There wasn't much he could think to do with that function at the moment, but this was just a test after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat button does Zinc use on Rhoda</span></div></div>",

Despite studying to become a prosecutor, she really wanted to become an artist. In here, she felt like she could really be herself for once. Well, that wasn't exactly true. Despite being female, she had been raised as a boy by her parents, and forced to hide her true gender. She still felt a strong resentment whenever she looked at her chest brace. She often wished she could just get this all out in the open, but she knew her parents would disapprove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was almost finished with her sculpture, she suddenly heard a knock on the door. Robin couldn't help but wonder who it was. After no one seemed to enter, she figured she should probably go see who it was. Opening the door to the club room, Robin was surprised to discover there was no one there. \"What?\" Robin said aloud, confused by what had just happened. \"Who ding-dong-ditches in a school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to simply close the door and go back to put the finishing touches on her sculpture, but before she did so, she noticed a box lying on the floor in front of the doorway. Even strange was the fact that it seemed to have her name written on it. She looked around the hallway outside the room, but there didn't seem to be anyone around who could have left the package. How did they know she was in here, anyway? Regardless, Robin took the box and placed it on the table she was working at, before opening it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! As if!\" Robin couldn't help but scoff at the contents of the box. Inside was an odd-looking TV remote, and an instruction manual that claimed it could swap people's bodies around. It was like something out of a crazy sci-fi movie, and almost certainly some sort of prank. \"Kinda far to go for a prank, though,\" she mused, looking over the remote. It seemed to be crafted fairly well, although whatever it really did, she seriously doubted it could actually do what the manual claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Robin had to admit that she was kind of curious. What if it did work? What if she could use the remote to swap bodies and such? As it ridiculous as it sounded, it might be worth trying, at least. Now that she had decided to try the remote out, she needed to figure out who to try it out on. Her first thought was to try it on her friends, Hugh and Juniper. If there was anyone she trusted enough to use a strange remote with, it was probably them. Plus, they probably wouldn't laugh at her too hard if it did indeed turn out to be a hoax. However, the remote was also possibly dangerous, and Robin wasn't sure she wanted to use it on her friends and put them in danger like that.</span></div></div>",

He was rarely allowed outside, he wanted to take full advantage of this opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lowered himself down to street level, he looked around and saw quite a few people walking around, no one was able to see him, he was completely invisible to the whole world. He enjoyed this a lot, no one would be taking him back to his room now. He looked at the people nearby and observed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a girl with orange hair and a yellow suit practically running down the sidewalk, she seemed to be in a rush. There was a cellphone in her left hand and she seemed to be talking to someone as she ran. \"Sorry Mr. Wright, I overslept! I'll be at the courthouse in a few minutes\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother person Hickfield saw pass by was someone he recognized as Phoenix Wright's daughter Trucy Wright. She was carrying a few tools for magic tricks with her, it seemed she was preparing for a show today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHickfield also saw a pair of two girls walking by, both wearing robes that were out of place in the city. \"C'mon Pearly, we need to get back to Khurain for our waterfall training.\" the older of the two girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger of the girls didn't seem as enthusiastic \"Mystic Maya, can we first go shopping for some clothes like the city girls wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya seemed to think about it for a second \"okay, we'll by you an outfit after our training\" Maya said to Pearl, who brightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHickfield wanted to do something he wouldn't be able to do in a million years if he was visible, he wanted to get close to one of the people walking by.

For a while now the defense attorney Mia Fey had been gathering information on him and those he blackmailed in an attempt to take down both him and Blue Corp. She hadn't gotten any major leads yet, however she was getting close to finding some actual information. While he doubted she would find anything for at least a few years, leaving any loose ends may be dangerous to him in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Redd White thought about what to do about the Mia situation he heard a knock on his office door. Strange, he thought he told his secretary that he didn't want to be disturbed. He walked to his office door and opened it to only find a package. He took the package and headed back to his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd, usually the only mail he got was letters from people he blackmailed, usually those letters consisted of them begging Redd White to end his blackmailing of them. He had a furnace full of ash from those letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the package and inside he found an odd remote and a manual. Reading through he found that the remote apparently had the power to swap bodies, possess people, and shapeshift. It seemed utterly ridiculous. He wanted to put the remote back in the box and throw it away! However, a thought came to mind. What harm is there in at least testing it? If he tested it and it didn't work, he'll just throw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was the most important question, who should he test it on? A few people came to mind. The first was Mia Fey, she had been gathering information on him lately, maybe he should test it on her. The access to her files on him would also be an added bonus. However, testing it on her first may be a bit risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to come to mind was a secretary he had hired the other day, April May. She was a nearby target and if she found out about the remote, it would be easy to keep her quiet about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final person to come to mind was a blackmail victim of his, Marvin Grossberg. While the thought of becoming Grossberg was revolting, Grossberg was completely under White's control, so keeping him quiet about the whole remote thing should be fairly simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking over for a while longer, Redd white chose to test the remote on...</span></div></div>",

She had been digging too deeply into his personal affairs and was asking questions he didn't like to hear. He was going to confront her eventually; even if the device didn't work, he'd find a way to shut her up. He put the device in his suit pocket and got up from his desk, heading out into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, be a dear and cancel my appointments for the day, I have some business to take care of,\" he told his secretary casually as he straightened his tie. \"An old acquaintance just called, and she's just not the kind of person I can leave waiting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" she responded with a nod and a fake smile as she took notes, \"consider it done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew I could count on you, dearie. Toodles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late when Redd's chauffeur pulled up outside Fey's office. \"What a drab place to work,\" Redd mused as he got out of the car. \"So ugly and cramped! Really have to pity her employees.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd walked into the agency without knocking, coming into a small waiting room. The fact that the door was unlocked was enough for him to realize someone was still here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoenix?\" he heard a voice call from behind a door. \"Is that you?\" It was a woman - definitely Fey. There was some shuffling of papers, and some muffled footsteps. Redd pulled the remote from his pocket, realizing he had the benefit of surprise. If he used the device right as she opened the door, she'd have little time to react, assuming it worked. If it didn't, well, he'd just put it back in his pocket and just threaten her the normal way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the buttons, pondering which one to use, but the sound of the footsteps was getting too close to think it over for too long. The knob to the other door began to turn, and Redd quickly pressed his thumb down on the _______ button as it opened up. </span></div></div>",

In an instant he was floating above his own body in some sort of ghost form. He didn't have much time to react however, as the doorknob of Fey's office began to turn. He quickly moved his new ghost-form into the office and possessed whoever was on the other side of the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment he was standing on the opposite side of the door with his hand on the knob. Before he could do anything, he heard his own voice faintly through the other side of the door. \"What am I doing here?\" He heard it say along with the faint sounds of footsteps going down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the footsteps had stopped, Redd looked down at his new body to confirm that he was now in Mia's body. Other than the obvious differences in body proportions and body parts, he saw he was now wearing Mia's black suit and her rather short skirt. He felt her scarf practically choking his neck, As he tried to pull it looser he accidentally poked his neck with Mia's longer nails. In his other hand was the remote, it must have come with him when he possessed Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the office, White soon found a mirror. He was satisfied to see Mia's reflection in it. \"Well Miss Fey, is seems that this supertendous device works after all.\" He said in Mia's voice. Before doing anything else, he went over to Mia's filing cabinet and began to work for the files she had on him. Inside he found the very few files she had. There was nothing too incriminating, but there was a few leads. It would be best to destroy these before they actually could become useful to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the files out cabinet and began to tear up the papers. From anyone else's point of view it would seem as though Mia was destroying all of her work. White loved the irony of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had finished tearing up the files, he wondered what to do next. All he had really planned to do was test the remote and destroy whatever evidence Mia had against him. He supposed he could return to his own body now, but there may be some advantages in staying as Mia for now. After thinking over his options, he soon decided to...</span></div></div>",

And since that doohickey lets me spread my genius around, why not let Mia have some of it?\" he said. \"Besides, Fey might have more on me than she seems. I ought to do some investimagating or whatnot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, he could make plenty of problems for Mia while hijacking her body. He could certainly land her in enough trouble that he would be the last thing on her mind.<i>'Although I guess right now I'm all that's in her mind!'</i> He gave the thought a laugh, looking back down to the remote. \"Oh what a splendiferous find you turned out to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd spent a little while longer looking in the mirror at his new face. He loosened up Mia's scarf and began testing his voice. \"Aaaaaa, eeeeee, oooooo, uuuuuuu,\" he tested out vowel sounds. He posed in the mirror with Mia's arms crossed under her chest, trying to look like she did. \"I am Mia Fey, an annoying and useless attorney! I am so much better off with Mr. White making my decisions,\" he had her finish with a smile and a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling around, Redd plopped himself down in Mia's chair. This whole office was an eyesore compared to his, but it was an injustice he'd have to put up with for the moment. He kicked off her shoes and rested her feet on the desk as he pulled up her cell phone and went through the contacts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvin, Maya, Phoenix, eh,\" those were the three names she seemed to have called the most. Redd recognized the first - Grossberg. Grossberg was under his thumb; if he called him over then he could probably turn the man to Redd's point of view. \"Maybe he'd like a new body,\" Redd said as he looked down to the one he currently inhabited. \"Mia certainly wouldn't be giving me trouble if that whale was at the helm.\" He chuckled at the thought; it'd be so horrible! He didn't recognize the second name at all, so calling her would be a tossup, but he supposed that it'd be an opportunity to burn one of Mia's bridges. The last name was curious - Phoenix. From the sound of it, Mia was expecting this fellow when Redd came in. Was he maybe investigating with her? Redd was tempted to call him to find out what he knew. The risk would be that he'd probably have to act like Mia, but he was sure he could manage it. <i>'I've always been a great dramaturge after all!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, Redd could set about finding Mia's home. It'd certainly be a boring night if he went back to whatever peasant abode she stayed in, but there was always the possibility she had more information stashed away there. If not, well, he could likely find some way to entertain himself with her body. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a while since Redd had to drive himself anywhere, so taking Mia's car to her home was a bit of an odyssey, especially since it was basically night. Redd figured that it wasn't his car <i>or</i> body though, so he drove as recklessly as he felt like. Mia's car got a bump or two, but it was overall okay and she didn't even get pulled over. That was a success in Redd's mind! <i>'Mia owes me for driving her home ever so graciously.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia's living space was tidy and simple. All very simple and drab colors - beige, whites, some blacks and greys. It was so very boring to Redd. There were some scrolls on the walls that Redd couldn't read or identify - looked to be from some far-off country. \"Well if <i>I</i> can't read them, I can't say they're very important,\" Redd mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit further in, he found Mia's bedroom, which seemed to double as a home office. It was large but similarly sparse; there was a bed, some drawers for clothes, a filing cabinet, and a computer. A large space was set aside amidst all these things, but Redd couldn't imagine what she used it for. He flicked on a light and threw off Mia's jacket and scarf, leaving the remote on the bed with them. Looking in the mirror, her outfit was rather... revealing. Aside from her ample chest being on display, the shirt underneath the jacket hardly even had sleeves. \"She almost looks like she'd be one of my secretaries,\" Redd spoke to himself as he turned around, looking over and patting down Mia's body in the mirror. \"Maybe I'll consider hiring her after ruining her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd pulled up the computer, hoping to find some new information, but it was locked with a password. \"Ugh,\" he grumbled as he pushed some of Mia's hair out of his face. \"Fine, I can guess my way through this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Password</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>MiaFey</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Attorney</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ReddWhite</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BlueCorp</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Damn! Those were all the passwords I would have used if I were her.'</i> He looked around the desk for a place she might have written the information down, but it seemed she had really just committed it to memory. He crossed her arms in frustration, how was he going to search through her things now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd turned to the filing cabinet instead, using a small key on the desk to open it up. \"Something I should be having <i>other</i> people do,\" he mumbled as he began to pull out folders and look through papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could she know all of these names?!\" Redd exclaimed in shock as the file scattered over Mia's desk. The details were scant; it was just a list of names. All names of people Redd had blackmailed, and mostly names of people who were dead. It shouldn't have been possible for her to get this information - Redd had assumed they had all taken it to their graves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd forced himself to a take a deep breath. \"It's okay, you have control of the situation now,\" he told himself slowly. \"I have the remote, I have the papers, I have her body. She can't touch me.\" In short order, Redd tore all the papers that seemed even tangentially related to him to pieces. The garbage wasn't enough - he threw the scraps into her sink and had them all go down the drain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still worrying though. If she got that information once, she could certainly get it again, and other could follow her. He needed to learn who Mia's informant was. Redd would need to figure out how to solve this in the long term. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could keep monitoring her...\" Redd considered. \"Bugs might not be enough though. I'd need to keep close watch - either in her body or the body of someone she trusts. Silencing her would be easy, but I need to know who else she's been in touch with...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option was the more direct one - threaten her. Redd had the remote now, and he had Mia's body. He could make her do <i>anything</i>, and if he let her know it then she'd certainly crack. It <i>would</i> mean playing his hand with the device though. If Redd had learned anything, it was that Mia was a lot craftier than he thought, and she might find a way to subvert him even with the device. It'd certainly take a lot less time though.</span></div></div>",

It was clear that he would have to keep an eye on her for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanting a few bugs in Mia's house would be a good start, but he could go a step beyond. Having one of the people closest to her be his own personal camera, that was his plan. Mia would never suspect one of her closest friends of being the worst possible person to confide information with. All that he would have to do is call over one of her contacts and possess them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took out her phone again and looked at the three most called numbers again.

If he wanted to find out who Mia's informant was, the best thing to do would be to watch her day unfold from her perspective and see what happens. Furthermore, Mia was too dangerous to leave unobserved. If <i>neither </i>of those two people were her informant, then it'd be too much of a risk to let her have free reign. She could just recompile her data and go public. If either of these contacts on her phone <i>were </i>the informants though, then surely they'd contact Mia and reveal themselves in time. Until that point, he had destroyed her information and had control of her body, so he could at least forestall her going public with what she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had little else to do until tomorrow, however, so he decided he would have to go to sleep for now and head into her office tomorrow. \"Ugh, can't imagine how anyone lives like this,\" he complained as he threw off Mia's shirt and skirt. It didn't seem like she had anything <i>nice</i> in the way of sleeping clothes. He begrudgingly settled for some clothes he found in the bottom drawer, just a white shirt and what looked like jogging shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Atleast her bed's almost acceptable</i>,' he thought to himself as he laid down, trying to get some sleep before the long day tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Redd stepped out of the shower with a towel around Mia's torso. \"Hmph, this thorn in my side should be thankful I'm going about her miserable life for her even for a day,\" he shouted as he shook out her hair. Redd was never a person who cared about privacy, so he had little trepidation about preparing her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went out into her bedroom once again, looking through her wardrobe with disdain. \"All black and white! Ugh, so boring.\" He continued to push through until he found a light blue blouse in the back of her closet that appealed to him, as well as a white skirt in the bottom of one of her drawers. \"Tch, so cheap, but the only color she has in the whole house!\" The skirt was rather short, but that seemed common for her. The blouse was a bit small as well, but that scarcely bothered Redd, who chose to just leave it unbuttoned around the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Redd was familiar with makeup. Everyone had to look their best after all, even if his face was perfect anyways. Those who were familar with Mia would probably think his choices overboard however; he found the brightest red he could for the lipstick, and left the eyeliner and blush thick. By the time Redd was done, Mia scarcely looked like a lawyer, but Redd didn't really intend on doing <i>her </i>job all that much today anyways. \"Well, fun time's over, time for work,\" he decided. He left the apartment and got into Mia's car, heading out for her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, boring,\" Redd mumbled to himself as he spun around lazily in Mia's chair, waiting for something to happen. He had gone through her files a bit more to kill time, but it seemed like she didn't have anything else interesting among them. He couldn't access her computer as well, since he didn't know her password. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis boredom was interrupted, however, by the sound of a door opening. Excited, Redd bolted to Mia's feet. \"Who's there?\" he called in her voice, \"can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, its just me,\" a voice replied from the lobby.

He was positive that he was currently in her body, how was she standing right in front of him. Upon closer exception, he noticed that she was wearing some kind of robes and her hair was in a different style. The robes seemed familiar to him, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get straight to the point.\" Mia said sternly \"Who are you and why are you in my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about. I am Ms. Mia Fey, this is MY office.\" Redd attempted to lie his way out of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was not amused. \"Anyone can take one look at your face and tell that you're not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd should have expected that lie not to work, but it was worth a try anyway. He slowly back away toward Mia's desk as he spoke \"How are you here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took my body, yet you didn't know about my family's spiritual powers? How did you take my body?\" Mia said confused, she had assumed that her body was somehow possessed by a spirit without her purposely channeling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd snapped his finger, now he remembered. Mia' family was full of spirit mediums, he even exposed that the police had gone to Mia's mother with an unsolved case several years ago. He never believed that the whole spirit channeling thing was real, which explained why he had forgotten it after so many years. It also explained how Mia was here right now, when he possessed her, her spirit must have been expelled from her body. She must have had someone in her village channel her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to Redd's silence Mia took a step forward threateningly. Redd needed to think of a way out of this situation fast, while he didn't feel particularly threatened by Mia, he didn't want to risk her finding out who he was. If she found out who he was, she might start looking for how he was able to steal her body in the first place and the last thing he needed was her finding out about the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what he saw, Redd had two ways out of this. The first was the simplest, just make a run for it. If he ran forward right now, he was sure he could catch Mia off guard and push her out of his way and make it toward the exit. There was one major problem with this though, the remote. He had left the remote on Mia's desk and while he had been subtly backing up toward it, he was still quite a distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could make a run for the remote, but he was sure if he did that Mia would quickly run toward him, and if she did that then their was no way he would also be able to run out of there. So he would have to use the remote to escape. If he used the possession function on himself, then theoretically Mia's spirit would return to her body, due to him leaving it. Hopefully that will either knock her out or disorient her. Then he could either slowly and safely float away from the office and possess a nearby body for now or possess whoever had channeled Mia and hopefully fool her into thinking that he was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mia took another step forward, Redd realized he didn't have much time to think and quickly made his decision</span></div></div>",

He was slowly backing up to the remote, but then immediately shifted his stance and charged forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-stop!\" Mia shouted as Redd barreled ahead at full speed. He had an easy time pushing her over, having caught her by surprise. Mia tumbled to the ground with a grunt and an angry shout. \"Get back here!\" she yelled as she struggled to get back to her feet. By the time she was up, though, Redd had slammed the office door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia twisted the knob and violently pulled the handle. The door opened, and Mia caught a brief glance of her own body shutting the front door of the office behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd wasted little time getting into Mia's car and turning the keys in the ignition, pulling away from the office. Thankfully, there was no other car in sight. This meant that whatever body Mia herself had taken didn't have a vehicle of its own. He could see the other Mia as she opened the office door and briefly gave chase, but she gave up after the car got a block away or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I managed to get out of that,\" Redd muttered, \"but apparently just controlling Mia's body isn't enough to shut her up. Spirit channeling... I'd barely believe it if I wasn't in the damn woman's body right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd reasoned he would have to get some more leverage on Fey. Something that would make her shut up and back off; he couldn't sit around if she was immune to possession. It wouldn't be hard to get some blackmail material on Mia if he <i>was</i> Mia, right? He'd need something fast; he had to get back to the office if he wanted the remote back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia, meanwhile, was cursing under her breath, panting after having to chase her own car. She was essentially stranded, with some flamboyant stranger parading around with her identity. Sure, she had a body, but there weren't a lot of ways to explain why there were two of her running around. She needed to assess what damage her body thief had done. Maybe looking around the office would provide some clues as to who had stolen her body? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as MIa wanted to chase down whoever had taken her body, she resigned to the fact that she couldn't catch up to them on foot. She wished she had some idea of where the person in her body was going, but considering how they just randomly drove off after being in her office all day, she imagined that whoever was in her body didn't have a clear destination in mind. She decided to go back up to her office, hopefully the body thief left behind some clues of their identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking back up to her office, Mia noticed a few things. The first of which being that there were shoe marks on her desk! Not only that, they were from her shoes, it seems that whoever was in her body was a slob and rested their feet on her desk. More importantly though, there were quite a few files missing from her cabinet. The missing files weren't completely random either, there was one common thing linking all the missing files, Redd White.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, whoever was in my body wanted to get rid of my files on White, but why?\" Mia thought aloud. Whoever was in her body wanted these files gone, but what ghost would want to take her body and protect White? White didn't exactly have many friends, anyone who worked with him was most likely doing it out of blackmail and you can't blackmail a ghost. That's when Mia turned her thinking around. What if no one was helping White? What if he did this on his own? That seemed to be the only plausable explanation. She gave that possibility some thought, but no matter what angle she looked at it, that was impossible. She was positive that Redd White was alive. There was no way a ghost of him could forcefully take her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia sat at her desk and gave it some thought. How could he have done this? Then she noticed that on her desk was a remote. She had a small T.V. in her office, but this remote was clearly not for that. The remote had five visible button. They were labled 'Aware', 'Unaware', 'Possession', 'Shapeshift', and a small 'undo' button right below the Shapeshift button. She had no idea what the 'Aware' and 'Unaware' buttons did, but she had a hunch on what the  'Possession' and 'Shapeshift' buttons did. If White had this remote, then it was entirely possible that White was the one who took her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is of course, if this remote actually worked. She had no way of knowing that this remote could actually do what it was labeled as. It was entirely possible that this remote was just planted here by the person in her body to confuse her. It may be best to test it out. She looked at a clock in her office and saw the time, Phoenix would be coming in for work in about twenty minutes. Maybe she could try it out on him? Phoenix was her employee, she doubted that he would mind being her test subject....much<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Mia wasn't sure if she should let herself get side-tracked by the remote. Her body was still on the loose doing god knows what. She needed to at the very least find out where her body was and put a stop to it. She looked through what was supposed to be her schedule, she had planned to defend someone in court today, but there was no way that was happening now.....unless. While she doubted that whoever was in her body was going to be taking her law career seriously. If it was White in her body then it was entirely possible that he could attempt to ruin her career, thus securing his own. Even if he didn't know that she had a trial today her phone, which was currently in his possession, had reminders and alarms set in case she was running late, it was entirely possible that he could find out about it. Of course, if he wasn't there then and she showed up at the trial, she would be stuck in the courtroom defending while White was off doing something in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Mia decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Thankfully for her, she had a perfect test subject on his way right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, Mia heard knocking on the door. \"Chief, it's me.\" She heard Phoenix's voice from the other side of the door. \"Come one in Phoenix.\" Mia yelled out. When Phoenix entered the room, he looked at Mia with a confused expression. It didn't take much thought to tell why. After all, Mia was wearing the channeling robes of the person who had channeled her and her hair also looked completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief, you look different today.\" Phoenix said, commenting on it, but trying not to come off as rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Phoenix, I just have some different clothes on.\" Mia said with a slight grin as she pointed the remote at Phoenix \"You on the other hand, don't even look like yourself today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was understandably confused \"Huh, what do-\" Phoenix was interrupted as his body suddenly began to change. He shrunk slightly, his hair began to grow and change to the exact style that Mia's hair was currently in, his chest grew, and while all of the bodily changes were going on his clothes changed from his suit to and exact copy of the robes that Mia was currently wearing. \"-You mean.\" Phoenix finished his sentence, then immediately gasped at the sound of his own voice. He looked down at himself and saw all of the changes that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia couldn't help but giggle a bit as she saw Phoenix freak out about all of the changes. \"Don't worry Phoenix, I'll turn you right back. I can't have three of me running around after all.\" Mia said and once again pointed the remote at him. This time she clicked the Undo button that was below the Shapeshift button. As fast as all of the changes had happened, Phoenix's body had returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill taken aback by everything that had just happened. Phoenix asked the obvious questions. \"Chief, how? why? what? where? when?\" He stuttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Phoenix. Sit down on the couch, this is going to be a long story.\" Mia directed Phoenix toward the office couch. She then proceeded to explain the remote to him. Well, she explained what she knew at least. She only knew for a fact what the Shapeshift button did and a vague idea of what the Possession button did. She still had no idea what the 'Aware' and 'Unaware' buttons did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so you got this remote and it can change people's bodies, but there's still one thing I don't get. When you turned me into you, you said 'I can't have three of me running around. There's you, the original and me, the second one, but who's the third?\" Phoenix asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia smiled a bit, she was glad Phoenix was able to notice a detail like that while he was freaking out. He wasn't the smartest person she knew, but he was clearly learning how important it was to keep track of small details like that. \"Well, that's another long story.\" Mia began. She then proceeded to tell Phoenix about how her own body was taken and about who she had suspected had taken it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if your body was taken, how are you here right now?\" Phoenix asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's another long story, but it's not important right now. The point is there is someone running around with my body.\" Mia dismissed the question. She had already explained many seemingly impossible things to Phoenix today. She didn't want to go through the trouble of explaining the Kurain channeling technique to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are we going to get the person out of your body?\" Phoenix asked, anxious to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was unsure how to answer. \"I honestly have no idea. The only thing that I do know is that as long as I have this remote, he has no control over whether or not he can leave my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he's stuck as you until we do something?\" Phoenix inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, he won't be able to take anyone else's body.\" Mia answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what if we make him want to go back to his own body?\" Phoenix thought aloud. \"You said this guy ran his own company, right? So what if we used the remote to infiltrate his company and start ruining things? If we cause enough havoc, he may want to go back to being himself just so he can go and fix things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia gave it some thought, it could work. Redd White may have taken her body, but he still had his company to worry about. Maybe she could ruin Blue Corp. from the inside while she was at it. Does Mia go along with Phoenix's idea?</span></div></div>",

He clutched the remote in his hand but was soon knocked over by a force behind him. \"What are you trying to do?!\" the real Mia shouted as she tried to pry the item from her original body's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that concerns you!\" Redd shouted back through clenched teeth as he struggled to reach for the button on the remote, clicking wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for him, Mia couldn't stop him. He managed to aim the remote at himself for just a moment, and clicked \"possession\", freeing himself from Mia's body and giving him an aerial view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow him, the body he had just left seemed to pass out for a moment, before struggling to its feet. \"They even dressed me? Uggh,\" she shivered as she looked down at the outfit she was wearing. The thick make up on her face added to the unsettling effect; whoever had been using her body did a good job at making it feel foreign even to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd noticed another figure as well, where the 'other' Mia used to be on the floor.

If he had to guess, this was the body that Mia herself had hijacked to confront him. Lying on the floor, seemingly still unconscious was a robed teenage girl. This girl's hair was styled in the same way that the 'other' Mia had hers. It was clear that this girl was the one that had channeled Mia while Redd possessed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia wasted no time in searching through her office, seeing what, if any, damage the person who had taken her body had did. She went through her files and noticed that everything she had on Redd White was gone. She slammed the drawer of her file cabinet in anger. It was clear that whoever was in her body was someway involved with Redd White. Although she doubted it was Redd White himself, due to her having no idea how he would steal a body, she knew they were in someway involved with him and didn't want her looking into him. Although the physical files were lost, Mia didn't lose hopes. She still had two backups. She had copyed everything to her computer plus she had memorized most of them. Even if someone were to destroy them, she could easily replace the files.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd figured that there was no point in just floating around in ghost form. He needed to possess a body now. While Redd figured that he could just fly outside the room and possess some random body on the street, it may not be the best idea to possess random strangers. It might be best to possess someone in the room, more specifically, the girl who had channeled Mia. The girl's body also had the benefit of being associated with Mia. He could easily keep an eye on her from inside that girl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anymore thought, Redd flew his ghost-like form into the girl's body and possessed her. As he slowly got up fro the floor, he once again felt the strange sensations of entering a different body. Although his day as Mia had helped him get used to being a woman, this girl's body felt completely different. He felt the topknot of her hair and the loose robes that she had worn here. While Redd was a bit curious about his new body, he knew that he couldn't be suspicious for the moment. He couldn't risk Mia finding out he had just possessed this girl. Thankfully for Redd, the remote had once again traveled with him during possession. He subtly put it into the sleeve of this girl's robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was so busy searching through her office that she hadn't noticed that 'Maya' had woken up. Right now she was searching sitting on her desk looking to see if whoever had possessed her had been able to get into her computer. Redd couldn't hide a sinister grin as he looked over MIa's shoulder and saw her computer password, 'Diego'. Redd couldn't imagine why that was her password, but that didn't matter much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd briefly pondered what to do next, he could stay around the office, but he didn't want to risk Mia finding out that he possessed this girl's body. His other option was to go to Mia's hometown. 'Kurain', he vaguely remembered the name. If he went to this village, he may be able to find out some more about this spirit channeling thing. It already caused him some trouble today,so it may be best to find a way to prevent another situation like today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few seconds of thought, Redd decided on....</span></div></div>",

It'd be simple - you just need to take their body, plant a few bugs and maybe shred a file or two. Simple, right? Just a trial run; if the device works out nicely enough, then future attempts to secure 'information' should be trivial. Bluecorp will be untouchable! There might be a bonus in it for you too. Now what do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's heart was beginning to pound; she wasn't sure she was allowed to say no. \"Uh, who did you have in mind?\" </span></div></div>",

What do you think you're doing!\" he shouted, a look of rage forming on April's face. \"Give me that remote this instant May!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril seemed to smile, \"Why I don't know what you're talking about <i>April</i>, but you really should get back to work right away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd began to approach, but was slowed again by April's outfit. <i>'How does she walk with these heels - and this skirt!?'</i> It felt like any wrong movement would cause the damn thing to ride up April's hips instantly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Security, Ms. May seems to be going hysterical, please escort her out of the building,\" April suddenly said into the desk, her finger pressing the call button. Redd couldn't believe what he was hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, I am your boss, give me that back this instant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think the company is called 'Junecorp', '<i>April</i>',\" Redd's body replied smugly, looking an awful lot like the real Redd White. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd punched and kicked at the guards all the way down, to little avail. His new body was weak, and he had little experience using it. The guards pushed him out onto the sidewalk with little effort. \"I swear I'll have the lot of you fired!\" Redd shouted as the door slammed shut, one of the guards laughing as they walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd couldn't believe how wrong that went! He had assumed that April would do whatever he would say, being his employee. It seemed she was treacherous as they come though - she just stole everything from him! As though he didn't give her a job and a paycheck just a week or so beforehand. \"That ingrate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd stumbled down the sidewalk, not sure where to go, but not feeling safe out on the streets like this. \"I just need the device - if I can recover that, it'll all be fine,\" he told himself. Maybe he could somehow get back into the building? He could surely devise some sort of plan - he knew all the codes and where all the security guards would be. April would likely be expecting something like that though - maybe he should just lie low at the moment? He could take his time to plan out some sort of counterattack to retrieve the device, and then he'd regain control of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd did have one thing that April didn't - information. It was his trade. Redd knew a lot of secrets - if he bided his time, he could easily blackmail people from April's body, and maybe get some allies. Grossberg was an easy candidate, but he had a number of other victims as well. He knew a thing or two about the Chief Prosecutor that was sure to catch her ear. He also knew his <i>own</i> secrets as well. It was risky, but he knew there was one attorney in particular who'd certainly be willing to help anyone who could give information on Redd White. He could tantalize her with some potential information, and stab her in the back the second he got the remote again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also possible she'd just get tired of his body. Maybe she'd take hers back. There was no guarantee he'd get the device back, but his body would be worth it, right? It was likely hopeful thinking, but Redd needed hope if nothing else panned out.</span></div></div>",

Mia was skeptical about it at first, but her skepticism slowly went away as 'April' began to give Mia information about illegal activities committed by Blue. Corp. of course, every one of the \"Crimes\" that Redd named in his act weren't real, but Redd knew enough about his own illegal activities to make his lie sound convincing. Soon enough, Mia was willing to hear him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to can take down Redd and all of Blue Corp.\" Redd began. \"Redd has something hidden in his office, if you can grab that, you can use it as evidence of his illegal activites!\" Redd woved his tale about some bit of proof hidden in his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia gave a skeptical glance \"You're telling me that Redd keeps something that important around? I've been looking into Blue. Corp. they have done a wide variety of crimes over the years, I highly doubt that there is evidence of all of them in his office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me Ms. Fey, the thing he has in his office can change lives in a instant.\" Redd told a half-lie. He just needed Mia to believe him and help him sneak into Blue. Corp. Once he got the remote back, he would rid himself of both Mia and April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had doubts, but her investigation of Blue. Corp. hadn't turned up anything recently and she was beginning to get a bit desperate. She was ready to jump at any tip she was given. \"Okay, so the only thing we have to do is sneak into the office of the owner of a multi-million dollar corporation. So, how do you expect us to do that?\" Mia joked as she asked her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd was expecting result like this. \"I've worked there for years, I know the security like the back of my hand, we can sneak in no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had doubts about it, but nodded in agreement, a smile on her face.

If he were to catch me helping you sabotage him, then he'd certainly go public with what he knows.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd scowled.

My life would be ruined if I was caught.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite sighed in frustration.

Only a real scummy lawyer would do such a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossberg's eyes widened in shock as 'April's' words set in. \"L-let me get my coat,\" he whimpered as he slowly got up from his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call him to Gourd Lake... are you sure?\" Marvin asked nervously as he and Redd drove away from the office. It was Grossberg's car, but Redd had 'persuaded' him to hand it over for the greater good, and he was thus sitting at the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positively,\" Redd replied, \"just tell him you have all the evidence on him you need, and that he has to meet you down at the lake with the money. Oh! Tell him you have an accomplice as well. That way he can't kill you off the bat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Grossberg exclaimed, \"he would d-d-do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd shrugged, \"I dunno. Hasn't been himself recently. Anyways, we're at the park, so get out!\" Redd proceeded to kick Marvin out of his own car, leaving him at the lake as he drove away. \"I'll get you later!\" he called out, April's voice fading as the car sped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom across the street, Redd staked the Bluecorp building from the driver's seat of Grossberg's car. He knew Mia wouldn't recognize it, but just to make himself harder to recognize, he also threw on an over-sized raincoat from Grossberg's office. It was a bit smelly, but that was something April's body would have to deal with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, He saw what he was looking for - April entering the lobby in his body. She seemed stressed, yelling at one of his guards and gesturing towards one of the other security officers to follow her. The two of them exited the building, leaving only the other guard behind to manage the lobby, seeing as how the secretary was gone. \"Just one then...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it seemed April and the other guard were gone, Redd got out of the car and waited by the road, trying to act casual. He was sure the guard would have to leave for the bathroom eventually, and that would be the window he needed. He was sure April would hide the remote away in the office, there was a floorsafe tucked away under the desk. White knew the code; all he needed was to get into the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well... it's where I'd put it atleast.'</i> He supposed he would have to hope that April would think along the same lines as him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the guard broke from his station, going off to another room. Redd made his move, quickly stepping to the front door. He only opened it a crack, to prevent the welcome jingle from playing and alerting the guard. Thankfully, April's small frame let him barely slip through. Hurriedly, he pressed the button on the elevator, waiting for the car to come down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Come on, come on...' </i> the guard would know to keep an eye for him - it was one of the same men from earlier. They'd be the second people fired once he got his body back, right after he was finished with April. He'd have to fantasize about his punishments for her later though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid the car come down in time? </span></div></div>",

He let out a sigh of relief once it did come down. He ran into the elevator and hit the button to bring him to the top floor, where his office was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had gotten to his office, he began to turn the place upside down searching for the thing. His entire plan relied on May leaving it here for safe keeping. If she had brought it with her, that may cause some complications. Especially if she used it on Grossberg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, his fears were unfounded. He found the remote behind one of the trophies on his shelf. It was actually a impressive hiding spot, no employee would dare snoop around his trophies and anyone who broke in, Redd included, would look it over since there isn't much space between the trophy on the shelf and the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd grabbed the remote and began to make his way out of Blue Corp. To his surprise, the guard from earlier wasn't at his station. Did he abandon his post? 'Another reason to fire him later' Redd thought as he made his way to Grossberg's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to drive back to where he had dropped Grossberg off earlier. Now that he had the remote he could return to his body and think of a suitable punishment for Ms. May. He was feeling a bit paranoid now though, his whole breaking in and stealing the remote plan had gone smoothly, almost too smoothly. There were barely any guards on duty and he did find the remote rather easily. Did April purposely have the security be low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Redd got closer to his destination, he began to notice that a car seemed to be following him. He got even more paranoid. Was the car following him? Even if it was, there wasn't much he could actually do about it. He'd just have to be ready when he got to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had arrived, Redd got out of Grossberg's car and began to walk toward the lake. He kept the car from earlier in the corner of his vision as he walked. He kept the remote clenched in his hand. If Ms. May did somehow outsmart him, he still had the remote. He could use it to fix the situation if things went wrong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere Grossberg and April in Redd's body at the lake?</span></div></div>",

He also shouted to Marvin while he was at it, \"I appreciate your help Grodyberg, but this was technically a betrayal of my trust so you'll need to be punished as well.\"  He had two options before him as he saw it. He couldn't use body-swap to fix this; it got him into this mess. He'd get his body back, but April would have the remote. He could IMITATE a body swap though through shapeshifting; he'd still technically have April's body but it'd functionally be the same as his own. He could then turn April back to normal and think up a punishment for her. The other method was possession; with it, he could just leave April's body and take back his own with April still in it.

She seemed a little bit disappointed to be back in her own body after being wealthy and powerful for the day. Atleast he didn't turn her into a frog or something? Marvin seemed to be completely in shock, stunned by the whole affair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd, meanwhile, finished the job by using shapeshift on himself, returning to his old form. \"Ahhhh, glad to be back in my perfect, glorious body,\" he said as he straightened his tie, giving a forced smile back to April and Marvin. \"Glad you didn't damage it any dear. Things would be getting much worse for you if you did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh, you aren't going to do anything else Mr. White, a-are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm afraid I must Ms. May,\" Redd replied, his voice still maliciously upbeat. \"If I don't punish you, how do I know you won't do it again? Not to mention, Grossbug clearly isn't as loyal as he should be. I think I'll be needing something to leverage him more as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what on earth is going on here?!\" Grossberg shouted, eyes wide like a deer in headlights. \"This is mmmmagic!? This can't be really happening!\" He seemed like he was ready to run away, but was kept where we was by a mixture of shock, confusion, and curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm afraid its all very real, as you're about to find out,\" Redd said grimly as he raised the remote, clicking 'aware swap' once on April and once on Marvin. There was silence in the air for a moment, as the two began to realize what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD, THIS IS WORSE. JUST TURN ME INTO A FROG INSTEAD, PLEASE!\" April pleaded from Grossberg's hefty form. Grossberg, for his part, was in total silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, no. Be good and MAYBE I'll give you another body, but for now you stay there as your punishment, and Grossberg stays as you. I really ought to keep a close eye on him AND I need a new secretary, so two birds with one stone, right? I expect to see you bright and early tomorrow, 'Ms. May'. As for you 'Grossberg', you're dismissed. Don't bother coming to see me, I'll call you if I need something, how does that sound?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverly satisfied with himself, Redd left the two behind to handle what had just happened to them, heading back to his office with the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do we follow? </span></div></div>",

She was in White's body, she was temporarily the president of Blue Corp and had all the power that went with that position, and it was all taken away because she had made the stupid mistake of leaving the remote back at White's office for 'Safe keeping'. Of course, she didn't only blame herself. She also blamed the man whose body she was currently being forced to inhabit. If he hadn't called her out here, then none of this would have happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossberg was panicking in a similar way, although he wasn't panicking over his own actions. He couldn't believe what had just happened. he had been transported into the body of a young woman and the one responsible for it was Redd White. He couldn't believe it, if he wasn't dreaming right now then that meant that Redd White not only had a large network of blackmail on people, but he now had control of people's bodies!  He was invincible, if he couldn't get blackmail on someone, all he would have to do is take their body and create some blackmail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" April shouted from Grossberg's body and walked over to him \"Because of you, my one chance to be in charge was ruined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossberg was frightened. He felt very vulnerable in April's body and although his own body wasn't the most athletic, he imagined that if April was mad enough she could easily badly hurt him in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...You're going to help me get revenge on White.\" April said as she finished her walk over to Grossberg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossberg had a bad feeling about this \"How?! You saw what happened to that guard! If we tried anything, he could turn us into bugs or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything would be better than being in your body.\" April began \"Not that I plan on being turned into a bug. White's just as human as anyone else. The remote is what let's him swap bodies. If we can steal back that remote, then <i>he</i> will be the bug under <i>my</i> foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how are you planning on doing that?!\" Grossberg asked, he had a feeling on what her answer would be and he didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, White loves having his secretaries around, I know that better than anyone else. All you have to do is wait for him to put his guard down and snatch it.\" April explained her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you doing while I'm risking my life?!\" Grossberg practically shouted, the plan sounded even worse as she said it aloud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I can't do anything from your body! I wouldn't be allowed anywhere near Blue. Corp., I have no choice to rely on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Grossberg wanted to reject April's plan, he knew he didn't have much choice. He was currently stuck in her body and he certainly didn't want to be stuck like this. Not to mention, he didn't want to be working as Redd White's secretary for who knows how long. \"Alright, but the second something doesn't go according to plan, I'm backing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't mess up.\" April gave Grossberg a warning before she began to walk off in the direction of her home, she may have been stuck in Grossberg's body, but she would die before she would sleep at his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossberg similarly began to walk toward his home. Every step he took in April's body lead to a new, uncomfortable experiance.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't feel anything - his own body was standing below him - but he could somehow still see and hear. April May was holding still, looking confused, while his own body was standing without him, seemingly lost in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, why did I call you in here again Ms. May?\" Redd's body asked a nervous April May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you said you needed to test something sir?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd's body snapped his fingers, as though in realization, \"ah! Yes! The intercom, I wanted to make sure it was connected to your desk properly. That's all, you can go now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril knew better than to question White, and she gave a nod as she turned and walked out of his office and back into the lobby. She took a seat at her desk, deciding to brush off her boss's weird behavior and get back to work. However, as she reached out for a pen, her hand froze and her eyes seemed to stare off into space, as though in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she seemed to recover, her eyes going wide. She held her hand close to her face in shock, examining her sharp, colored nails with great interest. She pulled herself up from the chair, but nearly fell over due to her heels, seeming unused to balancing on them. \"...can't believe it,\" she muttered as she pulled herself up with her desk. She took, short, wobbly steps as she moved from the desk and into the restroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! It worked!\" Redd laughed with April's voice as he examined her face in the mirror. He gave himself a smile and a wink, heart pounding with excitement. \"You're the boss Mr. White, anything you say goes!\" he had her say. It was really true now though, who could really tell him 'no' when he had this kind of power at his disposal? He put April's hands onto her waist, covered by a short, white skirt, and rubbed them down her legs, finding the sensation of having no leg hair strange in addition to having most of his legs exposed. The skirt didn't really leave much to the imagination, and it was cut do far up April's hips any misstep threatened to show off even more skin than intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as he heard footsteps outside the restroom that Redd realized it might be a bad place to explore April's body. He gave his new pretty face another glance in the mirror before slowly stepping out of the bathroom and back to April's desk. He was beginning to get some sense of balance back, but just barely. Even if he got used to the heels, April's center of balance was entirely different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, when Redd returned the remote was still there. It barely seemed to cross his mind that he had left it behind as he picked it back up, looking over its settings. Redd wasn't entirely sure that he wanted to leave April's body behind yet. The allure of literally controlling someone was rather intoxicating to him! He had always called the shots; his employees followed his orders and the people he blackmailed did as he said, but this was a step above and beyond. Secretary work was beneath him, however. He wasn't going to waste time scheduling his own meetings or taking his own calls, that was April's job and he wasn't going to do it for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well maybe I can get 'Mr. White' to seeing my way,\" he muttered, arms crossed under April's chest. \"I am him after all. If he says April doesn't need to work for a day, then April doesn't need to work for a day.\"</span></div></div>",

That incident at the clinic had ruined her life, she would forever be known as the woman who had killed 11 patients. That wasn't the end of her suffering however, the following week she had gotten into her car accident and lost both her sister and her face. For the past year, she had been living as her sister, Mini Miney, she hated it. She hated everything that had happened a year ago, and most of all, she hated the man who she blamed for all of it, Turner Grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIni was going through her daily routine when she suddenly saw a package, where did it come from? She walked over to it and opened it out of curiosity. Inside was what appeared to be a remote and manual. The manual explained that the remote had four functions. 'Aware Swap', 'Unaware Swap', 'Possession', and 'Shapeshift'. The manual described what each of those functions were for. It claimed that the remote was able to swap around bodies and other similar functions, it seemed like complete nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIni was about to throw the remote away, but something about it made her want to believe it. Maybe it was the fact that she had been living as her sister and studying the occult for the last year, but the remote didn't seem like the most ridiculous thing in the world. The question now was, what to do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thought to come to mind was to use it on Turner Grey. He had ruined her life a year ago, her stealing his would be a fitting punishment. He would stuck in what would be stuck in, as far as he knew, the body of the sister of the girl he drugged and made crash and she would in his body and owner of the clinic she once worked at. This was her chance to turn around her life in a positive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut is that really what she wanted to do with it? She could use this remote to completely abandon all aspects of her old life, completely forget everything about herself and become someone completely new. Anything would be better than how she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Ini decide to do with the remote?</span></div></div>",

He knew the circus was beginning to do well for itself thanks to its new star, \"Maximilian Galactica\", but it didn't matter a whole lot to him if he couldn't participate. Ever since the incident with the lion, he hadn't been able to walk at all, let alone be an acrobat. The fact that his brother was comatose only worsened his depression. The thoughts of all the other entertainers still going on as though nothing had happened made him almost as angry as it did sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat in his room, emotions festering whilst the circus lights flickered in the distance, he heard a sudden rustling from the window. \"Money, is that you?\" he asked. Sure enough, the circus monkey climbed through the open pane, carrying a small box in its hands. \"What'd you take this time?\" he asked gently, happy to atleast get some company even if it was a kleptomaniac chimpanzee. The monkey put the box down on his lap and gestured to it, as though telling him to open it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, I'll look at it,\" he said reassuringly. Opening the box up, he laid out the device and began reading over the instructions. \"Hah! What a lovely thought, body swapping. Would be nice to have my legs back... way back when I could basically fly. Kind of a mean joke if it was meant for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing able to walk would be nice, but it wouldn't solve Acro's problem. He was angry that the whole event was swept under the rug. He knew no one meant for him or his brother to get hurt, but it didn't stop him from just getting more and more upset every time the ringleader's daughter spoke of his brother in such light terms. \"He's a star now,\" she would say, as though she didn't even realize it was her fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this thing worked, he had to wonder where the limitations could be. He'd definitely be able to feel like part of the circus again if he swapped with one of the other entertainers. Heck, he'd able to move around on his own if he so much as shape shifted, right? A part of him quietly wondered what would happen if he used it on someone who was comatose. All the possibilities, for fulfillment, revenge, and even some sort of salvation gave him hope for a second, even if he thought the device was probably fake. \"Well, I have nothing to lose, right?\" he asked Money, who nodded in a fast motion. \"May as well use it; if it doesn't work, then no one's loss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of person does he decide to test it on first? </span></div></div>",

She looked over her arms, now much larger and a deep tan. \"I can't feel my legs? What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcro noticed the remote had fallen on Regina's lap, covered by a blanket. In a swift motion, he scooped up the device. \"We - we switched,\" he said, going back to a reserved tone that was unusual for Regina. \"This was what I was talking about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... me? But now I can't move,\" she said, starting to sound a bit worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it can be undone,\" Acro assured her. \"I just wanted to... borrow your body. Just to go for a walk. It's been a while since I've been able to take a stroll on my own, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her composure, Regina gave a smile from Acro's body. \"Oh! Uh, yeah. I understand and I'm glad to help! Just, uh, be careful with it, and be sure to come back! The lions need me after all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Acro said to Regina as he turned to walk away, \"thanks for understanding.\" He could feel Regina's heart pounding as he left the building, thrilled to feel free. He didn't particularly care that he was a girl, he had no intention of going back to his own body any time soon. He could maybe consider taking a new one down the road, but for now, Regina could stay as him. As he walked, he couldn't help but pat down his new legs, thrilled to have some sort of sensations below the waist. Regina definitely felt weaker than his old body in its prime, but the fact that he had one that could move around at all was a godsend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he just had to figure out what to do with it. He didn't have any interest in being near the lions, so that was checked off the list. Part of him wanted to walk back around the circus and explore the place from his new perspective after so much time away. He could check out Regina's room if he so pleased and acquaint himself with his new body, maybe try to relive his acrobat days and see how athletic she was, or he could use the device and try to find a new body that was more to his liking. Alternatively, a thought came to him. His brother was in a coma, but it was because of an animal attack. Maybe if he had a new body... he'd be okay? It was a dark thought, since someone else would be subjected to a coma, but surely Acro could find someone deserving of such a fate. Looking down at himself, he realized Regina was already a candidate in his mind, as she caused the accident anyways. </span></div></div>",

Every since the accident, Bat had been in a coma, Acro couldn't accept this. Of all people, why did it have to be his brother that had to end up like that? Every since the accident, Acro prayed everyday for a miracle to awaken his brother, now he had one in his hand. With this, he could wake his brother up. His brother's body may have been damaged, but if he had a different body maybe he would wake up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcro left the circus, normally he would need someone's assistance to go anywhere and even then there weren't many places he could go, but now that he had Regina's body, he could go anywhere he wanted! The act of walking itself was amazing to Acro after all that time in the wheelchair. As he walked toward the hospital, Acro was tempted to run, just to experience the feeling of doing so again. He decided against it though, Regina's boots were clearly not suitable for running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the hospital he was thankful that visiting hours weren't over yet. He asked to see Sean Dingling and was escorted to the room his brother was in. Not that he would have needed to be escorted, after all the times he had visited Bat in his own body, he had practically memorized the layout of this hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the room, Acro looked at Bat's body. Every time he saw him like this, he would get just as sad as he did the first time he saw him like this. If this worked, he would never have to see him like this again. Acro opted to use the Shapeshift button on Bat. Either of the swap buttons would theoretically put someone else in the coma in Bat's place. Acro considered doing that if the Shapeshift didn't work. He would gladly put Regina into an eternal sleep if it meant Bat would wake up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opted not to use Possession because he didn't want to freak Bat out by putting him in some kind of ghost-like state immediately after he had been in a coma. Plus, there was no one in the immediate area that Bat could possess other than Acro, and Acro didn't want to be possessed and be unable to explain anything about what happened to Bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcro pointed the remote at himself and hit the shapeshift button, registering Regina's form in the remote. He then pointed the remote at Bat and pressed the same button, in a few moments, Bat's body morphed into an exact copy of Regina's. Acro closed his eyes and prayed that Bat would wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he?</span></div></div>",

So instead of using a swap or possession function, he  pointed the device at Regina's back clicked \"Shapeshift\", which prompted a little light to blip on the device just as Regina closed the door. Acro waited for a little while, looking down from his window as Regina walked away to where they kept the tigers. Once he was sure he was secluded again, he decided to put the device to the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, took a deep breath, pointed the device at himself, and clicked the 'shapeshift' button. Immediately, he let out the breath and opened his eyes, as his whole body underwent a dramatic change. He could feel a heavy bundle of hair weighing down his head, a set of gloves over his arms, and his legs were now only covered by a pair of stockings. He pulled up his hand and found it much paler. He could sense by the new shape of his body and all his sensations that it worked: he was Regina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Acro put his hands on either side of the chair, and pushed himself up. He stumbled, partially due to his new center of balance but also due to being crippled for so long, but managed to hold himself up by the window sill. He took a few clumsy steps, but to his amazement, he could walk. He swung a leg outward, a flourish of glitter flying about him, and gave a laugh of joy, not even caring that it was Regina's voice. \"It worked! I'm her!\" Now he could go anywhere! For a moment, he didn't feel like he had any limitations. With this device nothing could go wrong for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did realize, however, that there were currently two Reginas around the big top. He'd have to be careful like this. Maybe he'd take it slow for the moment. He could go exploring the circus as Regina while the real one was feeding the tigers; part of him was tempted to cause trouble for her while he did it. Maybe then she'd get the treatment she deserved for her actions. Otherwise, he could just leave the circus for now; if he put distance between himself and Regina, then he wouldn't have to worry about a time limit. It'd been a long time since he'd been on an outing. Maybe he could even test out the device more outside the confines of hisbuilding. It'd be a while before Regina came back to check on him anyways; no one would miss him until tomorrow morning most likely. </span></div></div>",

Of course, this meant that he couldn't go into the center of the big top itself, as Regina was currently in there feeding the animals, but he could at least walk around the other areas of the circus. Like the cafeteria or the rooms of his fellow entertainers. He hadn't been able to go to those areas in a long time, it would be nice be there after so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he though of where to go he heard a grumbling from his stomach. Regina's body must have been hungry. She must not have eaten before today's show. At least that cleared up some thoughts of where to go. He began to head to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the kitchen and inside he found Moe with many burgers. Moe looked at him and began to speak \"Hey Regina! Did you already finish feeding all the animal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcro figured the best thing to do here was to attempt to act like Regina. He put a happy attitude behind his words as he began to speak. \"Yes! It didn't take as long as usual. I'm kind of hungry now, can I please have a burger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoe got a burger ready. \"Sure, but first...What did the hamburger say when it pleaded 'not guilty'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcro sighed internally. Moe was always telling jokes like these, although, they were rarely funny, but who knows, maybe this will be the one that hits the mark. \"What did the burger say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been flamed!\" Moe said loud and exaggerated before he began laughing wildly to him. The joke did not hit the mark. Acro gave a polite laugh. Moe seemed to get depressed. \"Usually you laugh along with me Regina. Am I getting so bad I can't even make you laugh.\" Moe sighed and handed Acro a burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Acro could say anything else, Moe slammed his fist down into his hand. \"That's it! I'm going to work three times as hard on my jokes tonight. I've hit a new low, but that doesn't mean I won't bounce up higher than ever before!\" Moe exclaimed before storming out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcro sat down and began to eat the burger Moe made for him. As he ate he heard to the door to the Kitchen open again. As the person enter the room they exclaimed \"Regina sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho entered the room?</span></div></div>",

The ventriloquist was a nervous and anxious fellow, and Acro recalled that he was hopelessly infatuated with a girl who was much younger than him. Also his ventriloquism was questionable at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello Ben,\" Acro said, looking up at him, instead of the puppet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's face flashed red, nervous, as he began to maneuver the dummy. \"How's it going toots? The food good today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit annoyed, Acro continued to address the ventriloquist. \"Yeah, its fine, <i>Ben</i>,\" Regina's voice sounded uncharacteristically annoyed with Acro using it. \"How are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen seemed unsure of how to reply to this. \"Uh...\" he stumbled, \"I'm, doing... fine?\" Suddenly, the puppet's voice piped up too, \"I'm doing just great! No, uh, I had a question to ask you, Regina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcro was only Regina for a few minutes and this guy was already beginning to exhaust him. He flicked an eye over to Ben, who had a hand in his jacket pocket awkwardly. If Acro remembered the rumor mill properly, Ben had it in his head that he would propose to Regina. It was a pretty absurd prospect; his competition was Maximilian Galactaca. Acro could hardly fathom why anyone would want to be with her after what happened to his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe I'll set him straight,'</i> Acro thought with a grin. \"I'm reeeeeally, sorry Trilo, but I only talk to real people,\" he replied with feigned sweetness as he pulled himself up from his chair. \"Now, I got to head out, I'm pretty busy with the tigers and whatnot, y'know?\" he said with a tilt of Regina's head, trying to imitate her smile. Ben sputtered at this, choking on the water he had begun to drink. Trilo visibly spazzed out as well, all his pieces seeming to fall of his torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was burning red as he bent over to start picking up the pieces to his precious dummy. \"I'm uh, I'm really... sorry...\" his voice trailed off as he gathered up the pieces to the dummy, turning around and slowly walking away from the room, embarrassed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcro sorta felt sorry for him, but he had trouble caring in the long run. The guy would be better off if he just gave up on pursuing Regina after all. Acro realized he still had the device on him. He wondered how Ben would respond to a switch with the remote; Ben was a really nervous fellow, but he seemed to be at his best when he was pretending to be someone else. He could register Ben with one of the swap functions now and find him a new body later, just to inject some entropy into things. Maybe it'd do some good for his confidence in the long run? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He aimed at Ben and clicked the Aware swap button, registering him as the first target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was who to swap him with. Thinking it over there were three options here in the circus. The first was Max Galactica, the new star of the circus. From what Acro understood both Max and Ben were after Regina's affection, making them rivals. Max was the new star of the circus and was use on all of the posters to advertise the circus. Ben on the other hand was the lowest act in the circus. Swapping the two of them would be an interesting change of ranks and perhaps Ben being at the top would give him the confidence he needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second choice was Moe. Moe was the oldest act at the circus and very respected in the eyes of all the performers, Acro included. However, Moe was growing old and less people paid attention to his jokes. Maybe being someone younger would help out Moe as much as being one of the most respected performers would help Ben<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third choice was more risky, swapping Ben with Regina. It was clear that Ben liked Regina. Perhaps making him become her would help him. Although, Acro was only considering this because the thought of Regina being trapped in someone else with no idea how it happened. However, this would be risky. Acro himself was currently a copy of Regina. Going anywhere near Regina right now brought the risk of her seeing him and finding out about the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking his options over, Acro chose to swap Ben with....</span></div></div>",

He felt Moe might react negatively to a switch as well. It was a lot of stress to put on a person, and Acro had no grudge with either of his coworkers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did have a grudge with Regina, however. He had no idea how she would take to a body swap, but he imagined it would leave her rattled, especially if she had no idea why. Eager to get some revenge, Acro decided to hold off for a second while Ben walked out, to put some distance between him and the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with his plan, Acro then took off in Regina's body towards the big top itself, where Regina would probably still be tending to the animals. He became careful now as he brushed aside the tent flap, slowly walking his way down the center, careful to not make noise with Regina's boots. He could hear Regina's voice not far ahead, along with what he assumed were the sounds of the new tiger, Regent. This would be tricky; he couldn't change back until he reached his home because he still needed Regina's legs. He'd need to hit her with the body swap while hidden and still get out unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way through the audience stands, crouching low, he could hear Regina call out in a sing song voice, \"alright Regent, that's enough for now, back to the cage!\" He pulled himself up slightly, looked up from the front row as Regina directed the tiger back to it's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Good, it'd complicate things if Ben had to deal with the animal,'</i> Acro noted. Regina disappeared for a bit as she guided the tiger to a back room, but he knew she would be back as she left some of the food for it behind. She'd have to clean it up at some point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Regina did come back to gather up the mess she left behind. Ducking out of sight, he wasn't sure where she was facing as she cleaned up her mess, but he realized he would have to pull himself up to get a view on her. Hesitantly, he decided to take the risk, and he slowly lifted his legs, peeking over the pew he was behind. Glitter scattered about as he moved to see Regina...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It might be best to either go back to his room or leave the circus for now, He thought. He was able to freely walk around the circus as Regina up until now because she was preoccupied with the tigers and wouldn't see him, but now that Ben and Regina are in each other's bodies he would have to avoid them both.

She had gotten away with the murder of her sister and caused the suicide of Terry Fawles with no consequence. Not only that, but she had successfully murdered that annoying defense attorney  Diego Armando. So, if she was able to do all of this, then what was the Problem? Simple, how she had to hide the evidence of Diego's murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding the evidence itself was simple, she just handed it off to an idiot college student who happened to be at the courthouse. Sadly, getting the evidence back was turning out to be the hard part. The moron refused to give it back! Keeping it as a present and falling in love with Dahlia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past few months, Dahlia had her sister Iris pretend to be her around Phoenix and get the necklace back, but after several months of Iris making no progress in getting the necklace back, Dahlia was getting impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Dahlia, she had received something that might help her get it back. In the mail she received a strange package that contained a remote and a manual. The manual claimed that the remote was some kind of body switching device. Dahlia didn't want to believe it, but considering the fact that she was originally born in a village full of spirit mediums, this was not the weirdest thing that she had heard of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was, who to test it on? The first thought that came to her mind was to use the remote on Phoenix. If she did that, she could easily get the bottle necklace back and then completely stop contact with that moron. Of course Phoenix was not the only person she could test the remote out on, she could easily use it on Iris just to check if it would work. Or maybe she could use it to get rid of that annoying Mia Fey for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did Dahlia test it on?</span></div></div>",

Dahlia then pointed the remote at herself and once again clicked the Aware Swap button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Dahlia was standing where Phoenix had been. She was overcome with man weird sensations due to her being in a completely different body. The most noticeable thing being the change in gender. It also seemed that Phoenix was coming down with a cold and now Dahlia had a headache because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia didn't have time to thing about things like that. She wanted to leave Phoenix's body as soon as possible. She looked down at Phoenix's neck and saw that he was indeed wearing the necklace that she had given him. She left the university, she was going to personally deliver the necklace to her home. Once she had done that she would return to her body and retrieve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was the headache because of Phoenix's cold, or maybe it was the excitement of finally being able to get rid of the only evidence against her, but Dahlia hadn't noticed one small yet important fact. The remote hadn't followed her when she swapped bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Phoenix was standing outside the university confused. One moment he was finished with all of his classes for the day and was heading home, the next moment he was twenty feet away and facing the university. Not only that, he was in a completely different body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to figure out whose body he was in. He saw strands of red hair fall into his face. He was wearing a white dress and on the ground was an umbrella that was a similar color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dollie!\" He shouted in shock, although there was definitely a small amount of joy in his voice as he shouted that. He couldn't believe that he was in his girlfriend's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around for Dahlia, who he assumed was in his body, but strangely he couldn't find his own body anywhere. \"Oh no, did she get scared by the body swap and run away?\" Phoenix said to no one in particular, as far as he knew, Dahlia was the kind of girl who got scared easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She probably got scared and went home.\" Phoenix told himself, he would have gone to where she lived and met up with her, but despite them dating for months Phoenix had no idea where she lived. He assumed she was just to shy to tell him. With no other options, Phoenix decided to just head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up Dahlia's umbrella off the ground, he was glad she had brought it. Now he had a way to avoid the rain on his walk home, he had gotten a cold in his own body, he would have hated if he gave Dahlia a cold too. As he picked up the umbrella off the ground, he had not noticed that right next to it was a remote of some sort. As Phoenix walked away, he had a smile on his face. Sure, he was in a completely different body, but at least he was his precious Dahlia and not someone he barely knew</span></div></div>",

Assuming that Dahlia was in his body, he couldn't imagine how she was handling herself with this rain. He wasn't doing so good himself, sure the umbrella was protecting him from the rain himself, but he was getting very cold with the wind. He wanted to get out of the rain as soon as possible, unfortunately, he wasn't walking as fast as he could be. Dahlia's body wasn't exactly easy for him to walk in. She had been wearing both a dress and heels, obviously not the kind of clothes that Phoenix was used to walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoenix got near where he lived, he suddenly tripped, it was surprising it took so long for that to happen. As he picked himself up off the ground he noticed that when he had tripped he fell straight into mud. He looked at Dahlia's dress and saw that it got covered in mud during the fall. Not only that, but her umbrella was broken in the fall. \"Oh No!\" He yelled as he grabbed part of the muddied dress. \"I hope Dollie doesn't get too upset.\" Deciding that standing out in the rain wouldn't doing any good, Phoenix continued on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a college student, Phoenix didn't have his own place to live. However, he didn't live with his family either. Instead, Phoenix was temporarily staying in an apartment that one of his friends owned. His friend's name was Larry and he was a childhood friend of Phoenix. Larry had graduated from junior high, and only junior high. Phoenix had no idea what or where Larry worked, from talking with Larry it seemed that he did something different every other week. Phoenix didn't plan on permanently living with Larry, he planned to move out as soon as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix slowly entered Larry's Apartment, he stuck his head in before fully walking in. It seemed that Larry wasn't home right now. Phoenix didn't know whether not to feel lucky or disappointed about that. He really wanted to tell somebody that he was somehow in Dahlia's body, but at the same time he was positive Larry would react very, Larry-like, at seeing a girl in his apartment. Phoenix wasn't sure that he wanted to be on the receiving end of Larry's flirting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sat down on Larry's couch. He looked down at Dahlia's wet and muddy dress. He felt really bad about the fact that he tripped while in her body, but more importantly, he was feeling really cold. Because he had broken the umbrella on his way here, Dahlia's body got drenched in the rain. He would feel even worse if Dahlia got sick because of him. He supposed he should at least change clothes, although he felt that he would breaching on Dahlia's privacy by doing so. He obviously didn't have any of Dahlia's clothes here, but he was sure that if he looked around his own clothes he would eventually come across something that would fit her body.</span></div></div>",

At first he looked shocked, but a smirk quickly grew on his face as he psyched himself up to talk with the pretty lady before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, baby,\" Larry said, approaching 'Dahlia' with as suave a walk as he could muster, which, to be fair, wasn't all that suave. \"Are you here to have your way with me?

But enough about me, gorgeous, tell me a little bit about yourself. What brings you to <i>Casa de Butz</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix cringed internally. He felt violated on a bunch of levels, not the least of which stemming from the fact that Larry was flirting with his girlfriend. <span class=\"clblue\">(Like my Dollie would ever dream of stooping to your level,)</span> he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now he had a difficult decision to make.

If he went around telling people that Dahlia was going around saying that she was someone else, people would think she was crazy! The last thing Phoenix wanted was for Dahlia to have a bad reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m, uh, waiting here for my boyfriend.\u201d Phoenix made up an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, baby. I\u2019m right here for you.\u201d Larry flirted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was practically holding back puke, both at Larry flirting at him and at Larry flirting with Dahlia. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not my darling Feenie.\u201d Phoenix said, putting on an impression of Dahlia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! You\u2019re Nick\u2019s girl.\u201d Larry said, seeming to lose some interest. \u201cNiiiick! You doooog!\u201d Larry shouted to the ceiling. \u201cYou had a girl like this and you never brought her over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sighed. At least Larry seemed to understand that Dahlia was his girlfriend, hopefully now he would hold off on the flirting. Although, Larry was still eyeing Dahlia\u2019s body up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, you\u2019re all covered in mud. Did something happen?\u201d Larry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, I tripped and fell into a mud puddle on my way over here.\u201d Phoenix tried to laugh off what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry smirked. \u201cWell, if you need a new dress. I can provide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was shocked \u201cWhat?! What do you mean?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can get you a new one, there\u2019s a place nearby. Give me fifteen minutes and I\u2019ll get you one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix put his hands up defensively \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need one!\u201d He didn\u2019t want Larry buying Dahlia a new dress. He didn\u2019t want Dahlia to know some random stranger went and bought her something when Phoenix himself couldn\u2019t. Plus, Larry would never buy someone something like that unless he was still interested in dating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI insist! Any friend of Nick is a friend of mine!\u201d Larry insisted. <i>\u2018Plus, if you ever break up with Nick, I need to be ready to catch the rebound.\u2019</i> Larry thought to himself as he walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix realized he had no choice but to accept Larry\u2019s kindness for now. Once Larry left Phoenix sat down on the couch again. He wondered how Dahlia was doing right now. Similar to how he didn\u2019t know where she lived, he had never given her his address. Meaning that the soonest that he could meet up with her would be tomorrow. He'd have to spend the night in Dahlia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix waited for Larry, he was still a bit mad that Larry hadn't listened to him and insisted to buy Dahlia a new dress. <i>'Maybe I can tell Dollie I was the one who bought it?'</i> Phoenix thought to himself. As he waited for Larry, he realized that Larry had exaggerated a bit about how long it would take him. He had been gone for about forty five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more waiting, Larry eventually come back through the door. He was drenched from the rain and had a bag with him. \"I'm back\" He said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you'd take fifteen minutes, that was nearly an hour!\" Phoenix said, after he said that he sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it that long? Sorry, I'm not good with division.\" Larry said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'There was no division with that!'</i> Phoenix mentally screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyway. Here you go!\" Larry said as he handed Phoenix the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninside was a dress exactly like the one Dahlia had, the only difference was the color. Unlike Dahlia's dress, which was white, This one was very pink. As Phoenix looked at it, he couldn't help but blush. It didn't fully hit him until now exactly what changing clothes in Dahlia's body would entail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can change in Nick's room. I'm sure that he'll be here soon. I stop by Ivy University a little while ago and I didn't see him, but I did find something cool on the ground. Look at this cool ____!\"</span></div></div>",

He currently owed a large sum of money to Bruto Cadaverni, due to the injuries that Viola had sustained in her car crash. While he had a feeling that he could make it up with he money he would get from people paying their loans, with each passing day it felt like that was less and less likely. Glen Elg was nowhere near close to paying him and not even rats would eat the food at Armstrong's restaurant. It would take some sort of miracle for either of them to pay him back. Elg was insisting that he was working on some sort of computer virus and would pay back Furio with that, but it would take at least another few weeks before it was done. Furio needed money and he needed it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurio sat in his office thinking of what to do, maybe he could threaten Armstrong for money? Although he doubted that Armstrong would have more than a few bucks. It was then that Tigre noticed a strange package sitting over to the side of the room. Strange, he was sure that the package wasn't there before. Maybe Viola brought it in, but why wouldn't she tell him about it and why would she put it off to the side, almost out of sight? Regardless of how it got there or who put it there, he went to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he picked it up, he began to walk back to his desk. As he walked, he couldn't help but think of what was in the package and listened to the sounds the package made as he moved it. It was of a decent weight, there was some empty room in the package so he could hear moving, it sound like there was paper inside and another object. Maybe someone had paid their loan and had sent in the money through the mail? That's what Furio hoped for anyway, he didn't give much thought to the object in the package. Unfortunately for him, there was no money in the package only a remote and a manual, the manual being the cause of the papery sound that he heard. In his anger, he roared and threw the remote and manual across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Viola came into the room, carrying a tray of donuts and coffee for Furio. Something she would often do when she heard him get angry. \"Violetta, Youse go 'nd 'collect' some dough from Armstrong!\" He ordered her to do, even if Armstong didn't have much money, Furio needed to collect some right now just to calm himself down. While he didn't enjoy being Viola's 'boyfriend', she was at the very least useful for 'Collecting' loans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Viola had left the room, Furio looked the the donuts and coffee she had brought in. He then proceeded to open a window, throw out the donuts, and pour out the coffee. While Viola was technically his girlfriend, he wasn't stupid enough to try any of her food. Once he was done with that, he looked back at the remote and manual he had thrown. He picked them up and read the manual, it was the most ridiculous thing he had ever read! It was some sort of 'Body Swap' remote. There was a note attached to the remote itself. <i>'Your money problems have now been solved'</i> the note said, as if mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Furio didn't believe the remote, a thought occurred to him, the sender knew of his money problems! Furio never told anyone about that, the only ones who knew were him and Bruto Cadaverni! While he doubted that Bruto himself had sent this package, maybe one of Bruto's contacts sent it? This thing could be real if that was true. It didn't matter exactly <i>who</i> sent it, he was desperate. Maybe this could help him with his money trouble? Or better yet, let him get out of this situation without him paying a cent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course before he could make any grand plans, he needed to test out whether or not it worked. There were a few people that he knew and could easily get in contact with. The first three that came to mind were Viola, Elg, and Armstrong. Armstrong and Viola were both currently at Tres Bien and Elg was most likely at Blue Screens inc. right now. Both of those place were only a few minutes walk away. Where did he go to test the remote?</span></div></div>",

He didn't have a very specific idea of what he wanted to do with the remote now. He would probably test the device on Elg or something like that when he got there. He got up from his desk and began to head to Blue Screens Inc. on his scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Furio to get to his destination, it was only a short drive away. Blue Screens Inc. was a small company and the outside of the building was rather bland looking. Despite the bland exterior, the interior of the building looked like something straight out of a Sci-Fi movie.The walls were all a blue-ish white with the corners curved. All of the employees were wearing some king of blue computer display on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Employees, Furio looked at one desk and saw who he had been looking for, Glen Elg, Glen Elg was scratching away at some lottery tickets or something of the sort. After he had finished scratching his ticket, seemingly disappointed with the result, he looked up and saw Furio. He face contorted into an expression of fear upon seeing his loan shark in the building he worked at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurio grabbed the remote out of his pocket and was prepared to use on of it's functions to swap with Elg, when he suddenly saw a much, much, better target. He saw the almost robotic CEO of the company, Lisa Basil. He recognized her because one time he had come here to collect some money from Elg and she tried to kick him out saying his 'access was prohibited' or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chose to swap with her for one major reason, her position as CEO. With a CEO position, Furio would have access to everything that Blue Screens Inc. had to offer. That included both the money that the company currently. It would be simple, all he would have to do is take her body, do a little searching around and find out the companies banks accounts and transfer all of the money to himself. It was simple and he would gain a lot from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had a plan, all he had to do was take her body. What kind of swap did he use?</span></div></div>",

With this option he wouldn't have to worry about Basil in his body nor would he have to worry about there being two Basils running around. He saw Ms. Basil walking over to him, presumably to kick him out. He smiled and aimed the remote at himself and clicked the possession button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant he was floating above his own body and was in some sort of Ghost-like state. Not wasting any time, he floated over to Ms. Basil and flew into her body. Suddenly he was physical again, although it was clear that he was no longer himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change in gender was the most noticeable thing about being in Ms. Basil's body, but there were other more subtle things that he immediately noticed. His hair was lying flat and he had one of those weird headsets on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his own body still standing in the entrance, Furio smiled and turned to his 'Employee' Glen Elg, who was currently hiding under his desk hoping that his loan collector hadn't noticed him. Furio smiled and began to speak with Basil's voice. \"Elg. Youse have a guest. Go see 'im or youse fired\" Elg had no choice, he begrudgingly got up from his desk and left with Furio's own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now That'sa taken care of.\" Furio said and cracked Basil's knuckles, he was now ready to begin his plan of taking all the money he could salvage out of Blue Screens Inc. He went over to Lisa's computer, which was thankfully logged in and began to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Furio wasn't the best with machines. He had no idea how to transfer any money from the company. He usually had Viola take care of things like that. He decided that it would be best to just bring Viola here and have her help out. She should still be at Tres Bien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Furio walked out of the building he turned to the other employees \"Youse all have the week off! Git outta here!\" He yelled at them, not even attempting to act like Basil. He needed all of the other employees out of here if he was going to bring Viola, there would need to be no witnesses connecting the loss of money to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the employees had left, Furio began to walk over to Tres Bien in Basil's body</span></div></div>",

He got dressed (not that he had anyone to dress up for). He read his mail. He sat on his old chair. He read one of his books. He thought about what might have been. He went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor days, weeks, and eventually months, the monotony of the hell the men in blue called solitary started to get to him. Every day was that same routine. He got up, took care of his hygiene, read, and slept. The courts called him mad, but if he was mad, he sure as hell wasn't before he was walked into this room. This cramped, yet admittedly comfortable room, the guard introduced with a smirk by saying, \"I give you, your cell\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if it was too late for them to take it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, though -- oh, that day was different. On normal days his mail contained nary more than the news and letters from the parents he'd yet to give a word back to. But this day, he received a package. And the content of that package was one he would not soon forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Kristoph muttered to himself as he investigated this so-called \"body-switching remote\". Normally, he'd be more skeptical of these types of things, but it's clear whoever gave this to him had the kind of clout he could trust to tell him the truth. Perhaps the mystery benefactor wanted to see him on the outside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the cause, there were a few things he could do now that he had this device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first: Use the remote to escape right now. He could switch with the guard or maybe possess an unsuspecting person in the street. Both options were viable, and both would get him out -- with the remote in tact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he always had option two: He could lie in wait, perhaps for a visitor, or maybe even a passerby, and use the remote on them to get out. He could even use the remote while staying inside the prison as means to his ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what did he choose to do?</span></div></div>",

What was the plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Kristoph was confined to solitary, he had connections throughout the prison and had a basic understanding of things. there was an overabundance of one thing in this prison. People who wanted revenge on the people who put them in this prison. Whether the target of their revenge be a defense attorney, a prosecutor, a witness, or a detective. Kristoph could in some ways, relate to their pain. Of course, unlike them, he had a way of getting his revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy not turn their desire for revenge into his own personal gain? He could give them a way out of prison, a new body, no criminal record, and a chance for revenge. The only thing he would ask for in return would be small 'favors'. Whether it be information on how certain people that Kristoph wanted to keep an eye on were doing. Or perhaps even luring certain people to the detention center for a 'visit'. It would be simple really, even a simpleton could do it. Now that he had began to think this plan through, Kristoph needed to select his 'partners' in crime.

No strings attached.\" Kristoph told White of his intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how Marvelous!\" White said in his usual flamboyant way, before his tone got serious \"I'm no fool, Mr Given, business is all give and take, now, what can Redd White do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoph didn't appreciate White's butchering of his last name \"Oh, nothing major Mr. White. I only need you to do one small job. I assume you're familiar with Phoenix Wright?\" Kristoph asked a question he very well knew the answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd White's face contorted in rage. \"Yes, very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoph smiled at White's anger \"Now, I'm not asking you to do anything major like killing him, you don't want to go back to prison right after I break you out. No, I want you to affect his life on a much more.....personal scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd smiled at the idea. Getting revenge on Phoenix Wright was something he had long dreamed of. If it weren't for that pesky junior lawyer, he'd still be sitting in his comfy CEO chair atop of the blackmail empire he knew as Bluecorp. \"So, you want me to steal the body of Mr. Wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoph shook his head \"No, no Mr. White. Simply taking his body is too simple. I want something much more than that. I want everything that he knows destroyed. I will break his spirit.\" Kristoph said with a chuckle. \"Your job is to possess someone close to him. Do not worry, there are plenty of people you can choose from. Some with successful careers that you can exploit and take as your own. However, there is one person I will not permit you to possess, a rookie lawyer by the name of Apollo Justice. I have a personal vendetta against him and plan to get revenge against him in the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want me to replace someone close to Wrong? And how will this break his spirit?\" White questioned Kristoph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. At first he probably won't find anything odd with one person acting differently. However, as more and more people start acting different, he'll begin to question it, and once I have deemed that enough is different, we ruin him. His closest friends and colleagues all trying to ruin his life and career with eventually lead him to the point of insanity.\" Kristoph explained his plan in whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you plan for I to do all that?\" Redd White asked, smiling at the thought of being important in a plan to ruin Wright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, no, Mr White. You are merely the first I have chosen to move. Others will follow soon after you, I merely chose you to go first due to your personal involvement with Wright. Your imprisonment was his first major success in court.\" Kristoph explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I get to be the entrepreneur of possessing? How fantastabulous! Let's begin\" White said with a large smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoph pointed the remote at White again. \"Now White, a fair bit of warning. This remote can do more than Possess, if I deem you untrustworthy, I have the ability to put you into the body of bug. As you can imagine, I don't want to dirty my shoes with extermination. Choose all your moves wisely, I might be in jail, but I have ways of getting information on people's actions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedd said nothing as Kristoph pressed the Possession button, Redd soon found himself in a strange ghost form. He took this opportunity to fly threw the prison wall toward the outside world, meanwhile his body was escorted back to his cell. Redd hadn't been outside prison in years. He took a minute to bask in the sunlight before he got to his mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to possess someone close to Wright, but who? He had two options, a co-worker, or a friend. He didn't know much of Wright's personal or professional life. He flew toward Wright's office, thankfully he hadn't moved in all these years. Inside he found Wright talking to someone. Someone perfect to be possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it a friend or co-worker?</span></div></div>",

This remote was his chance to escape and he was going to get advantage of that as soon as possible. He aimed the remote at himself and clicked the 'Possession' button. In only a few moments, he was floating above his body. He was in some sort of ghost-like form. He looked down at his body. It was going about his daily routine as if nothing had happened, it appeared that the remote had vanished too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any time, Kristoph floated threw the prison walls and began to make his way to the outside world. He didn't even bother to look at guards as he passed by. He could possess one of their bodies and just walk away from prison, but he decided against it. They were an unnecessary step, why bother becoming a guard and leaving when he could just possess someone who was already far away from the prison?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he floated outside, he had to cover his eyes. It had been quite awhile since he had seen so much sunlight. He had done it, he was free as a bird. The wonders of being free could wait however, there was still the matter of a body to worry about. Kristoph wasn't particularly picky when it came to a body to first possess. He'd prefer to be pretty much anyone compared to being in jail. The person could be male, female, rich, poor. As long as they were healthy and in good shape he was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, whatever body he took, wouldn't necessarily be permanent. He had plans for the future now that he knew that this remote works and those plans may require him to end a few lives, in more ways than one. He made a mental note to allways keep the remote close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the prison was close to a relatively public area. The courthouse and the prosecution's office were both nearby. Sadly, the office of false Justice and the fallen Phoenix  who he wanted to exact his revenge on was on the opposite side of town. Judging by how long it took for him to move out of the prison in this ghost form, it would take hours to float over to their office  Of course, he didn't have to take revenge on the defense attorneys just yet, there were other people he wanted revenge against. His treacherous brother's office was nearby, he was as good a start on this cycle of revenge as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was, who to possess. The obvious choice was to take Klavier's body, not being in control of himself for however long Kristoph decided would be a good punishment. Of course, Krishtoph had a second idea. Instead of possessing Klavier directly, why not possess someone he knows? Being betrayed by someone he thought he knew. Kristoph couldn't help but smirk at the karma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Kristoph do?</span></div></div>",

After all, who else has become so personally invested in all his subjects' lives? Certainly not Mr. Cole Ectacks, the greedy fool. Certainly not Ms. Isla Ving, she's far too sympathetic to give each and every subject attention. No, only he, Paul Atishon, grandson of the prominent congressman Abe Atishon, would be good for the job! All he had to do was convince everyone else of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the perfect way to do so presented itself the following day. He stepped out his front door and into his palanquin, when suddenly there was a knock on the curtain from one of his staff members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! There is a package addressed for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA package? He grabbed the package, and began to open it, hoping it was of the $1000 or above variety. He couldn't stand those sub-1000 gifts. They went right in the garbage. But this was no sub-1000 gift, no. This was priceless. Inside the package was a remote control and an instruction manual that read \"Body switching remote.\" A remote that could switch bodies? If he had that kind of power, he could win the election! Not even that, he could do whatever he pleased! Oh, it was glorious! It was stupendous! It was perfect! It was... destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be destiny. Clearly the Gods above thought him to be deserving of such a miraculous device and entrusted it to him, Paul Atishon, out of nothing less that sheer amazement. It was clear he was free to use this remote control as he saw fit, as he was only capable of doing good with the thing. But that lead him to a single, most important question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the Great Paul Atishon use this amazing gift from the heavens for?</span></div></div>",

What other use was there for a device that could let you control other peoples bodies and have them do things, even against their will? He would use it to win the election! Of course, there was no need to use the remote at all. He could easily win this whole thing without it, he was too glourious to fail! The remote would merely get him the same result, with him having to put in less effort. All for the better of course, why should he, someone who reaches near divine levels of magnificence have to put his full effort into something so one-sided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was, who to use this device from the heavens on? The very first thought he had was to use the device on someone in Kurain village. While he was positive that his thought provoking and excellently worded speeches would win over the public, maybe the people in Kurain would prefer to hear of his magnificence from one of their own citizens? All he would have to do is take the body of one the people living there and give one of his usual speeches and even if this plan didn't work, he could at least use the body that he had stolen to vote for himself. There was more than one way to win an election after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, why limit himself to the village himself? There were many people outside of the village he could use the remote on. For starters, he had heard that many people of the village were familiar with an agency in the city called the 'Wright Anything Agency' or something like that. Even the villages' future master was on friendly terms with the people at that agency. He could see it now \"We are the Wright Anything Agency and we approve of Paul Atishon for assemblyman\" that's what he would say, it would be simple. Too bad the future master was currently out of the country, if she were here while he took one of those bodies, he might get her vote too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choices were many and they were all up to him, more than usual though! For a normal person this was a simple choice, but for him, this was a momentous decision! He carefully thought about it and soon came upon the magnificent decision to take the body of.... </span></div></div>",

There were several reasons for him choosing to switch with Pearl, but the biggest one was that she was the cousin of the future master of the village, Maya Fey. While switching with Maya herself would have been better, that was unfortunately not possible with her being out of the country. Thankfully, Pearl herself was still respected by many people in the village, due to her having extremely high spiritual power. Now that he had chosen who to swap with, all he had to do was find her and use the remote. He left his home and began to make his way toward Kurain Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had arrived in Kurain village, he began his search. While walking, he passed by multiple people. He made sure to give a speech about his campaign to each person that he passed. They all said that he was bothering them, and that was true! He was interrupting their ineloquent lives with his gracious presence. He soon found Pearl. She was exiting a large building in the center of town known as Fey Manor. As she walked out, multiple people passed her and those people gave her respectful bows as they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had found her, he had to choose which of the remotes buttons to use on her. The three that would most suit his plan were the 'Aware Swap', 'Possession', and 'Shapeshift' buttons. However, 'Unaware Swap' was still a viable option because this was just a test and the most important thing to do was test out the remote and make sure that it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich button does he use?</span></div></div>",

He barely stopped to get a look at himself before walking away and beginning his plans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the other side of the road was a silently panicking Pearl Fey, confused, scared, and disgusted all at once.

DON'T WORRY THERE ISN'T MANY</span><br>\r\nThere are four functions that can be preformed with the remote; aware swap, unaware swap, possession, and shapeshift, this is how each of those swaps work<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aware Swap function is a simple body swap. When used, the two targets of the swap will be put into each others bodies and be able to notice. The rest of the world would see them as each other<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unaware Swap function puts the targets into each others bodies, but only those holding the remote would notice. No one else in the world would be able to tell a swap took place <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Possession function turns the affected party into a ghost-like state. Once in this state, the user can fly into and possess the body of any person. Once they turn into this ghost-like state, their original body act completely normal and will retain no knowledge of the remote<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shapeshift function can copy someone's shape. If Phoenix were to use the shapeshift function on Maya, then Maya's shape would be saved. If he were to use the shapeshift button on himself, then he be in an exact copy of Maya's body and the world would see him as Maya. This function can also be used to shapeshift others. The remote can save multiple people's shapes and has a 'undo' button to let someone back into their body after they shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Command function is unlike the others in that it is hidden in a compartment on the under side of the remote and it isn't mentioned in the manual. It is used to give orders to whoever the wielder of the remote chooses. The person the button is used on will enter a motionless state until a command is given. Once a command is given, it will take immediate effect. The person being commanded will not remember being given the order, however, they will be fully aware that they are doing something against their will. Commands that result in physical harm will NOT take effect, however commands that result in mental harm will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Phoenix were to aware swap two other people then both of those people would be able to notice the swap and everyone would see them as each other<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Phoenix were to do an unaware swap on two other people then they wouldn't know they are swapped however Phoenix would know<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Phoenix were to press the possession button on someone else, then that person would go into ghost form and be able to possess people<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may use characters from any Ace Attorney game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only one remote. Whoever finds it may give it to others, but there is only one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Ace Attorney characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep this T rated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo ending the Story! There is always a way it can continue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave characters only appear time periods they should be in EX: No Professor Means in the original trilogy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing off Ace Attorney characters.
