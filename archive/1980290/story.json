Whoever had been doing it had done a good job covering their tracks and leaving no fingerprints, like skilled cat burglars. Normally this would be a job for the regular police, but it had gotten so out of hand that they had to ask the famous hero Ben Tennyson (as he likes to put it) to help. The criminal entered stores and robbed cash registers at night while only leaving the open empty register as an indication that the store had been robbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two alien aprehhenders were currently doing detective work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter investigating the stores that were robbed, Ben surmised that the villian would show up at the next store, Mr. Bauman's market. Ben also knew that the villian had been coming in during the night. He had examined the last store and saw an open window with footprints using wildmutt's thermal vision. He saw the prints were still fairly fresh and it was 9:00 AM when they were investigating, so it must have been at 5:00 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 3:00 AM in the morning as Ben and Rook stood lookout near Mr. Bauman's store in the proto-truck. Ben looked like he was ready to crash in bed. His eyes were drooping heavily. \"Man *yaaaaaawwwnnnn* this is ridiculous\" Ben said stretching, clearly sleepy. \"Steady lookout Ben\" rook replied. \"This criminal clearly comes out just before morning starts and robs stores according to your deductions, and is most likely to appear here according to the chain of robberies\". Ben looked at him with droopy eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but....why are we sitting here on lookout duty in the middle of the night\" Ben said complaining. \"We can never be too careful. The thief may come earlier\" Rook said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was honestly surprised at how Rook was able to stay awake so easily. \"How are you not tired yet\" Ben asked, begging to know how he is so alert\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expert training. I prepared myself to awaken at this time. A good law enforcer should prepare to awaken at any time\" Rook said while looking out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not really answering\" Ben said. \"Why are we even doing this anyway\" Ben complained again. \"we're superheroes, not policemen\" he added. \"This is a job for sherlock holmes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This criminal has been expertly robbing store and leaving no trace. It is possible that this is not a simple petty thief and may even be an alien\" Rook answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe, or maybe its just a good cat burglar\" Ben quipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rook spotted movement near the store. A shadow moved towards the store from the woods at amazing speed. From the looks of it it appeared as though this figure was feminine. She climbed up the store wall with expert movement like a cat. With a shaky move of her butt she appeared on the top of the roof. She took out a little crowbar shaped tool and pried open the ventalation shaft on the top while falling through, entering the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben, i believe the thief has just entered the building\" Rook said, only to here the sound of snoring. \"Zzzzzz...\" Ben said, sleeping in his seat, leanig against the window. \"BEN\" Rook shouted, shaking Ben awake. \"AAAH, WHAT IS IT\" he said. \"The thief has just entered the building\" he said. \"And i believe you were right about the \"cat\" burglar theory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was very reluctant to go and just wanted to go back to sleep. \"Ugh, fine lets go\" Ben said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two unbuckled their seatbelts and exited the proto-truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning up to the front of the building, Rook readied his proto-tool and Ben switched on his omnitrix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both kicked in the door with a large slam. \"Put your hands, or claws,  up in the air cat burglar. Ben tennyson is...uhh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped mid introduction when he saw who it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben and rook were surprised at who they saw. Instead of a guy in a black hood, they instead see a gorgeous, buxom young woman.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a pink skintight latex leotard that tightly hugged her lithe frame and huge hips. The legholes squeezed her smooth thick thighs as they were showing off her silky smooth skin. She had the biggest breasts as they pushed against the latex leotard, the orbs showing a huge line of cleavage going down, almost on purpose. Her hair was a large bunch of blonde hair and she wore a pink mask over her blue eyes as her arms were bare and her hands were covered by pink gloves. The leotard extended down her legs with two straps that connected it to her knee high pink high heeled boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was noticeably blushing at the sight of the beauty. \"Uh...uhm, who are you\" Ben asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman spoke softly. \"Ben Tennyson, how unexpected\" she said in a russian accent. \"I knew that you would find me, but not so soon. Za police in zis american city are so incompetent\" she added. She jumped over the counter and stood in a seductive pose, hand on her right hip and a bag in her other hand, presumably full of the money she stole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, the only law you need to know about right now is the Ben 10 law Mrs...err\" Ben asked confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darling, forgive my rudeness, i am Angelica, an expert thief coming from a foreign country. I am a woman thief enthusiast and enjoy spreading the wonders of femininity and thievery around the world, so i like to dress as womanly as possible, in case you haven't noticed\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had definitely noticed her jiggling breasts and thick bare thighs. He had to keep his male urges under control and not look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you za truth darling, i was searching for you. Why do you think I left such an obvious chain of thefts for you to follow\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? You have lured us here to find you on purpose\" Rook asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truthfully Mr. Alien accomplice, I only wanted to find Ben. I wish to share the gift of femininity with him and make him a her, ohohohoho\" she said putting a hand to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and rook were perplexed about this. They looked at each other with confused faces, but soon returned their gazes to Angelica. \"I don't know what you mean by that Mrs \"woman thief enthusiast\", but you\u2019re gonna have to put that money back or its hero time\" Ben declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, your hero watch, powerful indeed. I know all about your heroic acts Mr. Ben Tennyson\" Angelica said. \"A shame you won't be able to stop me\" she said as she pulled out a special gun from the back of her latex leotard's belt. With two quick clicks of the gun *pew pew* she shot out 2 see-through capture nets. The nets unraveled and prepared to ensnare Ben and Rook. The boys gasped in shock at the nets coming at them. They couldn\u2019t react fast enough. \u201cAugh\u201d \u201cUgh\u201d Ben and Rook said as they were captured and tied in the nets, falling on the floor. \u201cUrgh\u2026aagh\u201d Ben said as he struggled to break free of the net. He couldn\u2019t even reach his omnitrix. \u201cHAHAHA, that is unbreakable neutro-carbonate, you can never escape from it\u201d Angelica said in her sultry russian accent. <br>\r\n\u201cYou are not gonna get away with this\u201d Ben said. \u201cOn the contrary dear, I already have\u201d she said as she pulled out another gun. This one was pink with flowers on it. \u201cNow dear, experience the loving joys of womanhood\u201d she said as she blasted Ben with a pink ray.<br>\r\n \u201cUUUAAAAAAAUUGHHH\u201d Ben said as his voice was beginning to get higher. His arms became skinnier and his hands became slimmer and daintier with long fingernails. His eyes grew longer eyelashes. His hair, once short, exploded out of his head in a large cascading flow of long brown hair. His chest jiggled out 2 breasts that pressed against his signature \u201c10\u201d shirt, stretching it to show cleavage. His waist became thin, and his hips became wider and stuck out of his sides, stretching his pants. His legs became slimmer and his thighs fattened, becoming curvier. His manhood disappeared and was morphed into a new womanhood. He was now a she, a fully fledged girl. <br>\r\nOnce the transformation was finished Ben fell unconscious, her long flowing hair sprawled out on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica looked on in adoration of her work. \u201cGorgeous, just gorgeous\u201d she said. She jumped forward and walked over to Ben, her high heeled boots clacking against the floor of Mr. Bauman\u2019s shop. Rook looked to his left while he was ensnared in his net. \u201cBEN, BEN\u201d he shouted.  <br>\r\n\u201cShe bent down to see Ben, or probably Benina\u2019s sleeping face, her eyelashes fluttering and her lips plump and kissable. \u201cBenina Tennyson, I have just made you beautiful\u201d Angelica said. She cupped Ben\u2019s face with her hands and gave him a large smooch on her cheek. \u201cYou are my angelic creation Benina, soon you will join my side\u201d she said before running off with the money in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRook managed to break free of his net with his prototool that he managed to reach. He ran over to Ben\u2019s side and instead saw a beautiful girl with long hair sprawled out on the floor. She had Ben\u2019s shirt, pants and long hair the same chocolate brown as Ben\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen\u201d Rook said to his now female partner, seeing if she was alright. \u201cUmphh\u2026.uuugh\u201d Ben muttered, voice sounding lighter and more like a mature girl\u2019s voice.   <br>\r\nRook had untied Ben from the net. He could see her skinny body. He blushed a bit at picking up a human female. even if it was Ben. Slowly he picked up Ben in his arms and made his way to the proto-truck with the new feminized Ben unconscious, hair drooping down to the floor.<br>\r\n                                                                                <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben was currently asleep on a table at plumber hq. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummphhh..ugh\" Ben went. She woke up dazed. \"where.. where am I\" she said, her eyes widening as she realized her voice sounded high pitched. She put her hands to her throat. \"M-my voice its...a girls voice\" she said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben, thank goodness your are awake\" Rook rushed over to him...or now her. \"Rook, whats going on, where am I and..why is my voice like a girl's\" Ben said panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw that her hair was blocking part of her eyes, lifting a hand to swipe it to the side she saw her hand. It looked completely feminine with long nails and smooth clear skin, not a hair to be found with a lighter paler tone of peach colored skin. \"WH-WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HANDS, MY VOICE, THEY'RE...they're girly\" she screamed still panicking and looking at her hands as he came to a horrifying realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben please calm down, everything will be fine\" rook said trying to reassure him things would be fine. \"HOW CAN THINGS BE FINE. I'M A GIRL\" she said. She pulled on her long hair that was hanging from her head down to her eyes. \"My hair\" she said. She looked down and saw her long brown hair cascading behind her back, brushing up against her left hand and touching the bed she was on. She felt it with her long nailed fingers. It felt softer and smoother than the hair Ben had as a boy. She could feel her scalp when she pulled on it. It was definitely her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a mirror next to her and picked it up. Seeing her new image she was shocked. Ben's face, while still looking a bit like his male self's face, was now feminine. Her hair was long and reached down her back. Her eyes, while still retaining the green iris', now had poofy eyelashes and her lips were a bit more puffy and pronounced like her cousin Gwen's. In addition, her clothes had changed. She was now wearing a short sleeved hospital patient's robe, sporting a pair of jiggling breasts on her skinnier torso. She put a hand to her cheek to confirm if this was real. She could feel her soft skin and rubbed her hand up and down her cheek. she was definitely a girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH\" A loud yet comical girlish shriek could be heard throughout the plumber base. Grandpa max and Majister Patteliday rushed over to Ben's room in the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on\" Max said. \"Well Majister.... Ben woke up\" Rook said in a defeated way. Max went over to Ben. He saw his young grandson-turned-granddaughter scared and panicking. \"Ben its ok, we're here for you\" Max said. putting his arms on Ben's short non broad shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa what's going on, why am I a girl\" Ben said scared and worried. \"Is something wrong with the omnitrix\" she said, looking at the green wristwatch like device on her wrist, figuring its DNA altering properties would typically be responsible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ben its not the watch\" Max said. Rook began to add in the conversation. \"It appears that whatever this new Angelica criminal blasted you with has caused you to become female\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen became furious. \"What!!? Its that girl's fault\" she said angrily. \"I'm afraid so\" Rook said. \"But why did she do this to me\" Ben asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that we don't know\" Max said. patelliday begun to talk. \"Well we did a couple of DNA tests, no disruptors or viruses. Besides sporting a pair of pink poofy lips and long hair you're still pretty much you\" the fishy alien plumber said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she was just as your people say, cookoo\" Rook said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen couldn't believe it, he let a villain get away and turn him into a girl. He, or now she looked down at herself and her breasts, not believing he was a girl...and also slightly blushing from his new features. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>2 months passed since Ben was turned into a young teenage girl, but despite finding clues of her, Angelica was nowhere to be found, almost as if she left town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's life as a girl caused some problems with his, or should I say her, parents. It started when it was becoming fall again, and he was returning back to school. Gwen and Ben, now Benina, walked into the Tennyson house and it was quite some annoyance.<br>\r\n\"Gwen, what is young girl who looks like Ben doing here? Get her out please.\" Carl who was watching TV asked. Gwen looked around, \"Uncle Carl, where's Aunt Sandra?\" Gwen questioned, especially since she should've been with her husband because of them spending time together. \"she's out with some friends at the mall theater, why?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa Max came in and with Benina and Gwen, told him of why Ben was a girl. \"So, let me get this straight, a Russian blonde woman, named Angelica, a thief who travels the world, set up a bunch of robberies, to \"share\" the gift of femininity with Ben? With BEN?! And, Dad\" (referring to Max), \"You had no reason to put any of this time and effort into telling me, because you didn't say there was anything wrong on the summer vacation you guys were on?\" Carl confusingly asked. \"If I told you, you wouldn't believe me and thought I needed meds.\" Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl turned to his son newly turned daughter, and yet somehow, believed what they said. \"Okay.\" He said slowly, trusting but surely, \"But I reccomend that you stay and wait for Sandra to arrive, if she sees Benina with no explanation, she'll think we're all crazy\", \"We came up with that.\" Said Max.<br>\r\nSandra also was confused with how Ben was a girl, but after some explanation, she could understand more clearly, especially with Vilgax trying to conquer the world. But she didn't just understand, after Gwen and Grandpa Max's work was done and gone, Sandra taught Benina the things of being a girl, especially since this was the last week of summer. She showed her new daughter everything from a hairbrush, makeup, clothing, and bras and thongs. Carl on the other hand, was mixed still, having his child's gender changed hurt him because it was as close to killing someone by damaging the sex. On the other hand, his daughter had a heavily attractive body with her enormous jiggling breasts, and heart shaped butt.<br>\r\nBenina's appearance at first shocked the school, but as days went on, they started flirting with her, and liking her body. Benina was nervous with the amount of guys staring at her, especially since she was once bullied, but now liked a lot more. The knowledge of what girls do, combined with people liking her helped Ben get used to being a young woman. Even Gwen blushed when she noticed her cousin had bigger tits then herself did.<br>\r\nAs the time passed, two major things happened. One was that her room was painted pink, to represent the gender, which took a month and a half. Another was her hair color, because while it was at first brown, slowly turned a red tint to it. Eventually, up to the new time period, her hair completely became a blood red, like Bertha from south park. This gave her the nickname \"Redhead\", as she was gaining a slight increase in popularity. Benina knew one day, she would marry a good man, and have a beautiful baby boy. Her parents noticed her sudden hair change, but that didn't fully bother them because it didn't cause any harm to her. Benina even became friends with his ex-girlfriend Julie, but Julie believed she was a new person, not her ex-boyfriend turned woman. Even the other girls except Gwen thought she was a new person, not an actual boy. <br>\r\nCrime fighting also occurred a little less for Benina, allowing her to finish her lesions with all the knowledge. It almost felt as if being female was becoming good to her, but she knew she would revert back to a man one day......sadly, she was wrong<br>\r\nPlumbers HQ, 7:43, Saturday September 15, 2015.<br>\r\nMax and various other workers were working throughout the two months trying to find a cure to Ben's condition. However, to their horror, they found out the ingredient to changing the gender was a very rare ingredient. It wasn't scary because it was a gender bender, but because the ingredient was so rare, the name of it isn't even known, and it was just about located NOWHERE in the world. Max cried, realizing he failed to get Ben his original life back, but decided to think it was for the best.<br>\r\n\"Ben, I'm afraid we can't reverse the effect. The ingredient is very rare that's located nowhere.\" Gwen was saddened, mainly because this would keep the effect on crime fighting that it almost felt boring (especially with Charmcaster making an appearance), and she wouldn't remember the memories of him being a \"dweeb\" again. Benina only shedded a tear, because her life of being a boy and an average amount of strength gone. Her aliens were still the same, but because some of her strength was removed from her because of the gender change, she is psychically weaker than some of her foes, with exceptions being burglars, Charmcaster, and some male villains, making backup on most villains needed. But the pros with certain things outweighed the cons, but one con was certain parts of clothing, such as panties.<br>\r\nBenina slowly became a slut, but she often did this out of school. Benina couldn't believe how much time had passed since she became a girl and so many changes in life occurred. She told her parents a few days of becoming a slut later of what Max said. Carl and Sandra were sadended for their daughter, but Carl assured everything was going to be okay, \"No man or woman is hurting nor taking my little girl.\" He told her. Benina smiled when she heard him say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile.....<br>\r\nAngelica's HQ, September 26, 8:30 pm, 2015.<br>\r\nAngelica watched through a orb as Carl told her little Benina, \"No man nor woman is hurting nor taking my little girl\" with Benina smiling for her fathers kind and brave words. Angelica smiled, while she was in Russia turning boys into women, or just men into women, and robbery, she never was caught and arrested. Now she watching Benina the whole time, \"So my angelic creation has finally gotten used zo being a boy gifted with femininity? Gorgeous, very good.\" She smiled, her tits jiggling as she bounced slowly up and down. \"Benina, soon, my gorgeous child, we shall remove all filzhy men in zhe world, and everyone shall bow down to you as Empress Benina.\" She said evily and nastily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If anyone wants to know what Benina looks like now, here's a picture of what she'll mostly look like: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.curlhairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1-Girls-Bright-Red-Hair-Photos.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.curlhairstyles.com/wp-content...</a><br>\r\nIt's been 6 months since Benina lost her manhood, and 4 months since her hair became a bright red, almost like blood. It was now December 14, 2015, and she didn't know what she was gonna get for christmas. Although she came up with she would get as a guy, Sandra thought it was a little uncommon for a girl to play video games instead of being a smart cookie and reading books, while Carl just didn't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenina, while she still had the DNA of when she was a boy, sections of it were changing, her bright red hair being the first example.<br>\r\nHer eye color, although kept green, switched to a lighter tone, and the peach in her skin was slowly evaporating as her skin instead became just plain white. Also, her D cup tits developed a little more, and although still loved video games, her love for it was overtime shrinking. She also suffered a headache in October, which through an x-ray, revealed that her brain had become larger, and ever since, her memory was stronger. Her womanhood also was very strong, almost like what was left of her penis was used to give strength to when she carries a child in her womb. Also, unlike the other girls who had to shave their legs, Benina never had to once, it almost made her think that the transformation makes her body refuse to grow any hair other than the pile attached to her scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn November 1st, she suffered her first period, which felt so weird. But that didn't mean it continued, as it quickly stopped shortly after she told her parents. Her parents were confused of how she was having her DNA altered, but despite doctors and the plumbers, there was nothing they could do to prevent strange results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Benina looked at her mirror as she was getting ready for bed and brushed her teeth, despite going through a change of DNA, and the fact she would never be a boy again, she felt as if this was natural despite it not being that at all. She looked at the omnitrix, it looked broken, which was very weird because previous times it looked it was in perfect condition. Now it looked damaged, almost ready to come off, which she hoped wouldn't happen. Benina finished brushing her teeth, before she placed her pink pjs on after removing Navy blue pants and Shirt, which her mother bought constantly for her instead of just getting one new outfit per school day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenina then went to her desk, and reread what she wrote. Shortly after she became female, Benina decided to come up with pros and cons of being a girl and if she was happy to be female, and she could tell she would be for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's what the pros and cons said:<br>\r\nPros- No shaving, can wear old man clothing, emotion works better, more respect, and no more tents in the pants. Stronger memory, and better use of love. Finally, no body hair, but still applies to the no shaving part.<br>\r\nCons- Always sit down on the toilet, weird periods, a lot of makeup, and way too many choices of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen christmas came in, she got the book of Cujo, a dog who is bitten by a rabid bat, and goes insane. She thinks it's a good book and wants to read more horror tales.<br>\r\n\"Hey, cousin, how's being a girl feel?\" Benina's also 16 year old cousin Gwen asked, who was visiting for obvious reasons. \"It's good, REALLY good.\" Benina said, because of her having little to no crime fighting and lots of boys to like, it almost felt like paradise, especially with her emotions working longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the high amount of good things of her being female, Benina had problems such as because she had no penis, she had no control of how much she could hold her urine in before she would wet herself. Sandra was still teaching her to be a girl, and somethings such as that were slowing her down, especially with the makeover she annoyingly had. But that didn't bellow her any downer, as she went high when it came to happiness to her new traits of being loved as someone special because of the incident Angelica left her in. For some strange reason, even though she hated Angelica, Benina was starting to thank her for the transformation, as for the obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter days of winter break and into January, Benina decided to have a boy date her before she would just ignore all boys after going to college which her parents had planned for her. But, this felt out of nowhere, but because she needed to start somewhere, she chose one. And to also make girls for some friends too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica's Lair Dec 27, 2015.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica was starting to enjoy watching Benina accept being a girl, because this could increase her level of males to be perverts and whatnot. She had a feeling in her heart that she would have Benina to follow her rules, and rid the world of ugly men. \"Do not worry, my gorgeous daughter, you'll be empress and unaging Goddess, that soon, you'll rule the world with an iron fist. I know I should be Empress, but because you are the one I shared the gift of femininity I care the most of, I shall make you Empress! I can't wait for that day where you help my cause and finally have only men for labor. You're my creation, and will be my hero....mistress.\" Angelica said with happiness she looked like she was gonna squee in joy.</span></div></div>",

She could see her long hair flowing down her hospital robe, her skinny waist and large hips. But what really caught her attention was her jiggling breasts. They bounced as she moved, shaking in her robe as the cleavage showed. For some reason hers were big. She assumed her DNA was now much more female than she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in the meantime you should stay here, maybe test out and see how this change affects your aliens. Oh, also there's a change of clothes in that bag. We told Gwen about what happened and she picked some clothes out for you\" Max said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwen picking clothes!? Oh great\" Ben said, knowing she wouldn't be able to live this down. She took the bag and headed into the bathroom nearby. Rook was standing by the door. Once Ben opened it she groaned at the thought of wearing what she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door opened Ben came out wearing something quite stunning and flashy compared to her normal outfit as a guy. She sported a Blue top with a pink heart shaped logo in the center of it with designer diamond glitter on the collar and wrists, a long dark blue skirt and red flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, i'm a walking fashion trend\" Ben said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned to look at Rook. Rook simply looked at the boy-turned-girl and said \"if it is any consolation, you are very beautiful\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not helping Rook\" Ben said annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I believe it is customary on earth to compliment a female on her looks\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen simply sighed and walked forward, still annoyed that her breasts kept jiggling. Putting on those clothes was easy up until putting on the skirt. How do girls possibly wear those. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way to the main room where Grandpa Max was, Ben was getting some stares from the males and even male aliens. She was beautiful in their eyes. \"I need to fix this fast\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Ben, there you are\" said Max. \"Oh those clothes look good on you\" he said complimenting her. \"Please Grandpa Max, just stop...\" Ben said really not liking this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sport, we'll fix this problem up. But for the time being, you'll need to have a new name to fit your gender\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was angry at this and shouted in her light but furious voice \"WHAAT\"! \"Now don't worry, its not such a big change, just need to give you another name while you are a girl\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen folded her arms across her large chest and said \"fine\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...</span></div></div>",

She hated the name, but supposed there was no other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph\" Benina quickly turned her head in the opposite direction and flared her long hair as she proceeded to walk towards the hallway of the plumber base in a very stuck up way, hips flaring, breasts jiggling and flats pitter pattering on the floors unbenownst to benina herself. She seemed more and more female by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRook followed behind her. He had to admit, Ben in his current form was beautiful as strange as it was to say, more so than the average adolescent female. He noticed something out of the corner of his eye. Benina's hair seemed to be growing more and more until it reached down to her butt, while her butt was swelling and becoming rounder as well, pushing against the skirt. Walking beside Ben Rook said \"Do you not assume the female DNA in your system is growing more rampant by the minute?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenina simply said \"what are you talking about\" in her light but serious voice, clearly not aware of her hair growing. Rook decided not to bring up the subject. Perhaps it was a delayed side effect and not something to pay attention to. \"Never mind\" he answered her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen hated the hair constantly getting in his face. \"How do girls stand having so much hair UGH\" Ben shouted. \"As i said, your female DNA has taken whole and is rapidly spreading\" Rook said. Ben decided to note what Rook said since it seemed to be true.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wondered how he was gonna explain this to his parents.

She caught sight of a slight movement and turned to see Starfire standing there. In a new, very soft and feminine voice, she asked, \u201cStarfire? I am in your dimension? How did I get here and why am I a girl dressed like you?\u201d Indeed, Ben was now dressed in heels, long leggings to her thighs, a mini skirt, bare midriff, and a halter top that supported the fledgling breasts of a young woman. All that and hair so long it stopped just above her butt-crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire giggled, \u201cAs to how you got there, that was thanks to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned to see Raven, and with her was, \u201cGwen! You are here too?\u201d She noticed that Gwen was now dressed in what Ben would have called a sexy outfit until now. She noticed that Gwen also had a magic crystal set into her forehead of the same fashion as Raven. \u201cWhat is going on here? Why did you bring us and why did you make me a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire giggled again, \u201cWell, to answer why\u2026\u201d She showed Ben and Gwen a vid of a battle that was on another planet. The battle was between an army that was all female, and the Teen Titans. The battle did not go well for the Titans in general. The girls seemed okay, but the guys were quickly weakening. They watched in horror as Robin and Beast Boy were knocked out and captured! In the end, Starfire and Raven did the only thing they could do, which was grab Cyborg and Speedy and retreat back to space and then to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the vid was over, Starfire contented, \u201cThe planet you saw is ruled by the Empress Prowess. She has enveloped the entire planet that causes males to become weak, and eventually totally submissive to females, especially when they are bonded. When that happens, they will be irreversibly in love with the first female they come in contact with. We thought it would only effect males from that planet, but as you saw, it is not so.\u201d She sighed, \u201cRaven and I were not affected, but there were too many of the for us. We had to retreat. Cyborg was affected more slowly because of his cybernetics, but he was affected, and even now is still in medical being treated for the effects.\u201d She finished, \u201cProwess is now beginning to project this energy field toward other planets. If we don\u2019t stop her, she will take over many worlds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Gwen\u2019s turn now, \u201cOkay, I can see why I am here, but why Ben, and why do we look like your little sisters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven answered, \u201cWe needed both of your abilities, plus your fighting experience. However, for Ben, he needed to become a female if he is to help, and we need his, um, her skills. Also, whatever she is doing is effecting my power. The only way I could bring you here was to bond each of your essences to one of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked shocked, \u201cYou bonded our essences?\u201d Raven nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ben could ask why Gwen was shocked, Starfire continued, \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time to rescue Robin and Beast Boy. When the energy level builds up enough, Prowess will select mates for Robin and Beast Boy. Once bonded, they will do anything their mistresses ask. We need to leave as soon as the two of you are trained enough in the use of your new powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said, \u201cYou mean to tell me I am stuck like this until we rescue the boys?\u201d She sighed, \u201cOkay, what next?\u201d</span></div></div>",

First, since you are not from around here, and we don\u2019t want anyone to suspect that you are from another dimension, we need to give you new names to go by. Raven said I could pick.\u201d Raven rolled her eyes knowing what was coming. \u201cGwen, you are a magical being now, so we will call you Pixie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed but accepted it, \u201cAnd Ben, you are now my little sister, and in my family you must follow star based names that have not been used. So, from now on, you are Twinkle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen squealed in her newly feminine voice, \u201cWhat? No way! That sounds so, so, I don\u2019t know. Like I need a diaper or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven groaned at her, \u201cGive it up Twinkle. She is like a brick wall when she gets like that about something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Twinkle was stuttering when Starfire clapped her hands and said, \u201cWonderful!\u201d She hugged Ben/Twinkle, \u201cIt will be so wonderful to have a baby sister to teach things to! Come! We must start your flight training right away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Twinkle was used to \u2018alien\u2019 bodies, but she was in this new female body longer now than the average time that she spent in one of her transformations. So walking in a miniskirt and thick sole boots with somewhat high heels, feeling her breasts bounce, and even the long hair swishing around her body as she walked was different and annoying. She avoided even thinking about what was between her legs now, though she had to admit, the panties she was wearing were very comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the hanger deck and Starfire turned and said, \u201cOkay Sis! This is your first lesson. All of your powers are based on, and controlled by, emotions. So in order to fly, you have to be able to think of something happy.\u201d With that, she floated into the air. \u201cNow you try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Twinkle groaned, \u201cThink happy thoughts? Sheesh! It sounds like Peter Pan!\u201d She sighed, \u201cOf course, I feel like Peter Pan in this body.\u201d She closed her eyes, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Starfilre said, \u201cWhat is wrong Twinkle? Flying is easy really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Twinkle shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought about smashing Vilgax, about playing Sumo Slammers, even smashing stuff as Humungousaur, but nothing happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire giggled, \u201cThose are violent thoughts and emotions. You need something light and happy. Think about someone you love, or something love to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Twinkle was frustrated, \u201cThose are things I loved to do! But okay, I will try.\u201d It still took a long time, but finally, she began to float! \u201cAt last! This is cool!\u201d She actually giggled, \u201cThinking of smoothies did it!\u201d Starfire taught her how to control it, and she laughed, \u201cThis is great! It almost makes it worth begin a girl to be able to fly like this at will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched down lightly by Starfire, \u201cThere is only one thing. You said thinking of someone I cared for would help, but when I thought of Julie, nothing happened. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire looked a bit nervous, \u201cWell, um, since you were patterned after me, and, well, since I like boys\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Twinkle stared at her. Now she realized that when she was thinking of Julie, it was not the same as it had been, and that is why it did not work. To Starfire\u2019s relief, she only did a face palm and said, \u201cCould we get on with this? The sooner we accomplish this mission, the sooner my life gets back to normal.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I think I need to pee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did go into the bathroom, she was dismayed to realize that, as long as she was in this body, she would have no choice but to sit down to pee. It felt very odd to her, and she found it a bit disgusting to need to wipe when she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was washing her hands though, she saw herself in the mirror for the first time, and she was stunned. She could see her old face in there, but as a girl, she was very pretty! She saw something wrong with her hair and began to fuss with that. She did not know it yet, but she had also picked up Starfire\u2019s personal tastes and concern for her looks. That would be evident soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back, Starfire said, \u201cI think you are tired as well. Since you need to be able to concentrate, let\u2019s switch to a different kind of training.\u201d She took Ben\u2019Twinkle into what would be her quarters, \u201cHere is your makeup. I need to show you how to apply it and remove it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Twinkle said, \u201cNo way! I will not wear makeup!\u201d Of course, Starfire as persistent, and got Ben/Twinkle to agree to just try some basic makeup. It made such a difference, and Ben/Twinkle was so pleased with the result, that she did not even realize how much time they spent. But when they were done, Ben/Twinkle\u2019s look was even more feminine than before, and it did not even phase her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more training, where Ben/Twinkle got a good start on her bolts and discovered her inherent super-strength, both Starfire and Raven called a halt for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven said, \u201cThey have learned a lot, but they must relax now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire clapped, \u201cGoodie! Let\u2019s change and go out for pizza!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Twinkle looked shocked, \u201cYou mean go out in public like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls giggled, and it was Gwen that said, \u201cYou will need to eventually, but I think she means for us to change into civilian clothes.\u201d Ben/Twinkle was not very pleased to find out that meant a dress for her, but when she saw how pretty it looked on her, she did not complain, and what she did do was just so the others would not know how much she was liking this.</span></div></div>",

She had thought it out, and before the others could answer for her, she said, \u201cMy name is Amber. It is nice to meet you Andre.\u201d The others were shocked, but she wanted a girls name that was normal, not what they might give!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now Amber/Ben was the center of Andre\u2019s attention. And being fused so much with Starfire\u2019s personality, we found herself very comfortable with Andre, and without realizing it, she was more and more attracted to him! So when he asked her to dance, she did not even hesitate to say yes! She found that she especially loved the slow dances with Andre, and was disappointed when Gwen cut in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was separated from Andre, Starfire said, \u201cBen, er, Amber, be careful! You are new to this body, and to being female! You are quite vulnerable right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber/Ben giggled, sounding very much like Starfire, \u201cVulnerable? From him?

I would like to talk with Amber.\u201d Neither of them waited for an answer, and Andre led Amber/Ben to a private room. He looked down at her and said, \u201cAmber, you are so beautiful! It is hard to believe that it is happening, but I believe I am falling in love with you!\u201d And with that he took her in his arms and began to kiss her passionately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time there was no resistance at all from Amber/Ben. She wrapped her arms around his neck and held him tight! They made out a long time, and things got very hot between them! Amber/Ben was liking the feelings that Andre was causing in her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore things had a chance to go too far, there was a loud knock on the door.

So what is the harm if she falls in love as a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were abashed that Gwen knew what happened, \u201cGwen, we are sorry! We were desperate! We couldn\u2019t think of another way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen shook her head, \u201cI am no so sure, but it is done now. And Ben seems to be taking on both your femininity and your physical attraction to males Starfire. We can\u2019t treat her like a guy that is starting to like girls.

Of course!\" He took her hand and she was happy to let him lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got there, Ben/Starbeam said, \"There are some things about me that you should know.\" It was hard, but she told him about who she used to be, and how she was transformed into a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeedy looked concerned, \"So, you will go back to being Ben when this is over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him, \"In a way, that is up to you Speedy. I don't care what Gwen, or Starfire or anyone says. I love you! I want to stay Amber and Starbeam. I want to be your girl, and someday your wife.\" She began to tear up, \"But I also know I must return to my world. I want to do it as I am, but, if I do, will you come with me. Your world is full of super heroes, but mine isn't. They need me. If you will come with me, I will stay as a female for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her in his arms, \"There is nothing that could keep me from following you!\" And he kissed her passionately! Neither of them knew it, but because of the machine they had been trapped in together, every moment of physical contact deepened their love, and though Ben did not realize it yet, it was deepening a need inside of her to bear Speedy's children some day. By the time Gwen came looking for Ben, it was too late, things were locked between the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen found them, \"What are you two doing? Ben! Get away from him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Starbeam stepped forward and said, \"No Gwen! I will not. I am staying like this. Staying female. You may call me Amber or Starbeam, but I am not Ben any more! I love Speedy, and he loves me, and nothing you can say or do will change that, so you might as well get used to it. He will be coming home with us, and when I am old enough, I will become his wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen's jaw dropped, but she could tell her cousin was serious! She just walked away numbly to tell the others about this new development. One thing did cross her mind. There would be no need now to tell Ben that she was stuck as a female for the rest of her life. Since she decided to stay as Amber, that no longer mattered anyhow. What should they do now though?</span></div></div>",

It worked, until Raven was able to contact Gwen through a trans-dimensional portal, and Ben, Rook, Gwen and Kevin were off to the rescue. Blackfire gave Ben and Kevin a rough time until Gwen was able to get Starfire to realize what was happening and get her to focus her emotions again. Only her powers could cancel out Blackfire\u2019s long enough to let the guys subdue her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was in the form of Four-arms, trying to hit Blackfire when Starfire joined the battle. She tried attacking her sister with beams of energy from her eyes. Unfortunately, Ben swung at Blackfire at just the wrong moment. The beam from Starfire hit the Omnitrix full on.There was a tremendous feedback of energy and a green feedback bounced back and forth between the Omnitrix and Starfire until there was a huge explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it happened, Ben found himself flung hundreds of feet, through a door and into a passageway. Gwen was able to block it, but seeing her cousin flung away, she followed as quickly as she could. When she found Ben, she could not believe her eyes. She was glad to see Ben, as Four-arms, survived the blast. But as the Omitrix changed him back, while he was still dressed as Ben was before, it was not Ben\u2019s form that he was wearing, but that of Starfire! His, or now her, female assets were very plain to see, as was her incredibly long hair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shocked girl looked up at Gwen, then cupped a breast, confirming to herself that it was real. She said, \u201cGwen? What is going on? Why am I like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gwen could answer, she was enveloped by an energy burst from Blackfire and knocked out. When she came to again, she saw Ben standing over her. She smiled. It must be okay again. Then she realized that the Ben standing over her with a concerned look was dressed in s purple halter top, a purple mini-skirt and long purple stocking and high heels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He was in a strange place, and tied up. There was much more though. He was gagged, but he tried to scream as he looked down and saw two large breasts sticking out of his chest! As he struggled, he could feel the weakness of his body, and that something important was missing between his legs! A lock of long, red hair fell in front of his eyes. Red hair? For some reason, it was hard to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think more, he saw Blackfire walk up, \u201cAh, you are finally awake sister! And don\u2019t bother to try to use your powers, that little earring you are wearing will inhibit your mental functions enough to prevent you from being able to concentrate on any one thing long enough to be useful. Well, there are exceptions, but you will learn about those.\u201d She picked at Ben\u2019s shirt, \u201cWhat ever happened to you on that planet that you started dressing like this? It is horrid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tried to speak, but could not make himself heard, or, well, herself, since she now realized who\u2019s body she was in and a little more of what was happening, though she had no idea how she got into Starfire\u2019s body! Her words were hopelessly garbled by the gag though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackfire continued, \u201cAt last my dear sister, you will fulfill your destiny and bring peace to Tamaran by honoring the agreement with Okaara. When you are their slave, I will be made Queen of Tarmaran.\u201d She laughed, \u201cIt is a shame you have been married before As a virgin bride you might have bought me even more. However, I am well pleased to think of you in harem of an Okaaran prince. I wonder if he will condition you for a sex slave? Or perhaps send you to be bred by his choice captains?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed wickedly as Ben tried desperately to say, \u201cI am not Starfire!\u201d. Blackfire continued, \u201cI also love that little device you were wearing.\u201d To Ben\u2019s shock, she held up the Omnitrix! \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what I made in selling this.\u201d Ben struggled violently! Darfire shook her head, \u201cI can see I will have to up your settings.\u201d She played with a dial on a device she carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ben could not focus at all. She was a girl. Well, yes, she should be right. No? Why not. Starfire smiled, \u201cYou are calm and want to obey.\u201d Ben\u2019s struggles suddenly ceased. She could not focus on anything but those words. Calm and obey. \u201cGood girl. From now on you will not speak unless spoken to, and even then you will not say more than needed to answer or do what you need to do as a slave. You will not struggle and you will not try to escape. You will obey me calmly and instantly. Most of all for when you get to you new home. If a man want to take you, you will not resist, but try to please him. Obey that most of all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words passed into Ben\u2019s ears and on to her confused brain. They sank in deeply thanks to the brainwashing earring Darkfire had put on her. Darfire smiled, \u201cGood. Very good. Now, I will untie you and you will not move until I tell you.\u201d She did as told, and when she was untied, she was told to stand up, and without thinking, she did as she was told. \u201cNow, dear sister. As a slave you will need to dress better. Put these on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen undressed and put on the mini-skirt and sexy top she was handed. She was humiliated, but what could be next?</span></div></div>",

He looked up and saw the bounty hunter aiming, then saw that he was aiming at Gwen! There was no time to think, he yelled, \"Gwen! Look out!\" It made the hunter flinch just a second, long enough for Ben to jump in the way! Instead of hitting Ben full on, the beam hit the Omitrix. The force sent Ben flying and dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Rook showed up, and catching the bounty hunter off guard, he used the Null Void projector to send him where he would not be anymore trouble to them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRook ran over to Ben, \"Ben! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled, \"I had him on the ropes, but thanks Rook.\" He stood up a bit shaky, \"Let's see to Kevin though.\" He went to deactivate the Omitrix, but it began to spark and arc with green energy. They heard it say, \"Error. Damage to default DNA. Reevaluating. Closest match selected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had no idea what that meant, at least not until Ben began to transform, and when it was done, instead of the usual Ben standing there, Rook saw a small, slim, girl with long blonde hair, wearing a pink top, very short white shorts, and sandals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her, \"Ben? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up at him, \"Of course it is\u2026.\" Her voice faded as she heard it. She looked down at herself.

Ben is a girl!\" Gwen slapped him. \"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen walked up to Ben and checked under the hair on the back of his, well, her neck. \"Well, at least you are not a Unitrix like the real Eunice. That could get very awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen squeaked, \"Awkward! You don't call this awkward?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen crossed her arms, \"Being a girl is not awkward! And with all the forms you have taken over the years, what is the problem with being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen whined, \"Nothing I guess, if it was as temporary as the rest of my alien forms. But this is what I change BACK to now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to get back by transforming into different aliens, then going back, but not only did she always revert to the form of Eunice, but her aliens were the female versions, where you could tell at least. She groaned, \"I have got to find Azmuth! I can't live like this! There has to be a way to change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Ben, Azmuth liked his privacy, so he was not easy to locate. It took three months, during which time Ben learned what is is like for a girl to have her period, increasing her desire to get back to her male form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally got to him, Azmuth was as shocked as anyone at the sight of Ben. \"Most unusual. Apparently it missed the sample of your DNA and made the same extrapolation that the Unitrix did for Eunice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen almost screamed, \"I don't care how it happened! Fix it and change me back the way I was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth looked at her and said...</span></div></div>",

If I had been there, I might have been able to fix things, but it is too late. This is permanent.\" He studied Ben, \"You might want to consider a new name. I understand human names are usually gender based?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed in frustration! \"I don't want a new name! I want my old body!\" She was temped to smash Azmuth, but was able to fight that down. The truth was she was scared. Not of her body, but of the feelings it was giving her. She was starting to be attracted to males, and even Gwen noticed a more feminine bent to her personality lately. She was changing in ways she could not control, and that scared her more than anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quiet going back. After two days, Gwen knew she had to say something. \"Ben, I am sorry this happened. It was my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at Gwen, \"No. It just happened. It could have happened other time in other ways, but it happened.\" She sighed, \"And, well, you might as well start calling me Erin. Erin Amanda Tennyson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was a bit stunned, \"It sound, um, pretty, but why Erin Amanda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Erin shrugged, \"I programmed the computer to come up with a random first and last name that was possible around the time and place I was born. We don't pick our own names really you know. So to make sure there was no going back, I had it automatically change my name to whatever it came up with in all Plumber records. So I am now officially Erin.\" She sighed, \"It kinda fits you know. I think I kind of look like and Erin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen hugged her, \"Erin is a great name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to earth, Ben/Erin surprised Gwen even further. When they were alone, she asked Gwen, \"Gwen, since I am a girl for good, I might as well learn how to look good as one. Could you go shopping with me? I will need to learn about makeup, and, well, I might as well get used to wearing skirts sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Gwen agreed, but she was worried that Ben/Erin was going to easy on the girly stuff. Was she giving up, or was it part of the change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Erin did buy makeup and several skirts and dresses as well as a very feminine wardrobe. Since her changed was caused in the line of duty, her huge tab was picked up by the Plumbers, so she seemed to go all out, even buying various high heel shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to Plumber headquarters, she called Azmuth and told him about Ben/Erin. Then she asked, \"Is this Ben giving up, or is it part of the change in her body?\"</span></div></div>",

You must find a way to help her fight it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded. \u201cI have a feeling that won\u2019t be easy, but I will do my best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Ben\u2019Erin in her apartment on the base, going through her new outfits. \u201cWhat are you doing Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned at Gwen, \u201cI told you I am Erin now. And I am just looking at my pretty things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen hated what she did next, the skirt was so nice, but when Ben/Erin held it up, she let fly a burst of magic that instantly evaporated it into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Erin looked at her in shock! \u201cWhat did you do that for?

And who do you think you are kidding? Look at me! I am weak and feminine now!\u201d She picked up a blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen destroyed the blouse, \u201cThere is nothing wrong with being feminine when you are a female, not if it at the right time for the right reason, but you are more than that! I will call you Erin when you can handle this!\u201d She fired a bolt of energy at Ben/Erin that knocked her into the wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Erin yelled, \u201cHey! That hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen scowled, \u201cNot as much as this!\u201d She fired another bolt! Ben/Erin jumped in time to avoid the full force of the blast, but not soon enough to avoid being thrown across the room. Gwen fired again, and this time Ben/Erin jumped in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen/Erin said, \u201cStop it Gwen! Don\u2019t make me hurt you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sneered, \u201cWhat? A girly-girl like you is going to hurt me? Good luck with that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Ben/Erin screamed in furry and used the Omnitrix to turn into a female version of Four-arms! She dove at Gwen, who just barely managed to dodge her blow. She threw up a shield, which Ben/Erin pounded and pounded in her fury! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of this, Gwen was too exhausted to maintain the shield, and Ben/Erin smashed through! She grabbed Gwen with one hand and pulled back to smash her to pieces, then realized what she was doing. She held Gwen in two arms while clearing off the bed to make room for her. As the transformed back into Erin, she was in tears, \u201cOh Gwen! I am so sorry! Can you forgive me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled weakly up at Ben/Erin, \u201cYou are hard to get through to, but did I prove my point Erin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin/Ben smiled, (and yes, the reversal is intentional), \u201cYeah, I get it. Being a girl might make me softer, but only I can make myself weaker.\u201d She sighed, \u201cBut if I cannot be Ben, and I am not some soft, feminine doll of a thing, who is Erin? What is she supposed to be like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sat up and hugged her, \u201cI don\u2019t know. That is for you to decide. I think you will learn over time. What I do know is that Erin can be every bit the hero Ben ever was. I am sure of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed Erin/Ben away, \u201cOnly one thing. I saw the way Kevin was looking at you. Keep your pretty paws off of my man, or we will go through this battle again!\u201d She ducked the swing Erin/Ben threw at her with a laugh.</span></div></div>",

But in the mean time, she could cause you a lot of problems, and there could be residual effects mentally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax asked, \"Is there anything we can do to prevent that, or control it at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth shook his head, \"We can't prevent it. The most you can do to control it is to keep her close to females that will be a positive influence, and make her aware of the changes she is making until she learns to control it.\" He was fiddling at some kind of console. \"The interesting thing is, she may eventually be able to tap the aliens in the Omnitrix instinctively. She will be able to use any alien in the device, and possibly combinations of them, to suite whatever situation she is in, without going through the manual selection process. But that will not happen until she learns to control herself first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax said, \"You are not helping Azmuth. How long before she can control it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, \"I cannot tell. There are too many variables, not the least of which is not knowing what is going on inside of her head. I can only tell you she will adapt automatically, and for a while, she will not even realize it.\" A light blinked on his console. \"I am busy and I have an experiment running. Goodbye!\" And the screen went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax looked at Gwen, \"You better spend as much time as you can with Erin (Ben).

Fortunately, after years of working with Ben, who had often gone off on his own, she had mastered a good tracking spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt led her out of town and close to a farm. In the field she found a spaceship that looked familiar. Again using her magic to open the door, she went in. The fourth room she checked she found Erin/Ben in a passionate embrace. A bit too passionate for her as she could tell the man's hand was actively moving up Erin's skirt! He was also constantly whispering something into her ear. At first she couldn't see him well enough because of Erin, who now looked like their friend Carol. Then she saw, and she yelled, \"Gyula!!! What are you doing with my cousin!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Gyula smiled, \"Nothing she doesn't want me to do my dear Gwen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stormed over, \"Like hell! I don't know how you found out, but somehow, you knew she was in a weakened, suggestible state!\" She grabbed Erin/Ben's arm and pulled her onto her feet. All of this was confusing her. \"Come on Erin! This guy just wants to use you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin/Ben was clearly, well, stimulated. However, she was also feeling some clearing in her head, \"Gwen?\" She looked around, \"How did I get here?\" Then she sighed, \"Princess, queen, mother, babies, heirs, Gyula!\" She turned toward him. \"You wanted to make me your sex slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyula grinned, \"And what better slave than the famous Ben Tennyson turned girl? Tell me you didn't enjoy my touches my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin/Ben's mind was clearing more, \"Oh, I will tell you something alright.\" She made the omnitrix visible, made a selection, and in moments, she was a female version of Four-arms! She grabbed Gyula with two powerful hands and said, \"Try this on for enjoyment.\" She rapidly punched him in a number of places, then kicked him hard across the room. He slammed into the wall and was unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin/Ben looked at Gwen as she changed back to her human form, \"Thanks for pulling me out of that Gwen! I shudder to think how far that might have gone.\" She did shudder, \"Why are guys always after my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, \"You tell me. You were male until now.\" She paused, \"Though I have to admit, though you were an obnoxious jerk at times, you never treated girls like that.\" She paused, \"You seem to be more of yourself now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin/Ben nodded, \"I feel more in control, but some things are hard to shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked concerned, \"Oh? Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin/Ben blushed, \"Nothing for you to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen let it go, \"Well, let's get back to Plumber headquarters. Something is not right. I want to know how Gyula knew you were vulnerable.\" She rejected Erin/Ben's offer to go back and beat it out of him.</span></div></div>",

They had found the pod a little while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not magical, because I'm not feeling anything from it,\" Gwen said, running her own examination of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omnitrix scan the pod,\" Ben said, and the Omnitrix let lose a beam of light that began to scan the pod and when it was finished scanning it it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Scan complete. Created by unknown species,\"</b> The Omnitrix announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey knew for a fact just by looking at it that it was indeed alien, the pod wasn't made in any familiar design to any species that the Plumbers were familiar, and maybe even Azmuth if the Omnitrix if didn't know what species it was. Unknown to any of them the reason why the Omnitrix was didn't know what species was, was because the pod didn't come from any of the nearby planets, universes, or even any nearby galaxies, but actually from a different reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grabbed the pod and lifted up to get a closer look.The bottom of the Omnitrix rubbed against the pod, and the pod began to let loose a low hum, that surprised them. The crystals lit up and the pod opened revealing a black skull on it with yellow running across it. The skull let loose a small wave of energy that hit Ben and the Omnitrix as it opened up, causing green electricity to spark off of the Omnitrix as he was sent flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed on the ground hard and groaned. The last thing that he heard was Kevin and Gwen yelling. \"Ben!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Is it a fast or Slow Change?)</span></div></div>",

A bipedal human-shaped form. He didn't have time to really look at it though before the Omnitrix let off a blinding flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations Ben felt, they were the same, yet slightly different from when he usually transforms. Most transformations were, in his own description, like a good stretch. But this wasn't just some kind of good stretch, this was actually orgasmic, Ben was getting sexual pleasure from whatever was happening to him, whatever he was turning into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light dissipated about as quickly as it had appeared. What stood before Gwen and Kevin was about as far from either of their expectations as it possibly could have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had transformed into a beautiful, curvaceous woman. He, or rather she, had his normal face, but it was rounder, more feminine. His hair had lengthened, becoming long and wavy, reaching just past her shoulder blades. His normal clothes had been replaced with a revealing, overly-feminine superhero suit, a tight black midriff-baring top that ended just below her breasts, with long sleeves along with a matching black miniskirt, a bright green cape, and green thigh-high boots. The Omnitrix had relocated to her chest, resembling the emblem of a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Gwen were dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow...\" uttered Kevin, blushing, needing to remind himself that that's still Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben...\" Gwen said, concerned. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Ben could do was stare down at her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking much of it, Ben slid her right hand down her clothed chest, then her smooth bare midsection, all the way down to her skirt, waving with her cape in the breeze. She couldn't explain it, she was somewhat frightened, but at the same time, excited, she'd never been a girl before, and besides, the Omnitrix would have to time out eventually.</span></div></div>",

Let's see what else this girl can do~\" Ben announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen turned to Kevin. \"Doesn't it seem like he's enjoying this more than he should? The Omnitrix never swapped his gender when he went alien before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the Omnitrix is broken. This seems like something we should really ask Azmuth about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a red beam of plasma cut the top off of a nearby tree, which fell down right on top of Gwen and Kevin, them being protected when Gwen summoned a force-field just in time, splintering the tree on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got laser eyes!\" Ben yelled excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben!\" Gwen furiously shouted \"Stop messing around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" said Ben as he landed beside them, picking up the humongous pieces of wood with no problem and chucking them in a pile by the rest of the tree it was cut from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's flying, laser vision, and super strength!\" Ben could feel that she had way more powers than that, she was at the most powerful she'd ever felt in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben, aren't you in the least bit curious why the Omnitrix turned you into a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the universe is huge, there's bound to be some species somewhere that only has one sex. And look just like humans. Probably. It's a possibility. Okay, yeah, I'm curious. We should see Azmuth about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, the trio were boarding the Rust Bucket 3 when Gwen turned around to address Ben about a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben? Shouldn't you have timed out forever ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen hadn't even thought of that. She looked down at the Omnitrix on her chest, tapping on it with her finger as though she thought that would get a response. Her curiosity turned to legitimate worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, really forever ago! Oh no...\" She was now panicking at this point. Gwen took her by the shoulders and led her the rest of the way into the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Azmuth will fix it.\"</span></div></div>",

She ran her hand along the fabric of her skirt again, then became consumed by curiosity. She looked in front of her at Gwen, then at Kevin, to make sure nobody was looking before lifting up her skirt to reveal a lack of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately covered herself back up before Gwen turned her head around to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Ben?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. Just know that we're here for you if you need to talk about anything though.\" Gwen was trying to sympathize with Ben as much as she could, well aware that Azmuth might not know what's wrong with the Omnitrix, it's an issue nobody thought they would ever be in. Ben decided to take Gwen up on her offer, she did need to talk about that. She looked up quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwen, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the seat in front of her had disappeared, leaving Gwen completely visible from behind to her. She turned around to address her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ben?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Gwen's clothes disappeared. Ben looked all around the cockpit, trying to make it seem like she's looking at everything except her own cousin, seeing the outer layer of everything disappear, from the exterior of the control module, revealing the bells and whistles inside, to the hull of the ship revealing outer space around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think I have X-Ray vision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's cool.\" Gwen said nonchalantly, turning back around in her seat. \"We're almost at Galvan Prime by the way, so everything will be fixed soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Gwen was no longer looking, Ben returned her gaze to her, basking in the glory of Gwen's nude body, unable to take her eyes off of her heart-shaped ass for the remainder of the trip, only looking away as they finally began to descend through Galvan Prime's atmosphere.</span></div></div>",

Cables and wires were sticking out of the edges of the Omnitrix, plugging it into a diagnostic computer. Lines of code were scrolling up past the screen revealing details about Ben's current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally this would be a very easy fix\" Azmuth said. \"The Omnitrix swapping the sex of your forms would be the result of a simple glitch, the Omnitrix simply confusing a one for a zero, or a zero for a one, but it's your current Alien form that's the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What even am I?\" Ben asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no species I've ever seen before. You look exactly like a human, but your power levels are far beyond any bipedal sentient species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth turned his attention back to the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your readings are beyond any recorded species. With readings like these, you're infinitely faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, and that seems to be just scratching the surface. Although many Galvan scholars may object, your readings indicate that you could best a Saiyan warrior in battle with ease. The reason the Omnitrix cannot change you back is, if my theory is correct, because your current DNA is simply too powerful to be overwritten by your original DNA, or the DNA of any known species. The Omnitrix' microcomputer simply isn't powerful enough to do it, and in all of my years, I have never even come close to seeing that happen. I'm sorry, young Tennyson, but you may never transform again...\"</span></div></div>",
