Their Pokemon were with them, and were wandering with them. \"Har har.\" grumbled Misty, scratching at her new scales furiously \"These things are really itchy.\" Lily (the Pokemon magician who was now a Mismagius and had been affected by the spell that had brought them there in these forms) appeared. \"I think there's something up ahead!\" she said. <br>\r\nThey hurried to a forest clearing, and found... </span></div></div>",

The Growlithe was struggling less... and suddenly lunged at them, bellowing \"THE MASTER SHALL HAVE HIS VENGEANCE!!!\" He ran off, then, rushing towards the edge of town.

Pokemon are being attacked by these wierd miasmas, and are transforming into strange, dark versions of themselves.\" Ash recalled that the Growlithe had looked quite different after lunging out of the miasma. \"So where'd that Growlithe head?\" said Misty. \"I'm pretty sure he was heading towards the Relic Stone, which is said to be a gateway to the dimension of the Legendary Pokemon. Come to think of it, a lot of Shadow Pokemon have been heading there. Speaking of which...\" with that, the old Manectric rushed off in the direction the Growlithe had gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He decided to rush off after Manectric without his friends it seemed, since he didn't see them running behind him. \" Wait up Manectric!!!\" Ash cried it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * * *<br>\r\n\" Looks like you decided to join me..\" The Manectric grinned, knowing that Ash followed the ol' electric pokemon. \" Well... I need to figure out something...\" Ash shrugged his shoulders, with his eyes closed. The Manectric looked up and then to the cave entrance. \"This is gonna be dangerous kid, so you are gonna watch my back and I'll watch yours...\" Ash Nodded. \" Ok... uh..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Name's Kooler.\" The Manectric finished. Ash thought that didn't fit with him, but didn't judge him. \" Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alright, Follow me and you won't get harmed.\" Kooler then instantly walked toward the entrance, which Ash still got the goosebumps. \" Geez, it's hecka dark in here..\" Ash shivered, it is cold in the room. \" Do you even know Flash kid?\" The Manectric seemed confused. Ash couldn't tell them he was a human... or he doesn't know it, so what? But the result was that Kooler decides to use Flash on his own. \" I guess I'll teach you it when we're done.\" Ash took a breath, it was a close call. But it didn't matter, he has to figure out what happened to that Growlithe and why he was filled with dark aura. He continued on to the dripping cave filled with sharp points on the walls and ceilings which now gave Ash even more the creeps. \" This cave used to be a great place to explore, but now is a forbidden place.. thanks to this Lugia..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia huh?\" Ash mumbled. Kooler shooked his head. \" He is control by the darkness now.. We could never find a rescue team that could stop them.. It even says that a human could take him.. pfft what a stupid solution.\" Kooler chuckled lightly. Ash still looked crestfallen... A human huh? \" Shh, be quiet... hear that?\" Kooler shushed Ash's mouth for the sound of a crying wail coming from the upcoming path the two pokemon had been following. Ash's eyes were wide as the wailing became more angered. Kooler eyes squinted like he knew something's coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alright kid, be quiet and move but don't make a sound.\" Kooler whispered, and slowly tiptoed toward the route. Ash did too but did it more slowly than Kooler. \" Come on kid, do it a little faster!\" Ash now got annoyed. \" What am i suppose to do! I'm keeping quiet!\" He whimpered softly. Kooler sighed. \" Just do it a little quicker.. there's nothing here that can be 'that' noisy!\" Ash actually realized it now, there is nothing here that can be loud. Ash grins and walks faster toward the Manectric. \" Ok Good, we're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokemon successfully got to the another doorway, but now it seemed to be a room with a puddle of lava. \"I would've expected that shadow pokemon to come here, this is where Moltres lives.\" Kooler took a step forward to recognize something was keeping an eye on them. \" Hey kid, what's your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" K Ash, How about you...GET OUT OF HERE!\" The Shadow leaped up and took Kooler to the ground, The manectric squirmed and bit the thighs to stun him. \"DID YOU HEAR ME, GET OUT OF HERE!\" Ash couldn't move and sped out of the room.</b><i> What happened? Kooler is in trouble, but I'm a human...</i><b> \" You just need a little help on the power is all.\" A female voice started to sound out through Ash' Ears and got a glimpse of a Kirlia coming forth toward him.. \" Hey Your a Kirlia..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah.\" The Kirlia said. \" And i can help you realize your power.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You mean you know I'm a human?\" Ash replied. The Kirlia nods, \" Now I'll give you this.\" She putted a bright-blue silver medallion around his neck.\" What this you may ask? It deflects Shadow Pokemon, It will work only for you. Shadow Pokemon can't put it on. If you and the enemy clash, the darkness will come out of the body he possesses.\" She shut her eyes, explaining it's power. \" Now I wish you luck my friend.\" Petals shot through her and she teleported her way out, Leaving Ash with eyes blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I better go back and help Kooler out before it gets any worse.\" Ash planned then sprinted back to the room to help a new pal of his.</b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the darkness, Ash soon encountered Kooler, who was reluctantly attempting to attack a group of Pokemon dressed in purple sashes (he had evidently been taken by the shadows). The Pokemon in purple sashes had obviously just come from Moltres's lair, as they appeared to be a bit singed. The Pokemon in question were a Roserade with blue hair, a Persian with a red streak of fur, a nerdy-looking Wobbuffett, and a Meowth, who was clearly attempting to talk Kooler out of attacking them. Ash lunged at Kooler, shocking him with Volt Tackle. Kooler collapsed, revealing a sinister version of the Manectric where Kooler had stood. The dark parts of its fur were purple, and the light parts were grey. It's eyes glowed red, ebony claws stuck out from the Manectric's paws, and a look of rage, sadism, and hatred were on its face. The shadow Manectric bellowed in anger, then lunged at Ash. Ash dodged, then used Thunderbolt. The creature, realizing that it was outmatched, leapt into a shadow. Ash attempted to jump in after it, but instead hit solid rock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" a familiar voice spoke up. The Meowth had spoken, and it was only now that Ash recognized the voice. \"Team Rocket?\" The Wobbuffett, Persian, Roserade, and Meowth looked at each other. \"How does he know about us?\" James (who was the Roserade) asked. \"Guys...\" Wobbuffett began, but was interrupted by Jesse (the Persian), who realized there was something familiar about the Pikachu. Wobbuffett spoke up again: \"It's that kid whose Pikachu we... err... you guys... were trying to steal all the time!\" There was a long, awkward silence at this, after which Meowth spoke: \"Fudge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging Kooler out was no easy task. While Team Rocket had made multiple assurances that Moltres was perfectly safe (evidently, the Shadow Pokemon were terriffied of the screams of terror and/or pain that Team Rocket was giving off as they fled from being burned by Moltres) but Ash insisted on checking every opportunity Team Rocket might have for a trap. Team Rocket explained how they got to be there: They had been planning on stealing the group's Pokemon (as usual) when a strange mist overtook them (most likely the spell) and they found themselves in the den of a criminal organization known as Team Viper (the purple sashes were their uniform), who was evidently attempting to both stop the Shadow Pokemon and attempt to gain as much profit from the conflict as possible. As part of their first assingment, they were supposed to be stealing some of Moltres's treasure (which they partially managed to do, though they had dropped some in a panic). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the cave, Ash and the group found the rest of the group waiting for them, as well as an Empoleon and an Infernape, who were the leaders of the group that Kooler worked for. They wanted to ask a few questions of Ash and friends... </span></div></div>",

The Empoleon looked away slightly. Ash wondered if the Empoleon knew something more. \"Regardless,\" the Empoleon said, \"you may have been brought here for a reason. An act of the legendary Pokemon, perhaps, or that spell, it matters not. What does matter is we may need your help.\" Kooler (who was being bandaged by a Chansey) piped up. \"There was a Kirlia who gave you that pendant?\" \"Yeah, she said I had some sort of power.\" Ash replied. \"Interesting.\" said Infernape. \"We'd like you to join us.\" said Kooler. \"We'd like your help, anyway. Maybe, in the process, we'll be able to find a way to send you and your friends home.\" said Empoleon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(PS, Jesse, James, Meowth, and Wobbuffett had panicked and run when they saw Empoleon and Infernape, as well as the others) </span></div></div>",
