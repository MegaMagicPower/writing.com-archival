He'd wake up at 6:30, go to the gym down the block, come home grab something healthy to eat and change into work clothes, and head to work. He'd done this for as long as he could remember, since he started his job two years ago. His regimented routine showed, he was easily the most fit and well-groomed of his roommates and most of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately however, things were changing. Dean had been promoted recently at his financial firm. He was pleased with the money but the demands were disrupting his lifestyle. Late nights at the office and having to entertain clients over extravagant food and drinks were catching up to Dean. Instead of early morning gym sessions, he'd be having late night pizza sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of his work demands, Dean was stressed about his little brother Zach who had moved in and had a difficult time finding a job. He was constantly having to treat Zach to meals and keep him motivated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dean was running out of steam and it showed. His active lifestyle had been slowly become more sedentary. A few extra pounds of fat had made their way to his waistline. In fact, Dean outweighed his brother Zach for the first time since they were in high school. Dean was too focused on his work to even really notice however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Dean shouted as he woke up, his alarm having went off an hour ago. He was in his boxers, and had apparently passed out with Chinese food in hand. His vision was a little blurry from the several drinks he had over dinner, trying to wine and dine potential clients. When he was with clients, he had to be a \"yes\" man and doing whatever his clients asked of him, even if that meant taking far too many shots last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean stumbled across the room, grabbing a towel so he could get in a quick shower to wash off the sweat and shame. He comes out to the living room to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zach had his computer open, Dean hoped perhaps he was looking for a job, he had hoped. As much as he wanted to help his little brother out, he didn't have the time recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, bro?\" Zach said as he saw his older brother stumble out of the room. Dean groaned in response, from his hangover and knowing he was running late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach got up and walked over to his brother, as if to say or do something important. He gave his brother's little budding belly a shake. Dean was still pretty solid with muscle but there was some slight movement when he shook his brother's bloated gut. Dean shook Zach off of him. \"Stop that, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, when did that happen?\" Zach replied. He was used to Dean being an obsessive gym rat and being told he was a lazy slob. Zach wasn't the trimmest either but given the lectures from his brother about health and nutrition and the gym it all seemed a bit ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, I've just been too busy for the gym recently,\" Dean replied defensively. \"Anyways I've got to get going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach just shrugged. He peered into Dean's room as he went into the bathroom to shower and saw the leftover containers. He smiled, knowing his brother was trying to hide his bad eating habits out of fear of being seen as a hypocrite. As he was in his brothers room, he saw his phone ringing. It was Dean's office. Zach figured it was probably important, so he answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Zach answered, not knowing what else to say. Maybe they'd think he was Dean. Zach had a lower voice but it wasn't that different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Dean's boss, Erica Danvers. \"Dean,\" she began. Zach was right, she thought it was his brother on the phone. \"I need you to come in right away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What are you doing here?\u201d Dean asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean motioned over to Zach who was sitting on the couch eating cereal. \u201cHe let me in.\u201d Zach just shrugged and look back at the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay but why are you here?\u201d Dean continued. He realized he was only in his underwear and as his body wasn\u2019t quite in peak shape, so he threw a t-shirt on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis chuckled. \u201cMs. Danvers sent me. She wanted to know about how last night went and why you were late today,\u201d Travis smirked, taking another sip of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean rolled his eyes. While Travis and he worked for the same company, they were rivals. Both had the same job and essentially had to woo clients nightly. Dean was given a shot with one last night and Travis was far too eager to brown nose the boss and find out how it went for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt went well. They\u2019re going to go over the numbers and come in with a decision today,\u201d Dean said. \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to shower. I\u2019ll see you at the office.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll get out of here,\u201d Travis said finishing off the cup of coffee and standing up from the table. He walked over towards Dean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeen skipping the gym lately, have we?\u201d Travis said as he passed Dean, and gave his very slight belly a poke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean gave Travis no credit but he sure knew how to get under his skin. After all, Dean was typically the fittest guy in the room. He knew he\u2019d drifted lately but it wasn\u2019t as if he was some fat slob. At most he\u2019d put on five to ten pounds and it\u2019s not as if his muscles had gone anywhere. Like skinny Travis had anything to brag about anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis left and Dean proceeded to get ready for work. If he had time for a protein shake he\u2019d have made one but he was already hours late, and his clients were coming in this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean arrived to the office and saw his clients already there. \u201cShit,\u201d he thought to himself. It was all ironic since the reason he was late and hungover was because of his raucous clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean saw his boss, Ms. Danvers sitting with the clients in the conference room. He was anxious and trying to read their body language. He saw a doughnut sitting out in the break area and had to have one to calm his nerves. He took a gulp and a deep breath and made his way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice of your to join us, Mr. Prescott,\u201d Ms. Danvers said rather formally. She usually called him Dean. He took a seat and just slashed that winning sales smile that he usually saved for the clients and dates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe client, Andrew, an older fellow, and his younger business partner Len, sat there without much expression on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Dean...,\u201d Andrew began. Dean took a deep breath.</span></div></div>",

Ms. Danvers watched Dean and gave him a look of affirmation.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we celebrate?\u201d Len said, hinting that they should get some drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean looked to his boss for the decision. \u201cYou go ahead. I\u2019ve got some work to do around here, but Dean why don\u2019t you take our new clients somewhere nice for lunch and drinks. Maybe the all you can eat sushi restaurant in midtown,\u201d she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like my kinda place,\u201d Len said patting his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He wasn\u2019t fat by any means but there was no denying Len had a bit of a beer gut, likely from his college and then a few years post. Len and Andrew worked for a beer distributor, so perhaps Len had a few too many beers, Dean thought. Len was mid twenties, probably the same age as Dean. He had a bit of a southern accent and a rugged somehow permanent five-o-clock shadow to go with his short light brown hair. Andrew was about twenty years older, clearly the more mature of the team and more of the business type, to contrast with Len\u2019s frat boy attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDean before you go, I\u2019d like to see you for just a moment,\u201d Ms. Danvers finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean followed Erica Danvers to her office, worried about what she might have to say. \u201cGood work,\u201d she began as he sat across from her. \u201cThat\u2019s your third client this month. Your outpacing Travis. I\u2019m going to put in for a raise for you. Keep up the good work. Take the rest of the day to keep those two happy. Make sure you charge everything to the company card,\u201d she reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean walked out of his bosses office feeling pleased. He saw Travis at his desk on his way to reconvene with his clients. It was clear he had been keeping a close eye on Dean and was not pleased to see him so successful. Dean walked by confidently, puffing out his chest as he passed by Travis\u2019 desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a good rest of the day, Travis,\u201d Dean said, attempting to irk Travis, as he gathered his belongings. Travis just mumbled under his breath in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean and his new clients left for the all you can eat sushi restaurant. Sushi, sake, appetizers, and lots of it was served to the three men as they overindulged and enjoyed their afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink I could go for another round,\u201d Len said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bottomless pit, Len. I\u2019m not sure where you put it all,\u201d Andrew joked. Dean wondered if Andrew was just being polite because Len did have a bit of a gut, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen grabbed a handful of belly through his shirt. \u201cRight here, bro,\u201d he laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew just smiled and began to gather his jackets. \u201cAlright kids, I think it\u2019s time I get out of here. You two enjoy the rest of the day. And you,\u201d Andrew said looking at Len, \u201ctry to get in before noon tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen just laughed and sipped some of his sake. Andrew left and Dean caught Len rubbing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, another round of everything?\u201d Len said as Andre departed. Len had a shit-eating grin on his face. Dean thought about abusing the company card, and his raise, and Erica telling him to do whatever he needs to keep the clients happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure man let\u2019s do it,\u201d Dean said as he flagged down a waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s make a bit of a wager, see who can eat more,\u201d Len said, with a toothpick in his mouth trying to look cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean was intrigued despite being full. \u201cAlright what are the stakes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinner picks where we go next. And if I win, your paying. Or your company is,\u201d Len said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean nodded his head and put out his hand to shake Len\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re goin\u2019 down, city boy,\u201d Len said playfully. It was pretty clear from his accent Len was from Texas or Louisiana, Dean thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food and drinks were served. Several plates of sushi, spring rolls, soups, salads, dumplings, and much more, along with another bottle of sake. The two men stared each other down ready to face off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, he kept going to just be a prick, but Dean knew it was playful, and he had to keep his client happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, you win,\" Dean said, leaning back to show his bloated belly. Len finished off the last of his beverage and smirked in response. Dean looked at his watch, somehow it was only 5:00 despite what felt like hours of overindulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are we going tonight then? You get to choose,\" Dean said. He knew Len knew that Dean and his company would be paying for whatever it was they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen confidently jiggled his belly and gave a ponderous look. Dean could see some of it through the holes in his dress shirt. It was pale and fairly hairy, the same medium brown hair that adorned his head and face. Dean thought a couple of the buttons look almost ready to burst. Surely, this shirt Len wore was not one for the long haul the way Len put it away. Dean's clothes were looking tight themselves. He thought maybe he should go home and change before they made any plans for where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinkin' on it. Let me text a few people to see what's goin' on tonight,\" Len said. He let out a big burp to punctuate his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean shifted his weight and realized he need to put on something else. Not only was he in his work clothes but they were pinching at his growing tummy in a way that was uncomfortable. Surely they could dress more casual for whatever Len had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we stop off at mine? We can grab a few drinks there to pregame and I can get out of these clothes,\" he gestured, indicating his lack of breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that sounds good man,\" Len said. The two got up and made their way toward Dean's apartment. When they arrived someone was in the apartment. </span></div></div>",

Both Dean and Len were already fairly drunk from the sake and simultaneously in a food coma. \"Hey hey,\" Alec said as they entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean stumbled in first, looking slightly disheveled. He plopped himself down on the chair beside Alec. Len followed Dean in and did the same. As he did one of his buttons finally flung off his dress shirt and into the abyss of the guys apartment. \"Oh shit,\" Len said, laughing. \"Guess maybe be overdid it,\" he said slapping his gut, ripples going through the little amount of exposed flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys had quite a day huh?\" Alec said remarking on the fact that the two were clearly intoxicated, not that he had any issue with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure,\" Dean said, groaning and holding his gut in discomfort. \"Shit I need to change before my buttons come off,\" Dean said. \"So Len where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this club we should go to. I have some friends that are headin' that way. Y'all should come too man,\" Len gestured to Alec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec shrugged, seeming to be fine with it. \"Maybe our other roommates will want to come too,\" he suggested. It was a Friday night after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may need to borrow a shirt though, bro,\" Len said fidgeting with the hole in his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure man,\" Alec said. He looked Len up and down and figured he could fit into his clothes. Len might be a little bigger in the gut but Alec was wider all throughout, so it would probably be fine. Alec got up off the couch to go look for something Len could wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec returned with a couple shirts for Len to check out. He picked one of the roomier button downs he had, hoping Len's middle could fit into it, but because of his profession he didn't have too many dress shirts to choose from. \"Why don't you give this one a try?\" he suggested, walking over to Len.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen stood up, still drunk and in the mood to have some fun, ripped the entire button down he was wearing off, sending buttons flying and his moobs and gut jiggling. Dean hoped one of Alec's shirts would fit him, since he had completely destroyed the one he had worn over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Dean and Alec got an eyeful of this guy that they didn't even know very well. He certainly wasn't fat, but had a college gain and then some. He was a pretty hairy guy, covered in brown hair. There were a couple of evident stretch marks on his sides and gut indicating that his gain may have been somewhat recent or quick. Len laughed and gave himself another belly slap, he clearly was proud or at least not ashamed of his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen then tried on Alec's shirts one by one and...</span></div></div>",

He caught his bosses eye who gave a disapproving look. The prospective clients shook hands and left the building. Dean\u2019s boss, Erica, asked him to stay behind for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to this, Dean?\u201d she asked with concern. \u201cSince you\u2019ve started in this role you\u2019ve not exactly been hitting it out of the park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d he replied confidently. The look in his eye was not conveying that though. He caught a glimpse of Travis who was very closely watching the meeting from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just been difficult transitioning. I\u2019ll get the hang of it, I promise,\u201d he continued. Dean had only started this role of bringing in potential clients for new business recently. It was clear it had been hard for him, given his lack of sleep, exercise and good habits. Even his boss couldn\u2019t help but notice he\u2019d put on about ten pounds, not exactly filling her with confidence about Dean\u2019s ability to handle the excess stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have Travis handle new accounts for a while. Prove to me you can get back on top of your game and I\u2019ll give you another shot,\u201d she said after some consideration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean nodded his head. He was not pleased. While this would give him more time to focus on himself, he liked the promotion obviously for the money and the trust that was put in him. He wanted his boss to be impressed. And worse of all, he knew how smug Travis would be to hear that Dean struck out and that he\u2019d be solely in charge of accounts for a while. Dean went back to his desk, mumbling under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Travis was called into the conference room and was told he\u2019d be in charge of clients for the time being. When he left, he could see the giant smile on Travis face. It angered Dean immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess you couldn\u2019t handle it in the big leagues, eh Dean?\u201d Travis said walking over with a doughnut in hand. He chewed it in a way that annoyed Dean, though everything Travis did rubbed Dean the wrong way. He just looked at his computer screen and ignored Travis. \u201cMaybe if I\u2019m generous I\u2019ll take you out to lunch one of these days. If I have the time between meeting clients, that is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis walked off, and eventually was whisked off to some client meetings. Dean had no choice but to keep his head down and do his work. He wanted another shot and to show Erica that he was better than Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month...</span></div></div>",

Since he wasn't busy entertaining clients constantly, he worked off the excess weight with ease, and had event began building more muscle than before. He was feeling strong and good. Despite having lost his promotion, he couldn't complain. Sure, he had felt a bit like a failure, but maybe it was a good thing. Maybe the client work wasn't for him. He was happy to take any opportunity that came his way, but as ambitious as he was, he was feeling happier and more himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat at his desk with headphones in as he heard footsteps approaching. It was Travis, his arch-nemesis. They'd been getting along somewhat better since they were not competing for their position, but there was still some bad blood between them. Travis always enjoying giving Dean a hard time, and Dean was happy to give it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need that report by Thursday, Dean. I've got drinks with the heads of Montgomery Inc. on Friday,\" Travis demanded with a confident grin on his face. Travis loved asking Dean to do things. Dean just grinned and took it for the most part, but Travis wasn't his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean rolled his eyes. \"Sure thing, big guy,\" he replied. Dean had been playfully making jabs at Travis' weight. It was almost ironic since Travis had poked fun at Dean when he had put on a few pounds. Now that Dean was in great shape, he had to give Travis a taste of his own medicine. It was clear Travis had gained around 20 pounds in the last month. He was formerly a skinny guy. But the constant client meetings and change of lifestyle was not agreeing with Travis' waistline. Travis was wearing a dress shirt with buttons that were clearly straining to contain all of his new pounds. Travis was about 6'0\" with slicked back light brown hair. Dean couldn't help but notice his face had been looking a little fuller and his dress clothes showed off his growing curves. He wondered if this trend would continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis either pretended he didn't hear the 'big guy' comment or didn't take note as he walked back to his desk. Dean couldn't help but notice the way he butt filled out his pants. He envisioned what Travis would look like even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean shook himself out of his lost focus and back toward his work. He sighed, the report Travis asked for wasn't nearly ready. It was Monday so he'd only had a few days to get it together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT READY?!\" Travis shouted from his cell phone to Dean, who was at the office. Dean thought about the fact that maybe he could've worked harder to get it done in time, but he also was kind of enjoying seeing or hearing in this case, Travis pissed off. Travis was out with clients, as usual, while Dean was burning the midnight oil in the office. He had given the report plenty of time and attention, but it was a big ask to get it done this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Travis, it's just, I'm not going to be able to finish in time for your meeting at this rate,\" Dean said honestly. He was alone in the office at this point so he had his feet up and was sipping on a beer. \"I'll see what I can get done in the next few hours, but I've got to get out of here at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, Dean,\" he heard Travis let out a sigh. \"Okay, listen. I'm going to wrap up this client meeting and then come in and work on this with you. I've got to have this done by noon tomorrow, that's when I'm meeting with the client and getting drinks and lunch with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean was surprised at how quickly Travis calmed down. Spending his Thursday night in the office with Travis didn't sound ideal, but it's the only option he had at this point. He risked getting called out by Travis and his boss taking action if he flat out refused. He agreed to Travis' idea and hung up. He got back to working on the report and waited for Travis to get to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Dean heard the elevator door ding. It was Travis. He looked like maybe he'd had a few drinks, his tie was loose and he looked less uptight than usual. He walked into the office as Dean awaited a scolding, but Travis was unusually calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Dean, catch me up. Where are we at?\" Travis said walking over to Dean's desk and leaning down looking at what Dean had on the computer. Dean couldn't help but notice some pudge squeezing above Travis' belt buckle as he leaned over. Dean took his focus away from Travis' little belly and toward the computer. He showed Travis where the report was and the issues he was having with completing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis let out a sigh. \"Looks like this is going to be an all-nighter, huh?\" Dean nodded his head, annoyed but knowing that Travis was correct that it was going to take hours to complete this, even together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's do this. I need to order something to eat though, I'm starving,\" Travis said holding his stomach. \"You want something?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean shrugged. \"Pizza would be cool, I guess,\" he said. \"Weren't you at dinner with clients?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh. You know how it is, you do more talking than eating,\" Travis said, dialing on his phone. Dean heard Travis start ordering on the phone. He called the local place they usually ordered from. Travis ordered two pizzas, two orders of fries, a cheesesteak sub, chicken wings, and sodas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is someone else coming?\" Dean asked when Travis finished on the phone. Travis gave him a puzzled look. \"It's just, that's kind of a lot of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to be here all night dude, we'll get hungry,\" Travis said. \"Get off my ass would you?\" he said snidely. Dean just gave a look and got back to the report. Shortly after the food came and Travis started to dig in. Dean just watched as his coworker gorged himself like he'd never eaten before. Dean had a couple slices of pizza and a few handfuls of fries but wanted to see how much Travis would eat if he left it. He wasn't all that hungry anyways. Slowly but surely Travis made his way through one full pizza, all of the wings, half of the sub and most of the fries. He'd also drank most of first two Liter soda bottle. He was kind of intrigued and impressed. Travis tried to stifle a belch but couldn't help but let it slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" Dean said in response. \"Dude what?\" Travis said with an annoyed face. He had wing sauce on his face and his shirt. They both looked back down at the print out they were reviewing and tried to avoid having much conversation. Surely but slowly Travis kept eating away at what remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to eat the rest of your pizza?\" Travis said. Dean was kind of impressed that he had the balls to ask. \"Go ahead, big guy,\" Dean replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep calling me, big guy,\" Travis stated after scarfing down some pizza. Dean nodded. \"Yeah it's just, you've put on some weight Trav.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis gave Dean a smirk. He looked down at his stomach which was undeniably pooched over his too-tight belt. Dean can't believe he hadn't already removed it after the gorging he'd been doing for the last hour or two.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a Thursday morning. Zach had fallen asleep on the couch last night and woke up to his roommates heading off to work. He was on the couch, shirtless, sprawled out for all the world to see. Zach had recently moved into the apartment with his brother Dean. Their former roommate left, and Zach was growing tired of living at home in Jersey with his parents. So, Dean offered the room up to his little bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter graduating college, he'd had some trouble finding work. He'd studied Computer Science but it was hard finding work in such an oversaturated field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had been living in the Manhattan apartment for six weeks, but still had no luck finding work. Needless to say, he was not really able to afford much. Dean was kind enough to help him out, treat him to dinner or a beer once in a while, or quite frequently. Zach would snack on all of the food in the apartment when the boys were at work. And it showed. Zach had gained about five to ten pounds, it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec and Jared were starting to get a little tired of Zach mooching off of their food and drinks. Not to mention the fact that he lazed around the apartment and did whatever he wanted, whether it was watching television or playing video games all hours of the night. Occasionally he'd have friends or girls over late into the night when the guys had to work in the morning. The mess he left behind was starting to irk them as well: food wrappers, empty beer cans, his bong. Finding him shirtless in the couch, often hungover, was becoming a regular occurrence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' bro,\" Dean commented as he walked by a shirtless Zach, dressed in his work attire. Dean was drinking a protein shake he'd just made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach groaned and put the pillow over his head. Jared walked into the room, also dressed for work, and just rolled his eyes looking down at Zach and the mess he had made. \"You might want to lay off the beer dude,\" he said poking at Zach's furry stomach, that was starting to look a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" Zach said. He removed pillow off of his head in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't sleep out here if you don't want us to mess with you,\" Jared smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, bro. You should clean this up today,\" Dean said pointing to the beers and pizza crusts on the floor beside the couch. \"We don't want to get mice,\" he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Zach said getting up from the couch. He was clad only in boxer briefs and his expanding butt was on full display as was his morning wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, you happy to see me?\" Alec joked as he walked in the living room, referring to Zach's hard-on. He'd just gotten out of the shower and was wrapped in a towel. \"You know it,\" Zach laughed as he rummaged through the pantries for a box of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean and Jared were about to head out for the day. \"Any interviews today, Zach?\" Jared asked, somewhat sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had sat back on the couch with a hearty bowl of Lucky Charms in whole milk prepared. He just groaned and continued eating as he looked for something on television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep checking those job sites I sent you, bro,\" Dean said, trying to encourage his brother as he patted him on his shoulder. He headed for the door and smiled, along with Jared who took the same train as Dean most mornings. \"At least please don't eat us out of house and home, man,\" Jared quipped with a smile. Zach rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" Zach said as they both left. He continued eating a few more helpings of Lucky Charms as Alec got dressed and headed off to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Zach do?</span></div></div>",

He didn't mind his roommates, in fact he loved them, but he was getting the feeling that they were all growing tired of his routine. He wasn't completely unaware that he'd been taking advantage of the food, the beer, and everything else that his roommates were providing him. He didn't mind so much when it came to Dean, he was his brother, but he knew that Alec and Jared especially were hoping things would change soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach was feeling somewhat hungover. He recalls having had drinks with some friends last night and then coming back with a large pizza and playing video games until the wee hours of the morning. He might have also dug into the beer stash. That much was a given based on the empty beer cans scattered across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shower time,\" he said to himself after catching a whiff of his body odor. He tended to sweat in his sleep most nights, especially when he crashed in the living room since they didn't have an air conditioner out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach stripped out of his boxers and stepped into a cool shower. He knew his roommates were gone for the day, so he felt perfectly comfortable strutting around the apartment naked. Once he was out of the shower and the steam cleared from the mirror, he caught a glimpse of himself, in all his glory. He looked down at his fuzzy gut that Jared had poked earlier. He certainly wasn't fat but he was maybe a little softer than he was when he moved to the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe his gut was a little bigger, Zach thought, but he didn't seem to care or mind. \"As long as I can still see my dick,\" Zach joked to himself. He knew he was a long way off from that, especially since he considered himself to be pretty well endowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was honestly the first time that he even had the thought that perhaps he'd put on a few pounds after Jared said something this morning. Zach shrugged it off, threw on some clothes, and grabbed his bag to head off to a local coffee shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had been spending a lot of time in the apartment recently and needed to get out to get in a decent headspace to actually sit down and apply for jobs. He got a coffee and a few pastries from the place, and took a seat. Opening his laptop, he began looking at some of the stuff his brother had sent him. Zach had studied Computer Science, so ideally he'd find some IT work he could do. He'd never had a desk job before so the idea was completely unfamiliar to him. He wasn't sure that it was for him but he might as well put his studies to good use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

He was still hungry though, even after the previous pastries and heaping bowls bowls of cereal back at the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he wasn't going to stop himself, it's why he had a credit card after all - to pay for things when he couldn't afford them. Zach walked up to the register to order and saw the 'Now Hiring' sign just beside the register. It wasn't exactly a dream job but it's been hard for him to find work in his field, so why not work at the coffee shop? It's close to home, and maybe I'll get free pastries, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman behind the register with a dirty blonde hair and tattoos approached. \"More danish, or you looking for something else?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Zach stammered for a second. \"I actually was going to ask about the job. Can I apply?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed sort of surprised. This wasn't the first time she'd seen Zach in the shop and the sign had been posted for some time. \"Well, I'm the manager so I can make that happen for you,\" she said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cool. Well, I'm interested, so,\" Zach began nervously. He was caught off guard by her candidness. Not to mention the fact that he thought the woman was cute but he was trying to not come off like a douche, especially if he was hoping she'd hire him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you worked at a place like this? What makes you think you'd be any good at it?\" she said slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I used to work at the snack stand at my pool growing up. Same sort of think, I imagine,\" Zach said. He was very casual but something about him was very charming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? You're hired. You seem like a good dude and you seem like you need this,\" she says. \"I'm April, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick, really?\" Zach was shocked. He couldn't wait to tell his roommates he had a job, maybe they'd stop giving him such a hard time. \"When do I start?\" he asked scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow,\" April says. \"I'll have one of the guys train you,\" she finished. She tucked her hair behind her ear and smiled. Zach smiled back, the genuine excitement beaming from his face. It wasn't his dream job but hey, he finally had a job in New York City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to?</span></div></div>",

He had a few of them, because god knows he wasn't too good at laundry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already running late and now he was having shirt problems. Zach was perplexed, this shirt fit the other day but he was having problems with the buttons this morning. He figured it was just a fat day, but the truth is it has been a part of a pattern. After three weeks of his new job, the pastries were adding to his waistline. Not to mention the fact that he only worked three days a week and still had his evenings and nights to do whatever he'd like with. He'd made some new work friends that he'd go drinking with nearly every work day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean and Jared were in the other room getting ready for work as well. They always started fairly early but Zach was usually out of the house before them since he worked earlier and got off earlier. \"Problem, bud?\" Jared asked as he heard a frustrated Zach in front of the bathroom mirror. Jared was sipping a coffee and taking his time. He was an early riser and almost always awake before Zach despite him going to work later. He was entertained every morning watching Zach stumble out of bed and run off to the coffee shop, a job he just started and was still often late for. He's lucky he has friends that cover for him and that his manager liked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach got the buttons fastened and smiled looking at himself in the bathroom mirror. He gave his beard and his hair a once-over with a comb and headed out to the living room. \"All is good,\" Zach said giving a thumbs up to Dean and Jared who were sitting at the kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach eyed some doughnuts on the table and went in to grab a few. \"You get all the snacks you want at work, why do you need these?\" Dean quipped. Zach had a mouthful of doughnut and didn't respond right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I'm hungry,\" he said in response, talking through the chewing of his second doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the stress of Zach's growing gut gave way and bounced a troublesome button off his shirt. They had already been stretched to their limit to so it was a matter of time. Jared just laughed hysterically in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck. My other shirts are dirty,\" Zach said looking down at his shirt which was exposing some flabby, hairy flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think that maybe this is a sign you maybe need to lay off the pastries?\" Dean said, in the most encouraging way that he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared just scoffed, knowing Zach was incapable of laying off any food or drink, especially recently. He doesn't recall having seen him in the apartment without one of the two in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach poked his flabby gut. It was clear he'd gained another ten pounds or so since starting the job. At least it was clear to everyone around him, while Zach remained fairly oblivious. If he did realize it, he certainly didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, that's helpful bro. I can't go to work like this,\" Zach gestured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you wear an apron?\" Jared responded coyly. \"Just get in there and put it on before anyone sees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach liked the idea. He knew how smart Jared was and saw it as a better alternative than digging into his dirty laundry hamper and digging out one of his shirts covered in coffee and pit stains, or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach walked over to Jared and gave him a playful kiss on the head, and belly bumped his head in the process unintentionally. \"This is why you're the smart one,\" Zach said with a cheesy grin. He left the apartment knowing he was late and tried his best to not draw any extra attention to his button-less shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes and a few glares later and he's at the coffee shop where he tries to cross his arms to hide the hole and get his apron on. He slides past one of his coworker, ties the apron and lets out a sigh of relief which may definitely have caused another button to come off, but at least know he was covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zach,\" he heard and turned around to see...</span></div></div>",

Zach took a deep breath, immediately regretting it as he knew once he breathed out his shirt would be put under further strain. Zach slowly followed April, running through his mind what could possibly be the reason why he could be getting fired so quickly. Maybe it was the few pastries he ate. Maybe it was the many pastries he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach sat in the chair opposite of April, with his new gut profoundly sitting in his lap, even with an apron on. \"Zach, our beloved baker Terry has found it time to retire after working with us for years. And as sad as I am to see him go, we need a replacement quick. I figured that you'd be the perfect candidate! Terry will train you of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach was perplexed! He thought for sure he'd be fired, not promoted. Zach considered the options in his head. He wasn't all that good with the coffee machine, and he hated dealing with snobby customers. Then again, as his roommates constantly reminded him, he didn't need to be around more pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it!\" Zach said excitedly. April clapped her hands. \"Great! You can go see Terry now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had met Terry before, but only through the window of the kitchen inside the coffee shop. He made his way to the back. \"Hey how are ya, so you're the lad that they've sent to replace me, eh?\" Terry joked. Zach towered over Terry, who must've been 5'4 or 5'5. <br>\r\n\"Well you can hand over that coffee apron, you won't be needing that anymore.\" Terry said. Zach slowly took off his apron, revealing now 3 buttons that had popped off his shirt. Zach blushed in embarrassment. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see the pastries have already made their way to your gut since working here. Trust me, they'll do it to you!\" Terry joked, patting his own sizeable gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry handed Zach a baker's coat to cover his hairy gut and the two got started. Zach liked this new work. Although challenging to remember, the work seemed easy. They had finished baking the batch around 2. The coffee shop closes at 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, whatever is not sold by the end of the day, we get to keep, because it cannot be sold tomorrow. Almost as if on que, Zach's stomach rumbled. He just now realized he hadn't eaten today. \"And whenever you're hungry, no one's gonna stop you from eating your own work!\" Terry said, picking up a cookie and walking away. Zach couldn't help himself, and shoved 4 cookies, 3 donuts, and a croissant into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showing Zach how to clean up, it was 3 o'clock, and there were too many leftovers to count. Terry handed Zach a dozen of what seemed like everything, and Zach made his way home with a box full of pastries. When Zach walked in,</span></div></div>",

He opened up the box and started shoving food in his mouth, not even keeping track of what went in. Cookies, donuts, muffins, cupcakes, croissants, cake, and other sugary goods found their way into his mouth. There must have been a dozen or more of each. Zach was too focused on finishing the box before his roommates got home, as not to share the sugary delight. Zach's belly grew larger and larger, but he got hungrier and hungrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later, Zach finished the entire 3'x3' box of pastries. His stomach ballooned, sitting like a mountain ontop of Zach who was now laying down.

The truth is he didn't really mind it. So he gained a few pounds and the guys gave him a hard time about it. If he wanted to start working out like Dean and drop the weight he could.

They lived in New Jersey where the boys grew up, so it wasn't uncommon for their parents to come into the city or for the boys to head out to Jersey to spend the weekend at their family home. Zach had been living there after college and before moving in with Dean, so he hadn't really made it a priority to see his parents. The last time Dean went home to visit, Zach stayed in the city and partied instead of going home. Dean realized his parents hadn't seen Zach since he moved into the city two months ago. He worried they were going to be shocked at the sight of his (not so) little brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of this all didn't phase Zach in the same way that Dean did. Dean was the anxious one, Zach was the relaxed one, and it showed. Dean stuck to his gym regime and was in terrific shape. Zach on the other hand, had been stuffing himself with pastries, beer, and junk food for weeks, and it showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean had arrived home from work to change and shower before dinner. Zach had finished up work at the coffee shop at three and was napping at the apartment when Dean arrived. He walked over to Zach's room, the door was open and he was snoring. As always he was shirtless, large hairy dome of a gut rising and falling as he breathed in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Zachy, get up. Dinner is in an hour,\" Dean said from outside the door, loud enough to get Zach up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach groaned in response. After a quick shower, Dean got into more casual clothes and checked on Zach. He was in the kitchen eating some leftover Chinese food, in his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck dude? We're going to dinner in twenty minutes. Why are you eating and why are you not dressed?\" Dean said. \"Also that's Alec's food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach sighed and finished what he was eating. He went to his room to change. Unsurprisingly, both his pants and his t-shirt left little to the imagination. Dean had been telling him he needed new clothes after more than one incident with Zach's clothes ripping over his growing torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean couldn't help but almost laugh. His \"little\" brother looked like a stuffed sausage in t-shirt and nearly painted-on jeans. He didn't understand how it didn't bother Zach to be dressed like that. He wondered if maybe he didn't even notice how large his tight clothes made him look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to go shopping for some new clothes,\" he urged for what felt like the fiftieth time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wearing some of Alec's stuff. Most of it fits just fine,\" Zach replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you put on something of his now? You don't want to bust out of your shirt in front of mom and dad,\" Dean said watching the seems on Zach's shirt strain with all of their might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Zach said in response. He didn't really feel like being lectured by his parents about his weight. Dean was already doing that enough so wearing Alec's clothes might actually be a good idea.</span></div></div>",

Hovering above 230 lbs now, he saw that wasn't a good idea as he thought, seeing the whole room shake. Knowing that the jeans couldn't get past his larger butt and seeing that the buttons could never get around his fattened waist and belly, he gave up on the jeans. Zach was confused. He normally fit in Alec's clothes just fine. Then again, he normally wore Alec's sweatpants and sweatshirts, and he did add a little too much butter to the not-so-unintentional full sized extra cake he made today. Zach decided that wearing Alec's sweatpants would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he left his room, Dean rolled his eyes. \"Zach! You can't wear sweatpants and a sweatshirt to dinner with mom and dad!\" Dean exclaimed. <br>\r\n\"They're all that fit\" Zach said, grabbing a donut from the counter. All Dean could do is sigh - besides maybe the clothes could hide Zach's newfound heft. The two made their way to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach and Dean's parents were so excited to see their kids they gave them a big hug, barely noticing Zach's weight gain. Zach immediately felt underdressed in the fancy restaurant, seeing button up shirts and dress pants on everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach and Dean's dad was tall like his children, but not as tall as Zach. Their dad carried some heft but nothing surprising with his age. Their mom was the same, not too big not too small. But compared to everyone, Zach was huge. Broad, tall, and fat, even the sweatshirt couldn't hide these facts. Regardless, the four happily sat down to a table for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean and his dad ordered a 12 oz steak, feeling rather hungry; and their mom ordered a salad. Zach surprised everyone - especially Dean who had known how much Zach had already eaten today - when he ordered a 25oz porterhouse steak. \"You sure you can finish that, son?\" Dad asked. \"Yep, and I'll finish whatever you can't either!\" Zach joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family caught up with each other while waiting for food - Zach eating a noticeable majority of the bread - and once the food came, Zach's steak looked gigantic. Sure, Dean and dad's were large too, but Zach's steak looked the size of Dean. Zach quickly ate away at his steak. Much to the awe of his entire family, he ate the entire thing, the side of fries, as well as the last few bites of Dean's steak, and even a slice of chocolate cake for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach felt the sides of Alec's sweatpants cut into his fattened waist. The sweatshirt exposed Zach's happy trail slightly, as the sweatshirt couldn't cover all of Zach and his gut. Zach's mom and dad...</span></div></div>",

It brought him back to their childhood. Dean was always the do-gooder and was pressured immensely to get good grades and work hard, while Zach could be a lazy slob and get away with everything because he was the baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finished up dinner and stood up, Zach's belly was visibly hanging out of Alec's sweatshirt. He didn't even bother to tug it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're so proud of you for getting a job, Zachy,\" Mrs. Campbell said as she gave her son a big hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean was mindblown. It wasn't like it was a career, he was pouring coffee and eating pastries all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've made in the big city, big man,\" Mr. Campbell said hugging Zach as Dean watched on, getting more and more irritated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad gave their hugs to Dean as well, said their goodbyes and that was that. Dean and Zach headed to a bar to have a beer or two after even though Dean was seething, he was good at not showing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you thought they were going to say I was fat? I told you it wasn't that bad bro,\" Zach said, giving a heavy slap to his big brother on his shoulder as he took a swig of his beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean was off in space, still wondering how his parents didn't notice or say anything about his very big little brother. After lecturing Zach about his weight for weeks, his parents didn't even bother to reinforce it? Fuck it, he thought, why even give a fuck about how fat his brother becomes, if his parents don't even give a shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing how you get away with shit,\" Dean responded sipping on his own beer, as his brother ordered another. Dean rolled his eyes as this was on his tab, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it that I'm adorable,\" Zach said, with that shit-eating grin he always gave that seemed to charm everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another couple beers, Zach took off to get some late night munchies. Dean stayed at the bar where Jared met him. He felt free to vent to him. \"It's unbelievable Jared. He just gets away with it all. He's living off of me essentially, working if you can call it that at a glorified Dunkin Donuts and they just give him everything he wants. He ate a shit ton at dinner tonight and not a peep from mom or dad,\" Dean rambled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they didn't notice?\" Jared said. He almost couldn't keep a straight face with the suggestion, considering how obvious it was that Zach had quite literally blown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could make them notice, Dean thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

Dean was happy with his body, and disgusted by Zach's. How could he sit around all day, and no one would say anything? If he wants to be fat, Dean thought, then I'll make him fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dean got up the next day, he saw Zach still sleeping. Dean decided to take the day off. He woke up his brother for another fattening day at work. Soon, everyone was out of the apartment, and Dean would set his plan in motion. He through out any healthy food in the apartment. He replaced it all with junk food and fast food, all within reach of Zach. He bought a minifridge and placed it in Zach's room, and filled it with beer and sweets. Soon, all the cabinets were spilling out with unhealthy food. Dean knew whatever was in front of Zach, he'd eat. He'd heard him rummaging through the kitchen late at night, and failing to find a snack as he'd eaten them all the day before. He wouldn't let that happen anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 3, Zach came in carrying a box almost the size of a yoga ball. \"What's that?\" Dean asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, we were extra slow today, and I accidentally made an extra few batches, so I brought them home!\" Zach said, placing the box down and grabbing a cookie from inside. Dean was in shock. He looked into the box and it was full of dessert. Now was time to set his last part of the plan in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zach, I just wanted to say sorry about bugging you about your weight. I just want whats best for you. If you're okay with gaining a few pounds, then thats fine.\" Dean said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro, that means a lot\". Zach muffled, with a whole donut in his mouth. <br>\r\n\"I wanted to make it up to you, so I made you a milkshake!\" Dean said, handing Zach the tall glass. Sure, there was milk and ice cream inside, but heavy cream, weight gain powder, and appetite enhancers were a bit of a unique addition. Zach's eyes lit up, and he drank the whole thing, it was delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That milkshake is actually good for you, I added some vitamins so that even if you gain weight, there won't be any health complications. Think of it as our compromise!\" Dean said. \"And if you ever want one, I'll make it straight away!\" Dean said. <br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll have another then!\" Zach said. Dean blended away, and handed Zach another glass between mouthfuls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few weeks, Dean's plan is...</span></div></div>",

Shirts, pants, underwear, sweats: you name it, it was no match for the growing bulk that was Zach Prescott. With his own efforts, combined with Dean's plans, he had no trouble expanding in all directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach was attempting to get ready to head to a house party with his roommates and other friends. Emphasis on the word attempting as he had exhausted most options for what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean, Alec and Jared were in the living room sipping beers to pre-game as they awaited their younger, larger roommate. Zach had long since outgrown Alec's clothes which were the biggest in the apartment. Fortunately, he had some clothes Dean had gotten him that had a little extra room, or used to anyways. Dean didn't want Zach to know quite how large he was, so he would replace his clothes to try and keep him in the dark. Zach may have been a bit slow but even he knew that his waistline was well past where it was even just a month ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got to be close to 300, dude,\" Alec commented hearing Zach struggle to squeeze into something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close to? I feel like he's well past it,\" Jared snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, he's gotten huge but there's no way he's put on 75 pounds in a month,\" Dean replied, keeping the guys from exaggerating too much. He was enjoying it however, after all, much of it was his doing. He felt proud for having had a role in enabling Zach's slobbish behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fellas, get me a beer to shotgun. I'm ready to go,\" Zach shouted as he came from his room to the living room where the rests of his roommates sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach looked like a human sausage squeezed into a pair of shorts and a t-shirt that maybe fit him thirty pounds ago, and even then it was probably a stretch. His hairy belly was hanging out of the front of his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared just laughed. \"You're going to the party. Like that?\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I look good,\" Zach said. He put a backwards baseball cap and flashed a smile. He stood in front of where they sat on the couches as if to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec was sitting in front of Zach and reached out and grabbed his belly. \"You're not feeling a bit of a breeze, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach pulled down at his shirt in response. \"The shirt fits fine, man. Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to your man tits that are nearly busting out of there,\" Jared said, cackling. He sipped on his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach appeared unphased. He grabbed his third beer in what seemed like five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez dude, slow down,\" Dean said, eyeing his brother's drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm catching up with y'all,\" Zach said in response. \"Anyways let's get out of here,\" he said as he downed another beer and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three others got up and headed off to the party. When they arrived the four of them were greeted by all of their friends. The party was at a house with a large backyard. It was rare to have that kind of space but it was pretty deep in Brooklyn, the guys thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fellas, nice to see you!\" one of the guys throwing the party, Carlos said as he greeted the roommates. He was a friend of Dean's from growing up. Carlos went down the line greeting the guys until he came to Zach. Carlos had known Zach from when he was little and he couldn't believe the behemoth that stood before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zach? That you, big guy?\" Carlos said, seeming unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it goin' man?\" Zach gave him a hand shake followed by a big bear head, emphasis on the big. \"Woah,\" was all Carlos could say in response. \"Well there's beer and food over there,\" he directed the four men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach almost immediately made a beeline for the pizzas that were sitting out as well as the beers that were sitting beside it. Dean and Jared lingered near Carlos a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to him, dude?\" Carlos asked Dean, as they watched him dive into the pizza for several slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a growing boy,\" Dean said quickly, with a confident smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again. Geez,\" Carlos said again. \"I hope we have enough to feed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Zach was washing down his fourth slice of pizza with a couple of beers. His expanding belly trickled it's way further out of his entirely too tight shirt. At least a few inches of flabby, hairy flesh peeked out of his shirt and flopped over the waistband of his nearly painted-on shorts. After letting out a big belch, Zach saw someone unfamiliar approaching him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a tiny thing, probably only 5'1\" and adorable with a soft voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey,\" Zach said. He tried to hold in a belch from the beer he just guzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mallory,\" she said cutely. \"I just saw you eating and had to come over. I love a big guy who knows what he wants,\" she added, almost to shy to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach was confused but flattered. He was always a confident guy and had no trouble charming women but it wasn't often he was approached, particularly with his new found shape. Mallory came closer to him and gave the exposed part of his belly a little tickle. Zach could almost purr like a kitten in response as it felt so good. He wanted her soft hands all over his expanding body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom across the yard, the two were getting some attention. Not only because Zach continued to each most of the spread, but because they were shocked Zach was getting this sort of attention from a sexy girl like Mallory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, dude,\" Jared said to Dean. \"That girl totally digs your fat brother,\" she said nudging him and pointing over to the pair. Both were transfixed on them, watching Zach eat and Mallory giggled and admired him, occasionally touching his growing expanse. The guys wanted to go over but knew they were best to leave Zach to it, he certainly hadn't been scoring much lately with his focus being on eating and drinking more than any human should consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach shotgunned three beers in a row to impress his new lady friend. He had no concerns about depleting the party's supply of food or drink, clearly. Mallory was practically fawning over Zach. It took everything in her to not want to shove more food down his throat and rub his body all over. \"Let's get out of here,\" she suggested, coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a big guy, Zach moved pretty quickly in response. He jumped up, the exposed part of his stomach jiggling abruptly. </span></div></div>",

After 4 milkshakes, Dean was sure Zach would eat a lot, but not this much. Watching Zach eat, Dean absent mindedly started eating the cookies he had left on the counter for Zach. 1 became 2, 2 became 3, and 3 became 8. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach finally finished the entire box, and lumbered off to his room for a nap. Zach's stomach giggled further and further out of his shirt with each step, revealing his love handles. Dean heard the minifridge open and the crack of beer opening. This would be easier than Dean thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean thought that the food he bought for the apartment would last weeks. However, by next week, while looking for a snack himself, he saw the apartment was almost empty. \"There's no way...\" Dean started, and saw his brother knocked out on the couch surrounded by twinkie wrappers and empty chip bags. \"I guess I'll have to buy more!\" Dean again took the day off to fill up the apartment with junk food. Realizing he hadn't eaten all day, and being too tired to go out and get something healthy, Dean figured he could eat a few hotpockets for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean found himself regularly eating a good amount of food in the apartment, as he was often too tired to go out. And with eating the food in the apartment, and Zach's growing appetite, it became a 2-times a week job to refill the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for 3 weeks, and Dean was growing a gut of his own. He was indenial of this, too focused on fattening his own brother up to realize his own belly. But fattening wasn't a good enough word for what was happening to Zach. He was getting visibly bigger everyday. In just the month that Dean had devoted to fattening Zach, he must've gained 50 pounds. All he did was shove food into his mouth, drink Dean's fattening milkshakes, and sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean woke up one morning and found Zach yet again sprawled out on the couch, yet he could barely recognize his brother. He was in nothing but his underwear, which was beginning to tear. His hairy thighs were the size of tree trunks, his ass barely contained in his underwear, the size of globes. A huge mountain of a belly rose up and down as Zach slept, with a pair of moobs sitting on top. Zach's double chin was more prominent than ever, and mouth surrounded by chocolate. Seeing the empty cake plate next to him, he saw Zach had finished the last extra-fudge cake Dean had boughten. \"What a tub of lard!\" Dean thought, eating some extra-fattening bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Zach came home from work, announcing...</span></div></div>",

Of course, he'd set aside some food for himself - 3 triple bacon burgers, 1 plate of fries, and 1 milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach walked in the apartment, noticeably without a box of leftovers today. \"Busy today?\" Dean asked. <br>\r\n\"No, I got fired..\" Zach said, scratching the back of his neck. <br>\r\n\"What?!\" Dean exclaimed. The baking job was a huge part of helping Zach gain weight!<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my manager said I was eating more than we were selling, and she was tired of buying a new uniform every other week for me to fit into..\" Zach said, and picked up a burger.<br>\r\n\"Well screw her!\" Dean said.<br>\r\n\"At least I can laze around all the time now!\" Zach said, mouth full.

He had his own job and priorities to attend to, and he already was slacking a bit with his efforts to fatten his brother. He thought that maybe he could help his brother get a new job that could help alleviate some of the burden. Dean was at the kitchen table searching for jobs for his brother, while Zach was laying on the couch, stuffing himself with chips and beer. His hairy dome of belly jiggled with each movement, reaching for some chips or grabbing a beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared walked in, having come from some social plans and rolled his eyes. \"Nice to see your being productive, Zach.\" In response Zach just groaned and opened another beer. Zach was used to the jabs from the roommates about being fat, lazy, or unemployed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had been at home not working for weeks. His lazyness and his gut were growing exponentially with all this time at home. It was become tough for all of the roommates, having to clean up after him and constantly have him sprawled out on the couch, almost always in minimal clothing. It was becoming harder and harder to even see that Zach was wearing underwear (when he was) with the way that his large hairy belly flopped over the waistband. There was a lot of Zach and it was almost always on full display. An imprint had been making it's way into the couch where Zach's enormous ass usually sat. Dean figured it was only a matter of time until the couch would break under Zach's colossal weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared walked over to Dean. \"Any luck with the job searches for lardass? If we don't get him out of here soon he's not going to fit out the door,\" he said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that much of a stretch, Dean thought. Zach had piled on at least another twenty pounds since he was fired. His gut and moobs were growing so fast they couldn't be contained by any of Zach's clothes. If Dean actually were able to find a job for his behemoth of a brother, he'd surely need new clothes so he could leave the house without his giant jiggly gut on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.

Free meals, decent wage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Dean said to himself. Another job for Dean to stuff himself up to the brim with. Surely he could get it, he did have experience. All he needed was to convince Zach to get off the couch. It had been a month since he had gotten fired, but maybe he was ready to get a job? He looked over at his brother. In one hand, a slice of pizza. In the other, 2 extra large cookies. And his mouth was full of cake. Maybe it would take some convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatburger?\" Jared asked, hearing Dean's-not-so indiscriminate whisper. \"Do you want him to be the size of a car by the time he gets fired from there?\" Dean just chuckled to himself. Jared ignored this; noting Dean's slight weight gain himself. Though probably no more than 15 lbs, he could see Dean's belly sticking out in every shirt. Almost as if on cue, Dean reached for a brownie on the counter. Jared noticed all the food around the house and assumed it was Zach, but maybe it was Dean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy next week, with 5 more lbs added to Zach's growing frame, it was time for Zach's interview. Dean had woken him up 30 minutes before the interview to give him time to get ready. 20 minutes later, he checked back on his brother to still see him sleeping.<br>\r\n\"Zach!\" he yelled. Zach just groaned and turned to the other side of the bed, with the whole mattress creaking with him.<br>\r\n\"You need this job!\" Dean yelled, and he shook his brother. His entire body jiggled, and Dean was just now noticing just how doughy his brother was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he got Zach up and ready just in time for his interview. Zach, not surprisingly, didn't fit into any of his interview-worthy shirts, so an XXXL sweatshirt had to do. Dean walked him there just to be sure he actually went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach, even as large as he was now, was always a charmer, and killed the interview and got the job on the spot. The dull, monotonic manager saw Dean waiting for Zach and called him over. <br>\r\n\"We can use all the help we can get, would you be interested in the position?\" He asked. Dean was surprised. He definitely could use the extra money, as he spent a majority of his savings feeding Zach's never-ending appetite. Plus, he could fatten Zach at work and at home. Dean happily took the job with his brother. They were scheduled to start in 3 days.</span></div></div>",

And fat it was. Dean estimated that Zach had put on at least another 15 pounds since starting the job. He was dangerously flirting with 300 pounds. None of his shirts, work or leisure, really covered the growing expanse of his flab. Fat burger had already ordered a new size for him a week ago, and it was already squishing his fat hairy belly out of the bottom. Thus, Zach was stuck in the back flipping burgers since their manager didn\u2019t want his sloppy appearance to be seen by customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d Zach hands Dean three burgers, jiggling with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude they are combos.

Dean angrily grabbed it from his brother, causing them both to jiggle a bit. Dean wasn\u2019t growing at the rate his brother was but it was certain that another few pounds were added to his beginner belly and moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. Here you go,\u201d Dean said, handing off the meal to the customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shift ended shortly after and the manager, Larry, called Dean to his office.

He was going to make some changes to help fatten up Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean got the store a milkshake machine, so that guests - and his brother - could slurp down some fattening shakes with some new fattening menu items. Dean added mac &amp; cheese burgers, bacon covered buns, a new monster burger (4 patties, each covered in bacon and cheese sauce, layered with fattening sauces and more cheese) all made with extra fattening ingredients. He also created a new sauce for the place, made entirely of weight gain powder and hunger stimulants. With these new options, Zach was blowing up even faster. With his brother to encourage him - making him a few milkshakes and a couple of monster burgers, with 3 containers of the weight gain sauce added, Zach couldn't help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach loved his new job, even better than the bakery. He shoved burger after burger in his mouth. He put his mouth to the guzzle of the milkshake machine and sucked the machine dry. He'd be holding an extra-extra-bacon monster burger in each hand. He could shove cheesy-bacon fries into his mouth, and end it all with 8 packaged apple pies for dessert. Then he'd start it all over again. He was becoming enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could be said for Dean. With the new power as manager, the ex-jock took full advantage of kitchen capabilities. He'd find himself snacking on cheesy-bacon fries all shift, and making himself monster burgers up to 4 times a day. Even though he knew the weight gain sauce was bad for him, he made it himself afterall, he couldn't deny it tasted good. Dean's beginner belly was becoming a GUT. His belly soon poked out under his shirt. He found himself hungry all the time. But nothing could be compared to Zach's bottomless appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after a long shift at work, Zach and Dean brought home some dinner to feast on. While eating away at the bag filled of burgers...</span></div></div>",

Dean was sitting beside him in the other chair, both scarfing down their extras from work. It was inevitable that eventually Zach would break some of the furniture. Zach was shirtless (as was usually the case) and his hairy body jiggled aggressively from the fall to the floor. Zach and Dean both just started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude what the fuck?\u201d Jared yelled from inside his room. He came out to see what the noise was. He was pretty sure he had an idea though. He had seen the Prescott brothers gain weight over the last few months and knew Zach was slowly going from having a gut to being fat. And Dean wasn\u2019t far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather loud sound, 300 pounds of hairy, flabby flesh crashing through a couch and onto the carpeted floor. The neighbors below were probably wondering what had happened as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fucking funny dude. You\u2019re paying for a new couch I hope you know,\u201d Jared said, sounding frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Jared said turning to Dean. \u201cWhat the fuck happened to you? You used to work our daily and had this great job. Now you\u2019re flipping burgers and stuffing your face with this fucking pig,\u201d he contributed referring to Zach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach stood up. \u201cWho you calling a pig bro?\u201d He got face to face with Jared as if he was ready to fight. He belly bumped Jared, playfully but it knocked him off his feet, Zach\u2019s belly jiggling furiously in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean stopped eating, got up and helped his friend up. He didn\u2019t want any conflict. Maybe Jared was right too. Was he getting side tracked? He had this great life before he started trying to fatten his little brother up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared got up and shoved Dean off, implying he didn\u2019t need his help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve changed man,\u201d Jared said, word that penetrated Dean. \u201cAnd get a new couch.\u201d Jared angrily went back to his room and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean went to the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. He wiped the burger sauce off his face. He was wearing a t-shirt that was much too tight. He wasn\u2019t like his exhibitionist brother who paraded around nearly naked. Especially since he started gaining weight he mostly kept himself clothed to almost hide the truth that he too had been getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his shirt as he looked in the mirror to see a slightly furry belly that protruded out and nearly flopped over his waistband. While Zach was all flab, Dean has a more muscular build and his fat wasn\u2019t quite as jiggly. But it was impossible to deny that Dean was losing his former definition to this growing gut. He put his shirt back down, covering the evidence and sighed. Jared was right, he thought. </span></div></div>",

He decided he should step on the scale. He slowly placed his feet on the scale and it read \"220\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, he thought to himself. 35 pounds. Before now he was afraid of how he would react, but now he got excited. He found himself aroused, and wanted to get bigger. Curiously, he called for Zach to weigh himself. He couldn't imagine just how much he would weigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footsteps slowly made their way to the bathroom. With each step, the bathroom commodities like toothbrushes and shampoo jumped in place. Finally Zach made it to the bathroom. He squeezed himself through the doorframe. It was both too short and too narrow for his larger younger brother. He seemed to get a little taller too. Zach's ginormous belly brushed against Dean's growing gut, barely enough room for the two to fit facing each other in the bathroom. Zach barely fit in the bathroom himself let alone with another guy there. Zach stepped on the scale, and shocked both of them.

His huge, hairy set of man boobs with large nipples sat on top of his yoga-ball sized gut. Under his gut hid his stretched-to the brim underwear, which failed to contain his huge ass and tree-trunk thick thighs. He looked at his puffy cheeks and double chin, and saw the fat roll developing on his elbow. He shook his fat gut. \"I'm huge!\" He said to Dean. He couldn't help but feel proud of his large size, as well as a little aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two growing brothers stared at their growing bodies in the mirror. Both content with getting bigger, their bellies growled almost on cue. They rushed out of the bathroom, with Zach quickly losing his breath, back to their bags of burgers, where Zach had to sit on the floor as nothing would hold him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing their feast, Jared walked by them and immediately exited the apartment, giving them a quick look of disgust on their way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean got up to make some milkshakes, adding weight gain powder to both their drinks, as Dean was now happy with how fat he was getting. While the shakes blended, Dean looked over at the weight gain powder, and couldn't help but to think of Jared.

He had decided he did like his new gut, but he was still more than 100 pounds lighter than his brother. He looked over to Zach who's fat ass was sticking out of the fridge, clearly looking for what he wanted to eat. He was wearing a too tight pair of underwear. He was always walking around in as little clothes as possible, partially because he barely had anything that fit and just because he was a confident guy, who enjoyed displaying his body. Whether he was 190 or 340, he liked his body and didn't give a damn about how anyone else felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean was a little less confident, especially since he'd tried to keep his gain somewhat hidden. But he was trying to embrace his new form and be more like his little brother. Dean removed his shirt, and decided he'd turn over a new leaf. He'd no longer be ashamed, especially if everyone was noticing his gains anyways. He sat in on the new living room couch and leaned back, his gut flopping with him. He rubbed it with a smirk as he chewed on some cookies that were beside him. He examined himself, noticing stretch marks and hair growing in. Dean used to shave himself frequently when he was living a more active lifestyle. But hair was growing in and he had felt no need to keep shaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach sat down beside him, flopping down and causing both men to jiggle quite a bit. Dean couldn't help but notice the way the couch sagged in Zach's direction, since he did weight 340 to Dean's 220. They were lucky to have found a new couch that could support almost 600 pounds of brothers. Zach snatched the cookies that were beside Dean, taking the whole box. Dean thought about how selfish Zach always was. \"Fuck man I was eating those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You snooze you lose,\" Zach greedily said as he munched on the cookies, crumbs spilled into his lap which was entirely covered by his colossal gut. Zach patted his belly arrogantly, causing widespread jiggling throughout his entire body. Dean found it very annoying when Zach would act like the big man in the apartment despite being the youngest, but the fact was, he was the big man, literally, even if he was an immature, selfish idiot, Dean thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach laughed at something on the television while Dean got distracted by his thoughts and made his way over to the kitchen. He went over to his stash of weight gain powders, sure to be quiet, but he knew that his fat little brother would be too focused on whatever he was watching on tv to hear what Dean was up to. He'd been oblivious to Dean's efforts to fatten him the past after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean decided...</span></div></div>",

Something in him enjoyed giving his brother a hard time about his weight. He deserved it and it certainly didn\u2019t seem to bother him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just wish you looked this good, little bro,\u201d Zach said laughing after having eaten a handful of chips. He shook his big belly for emphasis. Dean looked at it as it jiggled. The fat, the hair, the folds. His little brother was a big, fat, hairy dude and Dean was only going to make it even more noticeable if he had his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean finally came across something that piqued his interest. It was some untested non-FDA approved product that was meant to help people put on weight. It seemed to be geared towards people or animals with eating disorders. Dean worried slightly about what this product might do since it was so experimental. He looked over to his brother, his fat butt nearly busting through his black boxer briefs as he stuck his fat face into the fridge looking for something to eat. Soon, he\u2019d be as big as a fridge, Dean thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean went ahead and purchased the product which arrived a few days later. Late at night when everyone was asleep, Dean read the dosage and decided to add it to Zach\u2019s shake. Perhaps he went slightly over what was recommended, as he was fueled by his brothers greedy attitude. He placed the shake the fridge and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Dean woke up to see that the shake had been drank. He suspected Zach must have gotten up in the middle of the night and drank it. \u201cThat fat fuck,\u201d he thought.

Then again, Zach looked like he gained another 15, but he wasn't expecting this much success. His shirts were once strained by his biceps, now you could see the outline of a growing gut and the indent of a belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" Jared thought to himself, stepping off the scale that confirmed his 10 pound weight gain. As if to answer his question, Dean called out, \"Who's hungry for some healthy protein shakes?\" Jared heard the heavy thumping of Zach making his way to the kitchen. Jared exited the bathroom, and saw both Dean and Zach chugging their shakes. He noticed both their bare, hairy underbellies jiggle with each sip. No way Zach would be eating anything healthy... Jared thought. That's gotta be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way they'll get away with this... Jared thought, mistakingly blaming both brothers. Jared knew how to turn this around. The next day, Jared took out his 10 \"protein bars\" and 2 extra large \"protein shakes\" out of his bag. He slowly entered Zach's room, where he was sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to get fat?\" Jared whispered. \"I'm gonna make you huge.\" he whispered, and slowly fed Zach the weight gain bars and shake in his sleep. Zach slept away while being fed. Now Zach was eating 24 hours a day, with Jared feeding him when he was asleep. Yet, Jared didn't stop at just the bars and shakes. He brought some donuts from the kitchen, as well as cookies and brownies. Jared fed Zach for 2 hours straight, determined to get his revenge. And Jared would do this everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 2 weeks went by, and Dean was upset with Jared's progress. It looked like he had lost 5 pounds, certainly didn't look any bigger. He checked Jared's gym bag and saw the empty wrappers. \"Maybe I need to add more hunger stimulants and weight gain powder...\" Dean thought. He changed his recipe to double the concentration of weight gain ingredients. He even added 2 more bars to Jared's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Dean was placing the last treats into Jared's bag, Zach was calling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dean, I, uh, need some help!\" Zach called. Dean ran over, noticeably losing his breath. Dean couldn't help but to laugh at what he saw. Zach was stuck in the doorframe. While Jared seemed to be losing weight, Zach seemed to be getting fatter at double the pace. He looked 30 pounds bigger than 2 weeks ago. Just 2 months ago Zach was pushing 300, now he was pushing 400 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly bulged out of the doorframe, his moobs squeezed together on top. Zach managed to fit his belly through the door, but couldn't fit his broad and fattened shoulders. Dean pulled his brother by the arms, trying to squeeze him through. Eventually, with one last big tug, Zach was pulled out, and he flopped on the floor on top of his smaller, younger brother. Dean quickly lost his breath, as Zach was too heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared came back from the gym and saw the two fattened brothers sprawled out on the floor and couldn't help to laugh. He helped the two up. Once Zach was back on his feet, he turned toward the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you blending a shake earlier.\" Zach said, and shoved a donut in his mouth. \"Can I have one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared couldn't help but smirk, as Zach began on his second donut.

The apartment, his clothes, the furniture... it was all becoming too small for Zach who's rate of growth had only accelerated since both Dean and Jared had been making efforts to fatten the lazy 22 year old. While Zach wasn't completely oblivious, he seemed content to continue growing fatter and fatter. One had to wonder when anyone would recognize that enough is enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks passed, with Jared upping his efforts to fatten Zach by adding some supplements of his own to his food. Both he and Dean began bringing food to Zach quite often. With the increase of his weight, Zach became increasingly lazy, particularly because lugging around 375 pounds wasn't exactly easy. But as much as Dean and Jared enjoyed fattening their younger roommate, Zach seemed to enjoy being the big man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dean!\" Zach shouted, as if Dean wasn't only feet away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming,\" Dean replied, as he piled high food on several plates and brought them over to his brother. After the incident where Zach got stuck in the door frame, he stayed in the living room. They had purchased a new heavy duty futon that could support Zach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean hadn't neglected his own appetite of course. His belly flopping over his waistband and jiggling with each step as he brought a platter of food to his 'little' brother. But his increased efforts to make sure Zach's growing appetite was satisfied had cut down on his own overindulgence. Taking care of Zach was becoming a full time job, and between that and his actual job, Dean hadn't exactly had the peace he wanted. Fortunately, he and Jared finally had interests that were aligned and they could take shifts taking care of Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean had to wonder if this was a slippery slope however. For now it was just bringing Zach food but as he continued to grow would they have to help him wash and do other things? These thoughts constantly went through Dean's head as he contributed to his fattening brothers growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean walked over to Zach's futon, which was propped in front of the television. Zach was leaning back onto a pile of pillows, supporting his fattened face and neck, his beard failing to hide his multiple chins. As Dean looked down from Zach's face he saw his huge flabby moobs, covered in dark brown hair, and finally the biggest belly he'd ever seen. Even though he saw Zach growing daily, his gut seemed particularly impressive today. It was threatening to envelop the new futon already as this giant, heavy, furry sack of flesh, covered in rolls and stretch marks jiggled up and down with every small movement that Zach (or anyone in the apartment for that matter) had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean delivered with several plates of food, only for Zach to devour them in minutes. \"More,\" Zach said with his mouthful of food. Dean expected this response and knew Jared was on his way back from picking up several pizzas for Zach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared and Alec returned with the pizzas moments later and laid six of them on Zach's chest for him to devour. Surely 400 pounds was not far off with the amount of food Zach was consuming combined with the lack of much physical activity. Both young men couldn't help but be in awe of Zach's body. They remember the 200 pound kid who moved in with almost a year ago, and how he'd grown into this 375 pound monster. Astonishingly he'd almost doubled in size, and his huge belly was at the forefront of that growth. Zach continued to scarf down pizza at an alarming rate, each chew sending ripples all throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared, Alec and Dean stood beside each other in the kitchen. They shared one pizza, hoping Zach wouldn't realize there was more food in the house that he couldn't get his greedy paws on. Dean sighed. Jared looked over at Zach, his belly could be seen from over the top of the futon, and he could hear grunting noises as he continued to make his way through the food. He had a box of beers beside him as well, an occasional burp could be heard. As Zach's weight increased his ability to outdrink anyone did as well. He could drink a 30 pack himself and not even seem drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three roommates in the kitchen looked over at Zach, the literal elephant in the room, waiting for someone to say something.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Dean questioned his new life that centered around fattening Zach, Jared still seemed aroused and obsessed with the idea. Jared asked, \"I wonder how fat we can make him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach, although he could move, was basically immobile. He couldn't fit in any room, he had no incentives to leave the apartment, all he had to do was eat and sleep. Dean couldn't help to feel jealous, here he and Jared were acting on every command. All Dean wanted to do was pig out with his brother, and all Jared wanted to do was to feed Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Zach finished the 7 boxes of pizza and box of mere, and he shouted \"more!\" Jared jumped at the opportunity. \"I'll get you more now!\" he said fanatically. he mixed heavy cream with 5 times the portion size for the weight gain powder with some vanilla ice cream to make Zach a super shake. There were probably 2 liters worth, and Jared poured it down Zach's throat. \"more...\" he said as he finished the shake. Luckily for Zach, Dean was already prepared with 3 bags of burgers from work. He had hoped to save them for himself when no one was looking, but now it seemed like Zach needed them more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll hold him off for a while, or at least enough time for me to get some food from outside. I'll be back!\" Jared said, and ran out the door. Dean looked in the apartment for some food for him to eat, and found nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Zach had finished, and still wanted more food. Just as he called for Dean, Jared entered the apartment with at least 10 bags of pastries. While Zach seemed to get fatter and fatter, Jared seemed to get more sculpted and stronger to feed Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared handed Zach 4 large cakes and Zach dug in. He really became a beast with his appetite. Dean attempted to sneak a few donuts for himself, but Jared shoo-ed his hand away, took the box, and began feeding Zach. Dean rolled his eyes. Dean decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dean decided if he wanted to eat, he should eat. He left the apartment and headed to an all-you-can-eat buffet. With a mixture of hunger and anger fueling Dean, the aroma of all kinds of fattening foods at the buffet acted as a stimulus, and Dean dug in. He shoved any and all food he could in his face. Whether it was pizza, burgers, steak, pasta, cookies, brownies, cakes, anything that he could fit in his mouth, he shoved down. He acted like an animal. With every new plate he got, the buttons on his shirt strained. He found it harder and harder to squeeze into the booth with every plate. He couldn't explain his unstoppable hunger, and could only shove more food in his greedy mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours later, Dean had a massive gut sitting on his lap. He undid his jeans hours ago, and his underbelly was left exposed. Finally he felt full, and managed to waddle back home. Knowing Zach would be hungry, he brought some left overs from the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Dean entered the apartment, it seemed as if Jared had just ran out of food to feed Zach, who unsurprisingly, was still hungry. He let Jared have a break, who used the time to head to the gym, while Dean fed Zach his leftovers. By the time he finished the bag, Zach drifted off into a food coma. Perfect time for Dean to fall into one himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean's newfound love for gaining managed to establish a schedule for the men of the apartment. Dean would work a shift at Fatburger; and while he was there he would stuff his face with as much fattening food as he could the entire time. Meanwhile, Jared would be at home stuffing Zach. When Dean got off his shift, Jared went to his, and Dean would stuff Zach with burgers from work. Soon, Jared would come home, and Dean would head to the buffet as Jared stuffed Zach. Again, the two would switch, and Jared would head to the gym for a workout. This became routine, and in a month, resulted in drastic changes to everyone's physiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-One month later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean woke up after a long night of stuffing Zach, and stretched. He sat up, with much difficulty, and shoved a brownie from the bedstand into his mouth. Dean slept naked, as most of his clothes no longer fit. Dean waddled over to the bathroom, with each step sending ripples throughout his entire body. Dean shoved his fat body into the bathroom, facing a little trouble making it through the doorframe. After using the bathroom, he caught sight of himself in the mirror. How could he not, he took up the entire reflection. His huge, fat, hairy body filled up the entire room. His large moobs sat ontop of a gigantic protruding stomach. He tried to turn to get a view of his globe-sized buttcheeks but his belly knocked some of the stuff on the sink over. He had huge thighs. If it weren't for his hanging gut, he's be able to see his junk as well. His cheeks were puffy, he was unrecognizable from the ex-jock he once saw in the mirror. He decided to step on the scale; which read 270lbs. He had gained 50 pounds in just over a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling to get on his uniform, Dean waddled to exit the apartment, and saw his other two roommates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared was huge. Not in the sense of Dean and Zach, but his muscles were gigantic. He too gave up shirts, as his bulging pecs and biceps couldn't stop ripping shirts. He had the most defined 6-pac, with a large set of pecs, thick neck, huge broad shoulders. All the lifting of food to feed Zach and motivation to the gym made him gain at least 40 pounds of pure muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared's muscles hugely contrasted Zach. If Dean had thought Zach was fat before, now he was hugs. He barely fit into the living room. The old futon was long gone, he now sat atop of 2 mattresses stacked on one another. Still, he didn't fit on those. It was no surprise Zach gained the most weight, as he ate the most and moved the least. Zach weighed about 550 lbs, gaining 150 pounds in the month that passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing immobile and eating all day also changed his personality. He became spoiled and greedy, demanding at all times. He expected food at all hours of the day, no care for anyone else. He was also horny all the time. He could not reach his own junk, so Jared often helped him out. Jared was shoving a gigantic plate of bacon into Zach's mouth. Jared had to straddle Zach's belly to reach his mouth. When there wasn't food in Zach's mouth, Zach would be yelling for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean eventually made his way to the door and squeezed through the doorframe. At work, he sat in managers office for 5 hours straight, eating nonstop. He managed to break the chair of the office, and fell on the ground. Life was good. And fat. And hungry, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Dean got home to see Zach still eating strong, and Jared taking a break in the kitchen. There,</span></div></div>",

Zach's carefree attitude and lazy lifestyle was more than appealing. Dean had spend so many years of his life uptight and being a gym rat, but he was happier with his new potbelly and it was making him feel insignificant and small with his 'little' brother being such a massive man, at 550 lbs. He wanted to be that big. Scratch that, he wanted to be bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jared,\" Dean called from his room. He was squeezing into some tight sweatpants and removing his shirt. Jared walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Dean,\" Jared said poking his flabby gut. \"If you keep at it you'll end up like your brother,\" he said gesturing so Zach who had fallen asleep after devouring nearly all of the food in the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of what I wanted to ask you about,\" Dean began. He sat on his bed which creaked under his 270 pound frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could help me gain weight?\" he started. \"You've done such a good job with Zach, and I've realized I kind of want to be bigger,\" he said. He hesitated and couldn't believe the words coming out of his mouth, but he was sure that's what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're sure that's what you want, I can help,\" Jared said. He put his strong hand on his buddy's shoulder. \"Zach's not going to like sharing though,\" he said, almost laughing but also fearful of what would come of this. He had to wonder how he was going to handle both brothers, not to mention his own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Dean and Jared heard Zach stirring. \"I'm hungry,\" he bellowed from the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable,\" Jared said sighing. Both Dean and Jared wondered if Zach had heard any of what they discussed. They figured Zach was too distracted by his hunger to have heard anything. </span></div></div>",

One after another until the whole dozen was stuffed in Dean's belly. Dean moaned in pleasure. He sat back on his bed, and ate while Jared brought the food to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, loud BOOMS were heard coming from the living room. It had been 15 minutes into the stuffing session when the booms started, and 5 minutes passed until they stopped. Both men were confused about what the noise was. Suddenly a large shadow made its way into the room. The two gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had gotten up from his seat! His place that he hadn't moved from in weeks! Dean couldn't believe his eyes, and didn't think his brother was even mobile. Zach attempted to get into the door, but his belly was too large for the doorframe, it couldn't even squeeze in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, I'm hungry!\" Zach said. Jared looked confused. Who should he stuff? Before he could choose, Dean got up, and handed some food to Zach. <br>\r\n\"Then eat!\" Dean said. Zach couldn't believe his eyes. From being fed and waited on to having to feed himself! What was this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared couldn't handle the two boys fighting to be fed. He decided that he would have to rely more on weight gain shakes to feed them both. He would spend 1 hour feeding one brother, while the other drank weight gain shakes, and then alternate between the two. That had to be the only way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Jared tested out his idea. He hooked Zach up to a machine that would flow weight gain shakes into his mouth endlessly, and fattened up Dean with various cakes and fast food. After an hour passed, he switched. His system seemed to he working... but he lost a lot of time to himself. He had to have food and shakes delivered, and no longer went to the gym. His life revolved around fattening the two brothers, and he couldn't be happier. </span></div></div>",

Sure, every other hour Jared would come in and feed him some cakes burgers and pizza, but Zach needed real food. He liked real food. He was hungry for some real food. Yet, the weight gain shake was definitely better than going without eating every hour. Yet Zach fantasized about shoving his whole face into a huge, chocolatey cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had felt this way for the entire month since Dean had decided he wanted to be stuffed. Sure it wasn't bad at first, but now he grew bored. Dean would never let him have anything to himself. If Zach wanted to play a sport, Dean would have to play better. If Zach wanted to grow huge to 810 pounds, Dean would have to be bigger. Zach hadn't seen his brother in two weeks, ever since Dean got too big to fit through his own bedroom door. He wondered how big he had gotten. Certainly not bigger than me, he hoped. He worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis worries were set aside when Dean's door opened and Jared squished his way out. Since committing all his time to fattening his two roommates, Jared had no time for himself, including the gym, or eating healthy meals. Jared had gotten pretty big, but was big to start. He still had his huge muscles, thick neck, broad muscled shoulders, but they were connected to a large hairy gut. He too stopped wearing clothes as they got too small. Jared must've been around 240 pounds. He ate whatever he was feeding his ex-jocks, and ate whenever he had a second. Yet his biceps were still huge. This got Zach thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Zach (and Jared between bites) was stuffed with cake, pizza, burgers, brownies, cupcakes, fries, and a wider variety of the most fattening foods, Jared was preparing more weight gain shake. \"Hey Jared!\" Zach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared turn around with a brownie in his mouth. \"Yeah?\" he blurted out, and shoved another brownie in his mouth. \"I was thinking of going to the gym.\" Jared almost choked on his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be able to feed myself whatever and whenever I want, since you're so focused on Dean.\" Zach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared almost laughed. \"The only reason you can't feed yourself is because you ate so much food! And even if you do manage to get mobile again, you'll just eat your way back!\" Jared explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I keep up with exercise, get a nice muscle-gut combo like you fatso!\" Zach said, perfectly catching Jared with a mouthful of donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we even get you to the gym? You can't even get you through the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe bring some equipment here...\" Zach said. </span></div></div>",

He was tall and fairly thin with dark features though his hair was dyed bleach blonde. He had a skater punk vibe to him and had visible tattoos on his arms, and even his fingers. He had a few piercings as well. Zach and Chris had become fast friends at work over the past few weeks, Chris had gotten used to seeing Zach stuff himself on treats from the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s up with you?\u201d Zach asked, leaning on the counter as he ate a flaky scone, getting crumbs all over his apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, just studying for exams. Thank fuck I\u2019ve only got a few weeks left this semester,\u201d Chris replied. \u201cI may need you to take a couple shifts off my hands next week before finals,\u201d he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d Zach said with his mouthful of a danish, the next thing he could get his greedy hands on. Zach didn\u2019t mind the extra shifts, after all it was more time in the bakery which was usually pretty easy and he had free reign of whatever food was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI probably can\u2019t go get drinks after work either. After this semester is over though man, we\u2019ll have to go out and celebrate,\u201d Chris said, trying to motivate himself for the next few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d Zach said, again with his mouth full. Chris couldn\u2019t even tell what he was shoving into his mouth now. He just laughed at his gluttonous friend. He really was going to need that new shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe again poked Zach squarely in the stomach. Zach gave a playful punch in response. In the process he dropped a pastry he had been holding on the floor. And soon, Zach\u2019s ripped shirt wasn\u2019t the only problem. He bent down, and said \u201cfive second rule,\u201d joking that it was still okay to eat. As he bent down, Zach\u2019s pants ripped right between his growing cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris got quite an eyeful as he could see Zach\u2019s plump butt through a massive hole in the back of his pants. Zach\u2019s underwear weren\u2019t doing a great job of containing his growing ass either as it threatened to rip through them too.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jared was a bit surprised as he wasn't expecting to have his own intern but was thankful for the added help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon learning about each other, Jared found out James was the top of his class, played soccer in high school and was student body president.

Alec and his construction buddy Joey were finishing their work for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we better,\" Joey gestured over towards an older gentleman about sixty feet away. \"Before the boss man comes by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy hour?\" Alec smiled as he moved a few boxed around. He knew that Joey was going to agree to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously,\" Joey quipped, patting Alec on his sweat-soaked shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec and Joey had been working construction together on the job site for almost three months. Ever since he'd joined the team, Joey had become Alec's little buddy, emphasis on the word little. Alec was a pretty big dude, standing at 6'6\" and had a bit of bulk to him. In contrast, Joey was a much smaller and slimmer 5'6\". Despite the size disparity, Joey and Alec got along swimmingly since the day the met. Joey was only 23 and Alec showed him the ropes around the construction site and the two had become fast friends. It had become a routine for the two of them to hit up happy hour once their shift was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlikely pair headed to their lockers to change out of their sweaty clothes. Alec was drenched, his shirt underneath his vest was almost transparent, clinging to his skin. He was carrying about 215 pounds on his large frame, in fairness. Alec removed his tight and wet shirt, before opening his locker. Alec was a confident guy, not shy about walking around shirtless or even pantless at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked over at Alec and smiled. The two of them were so opposite, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for bottomless wings, bro?\" Alec smacked his wet hairy stomach in excitement. Joey just smiled and gave him a thumbs up as he fumbled with his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey was much shier than Alec about his body, though he had no reason to be. He was a trim 155 pounds which was perfectly average for his height. He had a bit of lean muscle but was far and away the smallest guy at the construction site. Joey wasn't even really sure how he ended up there considering he wasn't exactly your big, strong guy like his buddy Alec. Despite that Joey was a hard worker and could actually do more than most expected from him. Some of the guys would give him a hard time about his size, even Alec. It didn't bother him when Alec made comments though because they were legitimate friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to keep up with you,\" Joey replied as he watched Alec squeeze into a fairly tight tank top, his furry belly peering out of the bottom before he tugged it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec laughed. He knew that was not going to happen, but he liked trying to push Joey outside of his comfort zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey quickly slid into his clean shirt. He was a hairy Italian dude, and was not really a confident person, so he changed in a much more subdued way than his big, confident buddy Alec. He even dressed more conservatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the other guys walked into the locker room as Joey and Alec headed to their happy hour spot. \"Goin' to McNulty's?\" one of the bigger guys asked as he saw them headed out. It was well known that was Alec's favorite post-work spot due to the cheap beer and the bottomless wing specials for happy hour. Alec would always try to get out of work early to catch it when he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it,\" Alec replied. Joey just smiled with his mouth closed. Everyone at the site respected Alec, perhaps they were intimidated by him, but Joey often felt put down or ignored. He didn't let it get to him, and Alec always made him feel better about it. He thought that if someone was loved as Alec was his closest friend that everyone else would follow suit and think he was just as cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch you later, big guy,\" one of them said to Alec as he punched him on the shoulder. \"You too, little guy. Almost couldn't see you back there\", he added as he saw Joey from behind Alec. Joey suspected he was just messing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bar, Alec ordered his usual beer of choice along with the bottomless wings. He wasted no time digging in. Joey tried to keep up but would almost always end up stopping several rounds before Alec. He also took his time more with his beer while Alec really packed it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to keep up with me tonight, bud,\" Alec said, playfully nudging Joey beside him. Joey knew it was unrealistic but something in him really wanted to impress and make Alec happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do,\" Joey said as he started eating and drinking at a more Alec-like pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

He looked almost sick after eating seven plates of wings and drinking six beers. Alec gave a disapproving look but put his big arm around his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Alec said as he gulped down more beer. \"You tried your best man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll ever be able to out eat you and that monster,\" Joey replied, patting Alec's bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not,\" Alec said. He pulled up his shirt and gave his hairy belly a squeeze. He rolled his shirt back down and dove back into his wings. \"But I can help train you, man. If you want to eat be able to keep up with me.\" Joey couldn't tell if Alec was joking or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey just watched Alec continue to eat and drink for a moment or two before saying anything.</span></div></div>",

Plus, Joey had always been the little guy. He was tired of it. Maybe getting bigger was his chance to see what life was like on the other side.

Alec handed Joey the bottle. It was surprisingly small compared to products he'd seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... use this?\" Joey asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, no need. I'm just big naturally,\" he said, petting his furry and firm gut which he'd lifted up his shirt to expose. \"If I took that stuff I'd be as big as a house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why do you have it?\" Joey asked, wondering why his friend was so eager and willing to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend works at a lab and has given me some products he's working on. So it's sort of experimental. I figured maybe it would be something that interested you. I know you hate being the little guy around the site,\" Alec said earnestly, patting his little buddy on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey just smiled sweetly. Alec was a good friend, he thought. He didn't even need to tell him about what things he wanted or needed, he just knew. Of course it couldn't have been hard to tell, with Joey relentlessly being teased for his size. Most of the guys there wonder why he even works at a construction site at a measly 5'6\" and maybe 150 pounds. Most of the guys were at least 30 pounds bigger and Joey had nearly 75 pounds on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, take some,\" Alec urged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey shrugged his shoulders in response. He looked down at the bottle, reading the dosage carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there side effects?\" Joey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck if I know dude,\" Alec said. \"You gotta take risks sometimes, bro,\" he smiled and leaned back in his chair, looking very relaxed as Joey eyed the bottle and opened it up.</span></div></div>",

Explain what it is you want, and she'll sort you out,\" Alec said, delivering it like some sort of Italian mafia boss. To be honest, he sort of looked like one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... okay,\" Joey struggled to respond. He thought this all sounded a bit strange but the earnestness in Alec's eyes won him over. He seemed to not be able to say no to anything that Alec asked of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be nervous little guy. You're never going to be a big man without some confidence and swagger like your boy,\" Alec laughed and patted his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Joey took the card with him and with his next day off, he decided to head to this mysterious place. It was a seemingly minimalistic storefront, he saw nobody around the shop when he walked in. It looked less like a psychic shop than he expected. As he entered further he only saw a bell on the counter, he assumed to ring for any attention. He nervously approached the bell and gave it a ding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a woman appeared from the back of the store. Marie, he assumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you dear?\" the woman said as she approached. She was in her fifties, Joey assumed, and sort of attractive for her age. She definitely gave off the vibe of some sort of mystic or witch, which made Joey a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure,\" Joey said, looking away from Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. Let me look into your eyes, dear. I will be able to tell what you seek,\" Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey took his averted gaze and looked at Marie in her deep blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, I see. I know what it is you want. Don't be ashamed dear,\" Marie said in her soothing voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey just continued to look into her eyes. He felt almost hypnotized by her gaze as she stared back into his green eyes. She put her hands on his face, feeling his slight stubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make your wish a reality. You wish...\"</span></div></div>",

What is important is that you be honest with yourself and the person you want to become,\" Marie said. \"I want to visualize how you'd like yourself to look and give me your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey put his hands out, and Marie placed what felt like a crystal into his hands. \"Grasp that tightly,\" Marie stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie whispered some incantations and the crystal appeared to glow slightly. Joey couldn't tell as his hands were clasped around the crystal but he was sure he felt something - a light, a vibe, a sense - that the crystal did have some sort of energy. He did as he was told, however, as Marie finished her quiet chants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is it,\" Marie said succinctly, retrieving the crystal from Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Joey said, still perplexed. He itched his light brown spiky hair in bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will get what it is you seek, darling,\" Marie said, confidently. She put her hand on his shoulder assuringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I... pay you for this?\" Joey wondered. His earnest green eyes looking at the middle-aged mystic intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will. The matter of payment will be dealt with when you get what you want. Come back to me when you feel you've been fulfilled,\" Marie said. \"I assure you, you will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Um, thank you,\" Joey replied. He didn't exactly know what to do so he just shook her hand and left. She smirked as he left the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey left the store, grabbed something to eat and headed back to his apartment. He got into his underwear and slid underneath the covers. He went to bed wondering if seeing Madame Marie was a waste of time or if he'd actually get what it is he desired.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days go by without much change. Joey seemed to think that the wish was bogus as he saw nothing really change in his life. Joey looked at himself in the mirror as he did most days, saw the short dirty-brown haired, green eyed, clean cut guy staring back. He had a small happy trail on his skinny stomach that he rubbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" he said to himself looking in the mirror and seeing no real difference from the day before. He never had much faith in this magical wish bullshit anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to work and saw Alec there and smiled. \"How's it goin' little buddy?\" Alec asked kindly, not knowing how much those words actually stung. Joey was always the little guy, it's why he was compelled to wish to grow. But he figured that was all for nothing now. At least he hadn't needed to pay the Madame Marie, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All is good, man,\" he replied back to Alec, who gave him a playful slap on the back. Alec didn't know his own strength, it was always almost too much for Joey's smaller stature to handle. Joey braced himself for the days work and went about his business. They went about their typical day like usual: work out in the sun, head to the bar for food and drinks, and repeat the next workday. Joey didn't have a particularly interesting weekend either. Unfortunately for him he had obnoxious roommates, and often avoided his common area from having to deal with them. Both were bigger jock type guys, and they treated Joey like a little brother, like most people in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be until the next week when Joey considered that maybe his wish was coming true. He woke up on a Monday morning, not having put on his work clothes in days, and he noticed that they were a little tight. Joey had almost completely forgotten about his encounter with Madame Marie, and shrugged off the tight pants as being due to the shitty washer in the basement shrinking his stuff. It wasn't until he sat down to post-work drinks with Alec, that his slight growth was noticed. He sipped on his beer and Alec glanced down at his little buddy. He gave his stomach a pinch. \"Is this what I think it is?\" Alec joked with Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey was a little squeamish when it came to touch but from Alec, it felt different. Joey looked down at his stomach and noticed a tiny little roll. \"Oh shit,\" he said aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, little buddy. It suits you,\" Alec said with a smile as he sipped on his own beer. An order of wings and some burgers came the boys way and both dove in. Alec even remarked that Joey was eating more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like you're going through puberty or something,\" Alec joked with his friend. \"Maybe you'll finally have a growthspurt.\" Joey knew Alec was being playful, and to him Alec could do no wrong but it was something irritating to him that he was always picked on about his size, even by one of his best friends. \"Guess so,\" Joey said chomping on some fries. With Alec's encouragement he almost kept up with Alec, having finished off several pitchers of beer, wings, a burger, and some fries. His bloated stomach spoke for itself after the night was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weeks went on and Joey slowly but surely began to grow. It wasn't enough for anyone to notice that it was anything but natural, but the more he began to grow, so did his appetite. It had been two weeks and Joey had put on 15 pounds. He was still a slim guy, just with a little bit of a paunch to him. He examined himself in the mirror as he'd been doing more frequently recently and pinched his little love handles. \"What are you doing in there?\" yelled one of his roommates as he knocked on the door. \"I gotta shower, baby Joey!\" Joey just rolled his eyes, he hated that nickname from his roommate Shawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe examined himself even closer, looking at the mirror with a glint in his eye. Joey thought...</span></div></div>",

He had some dark brown chest hair and a happy trail sprinkled along his body, but he was pretty clean cut for his construction site. Many of the other guys had beards or a lot of hair all over them, not Joey though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past three years he\u2019d never really had any changes in weight or height.

He sighed, feeling disappointed the whole Madame Marie thing and his failed desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to move past it and got ready for the day. After his shower had a couple bowls of cereal and a bagel, a typical morning meal for Joey. When he arrived at the construction site however he had noticed something odd.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t shocking to see Alec up or down a few pounds but for whatever reason today Alec seemed bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey shrugged it off as nothing. After all he did take down many, many rounds of wings and beer last night. They began their work day and it was a particularly hot day. Alec was a sweaty guy and his wife beater shirt was nearly transparent by lunchtime. Joey couldn\u2019t help but notice the bulky, brooding beast that Alec was. For whatever reason Joey couldn\u2019t shake off his fixation with Alec today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey, Alec and a few of the other guys took lunch together. Alec had to go to his locker and grab a new t-shirt as he\u2019d fully sweat through the one he was wearing before. As he takes it off, Joey can\u2019t help but notice a little extra jiggle. Alec was a big guy all over covered in thick muscle, not particularly flabby usually, so this struck him as odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alec slid his shirt on he noticed himself that it was particularly snug. He struggled to slide it over his broad body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe too much beer last night, eh?\u201d one of the other guys, Owen joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo much? Not enough?\u201d Alec said and patted his gut which was hardly contained in his new shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys went to a restaurant to grab some food. Joey got a couple burgers, as did the other three guys with them. Alec went big because he always did and got six. After scarfing them all down, Alec was still hungry for more and got a whole pizza for himself. Of course he was washing it down with his favorite, beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez Alec, even for you this is kind of a lot,\u201d Rob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a growing boy,\u201d Alec chirped back giving one of his smaller friends a heavy smack on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate none of you can keep up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their meal they headed back to the site. Joey was impressed that Alec was even mobile after the ginormous lunch he scarfed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Alec as the afternoon went on. He continued working, sweating, and Joey was convinced that he was growing. He wondered if maybe his wish was misconstrued and Alec was growing instead of him. Again, he tried his best to shake off these thoughts and go about his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day came to a close, back by the lockers Joey got a good look at Alec in all his glory before they would head to their usual happy hour spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed...</span></div></div>",

He turned around and Joey couldn\u2019t help but notice his furry butt looked more rounded and chunky than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guys, Brandon, walked by and couldn\u2019t resist a big smack on Alec\u2019s exposed butt. It was playful and not all that uncommon in the locker room. Joey watched Alec\u2019s body fat jiggle, transfixed on it. Alec was a bulky guy but he had a strong muscular build, with a coating of fat on top. It was just more pronounced than Joey had ever noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec, Joey and some of the other guys showered before they headed for happy hour drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey changed quickly as always, he wasn\u2019t particularly confident in his body in the way that Alec was.

But Alec seemed completely oblivious to it. Nobody else around them seemed to be aware of it either, the general \u2018big guy\u2019 remarks were standard for a guy Alec\u2019s size. He was already a giant among men, surely nobody would notice a few extra pounds besides Joey who felt maybe he was responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey tried to avert his gaze as Alec struggled to get into his jeans.
