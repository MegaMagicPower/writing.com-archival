He has been watching the other children getting adopted and he wished that he was adopted by someone special. He is a good, kind, and sweet; but his mother is not good to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, we are going to see who will be adopting him, which will be a lucario; but not any lucario, Lucille the lucario. She is neighbor to the boy and his mother, but she loved the boy like he was her own son. Lucille would go see the boy after his mother and she was caught by his mother so that lead to a fight, but the end results was the boy was sent to an orphanage and Lucille was given a warning. She is looking at her chest while thinking about having a kid and Lucille sensed something by using her aura and she will check the orphanage out tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne child is going to be very lucky to have me as their mother and I will be the best mother to them.\u201d she said hugging her chest in a loving way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow will be the day.\u201d she said as getting ready for bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille had her new day planned out as she went to sleep, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy\u2019s birth mother is smiling because she doesn\u2019t have to watch her son and his father is out of the picture, but she still thinks of her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was a good son and he was cute when he was born.\u201d She said thinking about her son<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to get ready for her bath before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife is good.\u201d she said soaking in the tub<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to bed as well and she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate or destiny has a way screwing a person\u2019s life and it\u2019s how they deal with it, but the effects are both good and bad. Tomorrow will be quite a day for some people and it will be a bad day for others. The boy\u2019s name is Kai. Time to look forward to a new day and a good day.</span></div></div>",

Our three characters are waking up and they are getting ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I be adopted today? I hope so.\u201d Kia said as he made his bed before getting a hot shower even though he is an electric mouse, but he will be fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother day, another chance to make some money.\u201d His mother said as she left for work<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s find that special child and give them a good home.\u201d Lucille said as she saw that woman left and went to the orphanage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille was thinking of what she sensed last night and she was also thinking ways to get bigger, but she is only focusing on adopting a child. She is walking down the street to the only orphanage in the city, but she was thinking of what she was told after the trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, I\u2019m glad to hear that you wanted to care for the boy and he could have someone like you.\u201d The judge said to her after everyone has gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes your Honor.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA day will be the day for you to adopt the boy after you see that woman left for work and hopefully you will meet his father and he can have a family that truly loves him.\u201d He warned her as she nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder about him and I still need to know some things.\u201d She said as she was walking to the door of the orphanage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was inside, the receptionist spotted her and they started to talk about adopting a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to give one of these children a home?\u201d she asked Lucille<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I do and I will do what I can to provide the child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we have a selection for you to choose from and all of them need a good home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that all of them need a good home and a family that will care for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked till Lucille was given a tour of the orphanage and noticed the children looking at her, but she found all, but one child that she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, is there another child living here?\u201d she asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but he was the most recent one we have here and he was put here by his mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille stopped and she knew the child that the receptionist was talking about, but the receptionist noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am; but can you show me where the child is and I will be gladly to give him a good home.\u201d Lucille said as they went to the sleeping quarters for the children<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai was in his room thinking of his dreams and he didn\u2019t hear the coming footsteps down the hall. He was dressed with the clothes that his mother sent with him and he sitting on his well-made bed as the door opened. He didn\u2019t hear the door opening and closing, but he was pulled into a hug with his sinking into something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday, you will be my son and I will take good care of you.\u201d He heard as he knew the voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and he saw lucille next to him; but he just jumped onto her and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou came for me.\u201d He said happily and she hugged him back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did, your real mother will have to find out sooner or later.\u201d She said to him as he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left his room they could fill out the papers for him to be her son for life and he went to collect his things from his room. Soon with the paperwork done, they left the orphanage by taking a cab and they reached home in no time. Kai was looking at his old home before walking inside his new one and she gave him a tour of his new home. Their ranch-style home is a two-story house with a pool in the backyard; the first floor has the living room, kitchen and a minibar next to it; and a storage area for the water heaters and other things. The second floor has three bedrooms, two guestrooms and the other bedroom is for luke and herself.</span></div></div>",

An already well-endowed nidoqueen girl laid breasts-down on a mat, thoroughly enjoying the growth all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooohhhh.... now I see why this salon of yours is so popular with the girls around this neighborhood, Randore.\" Cooed the nidoqueen girl, rubbing her figure of 62-20-34, with the breasts quickly reaching the 80 mark before stopping, \"Those spells of yours are a little... tingly, though.\" \"Chaos magic tends to have that effect sometimes, so... it's a given, Sharon.\" Replied Randore, with a pidgeot girl of 82-16-30 playfully rubbing her swollen breasts into Randore's rump with her own, causing her to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Randore, care to show us a little... growth demonstration?\" Asked the pidgeot girl, giggling. Randore smiled, rubbing her bosom. \"Well Glenda, since you were kind enough to ask... watch how I grow.\" Randore adjusted her figure to 20-18-20 via her magic, before she began to slowly expand her hourglass figure via the use of bulk-up, her curves swelling up by the inch with each use of said technique. \"This is a little something I learned from a blaziken friend of mine, Helen.\" Randore added as her figure reached 25-18-25. \"Doesn't that get tiring after a while?\" Asked Sharon. \"That part's true.\" The chaos lugia girl replied, \"But keeping at it will eventually allow you to get the curves you need faster... though I might warn you, you could end up milkful as well.\" Sharon chuckled, tenderly patting her bosom. \"There's never such a thing as too much milk in this neighborhood, I'll tell you.\" The nidoqueen girl smiled, watching as Randore's curves reached 42-18-42... only for her boobs, hips, and butt cheeks to grow two inches wider once Randore tried the technique again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I bet Helen was <b>really</b> into using that technique during those workout sessions.\" Gasped Glenda, watching as Randore began panting as she continued bulking her curves up to 60-18-60 and still going. \"Well... she's always... available... if you... wanna... learn that... technique.\" Randore responded, taking a break midsentence in between bulk-ups, \"It still... takes... a lot... of uses to... \"level\" up, though.\" Randore's figure reached 102-18-102, still getting larger. The two pokegirls looked at each other, then nodded before turning their attention back to Randore. \"We'll tell Helen you suggested us to meet you if she asks.\" Glenda said, still enjoying Randore grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Randore know, someone was bound to walk in on the chaos lugia herself, growing her curves. Randore stopped expanding herself at 120-18-120, panting in exhaustion. \"See what I mean, ladies?\" Randore began, \"Using that version of the bulk-up skill will get you bigger, faster.\" Randore nuzzled herself into her assets whilst Glenda heard the bell by the salon door open. \"Hm? Now who could be coming over here at this time?\" Wondered the curvaceous pidgeot girl, watching as Randore began admiring her swollen curves.</span></div></div>",

Wasting no time, Randore casted a growth spell on Lucile, whom began growing by the inch in her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Randore, you shouldn't have.\" Cooed Lucile, stroking her figure, reaching 62-16-52 and still growing; Kai turned around and saw Lucille growing right before his eyes before shifting his attention back to Glenda and Sharon. \"Wow... I didn't know Lu was into growing, too.\" Kai said, blushing a little. \"Oh, in this neighborhood, a lot of us pokegirls are really into getting big.\" Glenda replied. \"Whether it's for fun, or for being more huggable.\" Added Sharon, \"For those of us that can't fly, even floating through the air when we float.\" \"Ah. I see.\" Kai responded, giggling nervously whilst blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille's hourglass figure reached 66-16-56 and kept on growing; she began stroking her breasts tenderly as she caught a fond flashback of herself getting expanded at the magic sauna, which caused her figure to spurt out to 76-16-66. Outside the salon, a dusknoir man unwittingly caught a glimpse of the open backroom door, then kept on moving. \"Hmm... so that's what Randore does in there. No wonder many pokegirls here come out big.\" He thought to himself, \"Come to think of it... maybe I'll make a drink that does something like that back at the Jade Spire tavern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after a while of growing, Lucille's hourglass figure reached 90-16-80... with her butt ballooning out an additional ten inches to match. Kai turned around and saw how much larger Lu had become before turning to Randore. \"Thanks Randore.\" Smiled Kai, hugging her whilst being careful not to wedge himself in between her cleavage once again. Kai moved on over to Lucille and then hugged her on the breasts, eliciting a soft moan in pleasure. \"Ready to go home now Kai?\" Lu asked, blushing from the hug. \"Yes, I am.\" Replied Kai, yawning, \"I'm feeling sleepy.\" Lucille and Kai began walking on out of the salon, with the two waving goodbye with a hearty \"Come again soon\" heard from Randore. Once the two left the salon, Glenda sighed. \"Poor kid, it's a shame he had such a rotten mother.\" The pidgeot said, \"It's good that Lu's taking care of him.\" \"Well... if that skinflint-of-a-mother tries hurting Lu...\" Randore responded, smiling darkly, \"I'll make sure she regrets ever mistreating Kai. After all, abusive parents should learn the errors of their ways.\" Sharon and Glenda nodded in agreement.</span></div></div>",

Luke handed the manager the bag back so he could give the owner kai gently. Soon the three made it to his truck and kai was still sleeping, but somehow he got stuck in her chest like the first time randore and she giggled at him for being cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll lock up while you two take him home.\u201d The manager said after setting the bag in the backseat of the truck and closed the door before walking to lock up the park<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this happen a lot?\u201d the owner asked while looking at kai<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happened once, but no.\u201d luke said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Thank you, Luke\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d was heard from the still sleeping boy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai tries to get deeper in to stay warm, but the owner was stopping a laughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is he in there in the first place?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but his mother lets him sleep with her if he wants.\u201d Luke said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe must have had a good time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did and I\u2019m happy for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m his mother\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d Luke said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked about their time at the park and soon they made it into the garage before a certain someone next door spotted them. He noticed lu was home too so maybe she can help and get kai out of his napping spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d was heard as lu came from the kitchen and noticed luke was with another woman and without kai<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where is kai, luke?\u201d lu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be the mother and he is in here.\u201d The owner said with a nervous smile as she pointed to her chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides I\u2019m with that shuppet you saw me with at the park.\u201d The spinda added while looking at luke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get some things from the truck before I forget while you two get him out.\u201d Luke said as he left to get the things that is for kai in his truck<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLu smile gently as she reached in and plucked him out, but not before he dived into her chest for warmth from the cold. They both smiled at him, but soon luke came back with a bag of stuff and he went up to kai\u2019s room to put the stuff in there. A car pulled up in the driveway and the lights flashed meaning it was for the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my ride and I\u2019ll be glad to see him at the park again soon.\u201d The spinda said as luke and lu nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the spinda gone, they took kai upstairs and put him in his bed before luke give him life-sized snorlax plushy to sleep with if he didn\u2019t want to sleep with lu tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d Lu asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had a blast and the most of the rides we did was rollercoasters, but he was drifting off on the Ferris Wheel.\u201d Luke said and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear and why was that spinda here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Kai was sleeping in my arms as we were walking out when we were stopped both the manager and owner of the park.

Sure enough, Millie began swelling up in the hourglass figure and udders with each passing second, her face blushing red as her udders and mammaries began sloshing with milk; in the span of several minutes of her walking about, her hourglass figure reached 200 inches wider, but there was no sign of her growth slowing down in sight. \"Grow my babies, let this hospital enjoy their soon-to-be finest wet nurse.\" Thought Millie, swishing along merrily.

You'll look be a walking lightning rod with boobs and hips!\" Shouted Marduk incredulously. \"I didn't let that power surging stop me from enjoying my day at the mall, and a second one certainly won't stop me from smiling now.\" Lucille responded, \"As long as my boy Kai's happy, I'm happy, too.\" \"Sheesh, even kids that are happy with mothers being huge is becoming commonplace in this neighborhood.\" Thought Marduk, drawing out a mega lightning arrow, and then drawing it before letting it fly. The arrow absorbed itself into Lucille's glowing body... only to begin surging out in the curves, her hips and breasts reaching 1,000 inches with electricity freely dancing around her body and her curves wobbling in unison. \"Now THAT'S what I call a supercharge!\" Shouted Lucille, with much glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Lucille know, Ariel and Susan would soon be checking on the situation out back. \"Nuts, company must be coming!\" Thought Marduk, trying to think of a way out of his situation.</span></div></div>",

At least Susan would enjoy it.\" Lucille smiled, heading out of the dressing room... only to bump into the breasts of the queen-sized luxray socialite herself, Loretta. \"Oh... excuse me.\" Lucile said, blushing... only for her breasts to be pressed up against hers as Loretta gently boob-hugged her. \"Ah, Lucille, I presume. I am Madame Loretta.\" Loretta Purred, \"It's a pleasure to meet you, one of your friends told me quite a bit about you.\" Loretta rubbed her breasts into Lucille's body. \"Erm... I hate to burst your bubble... um... Loretta, but I have a boyfriend.\" Lucile said, feeling a little uncomfortable from Loretta's attention. \"Actually, I was just dropping by to give you a little... something special.\" Loretta grinned, electric streams dancing through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille's eyes widened with surprise, beginning to feel Loretta's electrical streams flowing right into her nipples; her figure began wobbling all over the place like crazy as the currents surged into her body, causing her bosom and her rump to swell gradually. \"Oooooohhh.... that tickles!\" Shouted Lucille, giggling from the tickling sensation as her curves swelled outward to 122-16-92, with her hips and butt swelling up twenty inches wider to catch up with her bosom. Lucille also noticed her nipples bulging out even larger to match her breasts. Ten seconds later, the growth stopped at 162-16-152, leaving Lucille's curves jiggling constantly because of the electricity currents coursing through her, and the lucario girl herself utterly bewildered. \"Umm.... thanks?\" Said Lucille, rubbing the back of her head whilst blushing. \"Bon Voyage for now, Lucille.\" Smiled Loretta, sauntering into one of the dressing booths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille tried to wrap her mind around what had just happened, and why Loretta gave her already-ample figure a more generous spurt, albiet electrically-charged. \"Wait... just how DID she know my name?\" Lucille thought, \"Did any of my friends told her about me? At least she's plenty generous for a high-class pokegirl.\" Lucille swished on out of the dressing booths area, continuing her shopping whilst passing by Armond and Ellis, who waited just outside the dressing booths. \"Boy will that pikachu kid of hers be in for a surprise.\" Armond said, with Ellis taking a glance at Lucille's ever-jiggling curves. \"Well, that ain't nothin' compared ta how big Loretta made that one blaziken nurse... Helen, was it?\" Replied Ellis, \"...Not yet, anyways.\" Lucille ignored the two voices, then quickly paid for the air bra, with the male electabuzz clerk watching Lucille leave, having made her purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Madame Loretta...\" The electabuzz sighed, \"The ladies never cease to appreciate your generosity... whether or not they expect it.\" The pokeboy got himself ready for when Loretta comes his way once she was ready to check out.</span></div></div>",

Kaseim waited until Lucille wasn't looking, then used his Psi Pump on the lucario girl, causing her nipples and her nether regions to tingle as she was lifted off the ground much to her utter shock. Only a few thoughts ran through her head as Kaseim was getting right to work with his craft, with said thoughts being directed to the psychic pokeboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A top-off?

The lucario girl panted from the growth, seeing her figure reach 185-18-185 and slowing down somewhat in the growth. However, the electrical buildup began mixing with the aura energy, causing her mounds of flesh to surge out forward even faster. \"Aaahhh... this feels a little... too good...\" Thought Lucille, panting a bit as the growth slowed down once more... only to stop at 250-18-250, with her boobs and her rump now glowing brightly like neon lights. The intense warmth inside her curves left her mind feeling fuzzy, with her figure still constantly wobbling, albeit more slowly. \"Oh... my...\" Lucille thought to herself, \"Now how am I gonna explain... this to Kai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille hoped that the growth wouldn't be permanent, but it would be a while before she shrinks down to a more huggable size. Her glowing curves, however, would likely take longer before they return to normal. Lucille had no idea that there were a few pokepeople out there that wanted to make Lucille bigger, not that she minded such normally; Kai would probably begin thinking that the neighborhood was weird. \"Man... that's enough growing for me.\" Lucille thought to herself, strolling onward, \"Well... for today, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaseim shrugged, sipping his java once again. \"That went well... more or less.\" He thought, wondering if another pokegirl would pass him by.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile at 6PM, in a private room of Dr. Gardena, she was finished up with her day shift. Helen was sauntering on into the room. \"What is it, Dr. Gardena?\" Asked Helen, wondering why the doctor would want her in... only to see that the doctor's 14-16-10 figure was a little hungry for some growth... though her mind was somewhat ambivalent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen, I have a very... special request that I must make.\" Replied Dr. Gardena, blushing a little, \"I'm... needed at Loretta's little burlesque house as a guest dancer for the Jade Spire Tavern's owner.\" Helen giggled. \"Oh, doctor... I didn't know you had a little naughty secret, too.\" The blaziken nurse smiled, \"But seriously, is the little dance thing tonight? Don't forget that Kai needs his little check-up three days from today.\" Dr. Gardena nodded, keeping the check-up in mind. \"I'm definitely needed tonight, 9PM to be precise. If I return to normal before the check-up, the other doctors won't know. I'll get my showgirl outfit ready.\" \"Ok... we'll have to do this somewhere close to the Jade Light District, though.\" Helen said, with the two leaving the room to clock out for the night, with Dr. Gardena carrying two bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside one patient room, an alakazam man was slowly rising up out of his coma, very quietly groaning as to not wake up the other patients. Several thoughts began running through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the bloody 'ell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Ow did I get 'ere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... what is up with the bloomin' nurses 'ere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noting the last thought, he began receiving a flashback of some of the much-curvier pokenurses. \"Good Arceus, I so need to get drunk... and a disguise somewhere.\" Thought the Alakazam man, teleporting out of the hospital, out of sight and out of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, somewhere in an alleyway of the Jade Light District, Helen was in a fancy purple dress whilst Dr. Gardena was in a revealing showgirl outfit; Helen had brought her special figure decompressor device. \"Well doctor, are you sure about this?\" Asked Helen, \"It's temporary, so the curvature'll start shrinking by morning.\" \"I'm... ready. And please call me Jasmine.\" Replied Dr. Gardena, closing her eyes. Secretly watching from the alleyway on the opposite side, the mystery alakazam man had acquired a hooded longcoat and some clothes for his disguise. \"Now what're those two up to?\" He thought, ducking back into his alcove shortly afterwards as to avoid being seen, \"Must be gettin' ready for Loretta's place, methinks.\" Cautiously peeking out, he watched as Helen proceeded with her operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine felt something hook itself onto her crotch, wincing a little; shortly after a while, she heard a whirring sound along with her boobs, hips, and butt cheeks leisurely bulging outward by the inch as the air flowed into her. \"Mmmmmmmm..... this... feels wonderful.\" Jasmine cooed, her figure reaching 18-16-14 and still growing, \"I want to be somewhere in the... triple digits for the little dance tonight.\" Helen gently rubbed Jasmine's slowly-growing breasts, the latter chuckling a little from said attention. \"I'll help you unwind before your big night while I am at it, if you don't mind.\" Said Helen, rubbing Jasmine's shoulders and her back before gently caressing her swelling hips; Jasmine moaned softly as her curvature reached 24-16-20 and still growing, with Helen's special touch soothing her nerves a little. The peeping alakazam man's eyes shot wide open, watching as Jasmine was slowly turning from a petite doctor to a curvy club dancer... albeit in body. \"Whoa... I guess some of those out-o'-district people are takin' a shine to this place, too.\" The alakazam man thought to himself once more, \"Maybe I could make a livin' here. Beats bein' stuck in that coma, anyday.\" The hospital fugitive had no idea what had caused his trauma, or why he ended up in the hospital in the first place, but he was well beyond caring at this point. Tonight, he was going to enjoy his first night of freedom... along with the sight of Jasmine making her temporary transformation as a hyper-curvy diva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's hourglass figure reached 54-16-50 in size, but she wasn't going to stop there, she was now craving to become amongst Loretta's queen-sized dancers... if only for just one night; she was panting with intense pleasure, with Helen still massaging her body. \"Ooooohhh... yesssss! So THIS is what it feels like to get bigger!\" Jasmine shouted ecstatically, \"Don't stop! Not until I... reach the triple-digit mark!\" Jasmine kept on swelling up, with Helen speeding up the machine a little bit; the gardevoir girl herself reached 74-16-70 in the span five minutes, but she was still cooing for more as the machine kept on pumping air into her curves. A little later, Jasmine's nipples bulged up to match her breasts, sticking out as plate-sized lumps underneath her showgirl top, with the added sensitivity of her larger figure size also heightening the pleasure Jasmine was receiving. \"Whoever this... tavern owner is... I'm sure he's a very pleasant pokeboy.\" Smiled Jasmine, panting as her hourglass figure reached 104-16-100 and still growing, albiet slowing down as the machine was timing out. \"Well, Jasmine... there's only one way to find out.\" Replied Helen, unhooking Jasmine from the machine once it came to a complete stop; the additional air pumped into the gardevoir girl left her hourglass figure at 124-16-120. All in the span of ten minutes, Jasmine now had the fittingly-ample figure one of Loretta's queen-sized dancer pokegirls. \"Well Helen, let's pay a visit to Chateau Courbure.\" Smiled Jasmine, only to see Helen duck back into the alley, before coming out in an equally-revealing showgirl outfit of her own. \"Don't mind if I dance, too!\" Said Helen enthusiastically, quickly blimping her hourglass figure up from 62-16-50 to 162-16-150 after ten quick repetitions of her maxed-out version of bulk-up. The two pokegirls sauntered on towards Chateau Courbure, swaying their hourglass figures sensually as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alakazam man began silently following the two pokegirls as they reached the Chateau Courbure, only to see something else catch his eye: The Nocturnal Pleasures Inn. He was torn between following the two to Loretta's burlesque house of hyper-hourglassed pokegirls or spending the night at the inn... or possibly meeting pokegirls. \"Now where do I start?\" Thought the alakazam fugitive, overwhelmed with curiosity at the very thought of getting to know the ladies of the Jade Light District. After a few moments of thinking, he chose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you have the time to make me queen-sized?\" Asked the shiny blaziken dancer, \"Call me Ganene, by the way.\" The alakazam man cleared his throat. \"A quick one? Fine with me, ma'am.\" Replied the alakazam man, \"By the way, here's my little... business card whenever you're not busy dancin'.\" Ganene looked at the business card, seeing that the alakazam man went by the alias Kaseim Fortunado. Shortly afterwards, Ganene felt her nether regions tingling, as well as air flowing into her hourglass figure, growing by the inch with each pump. \"Oooohh... Don't stop! Not until I at least get triple-digits!\" Moaned the shiny blaziken dancer, her hourglass figure reaching 94-18-76, with her nipples bulging out as well. Kaseim slowed the pumping down as Ganene reached 124-18-106, with the last ten pumps going straight to her hips and butt cheeks. \"Final measurement: 124-18-116.\" Said Kaseim, \"I hope you enjoyed the Psi Pump treatment.\" Ganene hugged the alakazam man once again, smiling wider from the growth. \"Feel free to expand the rest of my fellow dancers if you like before the VIP guest arrives.\" She said, giggling from her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be a fun night.\" Thought Kaseim, looking at the curvy pokegirl dancers.</span></div></div>",

I might have a part-time spot available for him somewhere.\" Loretta thought, \"In the meantime... I'll send the other girls his way for a little... topping-off.\" Loretta headed off deeper into the backstage area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kaseim sat down by the front row... with the next of the pokegirl dancers soon headed his way; this one was a kimono-clad samurott girl without the facial hair, instead having long, white, flowing hair. She showed off her moderate figure of 32-16-30, and was well craving to be larger from the somewhat seductive look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the one who filled up Ganene, aren't you?\" She said, caressing Kaseim and smiling, \"The name's Mihoshi, lovely to meet a newcomer.\" Kaseim grinned, using the \"Psi Pump\" technique as the samurott beauty felt a fluid filling up her hourglass figure at a decent speed, with her nether-regions and her nipples tingling as the latter puffed out. Instead of moaning, Mihoshi giggled as her curves bloated past 52-16-50 and still going. \"Hehehehehehee... oh that tickles!\" Mihoshi laughed, still tickled by the expansion, \"Oh... Kaseim was it? Keep going till I break triple!\" \"Not a problem.\" Smiled Kaseim, with Mihoshi reaching 82-16-80, with her kimono's hemline raising upwards. \"Almost there!\" Mihoshi grinned, still jiggling her ballooning curves for the pokeboys watching. The growth of Mihoshi's hourglass figure stopped at 142-16-140, with her cleavage fully visible and the kimono now amounting to a miniskirt. \"Thanks!\" Smiled Mihoshi, \"It's Leonre's turn now, come on down!\" Mihoshi jiggled on away, with a Honchkrow girl slowly sauntering towards Kaseim. She was clad in a victorian-era showgirl skirt, along with a figure of 72-20-84.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Mr. Kaseim. I am Leonre.\" Said the avian pokegirl dancer, \"As one of Loretta's finest dancers, I would not mind a small improvement to my body.\" Kaseim performed his Psi Pump technique, only for Leonre to feel a tingling sensation in her breasts, hips and butt cheeks, until they blimped out to 144-20-168, with her swollen body feeling warm and toasty on the inside; Leonre panted, surprised from the sudden doubling-up of her curves. \"Oh... my!\" Leonre gasped, blushing, \"I had no idea you were capable of... that.\" \"That special trick o' mine is different with every use.\" Kaseim replied, with the alakazam man thinking \"At this rate, I'll be the talk o' the district.\" as he looked forward to more of meeting more of Loretta's dancers.</span></div></div>",

He checked out her 56-18-44 figure, just barely larger than Lucille's original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Camille's the name.\" Smiled the zebstrika girl, \"A little quick Psi Pump, and I'm good to go.\" \"Sure, why not?\" Kaseim shrugged, using the Psi Pump attack once again, only for Camille's breasts to start bouncing up and down, with her nipples tingling with a tickling sensation. Camille let out a whinnying series of giggles as her breasts wobbled about, electricity playfully dancing about her body. \"Ohohohohoho.... that tickles!\" Camille smiled, still giggling a little, \"When does the actual growth... happen?\" Camille watched with confusion as her breasts stopped wobbling, only to be soon replaced with a strong tingling sensation coming from between her thighs; the zebstrika girl blushed brightly as she felt like something was plugging itself into her, yet when she felt her crotch, she didn't feel anything latching onto her down there. No hoses, no suction cups, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille soon felt the area between her thighs pulsating as her hourglass figure began growing by the inch with each repetition, with the zebstrika dancer herself moaning. \"Oh... my Psi Pump technique's a mite... unpredictable sometimes.\" Kaseim admitted, watching and blushing as Camille began grinding in tune to the imagined pumping, with her figure swelling up to 66-18-54, her tongue hanging down. \"Ahhh... that's alright.\" Panted Camille, feeling incredibly aroused as her figure kept on swelling, Oh! ...I might... see you at.... mmmmmhhh... the inn tonight after the sho-ooooooooohhhhh!\" Camille swished away, still panting as she steadily kept on swelling up in the curves; meanwhile at the backstage, Loretta blushed at the sight of Camille's figure reaching 86-18-74... and the zebstrika girl letting out a squeal of intense pleasure as her curves rapidly bloated outwards to 172-18-148 along with the four orbs of flesh and fur lighting up like headlights. Camille moaned softly, swishing over to Loretta with her glowing, swollen figure with a thoroughly aroused look on her face. \"I feel like a new pokelady now.\" Camille cooed, gently rubbing her brightly-glowing bosom against Loretta's, with the latter chuckling. \"Save it for after the show, Camille.\" Smiled Loretta, \"We got a very important guest to entertain.\" Camille giggled, nodding as she jiggled on off, merrily humming and wobbling her newly-swollen curves... which began jiggling wildly as if they had minds of their own to her added glee. Mihoshi came back up to Loretta, her breasts having bloated out eighty inches wider and sloshing with water, much to Loretta's jaw-dropping shock; her nipples were the size of dinner plates, bulging from under her kimono. \"Hee hee... Kaseim's Psi Pump's got some strange second-hand effects sometimes.\" Giggled Mihoshi, cheerfully wobbling her breasts to hear the sloshing from within them, \"I guess it depends on the pokemon type, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Scott! Is this Kaseim's Psi Pump be capable of that?\" Loretta thought to herself, wondering if her electricity would balloon her up even further if he tried the technique on her, \"Then again, not many psychic pokemorphs learn that move. It's quite a shame, too.\" Leonre was soon seen swishing on over to Loretta, her hourglass figure ballooned out to 184-20-208, along with her curves being extra-lightweight and squishy. \"Which dancers will you be sending Mr. Kaseim's way next, Loretta?\" Asked the honchkrow dancer, eager to watch. \"Lu-Ying and Matilde are on their way to meet him as we speak.\" Grinned Loretta, looking aside to see Ganene lovingly embracing her breasts, which had blimped out eighty inches wider, \"After Lu-Ying and Matilde get their share, Elanor shall get her turn.\" \"Understood.\" Leonre nodded, swishing off to prepare for the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterwards, a mienshao dancer, clad in a specially tailor-made qi-pao, somersaulted on over to Kaseim in a single bound; she was joined shortly by a delcatty girl, dressed in a form-fitting catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame Loretta welcomes you to Chateau Courbure. I am Lu-Ying.\" Said the mienshao lady, rather modestly showing her figure of 42-18-32 as she blushed, \"I... have not been inflated for years, I'm afraid.\" The delcatty lady began rubbing her supple figure of 60-16-72 against Kaseim tenderly, much to Lu-Ying's embarrassed chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matilde, at Madame Loretta's service... and yours.\" Purred the delcatty lady, pressing a blushing Kaseim's face into her bosom, \"A fine gentleman like you would make a wonderful living with that technique of yours.\" \"Ah... well then...\" Kaseim replied, rubbing the back of his head with one hand, \"How would you two ladies like a little... uhm... increase before the show?\" Matilde giggled, pressing her breasts into Kaseim's face once again, with Lu-Ying fidgeting a little. \"O-oh my...\" The mienshao dancer said, \"If I must...\" Matilde purred, backing up to let Kaseim try the technique, with anticipation brimming in her eyes. \"Anytime you are ready, fine sir.\" Matilde said, swaying her body seductively. \"Here goes.\" Sighed Kaseim, using Psi Pump on the two pokegirls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLu-Ying's eyes shot wide open in surprise as she felt her navel tingling before her breasts and her hips began swelling outwards with a hissing sound at a rate of five inches wide per puff of air. Matilde's hourglass figure, however, began brimming with intense warmth as the curvature was blown up like a balloon; the delcatty dancer's area between her thighs was tingling, causing her to purr. Lu-Ying's hourglass figure reached 72-18-62, after the sixth puff... only for one last gust of air to flow into her curves, doubling the curvature to 144-18-124; Lu-Ying was completely taken by surprise by how quickly her \"operation\" went, not to mention her new figure size. The mienshao girl soon felt a new overwhelming sensation coming from her nipples, panting as they bulged outward as lumps under her dress top along with her breasts bulking up by an additional forty inches and weighing her puffed-up rump down. \"I am... definitely going to need a little... assistance backstage after Matilde has finished growing.\" Lu-Ying moaned, pressing her ballooned-out breasts against Kaseim's body gently, wedging him in between her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilde's hourglass figure reached 130-16-142 in the span of three minutes of feeling like she was in heat... with her breasts filling up with milk rapidly, growing another thirty inches and her rear end swelling out by eighteen inches from the secondary effects. \"Mmmmmmmm... Elanor shall be expecting you backstage.\" The delcatty diva purred to a dumbstruck Kaseim, the latter sticking his head out from between Lu-Ying's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elanor?\" Thought Kaseim, \"This gal sounds like another high-class lady.\" The two swollen-up pokegirls headed on backstage, with the onlookers gawking at how much bigger the two had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? Chateau Courvure'll be making it big in this district.\" Remarked one of the pokeboys, enjoying the sights.</span></div></div>",

Measuring in at about 92-22-92, Kaseim found himself being eager to make such a lovely ghost pokegirl such as herself even more profound in the curves department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Loretta told me about you, didn't she? I am Elanor.\" The pokegirl cooed, very pleased to meet Kaseim, \"Well, Mister Kaseim, would you mind giving me that psi treatment of yours really quickly? I would love the boys to see me even bigger.\" Using Psi pump, Kaseim watched as Elanor's perfectly-even hourglass figure began blimping out rapidly as she felt dark energy rush into her from between her thighs, making her moan in a mixture of pleasure and lust as her boobs and butt cheeks shortly broke triple-digits. \"Ooooohhh..... after the show, would you fancy a night in bed with us ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaseim's eyes went wide open with surprise. \"Whoa... the ladies in this district must be reeeaalll loose, I tell 'ya.\" Though Kaseim, with her hourglass figure shortly reaching 130-22-130... before doubling out at 260-22-260 from the secondary effects, with Elanor feeling extremely aroused. \"Well... this'll be a fun night, that's for sure.\" The alakazam man thought to himself, with the mismagius dancer herself licking her lips as she eyed Kaseim lustfully. \"For a psychic-type pokeboy, he has quite a wonderful technique.\" Kaseim had a funny feeling that he would be meeting the guest dancers soon, as showtime was rearing its head.

The lights dimmed as stage lights began lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of Jade Light District.\" Greeted an announcer, \"For tonight's show, we have a very special guest coming here; straight from the Jade Spire Tavern, the pokeman behind the neighborhood's best saloon! Put your hands together for... Zatchwell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Darkrai man in a green business suit, dark green business shoes, and jade-colored glasses walked on into the chateau; rounds of applause could be heard as he entered, and took his VIP seat at the front stage. Kaseim's eyes went wide open as he saw the owner of the Jade Spire tavern in the flesh. \"Ah... I would love to work in his place... or with the chateau.\" Kaseim thought, \"Beats being in that stinking hospital anyday.\" Little did Kaseim know, Zatchwell briefly observed the audience, momentarily glancing the alakazam boy's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... a newcomer.\" Zatchwell thought, \"Wait... if he's from that hospital... Nevermind, maybe he'll behave himself.\" The tavern head honcho sat back in his VIP chair, only to watch as the first dancer, Ganene, wobbled her super-engorged figure, much to the crowd's awe and Zatchwell's surprise. \"Wait... who did that to Ganene?\" Thought Zatchwell once again, \"Not that the boys are complaining, but... wait... psychic residue... secondary effects...\" And then, it all hit Zatchwell in full force. Kaseim has the Psi Pump technique; he watched as the rest of the psi-pumped girls swished onto the stage, shaking their money-making curves with delight. He also took note of a more lustful-looking Elanor once he saw how much larger her hourglass figure was. The pokedancers all began their special dance for Zatchwell, showing off their inflated curves to him. Zatchwell, shifting his eyes to Kaseim. \"I've seen that technique before, and it's quite impressive actually.\" Zatchwell said to Kaseim via telepathy, \"And now... let me show you <i>my</i> way of inflating pokegirls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his glasses, Zatchwell's eyes flashed, and before the pokegirl dancers knew it, small shadowy tendrils latched themselves in between their thighs like suction cups, very slowly puffing their hourglass figures up. \"Mmmmmm... keep on growing, my babies.\" Smiled Ganene, gently sitting down as two shadowy hands sprang up from her own shadow to fondle her growing assets, much to her added pleasure. \"If you want us to reach 500...\" Cooed Leonre, shaking her swelling rump for him, \"...then do not stop. The bigger, the better, Madame Loretta always says.\" Loretta watched as the dancers began growing in the midst of their dance. \"Warming up for the two special guest dancers, I see.\" Loretta thought, \"Well... it seems they both want to be as big as they want to be. Well... one of them, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, the dancing pokegirls, cooing in extreme pleasure, now had their hourglass figures measuring in at 500 inches in both the breasts and the hips; the pokegirl dancers began collectively eyeing Kaseim lustfully, rubbing their nipples and between their thighs to help curb their newfound heat. \"Well... time to bring out the special guest dancers now.\" Said Zatchwell, turning his attention to Kaseim, who had a look of bemusement on his face, \"And you, my psychic friend... I hope you enjoy your time with the ladies.\" \"Well... isn't he a generous sort?\" Thought Kaseim, with the eight pokegirl dancers sauntering over to Kaseim, collectively boob-hugging him before carrying him off backstage. \"Well Kaseim...\" Cooed Ganene, kissing the Psi Pumper on the cheek, \"After the show, how about a little... slumber party?\" \"Sounds fine with me, ladies.\" Smiled Kaseim. Loretta, upon seeing Kaseim with the ladies, began thinking \"Maybe Kaseim can test this technique of his on me sometime.\", imagining how much bigger the result of the technique would make her figure.</span></div></div>",

Zatchwell noted Jasmine's shyness. \"Hmmm... a first-timer, I see.\" Thought Zatchwell, \"How about I... ease you into this chateau a bit. Your friend's delightfully naughty on the other hand, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo shadow tendrils emerged from the two pokegirls' shadows, wedging themselves between their thighs. \"Wh-what are you... oh!\" Jasmine gasped as the tendril plugged into her nether-regions, sensually vibrating her lower lips, and leaving her panting with pleasure. \"Aaahh... oh yes. That's the spot.\" Helen said, humping at the tendril... only for air to start flowing into her hourglass figure through the special spot; Jasmine's hourglass figure grew as well, with her shyness replaced with ecstacy. Zatchwell soon changed the song to \"Pump it up!\", with the shadow tendrils puffing up the two pokegirls by the inch, their breasts and butt cheeks quickly surpassing the 100-inch mark. The two swelling pokegirls began dancing much more erotically, the two's nipples bulging outwards and becoming super-sensitive. \"Bigger.... BIIIGEEERRR!!!\" Shouted Helen, quickly overtaken by the pleasure, \"Make me... Goddess-sized!\" \"Very well.\" Zatchwell replied, with the curvature growth increasing numerically, going to two inches larger the next pump, three the next, and so on and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the span of two minutes, Zatchwell saw the two pokegirls' hourglass figures reach 250 inches wide, and still growing even more; the two were also getting closer and closer to climaxing. \"Well... here goes.\" Zatchwell thought, as the two pokegirls felt an intense surge of air flow right into their nether lips; the two squealed out in orgasmic pleasure as their curves blimped out crazily... only to stop at a humongous 32,000 inches. A short while later, the two pokegirls felt drowsy, resting with their newly ballooned-out flesh pillows. \"Mmmmmmmmmm.... so cozy...\" Thought Jasmine. Little did she know, Kai would be in for a surprise if he saw her this huge. Helen, however, was in absolute bliss at her curvature size. A big round of applause could be heard, with Helen and Jasmine getting their breasts and butt cheeks rubbed all over by the pokeboy audience. Zatchwell, however, relaxed in his chair. \"And that, ladies, is how I roll.\" Said Zatchwell, raising a wine glass to the two blimped-out pokegirls and slugging down the wine in one gulp, satisfied with his work on the two pokegirls' bodies. \"Well... this'll be fun to explain to the other nurses back at the hospital.\" Thought Jasmine, her mind still somewhat fuzzy from the growth. </span></div></div>",

The hourglass figures reached 50,000 inches, and kept on going exponentially. The intense pleasure of the growth left the two squealing out in pleasure once again, doubling the rate of the growth. Loretta's curves surged outward until they were 2,000 inches wide, as a result of the blowback as well. \"Ohh.... that's the first time this happened it seems.\" The Luxray socialite thought, \"Nevertheless, I am most certainly not complaining.\" Purring as she rubbed her pumped-up breasts and butt cheeks, Jasmine's and Helen's continued blimping up out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Helen and Jasmine swished on out of the chateau, their hourglass figures now measuring at a colossal 435,200 inches in the breasts and the hips. \"Well... that was fun.\" Jasmine said, \"Now the entire neighborhood's going to be talking about us when we get back. I don't know what Kai will think of me now that my boobs are hindenburgs.\" \"Well... at least we'll be making plenty of patients happy, let's just leave it at that.\" Helen replied, still strutting on. Peeking out from the chateau entrance, Zatchwell noted how much bigger the two pokegirls were. \"Whoa... Loretta really amped up the bonus there, didn't she?\" Thought Zatchwell, noting that the two uber-hourglassed pokegirls were now glowing brightly like neon lights, \"They'll be the talk of the continent, that's for sure.\" Teleporting away, Zatchwell went to sleep to prepare for the next day.</span></div></div>",

Ellis sipped a bit of it before letting Mourel continue speaking as a tall Luxray girl in a form-fitting red-orange sequined dress came sauntering on in; her supple figure of 82-16-74 jiggling in a tantalizing manner for Ellis as the pokegirl sat next to the former. \"Ah, good to see you again Loretta.\" Mourel said, bowing a little for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, gentlemen.\" Purred Loretta, sitting down next to Ellis, much to his squealing glee, \"What is going on in this neighborhood tonight?\" \"Oh... something about an adopted pikachu boy being adopted by this Lucille girl.\" Mourel said, \"Apparently, because of the birth mother being abusive, that story is spreading like wildfire here.\" Loretta sighed, shaking her head. \"Well... then let us just say he is lucky to find a more loving family then. Quite frankly, I do not like dwelling on the past.\" Ellis, downing his scotch in short order, began stroking Loretta's rear end with one hand gently. \"Oh... n-not here, handsome.\" Chuckled the luxray girl, blushing from the attention. \"There's a small inn complex right by the tavern in case you two want to get a little more, shall we say... intimate.\" Mourel said, with Ellis grinning once more. \"That would definitely help with getting that story outta my head.\" Nodded Ellis, with Loretta purring a little. \"I most definitely agree.\" Cooed Loretta, \"To be honest, I am a little tired of hearing about the drama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving paid for his drink, Ellis left the tavern with Loretta for the Nocturnal Pleasures Inn complex next door to the Jade Spire tavern. \"Well... if the father is nothing like the mother, then I'm sure he'll be wanting a drink, too.\" Thought Mourel, waiting for his next customer.</span></div></div>",

Let me se what spring is like on Jupiter and M-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Marduk could finish, he saw Eve walking along. \"Oh... hello.\" Marduk thought to himself, getting out his bow, looking to see nobody looking, and pulling out an arrow of patience, \"A late bloomer kind of girl, huh? I'll fix that.\" Letting the arrow of patience fly, it struck Eve in the rear, only for her hourglass figure to begin rumbling. \"Oh my!\" Eve shouted, feeling the arrow as well as her tiny curves tingling with magical energy. \"Score!\" thought Marduk, pumping his fist in accomplishment, \"Well, she won't be blooming so late anymore. Sheesh, I gotta stop with the puns.\" Bewildered at just what happened, she felt her body apprehensively, only to unwittingly turn to the camo-cloaked zoroark sniper, slowly walking away. \"Excuse me, sir!\" Shouted Eve, with Marduk freezing in place momentarily; one word entered his thoughts as his latest \"victim\" was now pursuing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting rapidly, Marduk began running, causing Eve to begin giving chase; Marduk was still stumbling about. \"Wait, I just want to have a little talk with you!\" Eve shouted, her catching up with the panicked zoroark sniper. \"I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it!\" Thought Marduk frantically, still outrunning the eevee girl. Two minutes, and a trip later, Marduk was face-down on the ground, thinking \"Oh, damn it all! I gotta stop drinking before sniping!\" as he struggled to get back up... only for Eve to catch up with him, only for Eve to pin him down; her figure measured at 37-10-37 and still growing. Marduk sighed as he looked at the curious eevee girl, who began hugging him with her slowly-growing curves, much to his bemusement. \"So you are this Marduk that was on the news last night.\" Eve said, giggling a little, \"Just... what arrow did you hit me with, anyway?\" \"That... was the arrow of patience.\" Marduk replied, \"Over the course of anywhere from an hour to an entire day, you're constantly growing in the hourglass figure when that hits you.\" Marduk said frankly, \"At least you'll be filling out rather nicely nonetheless. You'll be approximately 360 inches wider in the curves.\" \"Well... that's pretty generous of you.\" Eve responded, \"Still I kind of feel that I'd probably outgrow my sisters. Right now, they're in the mid 200's in hourglass figure inches.\" \"Well... mind if I tell you what I think about the pokegirls here?\" Eve nodded, with Marduk clearing his throat before he began his analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, while I do know that the pokegirls love getting curvier, they're... pretty loose to say the least. Heck, even those hyper-hourglassed pokegirl socialites of the upper crust are all fine and dandy with their curves getting rubbed, and even then they do have limits on what they see as unneccesary roughness, depending on the clubs they're a part of. Of course, I would explain more, but you would probably be wanting to scrub your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve blushed after hearing Marduk's analysis. \"Well... I'll take your word for it then.\" Eve said, her figure now at 47-10-47, \"I'm... going to need some clothes shopping, though. This little dress of mine won't be enough for my soon-to-be new figure anyhow.\" \"Ok...\" Marduk nodded, \"If anything, I could use a little break from my... hobby anyway.\" Eve smiled, gently hugging the zoroark sniper with her still-growing bosom, with the latter thinking \"Talking with the pokegirls I expanded's gonna be awkward I know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, outside of the clothes boutique, Eve was now clad in a tall, form-fitting dress of her own, her hourglass figure at 94-10-94 and still growing. Marduk, meanwhile, was in a tuxedo of his own, with a Baron Samedi-esque top hat as well. \"Ah, what a wonderful day for a stroll. Isn't it, Marduk?\" Asked Eve, swishing her ballooning curves. \"Indeed it is. A swell, sunny day.\" Marduk replied, noting Eve giggling; the zoroark boy then thought \"This upper-crust stuff feels a little iffy.\" as he strolled along, noticing Elaine and Fiore strolling by; Elaine's hourglass figure currently measured at 352-18-246, with Elaine watching as the two strolled by. \"Hmmm... that man seems familiar. But where?\" Thought the swanna socialite, strolling along merrily with her curves swaying from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the Opera House, Eve and Marduk looked upon the opera building. \"Well, you know what they say about Madame Melodia.\" Said Eve, \"Her voice soothes the soul, and swells up the bosom and the hips.\" Replied Marduk, thinking \"And the latter part's pretty literal, too.\" Observing the two as she strolled along a different block, Muchiko and her gallade companion, Gustav, looked at each other. Muchiko's figure currently measured at 864-20-560. \"Hmmm... could this man be THE Marduk that was on the news the night before?\" Wondered Muchiko. \"I do not know, to be certain, but when he caused Madame Melodia's curvature to expand, dear Arceus did the entire city hear her wondorous voice.\" Replied Gustav, \"The Mistress of Song herself had not forseen that outcome.\" \"Nevertheless, Madame Sylvia slept blissfully just listening to her voice, and thus, so did we.\" Smiled Muchiko, nuzzling one of her breasts tenderly against Gustav's face, \"And today, we enjoy this brand new day at hand.\" Upon hearing the conversation, Marduk began thinking once again, the memories of the previous night hitting him like a limousine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, hold it, I caused all of... THAT!? Ugh, man I gotta stop drinking DURING my snipe-flation rounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the town square, Eve and Marduk looked about the area; Eve's hourglass figure was now at 153-10-153 and still swelling. \"You could only imagine how much bigger I become once my actual growth spurt kicks in.\" Eve chuckled, happily swaying her growing figure, with Marduk nodding in agreement. The black-haired lucario socialite, Suzanne, looked at Eve and Marduk strolling by, her head tilted in perplexity; her form fitting dress for today was crimson, with her hourglass figure measuring in at 678-20-200. Loretta stood next to her, her hourglass figure at 820-16-740, and sharing Suzanne's confusion. \"Could that be the man that inflated the curves of the fair Madame Melodia?\" Suzanne asked, \"I do not know, but to do that to her in the midst of her performance... he apparently had not yet known how her power works.\" Loretta replied, \"Nevertheless, despite the initial surprise, she took it in incredible stride.\" The two pokegirl socialites secretly swore to be on the lookout for the zoroark snipe-flator, should he go back to inflating the pokegirls in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve continued strolling through the rest of the city, her curves reaching the high 200's in inches. \"I might have surpassed my sisters now.\" She smiled, hugging Marduk with her bosom gently, \"You are most welcome, Eve.\" Replied Marduk, the disguised sniper thinking to himself once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet another mental note: try long-distance snipe-flation. I'm probably gonna need one of those super-advanced expansion railguns for that, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the span of one hour after Eve had been struck with the arrow of patience, her hourglass figure was now at 373-10-373, her curves swelling up by seven additional inches, leaving her with 380-inch-wide breasts and hips. \"Just wait until I get my real growth spurt.\" Eve chuckled, gently pressing Marduk's face into her bosom, \"Then my sisters will see how much bigger I can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joy, if she takes me to meet those sisters of hers, they'll definitely be in for a swell surprise.\" Thought Marduk, a small smile forming in his face, \"Or, better yet, a surprise swelling. Either way, those sisters of hers'll be in for a fun night... if they let me stay over with them, that is.\" Marduk began forming plans in his head on how to further inflate Eve and her sisters, whether it was all at once, or one at a time. He also began planning something in his head involving future rounds of snipe-flating the pokegirls. Marduk and Eve continued strolling through the city. \"Maybe Marduk wouldn't mind meeting my sisters.\" Thought Eve, heading home with the zoroark man of mass hourglass expansion.</span></div></div>",

My babies are very sensitive.\" Cooed Loretta, panting a little from the eager gropage as well as blushing. \"Whoops, sorry.\" Giggled Ellis nervously, moving over to rub his face up against her swelling rump cheeks as well as goosing them with his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoretta's curvature reached 92-16-84 after five minutes of rubbing, with Ellis still rubbing away at Loretta's rear end. The luxray girl's face continued blushing rose red from the attention to her rump, pleasure now coursing through her body. Loretta kept on panting, feeling the attention to her ballooning rear end intensifying the pleasure, and consequentially the growth, with the rising intensity of the pleasure causing a dream to flash before her eyes; she was dreaming that her hourglass figure reached the triple digits... however, she was also swarmed with a harem of pokeboys eager to massage her swollen curves. Her titanic breasts were hooked onto a milking machine, the luxray girl herself purring from the machine's work as well as the attention from the pokeboys left her at the very zenith of bliss. A full-lunged squeal of ecstacy escaped from her as she felt her hourglass figure surge out further forward, the dream continuing on shortly after she was satisfied with the growth and fast asleep; Ellis soon appeared amongst those pokeboys, comfortably asleep on Loretta's rump with a huge grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, next door to Loretta's Inn suite, a typhlosion man sat up in his bed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" He thought, groaning a little before slowly slipping out of bed. He began sneaking out of his suite, then seeing the door to the suite where Loretta and Ellis occupy only slightly ajar. Peeking inside the bedroom, he saw that Loretta's mammaries took up most of the front side of the four-poster bed. Loretta's curves reached 152-16-144, with the couple fast asleep; her nipples were puffy, poking out of her top, just ripe for the stroking whilst the couple was fast asleep. \"Hmm... I dunno whether to stroke them or... just leave them alone, I guess.\" Thought the typhlosion man, trying not to let curiosity get the best of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe typhlosion man began thinking whether to stroke those stiff nips of the luxray girl's, or to leave and keep the memory of the incident out of his mind. \"Oh boy... I'll probably never hear the end of this if I wake her up.\" The typhlosion man whispered to himself as he still began struggling whether to overcome his curiosity or to give in and rub the puffed-out bosom of Loretta's.</span></div></div>",

Loretta's mind was still fuzzy, purring from the attention to her mammaries. \"Bigger, still?\" Loretta thought, assuming it was Ellis rubbing her bosom, \"Very well, the bigger the better Lucille always said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the typhlosion man's surprise, Loretta resumed rubbing her already-swollen body on top of the bed, with the static discharge making her grow even larger, only this time the growth was in spurts. \"Huh? How much bigger is she gonna get!?\" Thought the pokeboy, still rubbing away at the luxray girl's swelling breasts, only to accidentally rub her nipples, causing Loretta to moan in pleasure. \"Mmmmmmmm.... don't stop, gentleman.\" Loretta purred, nuzzling her swelling curves, \"Keep this wonderful sensation going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe typhlosion man stopped momentarily, then calmly resumed rubbing Loretta's nipples. Loretta's curves spurted out to 172-16-164, with the growth not stopping. Loretta panted and moaned in pleasure as her tender curves kept on receiving the attention from her new admirer, with Ellis slowly waking up. \"Mmmmmmm... what's going on now?\" Thought Ellis, feeling Loretta swell up even larger, \"Probably nothing.\" Shrugging, Ellis went right back to sleep. After a while of rubbing Loretta's nipples, her hourglass figure reached 212-16-204, her curves now taking up the entire bed. The growth stopped momentarily, with the typhlosion man assuming she was done growing; however, Loretta's eyes opened slowly to see how much bigger she became, thanks in part to the curious typhlosion man. \"Greetings. Good to see someone else joining me.\" Smiled Loretta, seductively eyeing the typhlosion man, \"Care to tell me your name before I... show you my best trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Armond.\" Replied the typhlosion man, \"And... what do you mean by best trick?\" Armond was slack-jawed with curiosity... only with the curiosity being soon replaced with shock as electrical streams danced through her body, leaving her undergarments unaffected. \"Now I will show you what many pokegirls mean by queen-sized hourglass figures.\" Loretta said, her body storing up electricity as Armond stood back a few inches. Shortly after a little bit of charging, the luxray girl let out a loud mewl of pleasure, with the electricity rapidly blimping up her curves, very quickly filling up the room until Armond was trapped between her cleavage. The typhlosion man was caught completely off-guard by the sudden surge of growth in Loretta's curves. \"This could take a bit of getting used to.\" Thought Armond, wiggling a bit inside Loretta's blimped-out breasts, causing her to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllis slowly woke up once again... only to find himself pinned near the back wall of Loretta's swollen figure; his eyes widened with a mix of perplexity and surprise. \"Whoa! D-didn't see that one coming.\" Thought Ellis, stunned at the growth surge. Loretta's hourglass figure now measured a whooping 322-16-314, only now was Loretta resting contently with her new figure size. The only question now was when will she return to normal? Ellis went right back to sleep once more, still resting against Loretta's queen-sized booty. Armond, meanwhile, was still overwhelmed a little from the sudden surprise Loretta had for him. \"This neighborhood's gonna be fun, I'll tell you.\" Thought the typhlosion man, slowly falling asleep right between the oversized bosom of the generous luxray lady, \"Not very often I run into pokeladies that love getting super huge like that.\" Armond dozed off finally, wondering what tomorrow in the fwoomp-happy neighborhood would send in his direction.</span></div></div>",

The typhlosion boy's heart was pounding, with erotic daydreams of his time with the pokegirls of the chateau as well as Loretta herself, flooding his mind.

Also, among the ladies here, she has amongst the highest number of men she has taken to her bed, seeing how easily she tends to be aroused when expanded.\" Armond raised an eyebrow. \"How many pokeboys has this Ganene slept with?\" Asked Armond. \"562, and still counting.\" Loretta replied, \"Most of them, fire-types like you.\" Moving over to the adjacent door, Ellis began to speak. \"This here's Mihoshi's room.\" The swampert boy cheerfully said, \"For a samurai hottie, she's pretty cheerful... and like Ganene, she's a natural in bed.\" \"Ah, I see.\" Armond said, the trio moving onto the next pair of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lu-Ying will be in there when you need her.\" Loretta said, \"She's... a little on the shy side when it comes to contact with her body, but I would be careful around her when her... passionate side surfaces.\" Loretta winked, leaving Armond to tilt his head. \"And why should I be careful?\" Asked Armond. \"Let's just say that she's a force to be reckoned with in bed.\" Ellis replied, \"I mean, one time, I caught her playin' with herself, and before I even saw it comin', there we were, ruttin' like nobody's business. I even...\" Loretta blushed, chuckling a little. \"I think our new friend got the point, Ellis.\" She smiled, having a flashback of a similar instance involving Lu-Ying. Moving over to the next door, Armond waited to hear whose dressing room it was. \"This room belongs to one of the chateau's top dancers, Leonre.\" Loretta smiled, \"While she is very elegant in her dance, and already supple in curvature, she also gets... a little intimate with even the other dancers sometimes.\" \"Erm... that's a little more than I needed to know, but ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next dancer of ours is Matilde.\" Loretta said, \"She is a natural at lap dances, but get her purring, and you'll be giving your arms quite a workout.\" Armond nodded, moving over to the next door. \"That's Camille's room.\" Ellis said, \"She's pretty cheerful, too, but mighty ticklish.

Loretta began rubbing her curves for Armond. \"And last but not least, you have yours truly.\" Purred Loretta, gently hugging Ellis and Armond, \"After business hours, would you boys mind a little... night of passion in bed once again?\" \"Am I ever?\" Ellis gleefully responded, smiling. \"Well... ok.\" Armond replied, \"But I would love to get to know the chateau babes as well.\"</span></div></div>",

Ganene turned out to be a shiny blaziken dancer with an hourglass figure measuring in at 84-18-66; her fire-themed legless, strapless, backless bodysuit offered plenty for Armond to ogle at... with the dancer herself letting him into her room and closing the door behind her. \"So Loretta told me about you. Didn't she?\" Inquired Ganene, smiling as she mashed her breasts into his face, \"I'm always up for newcomers.\" Armond chuckled playfully, rubbing the area between Ganene's thighs, eliciting a moan of pleasure... only to see her lie down on her back. \"Ooohh... a quick puff-up, then? I won't mind.\" Ganene cooed, rubbing her breasts. Shrugging placed his mouth up against the shiny blaziken lady's nethers and proceeded blowing into her, causing her breasts and her hips to widen up. Ganene's eyes shot wide open, letting out a slow gasp of pleasure as her curves blimped out ten inches wider with each puff. \"Mmmmmmm.... that's a good boy. Keep me growing.\" Ganene moaned, enjoying every second of the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more puffs, Ganene was now 144-18-126 in the figure, with Ganene delightfully nuzzling her curves. \"I'll... be seeing the other girls now.\" Armond said, heading towards the door. \"Come back anytime, big boy.\" Cooed Ganene, massaging her nethers, with Armond closing the door behind him on his way out. The typhlosion boy headed over to Mihoshi's door, then knocking on it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in.\" Mihoshi called out from the other side of the door. Obliging, Armond opened the door, and came into Mihoshi's room. Mihoshi turned out to be a kimono-clad samurott girl without the facial hair, instead having long, white, flowing hair. Her hourglass figure measured at 72-16-60, her breasts sloshing with a fluid as they jiggled. \"You must be that Armond boy that Loretta told me about. Welcome.\" Mihoshi giggled, playfully jiggling her breasts, \"I'm filling up for the show, in case you're wondering.\" \"Ok... lemme help with that.\" Smiled Armond, breathing out a jet of steam into her body. Mihoshi giggled, feeling her body warm up... along with her curves fattening up. A short while later, she began moaning pleasantly. \"Mmmmmmmm... most of the fire-types I met usually love to do that.\" Mihoshi cooed, her tongue hanging out as she grew wider in the hourglass figure. After a good five minutes of swelling, Armond stopped the steam breath, leaving Mihoshi with a figure of 212-16-200. \"Thank you...\" Mihoshi moaned, rubbing herself all over, enjoying both the warmth and her new figure size. \"I'll... be meeting Leonre now.\" Armond replied, heading out the door as Mihoshi waved goodbye. After closing Mihoshi's door, Armond knocked on Leonre's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Leonre said through the door, \"Come in, I do not mind anyone's company.\" Entering the room, armond found Leonre herself; She was a honchkrow girl dressed in  a victorian-era showgirl skirt, along with a figure of 72-20-84. \"Welcome, Armond.\" Leonre smiled, \"I see you have met Madame Loretta.\" \"Well... she wasn't kidding about being generous, that's for sure.\" Chuckled Armond, hugging the avian pokegirl dancer; Leonre returned the affectionate hug in kind, with her tongue wrapping itself around the typhlosion boy's. \"That will be all for now, no further until after the last show for tonight.\" Leonre said, \"Though I do fancy a little enhancement to my curves.\" Obliging to the demand, Armond began blowing hot air into Leonre's body; the soothing heat left her boobs and her hips quadrupling to 288-20-336, with the warmth leaving the honchkrow girl herself warm all over as soon as Armond finished his puff kiss. \"Thank you, Armond.\" Cooed Leonre, mashing her swollen breasts into the typhlosion boy's face. Armond had a feeling that meeting the other three pokegirl dancers would go just as smoothly.</span></div></div>",

Pump me all the way to the top!\" Shouted Camille cheerfully, rubbing her swelling curves; her swelling hourglass figure reached 112-18-88, and still rapidly growing... only it eventually started leaving her moaning with pleasure. \"Mmmmmmm... maybe after the last show, you can ride me into the night.\" Cooed Camille, winking to her inflator. In only the span of three minutes, Camille's hourglass figure reached 280-18-256, her nipples bulging out like dinner plates. \"I... think Lu-Ying'll be needing me now.\" Said Armond, kissing Camille on the exposed bosom much to her giggling glee. \"Come back anytime.\" Replied Camille, enjoying her new figure size as Armond headed out the door. Matilde was next as Armond knocked on her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, handsome.\" Matilde said through the door, with the typhlosion boy obliging. Inside, Matilde, the delcatty dancer, purred as she gently embraced the visitor with her figure of 60-16-72; her form-fitting catsuit was rubbing up against his body, with the heat transferring into the suit, and consequentially, slowly expanding her hourglass figure. \"This is why this lovely suit is one of my favorite outfits when fire-type pokeboys are involved.\" Matilde purred, gently mashing Armond's face into her swelling chest, \"The heat absorption not only feels fulfilling, but it also keeps the other pokeboys nice and cozy for those long winter nights.\" \"I... see.\" Armond chuckled, blushing as he gently massaged Matilde's swelling bosom, transferring even more heat to further expand Matilde's curves until they reached double her initial size. \"That will do for now.\" Said Matilde, licking Armond's forehead, \"I will be getting ready for my number on the stage soon.\" \"Ok... see you.\" Armond responded, leaving the room. Armond was now at Elanor's room, only for him to be pulled right into the room upon knocking on her door. Elanor was a particularly curvy Mismagius girl in a fancy showgirl outfit; her figure of 92-22-92 made Armond wonder how she kept her figure perfectly even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Chateau Courbure, handsome.\" Elanor said, using a small bit of shadow magic to expand her bosom and hips eight inches wider. Following the two into her room was the mienshao dancer herself, Lu-Ying; she sported a specially-made chinese dress, with her figure of 42-18-32 appearing to secretly beg to be bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Madame Loretta welcomes you to our humble chateau.\" Said Lu-Ying, only to catch the sight of her hourglass figure ending up getting expanded as a result of Elanor's spell, \"Oh.. oh my!!!\" \"Power overwhelming... let us grow to our hearts' content!\" Shouted Elanor theatrically, the two pokegirls' curves surging out rapidly 420-18-320 for Lu-Ying and 920-22-920 for Elanor, respectively. \"Whoa... well this'll be a fun night once this show's done.\" Thought Armond, wondering if he would inflate Loretta next.</span></div></div>",

What a day.\" Randore thought to herself, \"At least business is going wonderfully. This calls for a little... celebratory growth.\" With a little spell, her figure was shifted to 20-18-20 in a flash; the chaos lugia herself was very eager to reward herself for such a long day of work. Taking off her purple robe to show off her blue strapless, legless, bodysuit in front of a mirror opposite to her bed. \"And now, let the growth of pleasure... begin.\" Randore thought to herself, smiling as she casted a growth spell on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small tingle, Randore's boobs, butt cheeks, and hips began slowly-but-surely bulging outward. Randore gently fondled her swelling figure, rubbing her bosom. \"Mmmmmmmmmm.... I have an odd feeling someone might be coming over to visit me.\" Thought the chaos lugia girl herself, having a feeling that the visitor will be enjoying seeing her grow, \"Someone handsome, friendly, and who loves it when girls get bigger for him.\" The thoughts of such a visitor happening to catch her had left her slightly aroused, ballooning her curves to 32-18-32.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandore began rubbing her swelling curves all over sensually as if she were posing for a fashion magazine, stopping once in a while to cup her engorging breasts. \"Maybe I can stop by Lucile and Mika to have a little fun making them big.\" She thought, remembering the one time where Lucile's hourglass figure became far larger than she bargained for, only to find herself overwhelmed with the blissful sensation of the growth... along with Ariel blushing as a result from hers getting fwoomped out; Susan also thoroughly enjoyed the swelling of her figure, albeit she enjoyed her super-engorged bosom even more. \"Ah, good times. Good times.\" Randore smiled once again, checking up on her figure and seeing it was now 44-18-44. \"Oh... I guess I got a little carried away there. Oh well...\" Randore shrugged and continued to take in the expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lugia girl herself began experiencing another flashback, this one concerning the time she was with Helen in her bedroom having ballooned up her hourglass figure to 152-16-140 via quite a rigorous bulk-up session for a blaziken man coming to visit her, whilst Randore bulked herself up to 160-18-154; the lucky pokeguy, however, had a little fun making the two even larger before he finally rested in between two pairs of car-sized breasts. \"Mmmmmmmm... there's a lot of men that love girls that grow in this neighborhood, apparently.\" Randore cooed to herself, feeling another spurt in her curvature. Taking a peek, she reached 68-18-68 in the hourglass figure. \"Now let's see how big I can go before the spell stops.\" Thought Randore once again, enjoying the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandore was soon hit with another flashback, this time of her encounter with Mika. Making her hourglass figure grow, along with Lucile's had left her... very aroused towards the latter to say the least. Her curves had spurted once again from the flashback, reaching 92-18-92 and still ballooning outward. \"Mmmmmmm... at this rate, this visitor'll enjoy a wonderful day with me... whoever he is.\" Randore smiled, and let the growth spell just run its course.

Getting right into bed, their clothes taken off, the couple went right to work with the lovemaking under the bedsheets. Later that night, pumping sounds would soon fill the entirety of her mansion, along with the couple's moans of pleasure and lust, with audible stretching being heard.

Just the two of us?\" She said, getting a small nuzzling from Ku'yleh. \"That will be arranged, my dear.\" Smiled Ku'yleh, tenderly stroking the chaos lugia mistress' swollen figure.</span></div></div>",

Coming on inside were a few other pokenurses, with one of them being a tall serperior nurse, with a figure of 72-18-58, sat right next to said empoleon nurse, with the latter feeling a little tense. \"Hi, Allura.\" Smiled the empoleon nurse, \"Tired of this drama as I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is getting quite annoying how many of the pokenurses here are dwelling on this, Pauline.\" Allura replied in an exasperated tone, \"Whilst I genuinely sympathize with this Kai, like I do with all abuse victims, I really wish the drama had stopped as soon as Kai was adopted. Too much attention paid on one kid isn't very healthy for his sanity if I may add.\" Pauline nodded in agreement. \"So... shall we go to The Jade Spire for a little drink?\" Asked Pauline, \"After all this, I could really use some tequila.\" \"Hmmm... maybe back at my humble abode, we can expand ourselves at my sauna to help... unwind.\" Smirked Allura, lightly tapping Pauline's tush with her tail. \"Oh.... that'll work too.\" Pauline nervously giggled, face red with slight embarrassment.

Sitting off to the distance from the six pokegirls was a typhlosion man eyeing the six curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... now where did I see those six before?\" Thought the typhlosion man, having a feeling of Deja Vu upon seeing the six nurses.

Enjoy the hour while you can.\" Replied the duskclops waiter, leaving the six girls to enjoy their drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the six pokegirls drank, their hourglass figures were steadily growing while the typhlosion man slowly approached Allura's growing rump from behind, the curiosity overwhelming him. Allura stopped her drinking and turned around momentarily to see her would-be admirer gazing slack-jawed at her, eyes wide open in surprise. \"Good evening, sir. Do you like what you see?\" Asked Allura, rubbing her bosom sensually for the typhlosion man. \"Actually.... yes, I do Allura.\" The typhlosion man replied, \"Oh, and my name's Armond. Wonderful to meet you.\" Allura downed a few more drinks to get her hourglass figure up to 90-18-76, only to shortly afterwards use overgrowth to make her hips and butt cheeks match the width of her bosom. \"I will let my friends come meet you at the Nocturnal Pleasures motel. In the meantime, we shall enjoy our time becoming queen-sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmond nodded, handing his drink money over to the duskclops waiter as well as a tip. \"Well, have fun then, ladies.\" He replied, leaving the tavern to find the inn complex. Back with the six pokenurses, Allura had reached 102-18-102, with the other five drinking more and more to try to break triple digits; the six pokegirl nurses began slowly becoming tipsy, with Pauline jiggling her bloated curves wildly, giggling. \"Ooooooh.... this kind of happy hour's really uplifting.... not to mention a little filling.\" Smiled Pauline, rubbing her 92-18-84 figure, seeing her nipples starting to become visible as lumps under her top, \"Maybe... a little too filling sometimes.\" Pauline blushed, stroking said lumps and panting a little from the small spike in pleasure coursing through her slowly-growing body. \"Mmmmmmmmmmm... I wonder why not many people stop by here.\" Alessa smiled, her hourglass figure starting to catch up with Allura's, with a measurement of 132-16-122 and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the last bit of free drinks, the six pokenurses began vibrating in the curves and began expanding gradually, with the six pokenurses too busy giggling as their boobs and their butt cheeks began blimping out; the tickling pleasure of the growth very quickly overcame them, causing them to fall asleep shortly afterwards. Allura slowly woke up, seeing that she and the other five pokegirl nurses had reached the 300's in the breast and hips departments as well as tethered to their tables by the tails. Allura turned her attention to the duskclops waiter, smiling at her. \"The effects of those drinks are temporary.\" Said the waiter reassuringly. Allura cooed, tenderly nuzzling her face against her swollen bosom, with the waiter thinking \"The dinner rush'll be coming really soon.\" as he teleported away, leaving the six pokenurses to wait as the float effect began to slowly wear off. \"Man, sometimes happy hours in taverns can be REALLY weird.\" Thought Pauline, still somewhat fuzzy from the drinks.</span></div></div>",

Resting in her lounge chair and taking in the sun was a tyranitar girl with a decently-sized figure of 32-22-30, her sky-blue swimdress clinging to her body and soaking in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two of Marduk's possible inflatees were a plusie and minun girl, both in a green, and orange bikini, respectively; their curves were petite, both being 16-16-16. \"I... might need twin shot for those two.\" thought Marduk, scanning his next target, which was a tall lugia girl in a dark gray, legless, wetsuit, posing for many pokeboys with her figure of 42-18-46.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was a green nidoqueen girl in an orange sling bikini, walking along and minding her own business; measuring at 62-20-50, it was a wonder to Marduk that she wasn't posing alongside the lugia girl. The next girl, swimming about, was a vaporeon girl in a navy-blue bikini, with a figure of 24-16-32. Maruk shrugged, then turned to his next possible target, a pidgeot girl in a strapless, backless red one-piece swimsuit, complete with a heart-shaped boob window for the boys to see; measuring in at 42-16-20, she was indeed more of the frontal type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the next pokegirl, Marduk's jaw gaped wide open. A reshiram girl in a black strapless swimsuit, with a figure of 72-18-48, was getting rubbed in the curves by a few pokeboys. \"Oy vey, two legendary babes so far...\" Thought Marduk, \"This is shaping up to be an interesting day.\" Performing yoga several feet away from the aformentioned reshiram girl was a shiny gardevoir girl in a flower-themed swimdress; her curves were 32-16-50. A shiny floatzel girl in a magenta bikini was seen getting lovingly fondled in the breasts and between the thighs by a swampert boy; the sensually-aroused pokegirl measured in at 82-16-76. \"Whoa... a little too frisky there!\" Thought Marduk. The next pokegirl, or group of pokegirls, rather, laying down on their towels left the zoroark archer puzzled. The pokegirls' bustlines measured anywhere from 80 to mid-100's in inches, with their breasts positively sloshing with milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest-breasted pokegirl, however, was a shiny lucario girl with a whooping figure of 232-18-72; her swimsuit amounted to a white bikini bottom, and patsies covering her engorged nipples. \"Whoa, look at the knockers on this milkmaid!\" Thought Marduk, \"And, of course, it had to be a lucario. That's just great.\" Currently, however, a blaziken boy was seen dry-humping said lucario milkmaid, her moans of ecstacy leaving her panting in pleasure. \"Wait... no children in this beach?\" Thought Marduk, \"That means it must be one of those \"adults only\" beaches. Not that I'm complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last possible pokegirl for Marduk to inflate, seeing that there was already a few too many for him to choose from without blowing his cover, was the chaos lugia mistress herself, Randore. She was in a faded-white, strapless one-piece swimsuit, with her current hourglass figure size at 92-20-80, resting on her beach towel as a small group of pokeboys began fondling her curves affectionately. \"Wait a minute... Randore? Must be her day off or something.\" Thought the zoroark archer, \"Well... she's gonna be fun to get growing, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarduk began examining the two sniping spots available to him on the beach: a high-up ledge outside the beach, or on the rooftop of a nearby restaurant with a few hiding areas. \"Well, now where do I start?\" Thought the archer, getting ready for a round of pokegirl fwoompage.</span></div></div>",

Marduk pulled out the fire arrow, aiming it right at the reshiram girl before letting it fly... only for the energy arrow to absorb itself into her crotch upon hitting her, causing her nethers to quiver from underneath her suit and her boobs and hips to pulsate as her curves expanded; the pokeboys continued rubbing her figure unphased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahhhh.... this energy...\" Cooed the reshiram girl, panting as she was rubbing her ballooning figure, \"Soooooo delicious...\" Loudly moaning in ecstacy, and unable to utter out any more words, the reshiram girl felt like a pokeboy was in bed with her; the pokeboys continued rubbing away, with one of them rubbing her super-sensitive area gently. \"Ugh, I'm a little off today.\" Thought Marduk, turning his attention to the aroused floatzel girl, only to see her hourglass figure getting blimped up to 182-16-176, and still growing, due to the swampert boy puff-kissing her and filling her curves with water. \"Well, that takes care of her.\" Thought Marduk, pulling out water arrows for the vaporeon girl. Letting one water arrow fly as she stepped out back onto the beach, it puffed her breasts outward by twenty inches. The vaporeon girl, however, wasn't minding the growth; she shook it for the pokeboys ogling her as a second water arrow hit her bosom, filling her assets up by another twenty inches as they sloshed with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you boys wanted to see me bigger?\" Asked the vaporeon girl, \"Here goes!\" The vaporeon girl guzzled down a bottle of fizzy water, then shaking her curves before they bloated out 200 inches wider from the fizz; her figure now measured at 282-18-246. Marduk soon had a funny feeling that someone was watching him from his spot. \"I gotta move in a little closer.\" Thought Marduk, \"But it could be my imagination playing tricks on me. The zoroark archer found himself struggling whether to remain on his spot, or move in a little closer to the crowd, while still remaining unnoticed.</span></div></div>",

Several more arrows later, the tyranitar babe woke up, then found that her bosom was now 72 inches wide, with Marduk hiding and holding his fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... time to turn over.\" She said, cheerfully snuggling against her swollen bosom. \"Mmmmmm... at least I got pillows now.\" Marduk shrugged, pulling out a water arrow and letting it fly; upon hitting the tyranitar girl, her boobs and hips swelled up thirty inches, totalling the measurement to 102-22-60... with the sunlight quickly soaking into her water-filled curves and doubling the size to 204-22-120, with the reptilian pokegirl herself moaning blissfully from the growth before going into a rather deep sleep atop her bloated mammaries. \"Well, she's taken care of.\" Marduk thought, eyeing the lugia girl next and beginning to charge up his power, \"Now for little miss show-off.\" Upon finishing charging up, he aimed right at the lugia girl, then began rapidly shooting off arrows at the lugia supermodel; the lugia girl, however, saw the arrows coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right on cue.\" Said the lugia girl to herself before turning to the pokeboys, \"Hold onto your pants, boys, there's gonna be more of me to love REAL soon!\" \"Wait... she was expecting... nevermind!\" Thought Marduk, the arrows hitting her in the boobs as well as the butt cheeks. The lugia girl herself moaned in excitement as not only her figure was fattening up like crazy, but her nipples were puffing up under the wetsuit. As Marduk continued the arrow blitz, he felt the lugia girl tapping into his mind via telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good boy! Keep my babies growing, keep me growing until I CUUUUUUMMMM!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnhindered by the voice invading his head, and nevertheless blindly obliging to the demand, Marduk still kept the arrows flying, with all of the pokegirls watching as the lugia girl's hourglass figure reached 182-18-96 and still growing.

Exhausted from the euphoric feeling of the growth surge, the supermodel herself landed boobs-first on the sand, drowzy as the crowd began massaging her swollen body. \"Mmmmmm... thank you ladies and gentlemen.\" Cooed Natalie, \"Mommy needs her sleep now, she earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding behind cover, Marduk was holding his head in pain, sleep threatening to take hold of him. \"No. Not now!\" Thought Marduk, \"I still... got pokegirls... to inflate!\" Pulling out a syringe full of adrenaline and a gauze, he was determined to continue with his round of pokegirl snipe-flation.</span></div></div>",

I wonder why.\" Thought Marduk, remaining hidden in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next pokegirl in his sights, however, was an aggron girl with a whooping figure of 320-22-86, her outfit being nothing but a french maid outfit, albeit with only her boobs exposed save for patsies covering the engorged nipples. Marduk's jaw went agape at the sight of her. \"Geez, how many big pokegirls are in this city?\" Marduk whispered to himself, seeing a few more milkmaid pokegirls with bustlines ranging from the 90s to the mid 140s in inches. The next pokegirl to swish on by was a swanna girl in a tall, dark-blue dress, her curves measuring in at 204-18-92; the swanna socialite had a very attentive blaziken boy fondling her curves, albeit a bit wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do be gentle good sir.\" The swanna socialite cooed, blushing brightly with the blaziken boy calming down, \"Madame Sylvia and her fellow women always expect the soft touch... even in the region which I shall not mention.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" Sighed the blaziken boy, moving besides the swanna lady's bosom, and with as soft a touch he could, began massaging the lump protruding from her top. \"Mmmmmmmmm.... much better.\" Cooed the swanna socialite, planting an equally-gentle kiss on the pokeboy's cheek. The scene left Marduk's head spinning with questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is up with this city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are the pokegirls so huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much bigger are they gonna get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in Arceus' name am I pondering so much!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... now I need a good spot so I can let my arrows fly.\" Thought the zoroark archer, getting his inflation arrows ready. The two spots he detected in his mental radar was the roof of the opera house and on the rooftops surrounding the central square area. \"Simple enough, though pokegirls not already past the triple digits in curvature are gonna be pretty scarce.\" Marduk thought to himself, \"Well... ground level's pretty much death sentence bait, so let's get started.\"</span></div></div>",

Getting what appeared to be a futuristic-looking gun with a fairly large barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This beauty here's the XP-80 Inflatomatic Railgun.\" Said the alakazam man, \"All ya need to do is hold down the trigger to charge up the gun, then release to fire. Maximum growth per shot is ten inches, though, and in its current state, it's not element-compatible.\" \"Well... sure, why not?\" Responded Marduk, trading in the seemingly-bottomless stash of regular expansion arrows, \"It gets exhausting having to use that blitz mode anyway.\" Taking the railgun in return for trading the normal arrow sack, the zoroark sniper headed off for his usual round of snipe-flating the pokeladies, the alakazam man's jaw dropping wide open at the sheer number of normal expansion arrows. \"Bloody 'ell, how did he get so many 'o those?\" The pokemerchant thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at the roof of the opera house, his new railgun was all ready to go, with his rune-enchanted arrows waiting in the wings. \"Alright, here goes.\" Thought Marduk, seeing the lucario socialite, \"And there's that upper-crust lucario lady again.\" Charging up his new gun, he fired the rail shot, making her blimp up ten inches wider in the curves before taking cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... was that a random growth spurt?\" Wondered the lucario lady, stroking her rear end, fattening up in the curves by another ten inches from the second railgun shot, \"Odd, none of the other girls told me about... Oh my!\" Receiving a few more rail shots, the lucario socialite became 202-20-120, her nipples now bulging forward like cannons as more pokeboys than usual began gazing upon her flesh mountains. \"Well... the bigger the better, I suppose.\" Shrugged the lucario girl, still walking along, \"Either way, Madame Loretta's chateau could use a few more dancers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarduk looked about, then saw the swanna socialite from earlier, swishing along merrily with her faithful blaziken boy companion. \"Ah, Madame Melodia's singing voice always soothes the soul, and swells the bosoms of the ladies that hear it. Wouldn't you agree, Madame Elaine?\" The blaziken boy said, gently rubbing the swanna lady's breasts, \"Most definitely, Fiore.\" Elaine replied, \"Though sometimes, its the hips that grow up instead. Speaking of which...\" A loud, singing voice could be heard emitting from outside the opera, with Elaine's breasts swelling up by the inch per every ten seconds the song was heard, with her hips growing twice as slowly. \"Oh Madame Melodia... may your voice be immortalized for all eternity.\" Smiled the swanna girl, very gently rubbing her swelling breasts, with the sniper himself left feeling puzzled once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expansion by way of singing... well... that's a new one!\" Thought Marduk, listening to Melodia's voice, \"Just... what does this \"Madame Melodia\" look like? She must be a knock-out if she can sing that well... much moreso than many of the other pokegirls here, that is.\" Looking down through the exposed hole in the roof, he could see a melloeta lady in a tall, form-fitting dress, with the hemline several inches off the floor; her hourglass figure was at a magnificently-huge 2048-16-2048, and slowly shrinking instead of growing as she sang soprano. \"Well... damn, apparently the ladies DO get bigger than triple digits.\" Thought Marduk, \"But instead of growing as well, she's shrinking. Does she have a \"step forme\" sister somewhere around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarduk began pondering whether to investigate Melodia further, or continue focusing on puffing up those upper-crust pokegirls. \"Hmmmm... sometimes, I really wonder if there's a city for those even-larger-still pokegirls out there...\" Marduk tought to himself, still pondering on investigating the melloeta diva, having a sinking feeling that it would end terribly for him if he did so.</span></div></div>",

Upon reaching the top floor, however, he was stopped on the way down the hallway by the ebony-haired lucario lady he saw earlier, spotting him through her open door and smiling seductively at him; Marduk had a sinking feeling in his gut, but just as quickly, he became bemused at her aroused expression as she swished over to him, her curves swaying as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, good sir. My name is Suzanne.\" Said the lucario socialite, \"What are you doing on this fine day, if I may ask?\" \"Well... eh heh heh... just taking a look at the skies.\" Marduk replied, \"Nothing much else, really.\" Suzanne chuckled, her bosom lightly jiggling about. \"I see.\" Suzanne cooed, \"But first... Ahhh....\" Parting her bathrobe, Suzanne exposed her breasts in all their tantalizing glory, with Marduk dropping his jaw. \"Whoa... I'm about to get laid, and I haven't even begun fwoomping those pokegirls yet? Even the upper-crust ladies must be into the whole free love thing.\" Thought Marduk, following the lucario socialite herself into her bedroom, with the door closing behind the two. Shortly afterwards, Marduk's grunts and Suzanne's ecstatic moans could be heard coming from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive hours later, Marduk came sauntering out of Suzanne's suite, blushing with a wide, silly grin on his face. \"Whoa... I'm feeling the wild side of the \"Roaring 20's\" alright.\" Marduk thought, heading on his merry way towards the stairway to the roof; Suzanne grinned as she watched the zoroark archer leave, her hourglass figure now measuring at 232-20-100 and her breasts filling up with milk. \"Going to help my friends get bigger, are you?\" Thought Suzanne, \"Well, two can play at this little game.\" Heading into her wardrobe, Suzanne shut the door behind her to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamping himself a good distance near the edge of the suite building, the hunter noticed a Reshiram girl in a tall, black, form-fitting dress with a figure of 172-18-98, with Marduk tilting his head a little. \"Hmmm... I guess she did a bit of growing at the beach herself.\" Thought Marduk, pulling out a fire arrow, \"A little more inches wouldn't hurt her.\" Letting the arrow fly and hitting the Reshiram socialite, her hourglass figure blimped up another fifty inches, her nipples becoming visible under her top as big lumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohh.... looks like I am bound to be a part of Madame Sylvia's chateau.\" Smiled the reshiram girl, receiving another fire arrow to the breasts and swelling up another fifty inches in the figure, totaling at 272-18-198, \"Now to fix that little problem a little.\" Closing her eyes, her hips shrunk by fifty inches, with those inches going to her bosom instead. \"Much better, 322-18-148.\" Thought the reshiram girl, merrily strolling along. \"Huh, I guess some pokegirls do want to remain top-heavy.\" Shrugged Marduk, continuing on with his hunt.

The zoroark milkmaid turned to Muchiko and Gustav, curtsying for the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Madame Muchiko and Monsieur Gustav.\" Said the zoroark milkmaid, her breasts now measuring at 204 inches in width, and still growing slowly due to lactation. \"Ah, Sera, enjoying your day off I see.\" Replied Muchiko, \"Other than... a few strange cases of unexpected growth that has been going on lately, it has been a nice day for us so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokegirls moved over to nearby benches to continue their conversation, with Sera's breasts surging outward another twenty inches.

I'll wait for more.\" Marduk waited a little bit, then saw Fiore sneak underneath Muchiko's bosom... and seeing the shiny serperior socialite herself blushing bright red, still talking with Sera. Marduk shrugged, shooting a lightning arrow at Loretta, causing her curves to blimp up to 164-16-148, much to her surprise; she shortly began purring as the pokeboys continued groping her body. \"Mmmmmmm... looks like someone was generous today.\" Thought Loretta, unaware of Marduk's presence. \"Well, now what?\" Thought Marduk, \"Do I inflate the last two pokegirls, or wait for the next set before doing so?

Who might you be? And... why are you hiding in the bushes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Marduk, and what I'm doing... let's just say it's a personal hobby of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inflating other pokegirls with those arrows of yours, I see. Well then... I have but one special request before you carry on. I wish to be constantly growing... at least for one day.

Erm... are you sure you want to go through with this? I don't normally use those arrows of patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am sure. The end result matters not, just as long as I feel the wonderful feeling of air rushing into my curves, just ripe for many pokeboys and fellow pokegirls to meditate with me on top of. Together, many pokegirls will be inspired to reach the nirvana of curvature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... ok... if you insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a maxed-out Arrow of Patience, which had the rune of a grandfather clock on one of the energy feathers, Marduk fired the arrow straight at Eliza, which absorbed right into her body.

That's fantastic.\" Thought Maruk, \"Oh well, might as well get Madame Loretta growing.\" Pulling out a lightning arrow, he fired it right into the luxray socialite, with the electrical energy arrow absorbing itself into her body, causing her curves to glow and double up in size, leaving her purring and rubbing her newfound curves. \"Mmmmmmm... someone in this park must be charitable this time of day.\" Loretta thought, with a few more pokeboys coming over to massage her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his focus on the zoroark milkmaid, her breasts were now measured at 182 inches, and still slowly growing. \"Man, and the milkmaids just get bigger and bigger and... well... at least there'll be way more than enough milk to go around in this neighborhood.\" Marduk thought, \"Speaking of which...\" The next pokegirl to stroll along in the park was a shiny serperior girl in a tall, form-fitting, backless forest-green dress with a hemline cut at the side, allowing her to show plenty of leg; her hourglass figure measuring in at a jaw-dropping 732-20-480. Sitting down on the bench right in front of Marduk's current position, her enormous figure completely, albeit unknowingly, blocked him from getting any further clear shots. The serperior socialite turned to one of her pokeboy companions, a shiny gallade boy, who sat atop her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mountains will shield you from those pesky watchful eyes.\" The serperior girl whispered, \"But do remember what Madame Sylvia said: If you must caress us, do be gentle.\" \"Very well, Lady Muchiko.\" Replied the gallade boy, quickly getting underneath Muchiko's breasts, with the serperior socialite herself soon feeling the gallade boy's hand feeling the area between her thighs, quietly cooing in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, now what?\" Thought Marduk, \"I could move over into the bushes on the other side, but chances are good that someone'll catch me. Hiding between that serperior lady's cleavage, however... oh boy that'll be embarrassing... and getting a good shot from there'll be pretty tough, and getting on top of that boobage might be suicide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondering quickly, Marduk began thinking of how to continue his round of stealthily inflating the pokeladies.</span></div></div>",

Not that I would complain, mind.\" Noticing a pamphlet appearing in his pocket, Julius picked it up to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, dear visitor, to Lavendar Sector, where free love does not discriminate even between classes. There are still rules to keep in mind during your stay here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Fondling and kissing is fine, but the more intimate acts, please kindly do not do those in public... unless you are sure your partner cannot be seen.<br>\r\n2. When giving the upper-class ladies the physical affection to their bodies, do be gentle, for they are a good deal more sensitive than the average pokegirls.<br>\r\n3. Should you make love to the madames, (and trust us, they sleep with pokeboys at least once a day... and they are not shy towards even other madames either.), do not be surprised if your sensitivity levels heighten during your times of passion... amongst other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulius chuckled weakly at the third rule, blushing. \"A little too much info on that third rule, there.\" Thought Julius, continuing to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4.

Well, that's good to know.\" Thought Julius, keeping on reading through the pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5. The pokegirls are all inflatable, so do feel free to pump them up as big as you want, the ladies are free to deflate themselves as they desire, though.<br>\r\n6. Anyone caught whining about how wrong free love is, and so on and so forth, will be removed from the sector immediately and permanently. Such drivel gets severely annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulius smiled at the sixth rule. \"Well, no drama no problem. Works for me.\" Thought Julius, looking at the last two rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7.

Most importantly, if you intend to traverse the rooftops, watch out for random thugs and other ruffians. The police force is hard at work eliminating the nusiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Random thugs on rooftops?\" Thought Julius, \"Goody, it'll be like Double Dragonite all over again.\" Continuing to read the pamphlet, there were three chateaus for him to visit, each owned by an especially prominent rich pokelady: Madame Sylvia of the Rose, Madame Justine of the Tulip, and Madame Minerva of the Blossom. \"Man, this is gonna be a fun visit... though the frou-frou stuff MIGHT take a bit of getting used to.\" Julius thought to himself, thinking of which chateau to visit, \"Now which of these manses should I visit?\"</span></div></div>",

Julius snuck into Sylvia's end of the sector, wondering what kind of pokemon Sylvia is; heading through the alleyways as shortcuts, he began moving about the city like a shadow in the darkness. Peeking his head out into one of the alleyways, he grinned slyly as he wrapped both arms around the waist of a linoone milkmaid-in-waiting from behind, her figure of 30-14-10 shuddering from Julius' embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooohhh... good day, sir.\" Smiled the linoone woman, wrapping one of her arms around him in return, \"Time for my... promotion, is it?\" \"Very much so.\" Smiled Julius, taking the girl into the darkness of the alley, the milkmaid-in-waiting chuckling. Seconds after the two disappeared into the shadows, moans of pleasure from the pokegirl could be heard, along with Julius' grunts and panting. Within minutes, a loud scream of orgasmic pleasure from the milkmaid-in-waiting rung out from the alleyway, along with bulging sounds. Stepping out from the alleyways, with their clothes back on and panting in pleasure, the linoone girl was now a full-on milkmaid, her figure now 172-14-50; Julius giggled, his face blushing brightly. \"Thank you for your time, kind sir.\" Said the linoone girl, cooing as her breasts continued to swell slowly due to lactation, \"Good day, and enjoy your time in our fair sector.\" The linoone lady moaned, covering her bulging nipples up with patsies and strutting on forward. \"Whoa... now what does that pamphlet say about side effects again?\" Thought Julius, \"I might regret reading it again, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding in the same alley where he promoted the linoone milkmaid, he began reading the pamphlet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Side effects that the fair ladies of Lavendar Sector might receive post-coitus include:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Lactation<br>\r\n-Swelling of the hips<br>\r\n-Erect nipples<br>\r\n-Slight drowsiness<br>\r\n-Euphoria<br>\r\n-Feeling of weight<br>\r\n-In the case of excess intercourse, the feeling of being full of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulius shuddered at the last side effect. \"I do NOT want to know what they mean by that last part.\" Shuddered Julius, only to see a silhouette of a pokegirl socialite on the card with a huge hourglass figure and an extremely gravid belly further down the card; the caption below the figure read \"May the lovely madames of our fair sector last for eternity.\", with two silhouettes of the same pokegirl below said caption. The two images left Julius' head spinning with all sorts of thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, some kind of weird magic's at work in this sector.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or... is it science? I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If sex does... THAT to those pokegirls, something must be behind all this weird stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Prismopolis more than meets the eye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I get out of Dramaville, and then I land right into Bizzaroburg... though I'm a bit conflicted if I find that a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now should I make a temporary detour into either Maize Domain or Azure Quadrant, or keep going through Lavendar Sector? Either way, Prismopolis is definitely more than meets the eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulius pondered on his decision. \"Man... I might need a drink.\" Thought Julius.</span></div></div>",

His brother and sister, Aaron and Anne are the older ones since he is the third child born besides his younger brother, Jack was almost the youngest if the twin girls, Dorothy and Angel weren't born; they love each other very much so they can share anything without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron watched over the twins with jack while anne stayed with nando because she was the motherly type to him. When one is feeling down, the others went to make them feel better and that is very sweet since their parents were working at their jobs; a tea shop owner and a bookstore owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNando has a few friends outside of the family that treat him the same way and they are Robin, Sam, Trey, and Lily. They go over to his house to work on their homework each day because his friends liked his family better and they would spend the weekends at other houses to make it fair since they do homework at his house. His younger brother is 2 years while the twins are 3 years and the older ones are 5 and 6 years apart from him. Why he is running is because the bullies are typical in the schools and they always start trouble, but the teachers are trusting to nando because he does the right thing to do and he has always tryies to do the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the bullies had done something to him so the teachers sent him to the principal for a talk without him being in trouble and he is feeling like everyone else who was sent to principal's office, but the main head made him feel better because she gave him something to drink with a snack. They talked for awhile he felt better and she wanted him to keep doing the right thing, but keep a special item with him just in case he is trouble so that leads to our current point in the story. The principal gave him a special necklace that she had since she was young and she wanted him to have because she liked him to be apart of her family in a matter of speaking. Nando is trying to hide from the bullies that he talked about because they should be punished and a girl saw him running so she is helping him till he can use the necklace.</span></div></div>",

They have bought themselves some time till they need to run again and the necklace started to glow so they see a portal opening up with a person walking out of it and the person is looking at the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to laugh till he saw a group of kids looking for them and he wanted them to walk with him because they will be watching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person is tall, strong, like nando in a way except the look on his face like he dealt with this problem before and he is wearing a cloak with the hood covering his face. The bullies saw them so they ran to them except for the person that nando called and he wanted them to leave him alone or he will be forced to do something that he won't like to do. He pulled his cloak over the kids behind him because they could use it and the person is ryan kasshi because kagome is the principal at the school here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan doesn't have his powers because he sealed them away for good along with his power palm and he still knows martial arts from his friend, but he is just a wanderer now because his daughter has his job at the company and he can finally watch the real natural beauty in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan steps forward with his hands wearing his gloves and and he pulled out a jar with a small fire because he wanted to breath the last of it before the fight. He got his last smoke as the flamesmoke disappears into the air and he provoked the bullies toward him as his cloak protects the children from the fight. Ryan has stopped using mind games because there became ryan's trick and he started the already ended fight with several punches. He is still the same in his fights so they are on the ground in pain so he turned to the kids because they needed to get home soon so he walked them home while getting something for the bullies to stay warm and dry. Rosa and nando didn't know that ryan was watching them besides kagome told him about him with the bully problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they are walking home, they started to talk about certain things and they will see each other at school and ryan is smiling because he is thinking about them. Nando wanted him to meet his family so he will when the time is right and he went to walk rosa home. Once she got inside, he started to walk through a door back home with a smile. Nando walked with his friends to school till he saw rosa walking up to him so he took her to meet his friends as they are walking to school and they are keeping it their little secret till their parents want to know about ryan. They saw the principal coming out of a house with a smile so they went to walk with her to school and she is thinking about ryan saving the two kids from the other kids, but she saw them walking toward her.</span></div></div>",

Ryan was wearing a cloak when he was coming out to take a look at them before taking off his cloak to wrap them up. Then he pulled out a jar with a small flame inside and he breathed it into his body before beating the bullies up, but he was so fast that they couldn't see him. Kagome was smiling because he was still the same and she knows that he doesn't have his powers anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan made sure that the bullies were dry and warm so they won't freeze to death and he started to walk the two home while taking about certain things.

When he walked into the store, he saw cages, tanks, and rows of animals because he had enough money for four pets to be his family. While he was thinking about his family, something happened to make blackout and he shrunk to four inches. When he woke up, he was confused for a moment till he remembered that something made him shrink and he went looking for his new family. His first stop is the fantasy row to see a dragoness with red scales, a bright yellow belly and a huge tail that was as long as she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was huge about 30 feet tall so they started to talk so he will be buying her soon and he gave her his word before leaving to find a hotel for anthros so he went inside to find multiple doors with names of animals. He went through the wolf door to see a number of giant wolves and they saw him so one of them with a smile greeted him, but they told him the same story that the dragoness told him. Ryan was looking the female wolf because she needs someone like him so he jumped over to her hand that she held out and they hugged before being lead out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about to leave when he saw something looking at him and he told her to go to the fox room for a female fox to join their family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked out a fox that was the same age as the wolf and they are walking to the dragoness, but he let out the dragoness as they were following him. To the cat row where he saw a cat that she wanted to play with him like an older sister so he called over to the cage to push a button for someone to get her out of the cage because ryan is going home with his new family. When they were bought and they were outside of the store, the dragoness has her super power, which is size control plus her name is Radia and our kitty is Felicity so that leaves the wolf and the fox without names. He told Hope and Faith to ride on radia while he is riding on felicity and they started their way home with smiles on their faces. Well when they got home without causing any damage to the block and radia used her size control to fit inside his house while he was on his older sister waiting to get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told that has some things for them and he asked hope to help him to the closet in the master bedroom. She pulled out several outfits for her and faith, several items for felicity, and radia has her piece of home here with them. They went to put their stuff in their rooms and they went to make dinner because they will spend some time talking before going to sleep in their beds. Their meal was great because he was a great cook and he knew some meals that would fill any gut to the top. He wanted them to talk about themselves as an icebreaker before they can know him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is very happy not to be alone again so he told something about himself before jumping off the table and running to his room. They were happy that he bought them so they went to bed and felicity knew something was wrong with him so she went to sleep with him for the night. Ryan is dreaming about his family and being alone for the night until he felt something coming so he started to wake to see his sister curling around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt her warmth so he went back to sleep and started to see his new family. Their house has magic in it so he has to set the house to use it so he can spend time with them and he will do it in the morning after they finish their meal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His current family raised him like a cub and he has his own set of clothes. When he was a baby, he was alone while crying till the lioness who is called Lily found him and she knew what humans are so she took him to be taken care of by an old friend who became his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily saw how max got into her forest so she saw his former family with cruel smiles and she felt bad for him. Lily is a monolith so her size about that size for a monolith and she can change her size, but she was human size for max.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n\"Hi there little guy.\" lily said as she picked baby max<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know someone who will take good of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your old family didn't love you so I will make that won't happen again.\" she said as she carried him to a cave<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily cuddled max till they got to the cave which has a family of foxes living in it and she is a snow fox which her name is snow.

During his walk, the day was clear and there was no trouble to be caused so it was peaceful. He heard something in the bushes so he stopped to wait what was coming and out comes a lioness who looked like the one who found him, but she was in trouble and they had the same looks of looking for the right lover. A tiger anthro came after the small lioness so max did the right thing which was protecting the lioness anthro.</span></div></div>",
