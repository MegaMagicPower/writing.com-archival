            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Who will you be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam Ogleby, the college freshman -- William is a short boy who went to college as a communications major, much to the chagrin of his family. His courseload is light and he's got a lot of time to exercise, or eat. He has grey-blue eyes often covered up by his mop of blonde hair, is 5'6\" and currently 150 lbs and a fair amount of muscle. He goes to a medium size private college on the east coast, pretty far from his home in Michigan. He never came out at home but doesn't know anybody at the new university, which will allow him to reinvent himself a little, and quickly change as he meets his roommate and the other guys of the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen Pointer, the Young Professional -- Ken graduated from college a year ago and has since gotten a cushy job at an office. He keeps a full schedule but the work doesn't fulfill him, and he's been looking for something more. Ken is 6'4\", has short-cropped brown hair and green eyes, and currently 200 lbs. Ken wasn't a varsity athlete, but he did keep up with a lot of intramurals and an exercise program in college. The intramurals gone and unable to afford a gym membership, Kyle has seen his abs disappear in the past year and added about 15 lbs to his once sleek and muscular frame. He lives with four other guys (three gay, one straight) whose eating and partying habits don't help the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve Klinger, the ex-jock -- Steve woke up one morning and wasn't really sure where his body went. In high school and college, he had been a wonderful athlete, or at least looked the part, as though he was a Roman statue come to life. Now 35, Steve's body has gone through some major changes. He is 6'2\", has black hair and brown eyes and currently weighs 260 lbs. He has no intentions of gaining any more, but his partner might have something to say about that, and something to do with how he got to 260 in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter Leonard, the big-time gainer -- Peter is a guy with only a few big goals, and those include gaining weight and living life on his terms. A day trader several years ago, Peter ended up with the kind of money that means you never have to work again, and he decided not to. Now he travels and eats and spends as he wishes. Peter doesn't have a partner, but instead tends to pick up a posse of young guys and take them with him on his wild rides, usually causing them to gain weight themselves, whether they like it or not. Peter has red hair, green eyes and currently weighs 400 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny Underman, the small kid in a big family -- If Johnny's parents didn't know better and for certain, they'd swear he was adopted. A short kid (5' 7\") from tall parents, red hair from black and brown, and blue eyes from green and black, Johnny looks like he was born to somebody else. If his height hair and eyes weren't enough, his weight is the final convincer. Despite his family's constant supply of fatty foods and buffets, and Johnny's own significant eating habits, he's never been able to break 150 lbs. His father is 320, his mother 280, and his older bother 260. Some quirk has always made Johnny skinny. He's not really sure at this stage in life whether that's good or bad. He's 17, he's come out to his parents, and they're fine with it.</span></div></div>",

Who is his roommate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald Tipton, the rich kid -- Ronald is coming to college as much for fun, as anything else. His family is unreasonably wealthy and only works when they want to. Ronald has decided to have the full college experience, er, mostly. Thanks to his family's large donation to the school, he'll have the largest room, decked out with a full kitchen, big screen TV and host of other amenities. If William's not his roommate, it's likely he'll have it to himself. Ronald is 6'1\" with a chic platinum blonde haircut. He's a svelte 160 lbs now, being a fitness nut. But he's been known to change lifestyles on a fad and a whim before, often with all the latest science money can buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg Dresden, possibly a wizard -- Greg comes to this university without much. He wears plain clothes and doesn't use a computer or much other technology. It seems to disagree with him. Greg is a History major with a focus on ancient languages and cultures. A lot of time spent with books and inside has left him pale and out of shape. Greg is 5'8\" and 220 lbs. He hasn't given much thought to his body lately, but the spare time of college might allow more focus on such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam Krauss, jock -- Sam is a gay fitness nut with one desire for himself and another for the object of his affections. He studies fitness and nutrition and knows how to get the most out of every calorie. Sam knows exactly what it means to be a feeder and plans on making it his life's work. Sam is the tallest and most fit guy in the hall, at 6'8\" and 220 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Stetson -- Jack is just a regular guy who's very gay. It's very likely that he'll grow attached to his new roommate. Where it'll go from there is up to you. Jack is 5'11\", 170 and neither fit nor fat. He likes to hang out and is just fun to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The place looks big enough to be a converted lounge, which he later learns that it is. William is astounded by his surroundings, which are even more luxurious than his own home. The dorm room is decked out with all brand new, stainless-steel appliances in the kitchen, a wide-screen TV bigger than William's even ever seen at the store, and on one side of the room a king-sized modernistic four-poster bed. In one corner of the room, as though transplanted awkwardly in, is a standard bed, desk and wardrobe that the college provides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald comes in from the kitchen to greet his new roommate. He's dressed in stylish clothes and has his platinum blonde hair coifed just right. He greets William and at the same time beckons three large men from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of William's stuff for us, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three movers pick up William's small amount of stuff and begin to put it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do that.\" William says to Ronald, more than a little embarassed.<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Ronald replies. \"That's why I hired movers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam can't argue with his logic, or the fact that he seems to be the first person in history to win the roommate lottery. Ronald is not only rich, but seems friendly and willing to share. They decide to share stories over pizza and beer. \"We'll order out this time. My chef can come in later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a chef?\"<br>\r\n\"I have a whole personal staff, but I wanted to leave them behind while I went to college. I want the real college experience.\"<br>\r\nWilliam tries to look away so as not to make a face at the remark, but can't find a direction to look that doesn't have him staring at some clear evidence that Ronald is NOT having the real college experience.<br>\r\n\"Okay, so... most of the real college experience. Including a roommate; you!\"<br>\r\nWilliam laughs a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza arrives much faster than usual and the boys continue conversation, Ronald between bites. \"I was pretty excited to leave my personal trainer behind. She's crazy strict about not just my exercise program but my diet too. Or she was. My other staff I left at our house and left them on paid leave. Her I fired. OH how I missed pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the boys sit together on the luxurious couch and watch a movie. Once the pizza disappears, Ronald grabs bags of snacks and sodas. It's not long until they're both feeling stuffed and tired, and go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food and the relaxing quickly become a habit and a pattern for both boys, though it's not always pizza. Ron's money buys them whatever food they want whenever they want, and he even brings his chef into town on weekends to help out. They manage to pack on the freshman 15 in three weeks. Ronald loves it. He loves finally enjoying all the food his money can buy, and even enjoys the new feeling of his weight. He decides to start gaining weight on purpose. William decides...</span></div></div>",

Assisting Ronald, however, did seem like fun. He had enjoyed seeing the extra poundage appear all over Ronald's body. His abs had just disappeared and William was looking forward to helping him grow. They decided to have a big dinner to celebrate. Ron orders from six different restaurants all to be delivered to their dorm room. Pizza, burgers, platters of lasagna, steaks, are augmented by milkshakes in which William puts gaining powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam is deeply impressed by how much Ron puts away, now that his mind is put to it. He eats two large pizzas, several burgers and a plate and a half's worth of lasagna before declaring he is stuffed. His stomach is pushed out far and his belly is swollen.

A second later, his full stomach begins to deflate.

Before William's eyes, Ron gains 10 lbs. It's the hottest thing William's ever seen. Ron appreciates what's just happened, but what's most apparent to him now is that he's hungry again. William brings him the remainder of the lasagna which he eats even faster than the last time. He continues, eating the steaks and finishing off the gainer shakes.

William goes back to the belly first, the heart of the matter. Empty now, it's soft, and he rubs and massages it with firm, insistent hands. He sees, through the straining underwear still barely on, that Ron is beginning to enjoy it. But the underwear is so tight that it won't slide off. William's even afraid to cut them off. He decides that the only way to get them off is the same way as the others. But not wanting to stop fooling around, he'll feed and fool at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam grabs the numerous desserts they ordered for the dinner and lays them out in front of Ron. Ron starts to dig in, but William slaps his hand away. He forces Ron into a reclined position and sits over his legs. He pushes his own small belly into Ron's larger one and rubs the surrounding area with his free hand as he spoons dessert into Ron's hungry mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowls of ice cream, cheesecakes, baked goods and tarts are fed to Ron, and William notices that the rapid expansion sessions also seem to have increased Ron's capacity. He eats 2 gallons of ice cream, a whole cheesecake and at least two dozen individual tarts before becoming full again. William feels the belly underneath his own get larger and larger, firmer and firmer, and he adjusts to accomodate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon is loving every moment, though by all rights he should be in pain by virtue of the elastic stretched to its utter limit around his waist. William, sensing it is time, readies a third pill and subtly places it into another tart, in order to catch Ron by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, underneath his own belly, William feels Ron's belly begin to soften, deflate and spread to the body. The suggestion of moobs previously on Ron's chest grow to something more, while under William's legs he can feel the thighs swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ron's underwear gives way and rips into pieces along the seams.

The sensation is wholely unique and amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in a series of swift movements, Ron pulls the shirt over William's head but keeps it on his arms, at the elbows. With one hand, he holds it to the bed, pinning William down. He then guides William's legs up onto his shoulders. There is a pause and William's hands are temporarily free, as Ron slips on a condom. But in a moment his hands are trapped above his head again, and his legs are locked into place on Ron's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam feels warm, lubed fingers insistently stretching him out before a Ron's head insists upon entry. As always the first stroke is calm and deliberate. But as Ron reaches fully sheathed, William feels Ron's belly push against the bottom of his legs. It is a new sensation and William loves it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon begins to move in and out, increasing in speed and leaning forward. He stretches William's legs, pushes his arm down and with his remaing free hand begins to work his cock. William knows he will not last long between all the heavenly sensations being put his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon pushes faster and faster, matching the rhythm of his body and his hand. William's tightness does him in, and Ron comes shortly after. They clean up quickly with a towel and lay together afterward, William absentmindedly rubbing Ron's new belly.</span></div></div>",

William told himself it wasn't for the stuff, and that wasn't a hard sell. He enjoyed every moment of being with Ron, though he hadn't expected any of this.

He had previously researched about these types of things, knowing Ronald would want to experiment for his full college experience. He realized he could be put up for the rest of his life by Ronald. He also knew that Ronald would never personally have to work a day in his life and could afford to be the more dependent, physically, of a couple. Plus he had wondered how far this gain could go for the wealthy boy. He couldn't ignore his other findings, on Ronald's side-project: funding a science department to reverse engineer changes in body weight and muscle versus fat content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ronald,\" William pleaded as he caressed down the playboy's newfound pudge.<br>\r\n\"Honey... I,\" he stammered, \"you don't have to if y-\"<br>\r\n\"Baby,\" William started as he straddled Ron, \"it's fine! But, do you think we could switch roles?\"<br>\r\nWilliam cupped his hands at the center of Ron's underbelly, rubbing back and forth<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ron choked out, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"You like to change things up, right?

What would you let me do?\"<br>\r\n\"What...\" Ronald closed his eyes as William nibbled his neck,<br>\r\n\"Feed you?\"<br>\r\n\"ever...\" William licked a trail up to the boy's ear<br>\r\n\"Grow you?\"<br>\r\n\"you...\" Ronald's excitement was practically jabbing William through his pants<br>\r\n\"Incite ravenous hunger?\"<br>\r\n\"want!\" Ronald echoed in the lounge, as he dripped in his jeans<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald attacked William, surrendering to the coercive seducer.<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the weeks, Ronald gave William blind access to his resources.<br>\r\nIt was incredible how many resources were providing him with ammo.<br>\r\nEndless food on call and pills/powders/tasteless fluids that ranged from lower metabolism effects, direct weight gain, appetite stimulants, to tips about how to lose (or gain) fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of those sorts of supplements, Will thought he'd use sexual urge to coax Ron into eating. It was so funny and cute to see how soaked Ronald's briefs (or jeans) would be after a feast, a buffet, and a force-feeding finale, even without being touched or mention of sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Will was told <i>What - ever - you - want</i> so he devised a notebook of different rules to try out (such as his \"don't move up a clothing size\").<br>\r\nPeople would've been blessed to have such a chance to experiment in their college years.<br>\r\nThe couple still enjoyed luxury and the comfort of each other's acceptance and caring. Will kept up his dinners with Ron, with a simple addition of lean proteins and supplements that helped him grow a fair bit of muscle under his padding, allowing him to complete tasks faster/easier for Ron.

Greg has sizeable manoobs and an admirable belly that rolls up as he bends over to strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam tosses his clothes over and catches Greg's. He slides into Greg's oversized clothing easily. He has to hold up the pants, but when he looks over to Greg's side of the room, he sees that Greg is still naked, and looking rather blushed all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't fit into these... yet,\" he says, clearly embarassed about his weight.<br>\r\nWilliam tries to reassure him. \"I know you might have been teased about it before, but keep a couple things in mind here. One, you're about to lose all the fat on your body in about 90 seconds. And two, you're talking to the voluntary recipient of every pound. I am one person you can be 100% sure is not judgmental about your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiles, still a little nervously, but stands up. He's still wearing his underwear, but William now gets a full appreciation of the body. In full standing position, the belly hangs beautifully forward in a way that makes William want to reach out and touch it. Not thinking, he does, and the process begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam feels the spark again, and warmth spreads starting from his fingertips to his whole body. Knowing what's happening this time, he gets to savor it as his body swells up. His small pecs grow to small manoobs, draping over his growing belly. His thighs also thicken and he feels his whole body simply get heavier as the process continues. The clothes, barely staying on his body before, fill up and even grow tight as it concludes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight being distributed over two inches less of height, as well as the body fat William carried on him already, are less negligible than he thought. The clothes are tight on William, and the t-shirt even rides up a bit to show the beginnings of his new belly. Greg, meanwhile, looks dangerously thin and has to pull the belt to its tightest setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys look more than a little ridiculous, with William wearing clothes that are simultaneously too tight and too long, and Greg wearing clothes that are too baggy and too short. William hears Greg's stomach growl from across the room, and his own agrees. He suddenly realizes he hasn't eaten all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys agree to head to the cafeteria. Once there, they dig in. William is enjoying the idea of keeping up with his new weight, and Greg falls into old eating habits. They find that...</span></div></div>",

Two nights a week, he had a two hour class when both William and Greg were off. They decided to use this time to enchant as many of his things as possible. William thought he'd be standing guard while Greg went inside, but Greg had a different plan. He would teach William to use the spell, and then they'd be able to double their efforts. In order for his plan to work, however, he'd have to transfer half of his fat to William first. William agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe learned the spell quickly, and practiced putting 5 lbs of fat into a few objects around the dorm room. After only a couple, William looked cut. Where Greg seemed to have never exercized, it was still a part of William's daily routine, and when he took away the fat on his body, he looked scarily like a model. His muscles were shapely, and though not huge, looked large and defined by the absence of any padding. He had a tight torso and squared off pecs that looked harsh and cut even without dramatic lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo test the success, Greg picked up the TV remote William had cast a spell on. William saw him pick it up then look at the remote strangely. He even shook it a little. Nothing happened. \"I didn't feel that warm sensation we usually get. Did I get any heavier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam is embarassed to say he didn't notice anything, knowing Greg is sensitive about his weight. \"Why don't you try the scale?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, I probably should have weighed myself beforehand, in that case. I don't know exactly what I weigh.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, get on the scale and we'll have to test it on the next one.\"<br>\r\nGreg gets on the scale. It flips back and forth before landing on 225. Greg then picks up a toothpaste tube that William enchanted and watches the scale. William, instead, watches Greg. Paying close attention pays off, and William notices as Greg's body shifts ever so slightly. He sees the t-shirt push out just a little further, the pants waist tighten up a little bit more, and the butt stretch out of the jeans a little tighter as well. The scale reads 230.<br>\r\n\"Looks like it works. I'm just surprised the spell didn't have that warm feeling like usual.\"<br>\r\n\"This is perfect, though! That way he'll have no idea what's happening. Not even a sensation when it happens.\"<br>\r\n\"The only catch is, if he doesn't touch the object within a week, the fat transfers right back to where it came from.\"<br>\r\nWilliam is troubled for a second, then comes up with an idea. \"We'll make it a contest. When we're in there, we'll each take it in turns to enchant one item, until we've no fat left. Then, at the end of the week, whomever weighs less wins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea clearly sounds fun to Greg, if the smile broken on his face is any indication. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night of the planned break-in comes and William and Greg prepare to get in. They wait in their room perched and waiting for Ben to leave. To prepare, William casts the fat transfer spell. They each stand on scales and watch the numbers to make sure they start on equal footing. As they begin, William is at 135, having shed some pounds through the spells. Greg is at 235, having taken them on. The extra 15 lbs are weighing on his clothes, usually loose, now outlining every fold. His belly peeks out of the bottom of his t-shirt, usually just long enough to cover the overhang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hold hands and the process begins. Watching each one is like watching a video of the other, in reverse. William almost immediately feels uncomfortable and regrets the decision not to wear different clothes. The sensation is pleasurable, but the sudden tightness in his jeans is uncomfortable until the button pops open. A belly begins, pushes forward and ever so slightly hangs down and out of his t-shirt usually hanging just at the waist of his jeans. His pecs soften and round out, and his face, even more slightly, does the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the process finishes, Greg's pants fall down. The loss of 50 pounds accounted for several inches in the waistline, and though Greg had been wearing a belt, it only held on for so long.</span></div></div>",

He dropped the second pair of jeans and dug in the drawer again coming out with a pair of sweatpants and another stored 20 pounds.  His belly was now a good sized balloon bobbing as Ben stretched and tugged the baggy sweatpants up to his waist where they just barely fit under his belly.  At it's new size, Ben was no longer able to ignore it. It now fell softly over the waistband of the sweatpants.  Ben looked around as if he knew that he was the subject of some terrible prank.  Nothing to see and Ben sat heavily in a chair.  Sitting, his belly was even more obvious and 10 more pounds stored in the chair added to its size.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ben's got up and rushed from the room.  William and Greg were surprised.

The revenge, and Ben's own resistance, are just icing on the cake. Together, William and Greg plan for the event. Ben goes to the shower at odd hours. It's late in the morning, when everyone else is already gone. It's probably so that nobody can mess with him in the shower, but since William and Greg share a morning off once a week, it's perfect for their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey prepare early in the morning. Greg performs the spell quickly and transfers all of his fat to William. William feels the warmth again, spreading throughout his body, but the prolonged exposure gets hotter. He feels himself sweating and this time watches the fat grow over his body. Remembering the tightness in his clothes last time, the boys had the foresight to wear untied robes this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 20 lbs from their previous encounter return, and William, with even less height than Greg to spread it over, develops the beginnings of a belly. He feels his front half sag quickly, like sand is being poured into a bag over his shoulders. He feels his ass grow too, more cheek touching cheek as the buttocks expand. He wonders if it's the magic or the fat that's turning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 more lbs pass from Greg into William and the belly is growing even more. It has a soft weight to it, and begins to push the sides of the robe apart. When William moves to close it again, he notices that even his arms feel heavier. They are softer and hang more as he pushes the robe together again, and tight. His thighs, too, begin to touch and continue to do so as the weight pours on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final 30 lbs pour onto William's body and he is barely recognizeable. 70 lbs heavier than he was 5 minutes ago, William's belly can barely be held in even by his robe. It is topped by manboobs, with nipples considerably larger than before. His thighs grip each other in sweat. The whole process has made him hot and sweaty. William raises his hand to wipe his brow and notices that even his hands have changed and are pudgy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys break contact. William looks over at Greg and is terrified. Greg, drained of all his fat, is dangerously thin. There is little muscle tone to speak of, and so even under robes it is easy to tell that Greg is unhealthily thin. Greg seems to notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll have to put some of that back on. Shouldn't be too hard, and maybe I'll do it the natural way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pats his belly, or where it was, and winces, forgetting there isn't padding to absorb the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam feels uncomfortable in his new body, even temporarily, and decides to take a shower. Greg reminds him that he only has a half-hour before the change becomes permanent, but William waves him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower, everything feels different. William's taken showers before, but never like this. There's so much more of him to get wet, to massage, to soap up and enjoy. William rubs himself all over and takes full advantage of the hot water on his belly. He finds it particularly gratifying to grab his ass with both hands; a much fuller task than before. Before he knows it, Greg runs into the bathroom and shouts \"You've only got 30 seconds left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam panics. In the space under the stall wall, he sees another guy's leg. He can't tell who it is, but he could transfer the fat to them in the time remaining. Or, does he try to run and give it back to Greg?</span></div></div>",

Michael can see that from the moment he catches an eye of the dirt-encrusted, paint-chipped sign. \"Geisenhauer's\", it reads, in an old blackletter script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the store is full of tall, crooked shelves overstacked with a nearly limitless supply of items stacked haphazardly, and with no apparent organizing principle. Greg moves through the maze of racks, shelves, and larger artifacts on the floor with practiced ease. William has to carefully inch through, at several times watching his head for hanging objects he hadn't seen a moment earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it to the counter, where William realized that Greg had been collecting items all the way there. He spread his arms and several items clacked onto the glass counter. There were several little bottles. Some were filled with dried, unidentified roots, some with different colored powders and some with disturbing, colored liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise seemed to rouse a shopkeeper in the back. William heard the steps of a rickety ladder creak, and a moment later, the tall shopkeeper emerged, a pen behind his ear and a particular dusty book in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the moment he entered the room, the shopkeeper did not take his eyes off of William. He dealt with Greg's purchases with familiarity, but never looked at them; William noticed that he handed over a wad of money and a vial of his own in exchange for what he received. Greg's vial contained a white substance William was sure he recognized but had a hard time believing he was correct. As he took the money and vial, the shopkeeper still stared at William with a disturbing fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg answered cautiously. Though obviously familiar with the shopkeeper, he too was unnerved by the staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is William, my new roommate. At college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two... cohabitate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a half-question, and it hung in the air unanswered. William tried looking away, hoping that not returning the shopkeeper's stare would cause him to break it. He was wrong. When he looked back, the shopkeeper spoke to him this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see something you wish was yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam was about to say no, with a marked disgust in his voice, when he saw an object over the shopkeeper's shoulder. On a shelf at his own eye level, was a wax sculpture of what looked a little like a Buddha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper did not look back, but instead reached into his old coat and produced an identical sculpture. On closer examination, William could now see that it was a candle. And rather than the Buddha he thought he'd seen, it was just a fat man, slapping his belly and smiling. William thought it was funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled. \"This candle is a gypsy charm dating back to the dark ages. They sold it to those who wished to be rich. When burned, it is said to bring the appearance of great prosperity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you? Call it a free sample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man deftly tossed the candle to William, who caught it smoothly. In his hands, it somehow felt soft, though it's form did not change under pressure. The smell was notable too, and highly recognizable. It smelled like fried food and made William quite hungry. Despite this, Greg is the one to bring it up: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Weren't we going to go out to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys leave the shop and quickly find themselves at a pizza place nearby. They eat...</span></div></div>",

For some reason, his old boxers didn't change, so he peels them off and grabs a new pair. They're silk and feel wonderful all the way up, like a soft breath all around him. Behind the new boxers are some silk pyjamas, so William grabs those and slides them on as well. They've clearly been tailored to droop loosely about his new figure, and the clothes caress him in every spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam walks around the room just to feel the sensations of the clothing. All over his body, a gentle caress is supplied. He's just starting to get hard when Greg wakes up. He seems surprised and disoriented until he turns around and sees William, dancing around in new pyjamas. He smiles, almost laughs, and heads to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both boys clean up, they decide to go out to the campus for a little bit and test out their new clothing, and William's new body. They put on new, finely tailored clothing -- Greg's never been so comfortable in his life -- and go out to the cafeteria. It appears, that while the candle's spell altered their clothing and surroundings, it didn't give them cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the cafeteria, they hear whispers. People are looking their way and talking. They look each other over, and nothing seems out of place, so they go forward to get some food. When they arrive at the line, the cafeteria worker, who's been rude to the last 50 people before them, smiles and says \"One moment sirs\" before disappearing into the back room. She re-enters with two banquet plates with ornate covers. \"Where will you be sitting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg points to a table over to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe comes out from behind the cafeteria line and starts walking to the table. William and Greg follow her, and sit down as she's putting the plates in front of them. She lifts the covers, and underneath each is a feast. Lobster, steak, and finely whipped mashed potatoes decorate William's plate. Greg has an impossibly large filet mignon and several other dishes William doesn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys are a little confused but don't hesitate to dig in and enjoy the meal. As soon as they finish, the cafeteria worker returns with cake. Two whole individual cakes, in fact, and places them in front. They're rich, chocolate and three layers high with fresh strawberries cut decoratively on top. A little slower than the main course, William and Greg finish their desserts and get up to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir clothes are tighter now, and a little uncomfortable. William undoes his belt as they leave the cafeteria. As they approach the dorm building, William feels his clothes get tighter. When he looks down, he sees...</span></div></div>",

Just as he reaches the door, he hears several rips, and on the other side, his pants fall down in tatters. His shirt has bust two buttons, but is barely staying on, the space between the buttons stretched to its utmost. The buttons are so tight he can't undo them, and has to rip the shirt apart.

William's silk boxers are exceedingly comfortable, and caress him at every move. He shifts in them slightly, which disturbs Greg enough to wake him up. The two disentangle and decide to get ready to go out. William wraps himself in a towel and heads to the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower, at this weight, is a new experience for William. He's looked at his new weight in the mirror, but the extra girth means more to wash and more to touch, and for some reason seems extra sensitive. Just from washing his body in the new weight, he's hard in a minute and enjoying rubbing his belly. He finishes quickly and doesn't think about it much as he dries off and returns to the dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that fits William now is an older pair of Greg's jeans and a t-shirt. William looks like he's wearing an older brother's clothes, since despite his new gain, he's still two inches shorter and thirty pounds lighter than Greg. Now, William has to hold up his pants, since Greg only owns one belt and needs it for himself. They make it to the magic store with relatively little trouble; William drives this time. This time, the shopkeeper is re-stocking the shelves in the middle of the store and sees them when they come in. His smile is probably the same, but William is sure it's creepier than last time. Greg does the talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to know more about the candle.\"<br>\r\n\"The gypsy curse candle?\"<br>\r\nWilliam chimes in. \"Curse? It was cursed?\"<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper looks surprised he didn't know. \"... Yes, it was cursed to make whomever burned it appear wealthy.\"<br>\r\n\"Why would that be a curse?\"<br>\r\n\"I may sell their artifacts, but don't expect to be able to explain Gypsy logic.\"<br>\r\nHe turns to Greg. \"Why didn't you tell him?\"<br>\r\n\"I thought it was a fake. I've seen you unload hundreds of those things from crates in the back.\"<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper is clearly not offended.<br>\r\n\"Well, those <i>were</i> fakes. For a... friend of yours, I produced a real one.\"<br>\r\nWilliam interrupts. \"How do I change back?\"<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper chuckles. \"Gypsy curses don't work that way.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean there's nothing I can do?\"<br>\r\nWith an evin crueller grin, the shopkeeper pulls an uncharacteristically modern book out from under his countertop. In bright, red, large letters, the title says 'LOSE WEIGHT NOW, ASK ME HOW.'<br>\r\n\"19.95.\"<br>\r\n\"That's... not a magic book.\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Isn't there a magical way to lose this weight?\"<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper looks at Greg. \"Again, I would expect you to have covered this, since you've been searching.\"<br>\r\nGreg answers this time, though it's clear he's repeating words the shopkeeper has spouted at him. \"The desire to be skinny is relatively new. Magic is thousands of years old, and most spells are 200 or more years old. There isn't a spell to just make you skinny.\"<br>\r\n\"And there certainly isn't one to erase gypsy curses. Even the minor ones they used on rubes.\"<br>\r\n\"So what can I do?\"<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper points to the book again. \"19.95.\"<br>\r\n\"The spell didn't work correctly,\" said Greg.<br>\r\nNow the shopkeeper is interested. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"It only changed our possessions for a couple of hours, but it's keeping William heavy.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you burn it all the way through?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"All the way through in one sitting?\"<br>\r\n\"No, actually. It stopped halfway through and then we lit it again.\"<br>\r\n\"There you go. The same reason that only your friend is heavier. You have to burn it all at once, and whoever participates in the burning will be affected. I assume your friend lit it the first time?\"<br>\r\nWilliam nods.<br>\r\n\"I suppose if it's the fine clothes you're missing, I can give you another try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe produces another candle from his coat and sets it on the counter.</span></div></div>",

He doesn't answer. The shopkeeper picks up the stone in one hand and begins to rub it with his thumb and some measure of practised precision. Suddenly William feels compelled to answer, almost as if there were strings on his lips and a hand pushing air out of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air feels strange, leaving him. And as he obeys the invisible compulsions, he feels warm and pleasant, all over. The questions continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You prefer the company of men?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure comes again, and William can not resist the question. <br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam is suddenly aware of the blood flow throughout his body. His skin is now aroused and sensitive, and he smiles without thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this was a secret at your school. Nobody knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he answers, even with a no, he feels even more of the pleasurable warm sensation spreading through his body. If it continues, he's sure he'll get hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone knew?\"<br>\r\n\"One boy.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah. Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper puts down the stone and replaces it in his case. Quickly, the sensation fades from William. He's not sure how to feel about the whole experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will accept two locks of your hair, one from above and one from below, and a sample of your essence.\"<br>\r\n\"My... essence?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, it means what you think it means. There is a room on the right you can use.\" The vials are in the cupboard on the back wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam turns to Greg, who nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I do it all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam ventures into the room and draws the curtain behind him. He grabs a pair of scissors and cuts a small lock of hair from the back of his head. He cuts the second lock, of pubic hair, and gets ready to... give a sample. Reaching down, he accidentally rubs his belly through the light t-shirt fabric. More so, than even in the shower, this feels warm. The lingering effects of the stone have left him sensitive, and he rubs his belly again, intentionally this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmth spreads throughout his body, and he begins to get hard. He continues the belly rub at a relaxed pace, ultimately enjoying the sensation and hardly aware of his surroundings. He's hard quickly and finished faster, filling up two vials. He cleans up and heads back into the main store, where the shopkeeper and Greg have been talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to tell you, we just met.\"<br>\r\n\"And you were... randomly assigned?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. The school does it by lottery. Though I have noticed a lot of gay guys in our wing.\"<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam lays the vials on the counter. The shopkeeper takes them and opens up his register. He hands William the Tenallardis and $200 in cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam is surprised and excited. The extra vial is apparently worth $200. He makes a mental note for a possible source of income later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To use the stone, hold in your dominant hand and stroke with your thumb. Think only about what you want. It helps to speak it repeatedly when you're first getting started. Keep in mind, even if you get it right -- wicked sense of humor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam and Greg leave the store, both with $200 in cash and a wishing stone.

Jack is still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg asks \"Are you all right?\"<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"You guys came in to say hi and then kind of collapsed.

They leave together and go back to their room, collapsing onto their respective beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, William gets up but finds that Jack is already up. Their room, which had been clean after just moving in, is now littered with wrappings from all kinds of junk food. William and Jack's parents had both left care packages, but William sees that Jack is now plowing through the last bag of cookies left by his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\nJack does not look up, but continues eating. William hops out of bed and tries again.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Quit eating those!\"<br>\r\nJack still does not respond, Suddenly, William feels an overwhelming hunger and has to have those cookies for himself. He grabs Jack's hand to pull the cookies away, and the hunger vanishes. Jack looks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... hey.\"<br>\r\n\"What the hell, man? You ate everything my Mom left for me!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. I woke up this morning and I was so hungry I couldn't think of anything but food.\"<br>\r\n\"That's pretty obvious,\" William says, pointing to the wrappers all over the room.<br>\r\nJack looks around as though he's just realizing the extent of what's happened.<br>\r\n\"Uh... I'm sorry. I'll buy you more stuff. And clean up this mess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looks truly apologetic. William is a little unnerved. It seems like Jack was totally out of his head with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well I'm gonna go take a shower and then go to breakfast. I don't have class until 11 today. Can you clean this up while I'm out?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower, William is distracted, wondering what's wrong with his roommate. 'Jack seemed like a perfectly normal guy. Is this hunger just some weird quirk?' William is so engrossed in thought he doesn't notice Greg coming into the showers as well.

He has no frame of reference for Jack, but Jack seems to chow down a lot too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam and Jack's 11 o'clock class is fairly boring, just an introduction to the course and professor. He finds it difficult to focus the whole time, even though the class only lasts a half-hour, because of a growing hunger. Despite a large and late breakfast, William finds himself taking third helpings at lunch, and still not feeling full. At his 2-4 p.m. class, William can hardly pay attention at all, and both boys skips their 4-5, heading for the cafeteria. Jack loads a tray full of plates, which are in turn full of food. William similarly loads up and sits down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike they haven't eaten in days, both boys dig into their food with reckless abandon and clear the trays full of fatty cafeteria food. Still they are so hungry that William pushes Jack for his place in line. They come back to the table with individual servings this time and eat, but are finally full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stops at the store on the way home to replenish the junk food he destroyed, but William goes straight home. The day has been strange, new and tiring, and despite not having any classes the next day, he goes to sleep early. The next morning William's alarm goes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe curses forgetting to shut it off before going to sleep, but gets up anyway. William gets out of bed, but he doesn't take three steps before he's struck by an extreme hunger. Food suddenly seems more necessary than air. On their shared couch, he sees the bags of junk food Jack must have brought back, and digs into them, tearing some of them open with such force that they fly all over the room. He opens every bag and eats ravenously until it's empty. He's about to start grabbing food from the floor when he feels a tap on his shoulder and comes to his senses. Jack is standing over him, looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\"<br>\r\nWilliam sits back. \"I-- I don't know what came over me.\"<br>\r\n\"It's just like what happened yesterday to me.\"<br>\r\n\"It's never happened to me before.\"<br>\r\n\"Me either, before yesterday.\"<br>\r\n\"Weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys are weirded out, but try to think nothing of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He hasn't really looked at himself much since he first got here, and certainly not this naked, but now the differences are noticeable. He's gained 22 lbs since he first got here, and it shows all over. He has a true belly, albeit a small one. His breasts sag slightly. His thighs are thicker, though they don't yet touch.

It's rare to find him in on any night, unless he's throwing a party at their collective house.

Matthew has often thought about using his position as a pharmacist at an experimental lab facility to assist with that process, but he should probably acquire test subjects first.</span></div></div>",

He watched him eat just a little too much and exercise too little. He watched him go out dancing less and drinking more. He watched him go up two pants sizes but refuse to buy new ones. And all this time, for many reasons, Shayne did not pursue Ken. But one by one, his reasons faded, and became irrelevant, until just one remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's boyfriend wasn't a bad person, nor was Ken particularly unhappy with him, which made it an ethical low ground for Shayne to try and break them up. Their long distance relationship created by graduation, however, was eventually destined to fail by the nature of the people in it. Neither really had the money to travel, or the inclination to save carefully enough to get it. Neither was good at keeping scheduled contact times, and Ken's boyfriend was quite jealous. Ken refrained from going out dancing, since his boyfriend said it was like almost cheating. He also refrained from working out, since he and his boyfriend had met at the gym. Drinking with friends was considered ok, which Shayne found ironic since he was, though passively, trying to steal Ken away, and one of the people most likely to succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShayne and Ken had never dated, but that was mostly Shayne's decision. Ken had not (until now) been Shayne's type, but Shayne had always been Ken's. Somehow, though the two had never broached the topic of sex, until one night when Shayne was in their shared living room. Ken came storming out of his room talking on his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Then I won't go to the gym, or the club, or the gay bookstore! What's next? Are you worried I might pick up guys at the grocery store? Or work? Maybe I should never leave the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a pause and his boyfriend is presumably responding. Shayne can hear noise but not distinguish words on the other half of the conversation. Ken speaks up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't buy this crap anymore. This 'I trust you, not other guys' crap doesn't work. It takes two to cheat, so unless you're afraid people are gonna drug me and take me behind the shed, it means you don't trust me not to do things with another guy. And I'm not gonna be with someone who doesn't trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen seems to be calming down, and Shayne can no longer hear yelling from the other side of the conversation, but it is apparent that there still is one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that means its over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is another pause. Shayne isn't sure if anything is said on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last part finished, Ken plops down on the couch next to Shayne. Even seated, their height difference is incredibly noticeable. Shayne looks up to Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sorry you heard me yelling. I hate to yell.\"<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\nThere is a tense pause, which Shayne breaks.<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly, relieved. I think we both knew it was coming soon. And that argument wasn't really necessary, I just felt like I had to get it off my chest. I feel like he's been keeping me trapped all year, and I just took it.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it still sucks when things end.\"<br>\r\n\"That is what chocolate, ice cream and bad movies are for.\"<br>\r\nShayne smiles and jumps up. \"Grab Bridget Jones from the shelf and put it in. I'll get the ice cream.\"<br>\r\nThey do. Shayne smiles widely to himself as he goes to the kitchen to get their prescribed breakup cure. Sitting on the couch together, closer by the scene, they're not halfway through the movie before Shayne's head is on Ken's chest and he's feeding him the ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surprisingly simple in the end, getting what he wanted.</span></div></div>",

Each night after work he would come home and they would watch movies together. Sometimes in the living room, like the first night, sometimes in each of their bedrooms, but always with an ever-growing collection of snack food. Popcorn, candy, ice cream... by the end of the week it was like Ken had bought half a concession stand in with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Shayne didn't partake he did enjoy feeding and the occasional stomach rub, staying close to Ken throughout. He loved the feeling of Ken's growing stomach each night. How it would get larger, swollen and tight as he stuffed himself to whatever awful flick had popped up on cable. He loved to stuff it each night and then feel it again the next day, just a little softer than the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week, a line was crossed. During the past year, Ken had outright refused to by new clothes as his body began to change shape. If he was honest with himself, he'd gone up two pants sizes, but he had refused to buy new ones. But the constant stuffing for a week changed things, and now five pounds heavier in a matter of seven days, he had finally reached the point where his pants wouldn't close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called Shayne into his room, still in his underwear and trying to pull his pants together around his waist. Shayne had been seeing and rubbing that belly all week, but seeing it unclothed again was exciting. He did his best not to stare, but each time Ken tried to pull the pants up and together, he pushed the belly up and out, making it look even bigger. All over Ken's body, Shayne could see the difference. He'd noticed slight changes over a year, but having stepped up the pace over the last week, things were much more noticeable. It excited Shayne even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sat down on his bed and gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got work in an hour. What do I do?\"<br>\r\n\"Call in sick,\" said Shayne. \"We'll get some new clothes for you.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have a budget for new clothes right now.\"<br>\r\n\"We'll go down to my work. I'm sure we can find something there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShayne's interests had found him unsurprisingly working at a Men's Big and Tall shop. The job wasn't much but it had its perks for Shayne, which usually meant silently tracking the growth of his clients, but today meant getting some free clothes for a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen put on a t-shirt and the only pair of jeans he could still entirely close and they left together. The shirt was uncomfortably tight for Ken, but delightful for Shayne, who could see every ounce of fat almost more clearly than when he had seen Ken without a shirt on at all. It was tight and clearly outlined Ken's rounding, soft belly. And whenever Ken moved a lot, the bottom of the shirt rode up revealing a happy trail going down and under the bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the store, Shayne had Ken measured for a new suit and clothing, which would be ready in three days. After the measurements were taken, however, Shayne rewrote them, increasing the waist another few inches. He had plans for that waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen decided to take the next three days off, and headed back home. Shayne continued to work, but couldn't stop thinking about Ken all day. The curve of his new belly, the way it was beginning to shake a little when he moved, and the urge to cup and rub it made it very difficult to concentrate on work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the day finally ended, Shayne headed home in a huge rush, but stopped to pick up a large dinner on the way home. He wasn't sure, but he guessed that Ken would probably be upset about today and not want to snack again, but a large dinner's something Ken had never been able to turn down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at home, he found that Ken had spent the day...</span></div></div>",

Shayne had never asked, because it was a touchy subject, but he was sure this guy was gaining intentionally at the rate he kept coming in. And his job clearly afforded him to spend frivolously. Every time he came in, he requested Shayne. He bought well, tipped well, and talked a lot for his troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Hydeman had gotten a new job 2 months ago. At the time, he had fit the tall part of the big and tall store. He was 6'6\", and a lean 190 lbs. He bought 5 new suits in one day, and tipped $300 for the service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later, he was back. He said his job worked him a lot and kept him busy, eating only takeout at odd hours and keeping him out of the gym. He'd put on 15 lbs in the intervening time, which Shayne was able to track because he'd secretly wired a scale in the tailor's stand. He had all of his suits taken out, and tipped Shayne another $200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later, Jack was back again. This time he'd put on another 15 lbs. And since then, almost like clockwork, Jack had been returning every two weeks, another 10-15 lbs heavier. He alternated between buying new suits and having them taken out, spending a ton of money each time and tipping handsomely as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day was a new suit day, and Jack did not disappoint. He picked out five top of the line suits and had Shayne take his measurements. After 60 lbs in two months, Shayne was sure the gain was intentional. A new job and stress eating could pack on the weight, but that much at that speed took effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShayne had him stand on the private tailor stand, next to the multi-panelled mirror, and checked him out as he took the measurements. He had a belly where there had been none; his thighs were thick and plump; the smile that had been charming before now echoed in his face with deepened dimples. Despite spending tons on suits, he apparently hadn't thought to replace his undershirts, which now rode halfway up the belly when he got measured. It also occurred to Shayne that he hadn't asked Jack to get down to his muscle shirt. That was new this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached around with his tape measure, he felt the softness and warmth of Jack's belly gentle against his arms.</span></div></div>",

Lately Ken had notice that his office job was quite boring and while it paid decent, it just wasn't too challenging to him. His life was in the same mind set. Nothing of interest at the moment.<br>\r\n\"Hey Ken, you wanna go hit up the Cub Den?\" chimed Matthew coming from behind him.<br>\r\nKen turned around to see his roommate dressed in some rather tight looking blue jeans and a white t-shirt that hugged his soft little belly and said \"Woof\". Matthew was sporting a bit more of a beard this week, it was from ear to ear and around his mouth. Shaved below the jaw line and kept trim. Matthew always had some kind of facial hair going. From a mustache to full on beard. He was clean shaven maybe 4 days out of the year, but three days later there's whiskers growing on him again. Matthew's friendly attitude and soft middle have really given him a real teddy bear feel to him. Ken found that if he needed to spill his feelings he found that Matthew was often the best guy to talk to. <br>\r\nKen thought about Matthew's question. The Cub Den was a bear bar downtown. The men were bigger, and hairier and a bit more gruff then the places where their mutual roommate Shayne hang out. Ken snickered at the thought of Shayne being cornered by a couple of Big Daddy Bears. Ken looked back at the TV and remembered nothing was on and that the last time he went to the Cub Den he was approached by a leather daddy, but the food was good and decently priced, same with the drinks and the music was a bit more of his taste instead of that repetitive lame stuff they play at the twink minded clubs.<br>\r\n\"Sure, let me get ready,\" Ken said and slowly got off the couch.<br>\r\n\"Hurry up,\" Matthew begged impatiently.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Ken swinging past the couch and walked down the hallway to his bedroom,\" Got a hot date?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, met him off of bearciti.com, now hurry it up Ken doll,\" Matthew pleaded.<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Ken said and shut his door and dug out a button up shirt and slipped on some looser pair of jeans he had to buy a few weeks ago since his old pair were getting a little tight. Ken made a quick pit stop in the bathroom and freshened up and joined Matthew in the entrance and the two piled into Ken's car and they headed off to the Cub Den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens at the bar?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Growing in a small town in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, they grew up in a conservative community where hard work and traditional family values were expected. Throughout childhood, Greg and Steve were best friends and were virtually inseparable. In high school Greg and Steve secretly began to date. Since Steve was a lineman on the football team and Greg was the class president, neither could afford their sexuality becoming public knowledge. While both tried to attend college together, Steve's athletic scholarship to Michigan and Greg's acceptance to journalism school at Northwestern forced them to take an extended break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe period of separation was good for both of them. In Chicago Greg developed a new understanding of what it means to be gay man. During his freshman year, he spent nearly every weekend in Boystown and other gay spots in Chicago. These excursions allowed Steve to learn a lot about himself. While he enjoyed the attention and the wild, random sex, he was only marginally attracted to the hard bodies that populated the typical hang-outs. Slowly he realized that he really enjoyed watching guys on campus slowly expand as they make the most of the all-you-can-eat-buffets in the dining halls on campus. On Wednesdays, when he did not have class from 11 to 2, he would sit in a dining hall with a book to spy on the eye candy chowing down. His interest in big man lead him to discover the bear, chub, and chaser community in Chicago. Soon, he began to see fat guys exclusively, except for his visits to see Steve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Ann Arbor, Steve began to feel more comfortable with his teammate, although he did not confide in them he was gay. While he worked extra hard during the football season, he and his fellow linemen always lived to live it up, especially once the season was over. Every year, they had a contest about who would gain the most weight during the office season. While Steve never won, he was always a prime contender. Steve always loved to eat and enjoyed the freedom of not having to watch what or how much he ate or drank. For Greg the off-season was great since it gave him an opportunity to combine his love for Steve and love of big men. Each year during spring break, Steve would visit Greg in Chicago and Greg would do his best to make him as fat as possible. Steve loved the cycle of eating and fucking, and Greg hoped to slowly seduce Steve to a lifestyle of fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter college, Greg and Steve moved together to New York where Greg had a job with a small magazine. Steve worked a waiter and part-time football coach until he was able to find a decent sales job.

No pizza.<br>\r\nOf course that didn't mean that he didn't stop at the market on the way home just to be sure that he had plenty of goodies just in case Steve changed his mind.  Along with chips, several dips and some bags of mixed nuts, Justin picked up a cheesecake, ice cream and cookies.  Heck, it was easy to order pizza if big Steve changed his mind.<br>\r\nSteve was right on time and brought four sixpacks of beer.  Justin noticed that it was Coors Light.  The big guy was serious.  No problem, Justin had that covered.<br>\r\n\"Sit down,\" he told Steve.  \"The game just started.  I'll put the beer in the fridge.  I 've got some cold glasses in the freezer.  Be right back.\"<br>\r\nPutting Steve's low cal beer in the garage, Justin broke out some real beer and filled the glasses. They were giant size and held two bottles.   He figured he would start Steve out easy with just a bowl of chips and some dip.<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Steve.\"  <br>\r\nSteve took the beer and took a big swig.  <br>\r\n\"I've got to start drinking beer from a cold glass.  It make such a difference.  I've been drinking light beer trying to drop a few pounds and the stuff just tastes like water.  Tonight it tastes like the real thing.\"<br>\r\n\"A cold glass makes all the difference.  I agree.  But don't worry I keep my freezer full of glasses so drink up.  It's only light beer. Ready for another?\"<br>\r\nSteve picked at the chips but as the game wore on and the beers kept coming, he began to get more aggressive.  By the second quarter, Justin could see that his resolve was weakening.  He looked at the empty bowl and then at Justin as if hoping that Justin would fill it up again.<br>\r\n\"Ready for another beer?\"  Steve had consumed a sixpack already although it was only three of the big glasses.<br>\r\n\"Sure.  I can't believe how good that light beer tastes.....Uh ,, by the way you didn't order pizza did you?\"<br>\r\n\"No, Steve.  You were so insistent that I just got the chips.  These games just seem to need pizza but heck, it's good to spend time with you.  I probably don't need it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, Justin.  I hate to spoil your enjoyment and I know how much you like pizza so if you want to order, go ahead.  I'll join you for a piece, maybe.  Drinking light beer gives me a little leeway.\"<br>\r\n\"Here's your beer.\"  Justin started Steve on his second sixpack.  \"And some nuts.\"  Justin put a big bowl of mixed huts on the table in easy reach of Steve.<br>\r\nBack in the kitchen Justin ordered two large pizzas with extra meat and cheese.<br>\r\n\"Pizza should be here by half time.  Thanks for being so understanding.  I really like pizza with my game.\"<br>\r\n\"The least I can do.  You're a great host and you've got a nice big screen.  It sure beats watching at home. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza came just as the half time started.  Justin took the boxes into the kitchen so Steve wouldn't see how much pizza there was.  His plan was to bring slices out a few at a time so Steve couldn't keep track of how much he was eating.  Justin was sure that so long as there was food in front of him, Steve would eat it.<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\"  Justin brought Steve one big slice of pizza and his fifth beer.  Justin was only on his second but he took two slices of pizza.  Steve inhaled his piece and watched hungrily while Justin slowly ate his two.  <br>\r\n\"There any more?\"  Steve just wasn't satisfied.<br>\r\nJustin chewed the last of his pizza.<br>\r\n\"Couple of pieces.\"  Justin lied. \"I'll get them.\"<br>\r\nThis time Justin brought out a platter with four slices, took two for himself and left the rest within reach of Steve.<br>\r\n\"Tastes pretty good.\"  Steve grunted.  He was stuffing a slice in his mouth.  The beer was clearly affecting him.  He finished his sixth glass, two sixpacks put away in Steve's gut.  The evening was going better than Justin had hoped.<br>\r\n\"Be right back.\"  Steve heaved himself up from the couch and lumbered to the bathroom.  Not bothering to close the door it sounded like a water fall as the big man unloaded.  Justin took the opportunity to put the rest of the pizza on the platter.  He figured Steve was not going to remember how many slices there were, how much he had eaten or that he was 'cutting back'.<br>\r\nFinally the waterfall stopped.  The toilet flushed.  Steve swaggered back to the couch, grinning like a Cheshire cat.<br>\r\n\"Man that felt good.\"<br>\r\n\"Brought you another beer.\"<br>\r\nSteve was beyond conversation.  He nodded dumbly and took a gulp.<br>\r\n\"I  like.'  Steve had picked up another slice of pizza and crammed it into his mouth.  He chewed thoughtfully, then swallowed.  \"Pizza.\"  <br>\r\nBy now, the game was irrelevant.  Justin kept the beer coming and Steve methodically finished all the pizza.<br>\r\nWhen the game finished Steve was well into the third sixpack, the pizza was gone and Justin thought Steve was just getting warmed up.<br>\r\n\"I'm ready for some desert. What about you?\" <br>\r\nSteve just sat there looking fat and happy.  His belly firm, round and filling his lap.  He nodded.<br>\r\n\"Desert.\"  he said.  \"I like desert.\"<br>\r\nAll Justin had to do was put out the food.  Steve no longer had any idea of 'cutting back'.  Steve was a hungry man who enjoyed his food.  The cheesecake went down easy. The cookies and ice cream started slow but Steve was a finisher.  <br>\r\n\"Great ....\"  Steve's eyes were losing focus.  He learned back causing his belly to look even bigger.  \"Game.....\"  His hands fumbled under the overhang of his belly and finally un buckled his belt, then unbuttoned his jeans.  \" So.....\"  Steve sighed and scratched his belly where the belt had held it in.  \"Full...\"  His eyes closed.<br>\r\nJustin watched the big man.  He couldn't have asked for a better night.  <br>\r\nCarefully he helped Steve shift until he was lying on the couch.  Justin covered him with a blanket and cleaned up the kitchen.  The only thing that would make it better would be big Steve in bed with him.  <br>\r\n\"One step at a time.\"  he told himself.<br>\r\nNext morning Justin wakes up eagerly, planning the day with Steve.

Reggie knew that most of the stuff in the store was bogus, and he knew some real spells. Sure he wasn't the best magician, he could make the lights turn out, or help himself get out of a cold. But that was about to change, just the other week he finally got in the oldest book Reggie had ever held. An ancient book, who's origins are unknown, even by the former owner, filled with runes and text most people would think are scribbles. But Reggie knew that somewhere, deep inside the book he could use them to help win Steve Klinger's heart. <br>\r\nReggie being a book nerd and bit of a loner always watched from the sidelines as Steve, the hottest jock in college, was out on the front lines scoring touch downs and being the center of attention. Reggie and Steve's paths finally intertwined when Steve needed some help with his school work and Reggie was volunteering as a tutor. Reggie would find it hard to concentrate during those long study sessions with that piece of jock meet sitting mere feet away from him. Steve wasn't like the other jocks who would make fun of Reggie for having a mess of black hair, or being overweight, Steve was a nice guy and even after he passed the class would come up and talk to Reggie like a normal guy.<br>\r\nOne night, after they had a late night coffee about year after college, Steve told Reggie something Reggie had been dying to hear over. \"I want you to suck my cock.\"<br>\r\nReggie didn't take much convincing and sure enough in Steve's car Reggie sucked the seamen out of Steve. It only took two jerks of Steve's hand for Reggie to unleash his load that night as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time the two kept in touch here and there, Reggie went from a pudgy 220 pounder  to a full grown 300 pounds thanks to his steady life style and Steve slowly gained as well thanks to his cushy office job and not hitting the gym as much. Reggie would often wonder what Steve would look like at the 300 pound mark, or even bigger. <br>\r\nWith Steve newly single since his last boy friend left him since Steve was getting to 'chubby' and for him, Reggie knew it was time to move in and catch the former jock and he knew that the ancient book that had come in the mail had just the spell for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Reggie was digging through the book with his Rosetta Stones to help him translate the text and sure enough found the right spell.. which one will Reggie use?</span></div></div>",

Now the tables would turn.  Reggie would finally have a fat friend of his own, Steve.  It was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell worked in a natural fashion.  Sure the weight would slowly transfer from Reggie to Steve but both men would find their appetites change to fit their new size.  Reggie had always been a big eater but as the spell began its magic, his appetite faded.  First the portion sizes got smaller.  He just didn't crave the big gut stuffing meals that were his norm.  He also began to crave fruits and vegetables and shun high fat and carbs.  Steve just picked up the slack.  It became impossible to satisfy his need for food and the satisfaction from stuffing his gut to discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly at first Reggie lost weight and Steve gained.  After two months, Reggie had lost twenty pounds .  It didn't make  much difference.  He was still fat.  Steve's twenty pounds made a difference that Reggie noticed.  Steve hadn't commented at all.  He had noticed Reggie's smaller consumption but not his own increase.  Steve was really filling out his clothes.  He wondered whether Steve had noticed his growth yet and how he liked it.  He called Steve and invited him over for breakfast.  One way or another he would find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie pushed over his plate.  \"You finish this, I've had enough.\"<br>\r\nSteve slowed down his steady shoveling of food into his mouth and nodded.  Reggie's plate had been heaping with eggs and potatoes.  It was still heaping.<br>\r\n\"You feeling sick, tubby?\"  Steve still made fun of his friends size even as he  had gotten bigger.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm just not so hungry right now.\"  Reggie was ready to find out.  \"You know, maybe you'd better  watch who you call tubby.  What are you weighing these days?\"<br>\r\n\"260 pounds of muscle.  That's not tubby..\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't we just check that.  You're looking a bit bigger to me.\"<br>\r\nSteve stopped chewing and pondered for a moment.

He could obtain the pig lard easy enough off of some fatty pork. Reggie's journey became even easier as his research found that the other ingredients were found in sex-drive enhancers for males... Now, for the tricky part:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie set up a feast, using the holiday season as an excuse for a small get together. Friends passed through, they played games and movies, but Reggie had full focus on Steve. Plate-after-plate Steve ate, until finally Steve picked up a pig in a blanket and sighed as he put it back down. Reggie quickly moved, offering to clear it out for him, tossing the item into a napkin and hiding it in his pocket. For the rest of the night, Steve chased shots of vodka with beer, completely lost in the camaraderie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to broil the potion! He strained the mix, cutting out the thicker sections of lard. Knowing the bitterness of some of the ingredients, &amp; the inevitable hangover Steve would be suffering, Reggie decided he'd add the potion to some some strong coffee. Letting it cool a bit, he brought a cup to his vaguely zombified friend who was now sitting up on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, man...\" Steve trailed, before burying himself in the caffeinated concoction.<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Reggie stumbled out as he faked his own hangover, soaking in the kick-off into this journey.<br>\r\n\"What's in this man? Did you drain some bacon grease in here or something?\" Steve mumbled.<br>\r\n\"Oh, man... it must be leftover in your mouth from those pigs in a blanket!\"<br>\r\n\"Uuuugh. Well... maybe we should pick up some breakfast to wash it all away then...\" Steve managed before gulping down the rest of the lukewarm concoction, hastily.<br>\r\n\"I knew this morning would be pretty sluggish after last night's shenanigans, so I had a mise en place for a breakfast feast... It's all done, except for the toast... Go have at it... I've just got to hit up the restroom first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve headed to the table where he saw a mountain of eggs, covered in shredded bacon, some deboned pork chops, hash brown, and a loaf of bread by the toaster. Reggie headed to the bathroom, grabbing a candle and taking out a slip of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that's left is the code word,\" he trailed in a whisper.<br>\r\n\"I burn this paper, and it's all set.\"<br>\r\nHe set the piece of paper circling the wick, lighter ready...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what did the paper say?<br>\r\nWhat will be the code word to set off the euphoric, if not erotic, feeding sessions?</span></div></div>",

This gave Reggie the chance to convert more and more of his own flab for muscles to help Steve with all of his daily tasks that became more and more impossible, like getting out of the car.

This meant he refused to buy bigger clothes. He picked up suspenders and accessories, instead, to make it easier to wear the size he viewed himself as. Though his tubby belly held the pants in place pretty well, the suspenders kept them up regardless of the wide open buttons and zippers. His shirts hardly held in the mass, as they tended to settle between his fat rolls - moving farther and farther up. So Claude's shop, which only offered current fashions up to XL, was a guilty pleasure.

At least if Ben porked up a bit it would take the pressure off Steve.<br>\r\nSteve was happy to slip into the baggy shirt he had brought to protect from the sun.  With his still large and relatively firm chest, the belly bulging below was not so obvious- at least to Steve's thinking.<br>\r\n\"I'm starving.\"  Ben said.  \"Lets get something to eat on the way home.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, if that's what you want.\"  Steve answered.

Clint struck up a conversation with Steve and the two soon found themselves at a sports bar a block away from the gym with Steve filling up on a basket of greasy chicken fingers and beer. The exjock and trainer didn't take long to fall in love and soon Steve was finishing off Clint's extras. <br>\r\nSteve suddenly realized that Clint's grip on his love handles were a bit stronger tonight and he was grabbing a lot more.

After a couple of more thrusts Clint was spent and laid back and slowly removed himself from Steve's ass,\" Fuck that was hot Stevie Bear.\"<br>\r\nSteven laid there looking at the wall then down at his belly which laid on the bed next to him.

Not to mention the gainer community, always willing to help an encouraging hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucky that he had acquired the complimentary card for the local wholesale club from Clint, Steve knew his tasks. He perused the isles for empty calories and sauces, knowing that he could add seemingly endless amounts of them to meals was a real help. Lastly was the milk. GOMAD seemed like a pretty legit way to up his appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Over the course of the next month, he found that it was easiest to take the milk in smaller amounts after he had already stuffed himself. He cut them up into 20 oz increments, explaining to Clint that he bought some extra milk so they could always rely on cereal if they were running low on food, or to accompany his (weakness for) desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He, however, always replaced the gallon of milk he'd devoured right before Clint's arrival home.

Soon he found himself able to down a whole extra half a gallon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This, of course, was aided by the fact that he tripled any butter in recipes, and graded half a stick over many pastas to keep them just that much more filling to his begging belly. The mornings began with 4 honey buns, from his lockable nightstand drawer, then from 6 pancakes to several dozen alongside a platter of bacon and eggs.With each mouthful, he'd drain maple syrup in until it had filled any space left. Once he found himself satiated, he'd make a routine to keep snacks around the couch - replacing snack bowls with punch bowls of goodies (hiding them in cupboards again before his honey got home)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few months in he gave up buying clothes to restrain his bulk. The rips, the tears, the button-pops. Ugh. He'd kept himself so preoccupied at home and was always ready to pass out by his baby's side. Clint enjoyed it too much to question it, and scare him into losing it, leaving only sexual comments to unveil his true feelings.

SO laarge that he almost had to struggle to get around the door to the parking lot. <br>\r\n\"Can't wait to hit the scale\" He said, triumphantly. <br>\r\n\"I can't wait to hit the bed\" replied Clint, as his busy day was tiring him out  and he began to drag his feet to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the get home, Steve waddles to the scale.<br>\r\n27lbs; 11lbs in just one night. Steve whistled in amazement. <br>\r\n\"Sounds like something is up\" Clint said slyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve, brushes his teeth, showers and gets cleaned up after the greaset ordeal at the restarant. <br>\r\nHe leaves the bathroom naked and ready for bed, where Clint already beat him to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were amazing today\" said Clint, naked and embracing his ex-jock Boyfriend into bed.   <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once Steve had kicked off his shoes he found Clint back from the kitchen with lust in his eyes. The lean boy friend clung to the bloated chub before his and grabbed the thick love handles and kissed Steve hard. Steve kissed back and hugged his lean boyfriend into his bloated belly, feeling Clint's hard on pressing against his leg.<br>\r\n\"You're so sexy,\" Steve said taking a breath.<br>\r\n\"You are too,\" Clint smiled,\" Ready to get topped off?\"<br>\r\n\"You bet,\" Steve winked, ready for sex..<br>\r\nClint lead Steve to the kitchen and told him to sit on the bar stool next to the kitchen island. Steve did while Clint when over to the microwave and took out a big tub of ice cream and a box of doughnuts from the shopping bag.<br>\r\nAt first Steve was disappointed, but knew this was going to be his first feeding session FeedUBigger promised. Steve quickly dropped his pants, exposing his still hard dick which was leaking at the idea of being topped off.<br>\r\nClint placed the tub of partially melted ice cream on the counter and took out a spoon and begun feeding Steve, slowly. One hand slowly offering ice cream to Steve's mouth, while the other slowly explored Steve's body. Clint begun whispering things Steve would once dread hearing,\" Fuck, your gut is getting big.\" \"I never imagined you'd get so big.\" \"I want you to get huge.\"<br>\r\nSteve managed to get about a quarter of the tub down before Clint couldn't stop himself and got Steve to his feet and turned him around and started to fuck him. Steve's bloated belly bounced below the island surface and he felt fuller than ever before. Stuffed in the gut and ass.<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the feeling of fullness and Clint's hand reaching around and giving a few tugs before Steve came, Clint followed shortly. <br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Clint said after a few moments, catching his breath,\" I can't wait to know what it's going to be like to fuck you when you're full at 360 pounds.\"<br>\r\n\"Same,\" smiled Steve feeling Clint slowly pop out of him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Long gone were the days of looking into the mirror wearing a pair of briefs and seeing a nice set of abs, a chiseled chest and some sharp facial features. Those were gone. Long gone. Long buried under a layer. A layer of age and an even thicker layer of fat. Steve was no longer the 170 pound track and field jock he was back in college. Those days were long gone. A decade and a half had seen his metabolism go from quick like his legs in college, to slow like the way he waddles now. The scale read 260 pounds just a few seconds ago. 260 pounds. A 90 pound increase since college. <br>\r\nLooking at his reflection Steven lifted his belly and set it down and wondered how he let himself get this big. Sure he wasn't at the gym as often as he wanted to be, his job isn't physical at all, just sitting and typing and munching on doughnuts and sipping coffee in a cubical nation. It also doesn't help that he lives downtown and often doesn't feel like cooking when he comes home. And with such restaurant variety within a couple of blocks of walking and all of it competitively priced had left Steve waddling home with a gut full of food. <br>\r\nSteven then noticed a pair of underwear left on the ground. He bent down and picked it up and checked the tag and read it, it was size 3XXLs.<br>\r\n<i>'Holy shit! I'm not that fat am I?'</i> Steven asked himself looking at the massive pair of underwear in his hands. <br>\r\nSteven suddenly felt a big pair of paws wrap around him and a big warm soft globe push against his back while some gruff hair sat on his neck. Steve looked into the mirror and saw his boy friend Greg had hugged onto him. He was pretty stealthy for a 360 pound guy.<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie, sorry about leaving that on the floor,\" Greg said with a light smile and hugged Steve closer and gave him a kiss on his neck.<br>\r\n<i>'Of course, it makes sense now,'</i> Steven thought to himself. He met Greg nearly a year an a half ago. Greg really is the sweetest man Steve had ever met. He's funny, can carry a conversation, he's thoughtful, always willing to help his friends and family and he can cook and.. Just everything any man would want from a boy friend. Steven also realized that Greg was also the reason he had been so blind about how fat he's been getting. Next to Greg's massive 65\" around gut, Steve's own 43\" belly looked pretty slim in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Steve do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They also leave with half a million dollars each, plus 1,000 for every ten pounds they gain, to start their own lives. Peter knows some of them are only in it for the money, and might even try to lose all the weight after they leave him, but doesn't care, so long as they keep him happy and he gets to watch them grow. Their growth is documented by pictures, video and even 3D rendering technology so Peter has detailed records of how it happens. He is revolutionizing the science and art of gaining.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe guys with him now are as follows.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAaron Tessel, the veteran -- Aaron is the first of Peter's guys to stay beyond the nine month period, and has been there going on 11 months. Peter has taken a liking to him, and Aaron did not want to leave. Aaron is 6'6\", with the same red hair and green eyes as Peter. He joined the program at 160 lbs. but now weighs 340. Whether he stays or starts his own life is up to you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAidan Felger, the gainer advocate -- Aidan was a gainer before the program and plans on using his money once he's done to advocate for gainer rights by starting a fat-friendly law firm. Aidan is now entering his 4th month in the program. He is 5'11\", with black hair and blue eyes. He joined the program at 220, the heaviest applicant to date, and is now 250, making his ironically the smallest gain since Peter started the program three years ago.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLance Green, the gold digger -- Lance is very much in it for the money, which has caused considerable tension between him and Aidan, who started at the same time. Lance has never really tried to hide it, and Peter doesn't care, but it upsets Aidan a great deal. Lance thinks the whole thing is weird, and a personal choice, and disagrees with Aidan's plan to start a fat-friendly law firm. Lance plans on starting a chain of gyms when he finishes the program, using the money he's gained and the fame he'll garner from losing all his weight to start him off. Lance is 6'2\", with a short-cropped set of brown hair he keeps neatly trimmed. Lance is the only one in the history of the program to keep up with regular exercise, and has also been the most adventurous in trying new and experimental additives and drugs to assist his gain, as long as he thinks there won't be permanent effects. From his insanely muscular 225, Lance is now up to 300, with a perfectly round and shaped belly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDaniel Benson, the newbie -- Daniel is the smallest applicant ever to enter the program, in every way except cock size. Daniel, in an uncharacteristically daring move, sent in a completely naked picture with his application. Peter was taken with the boldness and beauty of him, and brought him on board. Daniel is also uncharacteristically young, at 18. He decided to apply to 5 colleges and this. He is 5'4\", and currently weighs 140 lbs. Daniel is overall very nervous and excited about starting the program, and about the money at the end. He doesn't know if he'll enjoy the gaining, but he's willing to give it a try.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow that you know the interns, where will the program go?</span></div></div>",

It now boasts an enormous bedroom, a freight lift system, three commercial kitchens and a pantry to match the five enormous appetites on board, and a state of the art exercise facility, though the latter's only been used by one man. It has a dedicated crew who live on the plane. It can refuel in mid-air, and rarely needs to land, but often does so in whatever destination Peter has chosen for his program to go. Peter also has smaller chartered jets to take his team to more remote destinations.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe likes to surprise his boys both by his knowledge of foreign language and foreign cuisine.

Daniel knows about Peter's program only through the web, which is up front about the gaining, but doesn't include pictures of much of anything except food. Even though he's been picked up by a limo driver, Daniel expects to be boarding a normal plane. Daniel is surprised, then, when the limo driver goes past the departures gate and waives a pass at the guard booth at the runway entrance. He drives directly out to a private hangar, and underneath a 747. The driver calls on the radio.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We have arrived.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrom above them, Daniel hears mechanical noises. He looks through the tinted sunroof and can see a large platform descending from the plane. The driver gets out of the car, and Daniel moves to do the same, but the door is locked. He realizes that the driver is getting it for him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'What am I getting myself into?' he thinks. They exit the car and the driver escorts him to the lift. The platform is huge, and he sees a sign saying it is rated for 10,000 lbs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"The whole limo could fit on this thing!\"<br>\r\n\"It does, from time to time,\" says the driver.<br>\r\nThe driver is clearly not used to clients talking to him, but smiles gently at how impressed Daniel is.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe lift begins to go up into the plane.

The ceiling was higher than in most normal rooms, and the plane itself had much larger than normal windows.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe driver guides Daniel to a seat at the table and tells him that someone will be with him in a moment, he is just going to get the limo.

Being from the midwest, Daniel is no stranger to big men, but Aaron is something special. It is a statement of the strength and charisma of Aaron's smile that Daniel doesn't cower in his sight. Aaron is over a foot taller than Daniel, not to mention more than twice his weight. His intimidating figure, however, is totally mitigated by the bright smile he gives Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Aaron. I'm the one you've been e-mailing back and forth with.\"<br>\r\n\"Hi. Daniel.\"<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the program.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a silent moment. Daniel doesn't know what to say, or ask, and Aaron just looks him up and down, smiling. It does not help that Daniel knows he is standing next to a man that has seen him naked by virtue of his application picture. Daniel still isn't sure why he sent it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this time around, there was only one space to fill in the program. So your induction ceremony tonight will be extra focused on you.\"<br>\r\n\"What does that involve?\"<br>\r\nAaron smiles. \"A lot of surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tone comes over the intercom and Aaron shepherds Daniel over to a seat. Aaron's hand on Daniel's shoulder steps up the intimidation. It seems big enough to encompass his whole shoulder and more, but still gently guides him to a seat at the table which can be buckled. Daniel sits down and Aaron does his seatbelt. He leans in close as he tightens it, and when their faces are only inches away, he pulls the belt tight with one hand and braces Daniel's stomach with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel inhales sharply. Aaron's measured control is intensely erotic. The bell tone sounds again and Aaron sits in his own chair and buckles up. There is a lot less tightening to be done on Aaron's belt. After a couple minutes of the takeoff process, the plane levels out, the bell tone rings again and Aaron unbuckles himself. He leaves Daniel in place, and something in his face tells Daniel he shouldn't unbuckle himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to start dinner in a moment. This first dinner is going to be a little different than most of the time you're with us. Tonight, myself and the other interns in the program will be feeding you, and assisting you with your gain. In the future, primarily the reverse will be true, until you're no longer the new guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will start with the appetizers.\" Aaron pushes a button on the table and Daniel hears a buzzer noise in the next room.

Daniel suddenly can't remember the last time he ate, and he's sure it was ages ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron smiles as he watches Daniel salivate at the oncoming food. The platter is laid before Daniel and he starts to dig in with fervor. The wings, Daniel's first move, fall quickly as he rips the meat down to the bone on each one and tosses it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron moves behind Daniel and reaches around, rubbing Daniel's belly through the shirt.

He puts his hand up and feels the curved roof of the plane. His bed is quite wide, but the roof space above is limited. As he sits up in bed, he realizes that he is naked and suddenly remembers what happened prior. Now he really wonders what he's gotten into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are no clothes in the room, but a robe that Daniel quickly slips into and feebly slips into the hallway. He finds a bathroom, complete with shower, and cleans himself up. Coming out, he meets Aidan, also robe clad. Daniel immediately notices a tuft of hair on the chest, and hairy legs extending under the robe. Aidan is wide in the shoulders and all the way down, and a soft rounded belly portrudes in the robe, which he has obviously tied the robe under on purpose to emphasize. Daniel extends a friendly hand but finds himself gripped in a big hug. Aidan's soft body envelops Daniel a little, and he feels warmth flow through him. If you had asked Daniel before if such a man would turn him on, he would have said no, but Daniel is pleasantly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning!\" says the fatter man, smiling at the new boy. \"Aaron told me you came on board and had quite the first dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel blushes and wonders exactly how much got spread around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Aidan, I'm the longest in the program after Aaron. If you couldn't tell,\" he jokes, slapping his belly. \"It's my turn to show you around, and we'll start with a breakfast in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAidan guides Daniel into his room, next door to his own, and identical on the inside. They sit down on the edge of the bed, and Aidan pushes a call button that Daniel notices has a covered platter symbol on it. A minute later, the door to the room opens and four butlers come in one after the other. The first slides out a hidden panel from the wall, extending a table over the bed. The remainder place food on a line on that table. There is french toast, eggs in bacon, all in portions that look enough to feed 10 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAidan smiles and Daniel is suddenly surprised by his own hunger. At his last meal, he ate more than he ever had before, and now he's just as hungry. Both boys start eating, Daniel more ravenously. Aidan is slow to eat and asking questions about why Daniel is here, and what his plans are. He listens closely to the short, sometimes one-word responses, since Daniel is so wrapped up in eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Daniel begins to slow, and Aidan notices.</span></div></div>",

Aidan's soft belly envelops Daniel's back, and he exhales softly at the warmth. Aidan reaches around and gently stimulates Daniel's chest with one hand, while the other slips inside the robe and rubs his extended belly. Daniel's breathless sigh takes voice and becomes a light moan. The hand on Daniel's chest slides down and grasps the rope tying the robe shut. At a maddeningly slow pace, he begins to slide it out. Daniel feels it on his cock, and well before the robe is released, his cock is hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold air of the cabin hardens his nipples and surprises him, and he feels a need to be closer to Aidan. When he pushes backward into the that soft warm body, he feels that not all of it is soft. An insistent cock is pressing into back. Daniel is incentivized and thrusts a little harder. He hears a sharp intake of breath from Aidan, who is the surprised one this time. His surprise doesn't last long, however, and he quickly undoes his own robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel hears a panel opening and then an odd squirt behind him. Seconds later, there are insistent fingers at his entrance. He obliges. The fingers are at first cold and shocking. Daniel feels himself deflate while re-acclimating. Then he feels another hand slide up his chest and back down, settling on a rhythmic circular motion to his belly. The fingers inside him quickly warm and Daniel finds himself at full strength again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel lets out a grunt as the fingers are suddenly removed and replaced. The pain of Aidan entering him, fully, is countered by the lubricated hand now stroking his own manhood in the same rhythm. Back and forth they move, and Daniel no longer feels the cold of the cabin. He feels as though they are on fire, emanating heat onto the whole plane as they move in and out together. The world around him subsides and it is just the belly and cock at his back and the hand at his front in a thrusting frenzy until he feels a pressure inside, and releases himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys collapse next to each other, spooning, and Daniel is quickly asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awakes...</span></div></div>",

He sits up, then stands up, and Daniel is immediately surprised by several things. One, that he is 6'2\" and the most muscular man Daniel's ever seen, that his belly, though large, is somehow tight and quite round, and that he doesn't look in the face to be much older than Daniel himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy offers his handshake and a name of Lance. Daniel nods and accepts both. Lance indicates the bench next to him, and tosses him a water bottle.

His body is madly impressive. Muscles everywhere, but with padding too and an enormous and perfectly round belly. Only his cock, currently flaccid, is an unimpressive 4\". He stands still as Daniel stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel doesn't come to his senses while Lance approaches, pulling the robe rope in the same motion Aidan did. As the robe releases, Lance continues forward possessively. He picks Daniel up and puts him on the weight bench, laying him down. He holds both Daniel's hands above his head with one hand, and takes the gallon-size water bottle he'd been drinking from and puts it to his lips. \"Drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel does, sucking dearly from the water bottle. Lance puts Daniel's hands to the water bottle and makes him drink. Lance pushes apart Daniel's legs with his knee and sits between them. He then scoots up so their cocks meet at the hilt. Now erect, though longer than before, is still an inch shorter than Daniel's. With one hand, Lance firmly massages Daniel's stomach, coaxing more space. With his other hand, Lance rubs their two cocks together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gallon jug of protein shake rapidly drains as both cocks fully inflate. Daniel, despite having come so many times in the past day, doesn't last long, and Lance isn't far behind. Upon finishing, Daniel's stomach is full and sloshing, and he is incredibly uncomfortable.

Daniel can't see much through the tinted windows. They drive inside and someone shows up to escort Daniel from the garage to a changing room. They take his suitcase away and take him into a room full of mirrors and two assistants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your clothes down to your underwear, please. We need to take your measurements.\"<br>\r\nDaniel thinks this is weird, but remembers that he's only packed a week's worth of clothes and assumes these people must be tailors. They take his measurements and then put him on a scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he goes to put his clothes back on, they're gone. One of the assistants hands him a pair of what looks to be elastic dress pants. \"What about a shirt?\" asks Daniel.<br>\r\n\"You don't wear one for the welcoming feast,\" they say with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What have I gotten myself into?' thinks Daniel again. He is led into a lavishly decorated dining room stocked with an enormous feast. He takes a seat at one of the smaller chairs at the table, but the assistants usher him up to a special chair at the head. This chair seems to have its own table, isolated from the main area. It is also very wide. As the assistants leave, it takes all the willpower Daniel has not to jump up and start digging into the food. He is actually salivating and hungrier than he's ever been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, two men arrive to tell him what's going on. Daniel can tell these guys are not assistants. They are dressed in the same stretchy dress pants as he is, though they both have shirts on. Daniel finds it funny that one guy is clearly heavier than the other, but the heavier guy is in much better shape. He introduces himself as Lance, while the lighter one says his name is Aidan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty hungry, aren't you, Daniel?\" asks Lance, smiling.<br>\r\n\"I'm starving. Why wasn't there any food on the way here?!\"<br>\r\n\"Think about it. Would you rather have airline peanuts, or this?\" Lance indicates the enormous spread of food before him, and Daniel gets the point.<br>\r\nAidan breaks in. \"We're here tonight to help make sure you get full. You'll be in the seat of honor tonight and we'll be assisting you. Tell us what you want from the table, and we'll bring it. And if you need help getting it down, let us know.\"<br>\r\n\"At the end of tonight's feast, we'll take some quick measurements and take you back to your room,\" Lance says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel is barely paying attention by this point. He points to the Beef en Croute and they bring it to him. He devours it in a record number of bites. He continues to eat the food and drink the wine at incredible speed, aided by the food being the best he's ever had and almost 12 hours of hunger backing him up. After eating several plates beyond his usual capacity, however, he begins to feel full. When two complete dessert carts roll up filled with beautiful French desserts, however, Daniel can't believe he's hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Aidan, recognizing the signs, decide its time to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" says Aidan. \"That's why were' here.\"<br>\r\nAidan begins to spoon and scoop the various desserts into Daniel's mouth, including Creme Brulee, Chocolate Mousse, delicious fresh eclaires and many Daniel doesn't recognize. Meanwhile Lance is hard at work on Daniel's bare belly, massaging and allowing the stretch with a practised touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel has never felt like this before. He quickly gets hard and Lance smiles as he works that gently too. Over the sensations given to him by the food, Aidan and Lance, Daniel can hardly feel as his stomach fills up more than ever before. Lance pushes him a little bit harder as Aidan pushes larger bites into Daniel's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel can't take much more on either end, and Lance pushes Daniel over the edge. The combined sensations are too much and he falls asleep in the chair.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seems like forever to Daniel, but is really only about a half-hour in the limo before they arrive. Daniel can't see much through the tinted windows. They drive inside and someone shows up to escort Daniel from the garage to a changing room. They take his suitcase away and take him into a room full of mirrors and two assistants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your clothes down to your underwear, please. We need to take your measurements.\"<br>\r\nDaniel thinks this is weird, but remembers that he's only packed a week's worth of clothes and assumes these people must be tailors. They take his measurements and then put him on a scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he goes to put his clothes back on, they're gone. One of the assistants hands him a pair of what looks to be elastic dress pants. \"What about a shirt?\" asks Daniel.<br>\r\n\"You don't wear one for the welcoming feast,\" they say with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What have I gotten myself into?' thinks Daniel again. He is led into a lavishly decorated dining room stocked with an enormous feast. He takes a seat at one of the smaller chairs at the table, but the assistants usher him up to a special chair at the head. This chair seems to have its own table, isolated from the main area. It is also very wide. As the assistants leave, it takes all the willpower Daniel has not to jump up and start digging into the food. He is actually salivating and hungrier than he's ever been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, two men arrive to tell him what's going on. Daniel can tell these guys are not assistants. They are dressed in the same stretchy dress pants as he is, though they both have shirts on. Daniel finds it funny that one guy is clearly heavier than the other, but the heavier guy is in much better shape. He introduces himself as Lance, while the lighter one says his name is Aidan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty hungry, aren't you, Daniel?\" asks Lance, smiling.<br>\r\n\"I'm starving. Why wasn't there any food on the way here?!\"<br>\r\n\"Think about it. Would you rather have airline peanuts, or this?\" Lance indicates the enormous spread of food before him, and Daniel gets the point.<br>\r\nAidan breaks in. \"We're here tonight to help make sure you get full. You'll be in the seat of honor tonight and we'll be assisting you. Tell us what you want from the table, and we'll bring it. And if you need help getting it down, let us know.\"<br>\r\n\"At the end of tonight's feast, we'll take some quick measurements and take you back to your room,\" Lance says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel is barely paying attention by this point. He points to an enormous bowl of alfredo pasta and they bring it to him. He devours it in a record number of bites. He continues to eat the food and drink the wine at incredible speed, aided by the food being the best he's ever had and almost 12 hours of hunger backing him up. After eating several plates beyond his usual capacity, however, he begins to feel full. When two complete dessert carts roll up filled with beautiful Italian desserts, however, Daniel can't believe he's hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Aidan, recognizing the signs, decide its time to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" says Aidan. \"That's why we're here.\"<br>\r\nAidan begins to spoon and scoop the various desserts into Daniel's mouth, including cannoli, tiramisu and many Daniel doesn't recognize. Meanwhile Lance is hard at work on Daniel's bare belly, massaging and allowing the stretch with a practised touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel has never felt like this before. He quickly gets hard and Lance smiles as he works that gently too. Over the sensations given to him by the food, Aidan and Lance, Daniel can hardly feel as his stomach fills up more than ever before. Lance pushes him a little bit harder as Aidan pushes larger bites into Daniel's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel can't take much more on either end, and Lance pushes Daniel over the edge. The combined sensations are too much and he falls asleep in the chair.</span></div></div>",

It seemed weird that they recommended only packing a week's worth of clothes when he'd be there for nine months, but he guessed they'd provide clothing or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the limo picked him up at his house, and took him to a private chartered jet, however, Daniel decided that he probably should have read the full 10-page packet they sent him after he applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What have I gotten myself into?' he thought as he boarded the jet.

The four men a mix of different levels of enthusiasm for their calorie laden contractual requirement. The room is one designed by Peter to suit his gaining proteges; a nice open space with a 102\" TV against a wall if they ever can agree on something to watch or play and individual recliners packed with motorized footrests and in-arm refrigerators for drinks. The four men lumber in, the two more enthusiastic stripped down to their expansive boxers for comfort, Lance wearing a pair of nylon shorts and underarmor from his pre-eating workout and Daniel wearing jeans and a shirt that he had yet to outgrow. They each find their preferred seat and after a few minutes of bickering decide on a cooking channel to look for suggestions. Munching on a variety of deep fried treats the men eat bowlfuls of stuffed jalapenos, cheese sticks, curly fries, and hush puppies rinsed down with bottles of their favorite sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the way into their hour long gluttonous escapade Peter waddled in, not totally unusual but his beaming smile suggested something other than the usual requests for \"snacks and service\" as he'd call it. \"Hey guys! great news!\" He said, grabbing the remote from  Aaron and changing over to an input the gainers hadn't seen connected on the TV before. \"I doubt any of you were paying much attention to the news recently but my 5th startup I initially bankrolled just sold for 12 Billion, and I get a third of it! To celebrate I decided to greenlight Project Adephagia\". His enthuasim and news was met with mixed response. Anyone could've seen the jealousy of Peters expanded fortune on his face. Lance looked perplexed and at the same time a bit curious, no doubt about what Adephagia was. Finally Aaron hadn't stopped eating long enough to give a readable expression and  Aidan's eyes opened wide and he piped up, \"Really? You're... we're.... but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I don't think I mentioned this to any of you besides Aidan, the other one here who actually enjoys this as much as I do, Project Adephagia is a little mockup I paid Space X to draw up when I got a little too drunk a few years ago.\" Peter said chuckling. \"I didn't think they'd take me seriously but hey, they took $10,000,000 out of my bank account and gave me the working designs to what is now going to be the world's first privately owned residence in outer space, one especially designed to promote extreme and expectedly rapid weight gain.\" Peter may have been a large man, proudly over 400 pounds but even his thick thighs couldn't hide his full erection at just saying that out loud. The TV showed a computerized model of just what he said. Rather than a thin tubal structure like the International Space Station, Adephagia looked like a smaller rendition of the one early on in Aliens, two large buildings connected by several passageways. \"The facility will be made to run on solar power exclusively using the most advanced materials possible, one will be used as our living quarters, with every need accommodated in ways you couldn't dream of. The other will be used for storage of provisions, general supplies and living quarters to the serving staff who will operate and maintain Adephagia for us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen to be frank, your contracts are all at different points; you're all going to be paid in full whether or not you want to come along but I've got only a three month window to prepare and I need to know, who is interested in a longer term contract with a much larger growth opportunity?\" Peter looked around the room at his interns, stunned with such a proposition. <br>\r\nAaron took the opertunity to finish his loud eating, belch and grumble \"If I know you, we'll be racing to see who can attain their own orbit first, I'm in.\" Aidan quickly signed up too, Daniel backed out, happy to take his half million and hit the road scarcely a pound bigger, and Lance said he'd need a few days to decide. We have some of the right men, but will Peter want to find a couple new recruits to his zero gravity harem? </span></div></div>",

He didn't think he'd seen a building anywhere in his home town that was anywhere near as dirty as this one. The windows were covered in grime and impossible to see through. The old style hanging sign above the door said \"Gelsenhauer's,\" or at least he thought it did. The sign was just as dirty and in need of paint as the rest of the place. He'd never seen anyone else go in or out of the store. But one day, when he was walking home, something possessed him to venture inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening the door, the sheer number of dangerous looking cluttered objects should have been enough to get him to turn around. There were enormous shelves that towered so high it seemed as though the room he was in was taller than the building. Each shelf was packed with a seemingly random assortment of strange looking items of an exceedingly creepy nature. Johnny walked through the narrow path between enormous shelves trying to make it to a counter without touching anything, but one object caught his eye. A perfectly round stone on a shelf just ahead seemed to be the only thing in the room not covered in dust or cobwebs. He moved carefully towards it and grabbed it, but the moment he touched it he felt something grab his shoulder. He jumped and dropped the stone, which the figure to his right caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking, he saw a rather absurdly tall, old and spindly figure with his shoulder in one hand and the stone in the other. He seemed to be looking Johnny up and down, evaluating him. Johnny felt the hairs stand up on his arms and neck, and chill rush through him. Then just as suddenly as he had taken Johnny's shoulder, the man let go and stepped away. He spoke to Johnny as he walked, and Johnny followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have your eye on the Tenallardis.\"<br>\r\n\"Umm... what's that?\"<br>\r\nThe man sighed and visibly sunk a little from behind, as though very disappointed that his latest customer had no idea what a Tenallardis was.<br>\r\n\"It's a... wishing stone,\" he said with a pervasive and condescending air that made Johnny feel very small and stupid.<br>\r\n\"It grants wishes?\"<br>\r\n\"In a sense,\" said the old man, turning to face Johnny. \"It does not heed words or wishes, but causes desires to come about. For an experienced user with precise control of mind, it will bring about precisely what you want. For those less experienced,\" Johnny feels the hairs stand up again. \"it may have more unpredictable results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was very weirded out by the old man, but the idea of a wishing stone was very tempting. Then again, he looks around and thinks there must be a nearly infinite number of items in this store. Any one of them could help him fulfill his desires, and maybe without these unpredictable results the old man spoke of. Johnny decides...</span></div></div>",

He looks to Kyle who has a smile on his face and his madly rubbing the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny suddenly feels a hunger ten times more than he has ever felt before. The impulse is suddenly stronger than the one to breathe. If there weren't a huge feast in front of him, Johnny is sure he'd eat the table itself. Fortunately, the feast is there and Johnny takes part. Tarts and sweets, savory meats and steaks, fried everything falls into Johnny's gaping maw as fast as he can shovel it in. Nothing seems to be enough as he finishes off what should have been enough food for 5, 10 and 15 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's stomach stretches to accomodate the food.

He doesn't feel any more energetic, and he doesn't have to go to the bathroom, which means that all of the food is being turned directly into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny feels it all over. Every inch of his body is growing. His thighs get thicker and touch almost to the knee. He can feel himself lift in the chair as his ass fills out and gets wider, spilling over the sides. His belly, as it deflates, doesn't return to the hard ball but instead develops rolls around his sides and back.

As with any science experiment, they asked questions about family history, disease history, allergies, etc... This Johnny had expected. But there were several odd questions on the form. They asked for favorite food and restaurant, a daily schedule of exercise and activity, and a complete description of the last three days meals. Johnny had a very hard time with the last part, and could barely remember yesterday's meals let alone all the way back to three days ago. He fudged a few answers but completed the paperwork.

You're only 17.\"<br>\r\nJohnny flashed a smile, and his fake ID. \"Remember these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had gotten their IDs together, and they were actually printed with their own pictures, so they were believable.

We're not supposed to recruit people we know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was confused, but agreed. \"So, what is this experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time that day, Kyle smiled. \"Can't tell you. It's a double-blind study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was now a little nervous. He was sure Kyle wouldn't be involved in anything truly dangerous, or especially let him get involved as a patient, but Kyle not sharing a secret with Johnny had only happened a handful of times in their lifelong friendship. Johnny knew that smile, but was never able to figure out exactly what it meant until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think on it much more, however, a doctor came into the exam room. Kyle jumped but recovered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Gordon,\" he said, \"the patient is ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was also surprised, but smiled quickly himself. He introduced himself to Johnny. He had a wide smile and a welcoming face. His build was intriguing too. It was clear that he worked out. Even through a lab coat and scrubs you could see well-build arms and pecs. But what was even more noticeable was the perfectly round belly distorting his scrubs top. It was wonderfully round and looked hard underneath the thin layer of cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was very distracted and paid little attention to what the doctor was saying. The last thing he caught was saying that the lab tech would take measurements and finalize the paperwork, and then they would begin. The doctor left, and Kyle and Johnny were left alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle said, \"Well?\"<br>\r\nJohnny looked at him blankly. \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Strip down to your boxers.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\"<br>\r\n\"Weren't you paying attention to the doctor?\"<br>\r\n\"Clearly not as much as I should have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stripped down to his boxers quickly. It was nothing new for Kyle. The boys had been this naked together before, but usually together, and never in an exam room. There was tenseness in the room as Kyle got out a tape measure and started to measure all over Johnny's body. He measured the length of every limb and its circumference. He measured Johnny's torso, round at three places. Johnny felt tingled wherever Kyle touched him.</span></div></div>",

Please stand between the two large panels over there. It won't hurt, but you will feel something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stepped between two very large panels. A bright light emerged on either side of him, and began to slide down slowly, passing over his whole body. He closed his eyes. He could feel a vivid tingling and warming sensation over his whole body as the light passed over. When it finished, the tingling remained for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor then gave Johnny two bottles of pills, each with only a serial number and barcode. The first was filled with large, orange capsules. \"Take one of these every morning when you get up, and every evening before you go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other bottle was much larger, but full of tiny blue pills. \"Take one of these before you eat, every time you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor then handed Johnny a credit card. \"You can charge all meals to this card. They're considered part of operational expenses, and are covered under your pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back in three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was ecstatic. He'd taken this job to get enough money to buy extra food, and now, in addition to his pay, they were telling him his food was all expenses paid. He wasn't sure if he was hungrier than usual or the card was just burning a hole in his pocket, but he decided to immediately celebrate at the fast food joint around the corner. He ordered a combo meal, super-sized it and added extra fries and a shake. When he paid for the meal, he got an odd smile from the cashier, who seemed to recognize the card. When the meal came, all the fries were brimming more than usual, and they had thrown in an extra order of nuggets and an apple pie to boot. The tray looked overfull, more like it was a meal for three people. Johnny didn't think he would finish it, but didn't complain either. He was very hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just remembered to pop a blue pill before starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate the burger quickly, and interspersed the fries as he went. He had to refill his soda twice as he devoured the second set of fries and nuggets, and finally moved on to the apple pie. To his surprise, not only did he finish the whole meal, he did it in 15 minutes. He didn't want to eat anymore, but he didn't seem to feel stuffed. Looking down, however, his belly said otherwise. It was distended and tight, and aggressively so. Johnny decided to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a half-hour drive, and Johnny was surprised how comfortable he was. Usually when he was this stuffed, which happened from time to time, he'd barely be able to sit straight. But now it felt comfortable, and natural, as if the belly wasn't bloated but always like this. Johnny enjoyed the sensation. When he arrived home, his mother was in the kitchen with his father, and they were both preparing a huge meal for the evening. There were mashed potatoes boiling, a pot roast filling the whole kitchen with a wonderful smell, and vegetables being sauteed, smothered in butter and oil. Much to his surprise, Johnny found himself hungry again. And by the time dinner was ready, another half-hour later, Johnny's stomach had deflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny popped another blue pill in the bathroom before dinner, and sat down to the family table. For the first time since anyone could remember, he matched his brother's appetite. His parents didn't say anything, but it clearly did not go unnoticed. After dinner, Johnny once again was stuffed but didn't feel it. His taut belly felt comfortable and natural, though small in comparison to his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Johnny went up to his room and called Kyle. Kyle was just getting off work, which apparently kept him late, and they agreed to meet at the fast food place near his house. It was about an hour after dinner, and once again Johnny's stomach was flat. They met at the restaurant and Johnny ordered for both of them. Kyle's eyes flashed when he saw the credit card. It was clear that he recognized it as well, but refused to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny repeated his previous order, while Kyle only had a chicken sandwich and soda. Strangely enough, when their order was delivered, this new place made the same additions to Johnny's order. Johnny popped a blue pill and ate all the food again. A little slower, since he was talking with Kyle, but not much. His distended belly once again felt comfortable, especially when Kyle rubbed it under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was tired, and so they parted ways and went to bed. Johnny made sure to take the orange pill before falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

In elementary school, all the teachers used to be surprised when parent conference time came around and Johnny's parents came in. They assumed, eventually, that he was adopted. When he was little, it really bugged Johnny that this was the way of things. He felt like he didn't fit in with his family, especially at reunions, where everyone was from big to huge. His big brother often teased him for it, and though his parents were nice, they never went out of their way to stop Patrick from doing it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he turned 14, and realized he was gay, however, he decided it was an asset to be the skinny kid. More people thought he was cute and this built up his self-esteem. He decided to stay skinny, and when he turned 17, he even decided to get thinner. One night, when his family and Kyle were with him at dinner, he decided to announce it. They were going to notice soon enough when his plate didn't get emptied, after all. He did not get the reaction he expected. In fact, he hardly got any reaction at all. His brother scoffed and made a remark about already being able benchpress him, but his mother and father simply said as long as you're healthy, we don't care what you weigh. Kyle looked concerned and shared a look with Johnny's parents that Johnny did not see.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJohnny decided to not look a gift horse in the mouth and went about eating his dinner.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLater on that evening...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Johnny was always insecure about his weight. He liked being conventionally pretty (and Kyle did too- they were both vain, but appreciated each other's looks.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he'd been taking things too far, and his recent decision to lose even more weight was beyond the pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kyle went to the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the bookish sort (Kyle sometimes wore glasses specifically for the occasion, but didn't want to look nerdy), he decided to go to the library and take out a book on eating disorders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library was a run-down place, full of old books. All was quiet- perfect for a library, poor for making people feel too comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for over half an hour, there was no sign of a book on eating disorders. He was pretty sure that it was that way because eating disorders are a more modern problem. Figures, he thought, and he was about to leave, when something caught his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bookshelf that he'd never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the books on it. They were all written in what he was pretty sure was Old English. One of them looked particularly attractive. It was purple with gold lining around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blew the dust off it, opened it up, and took a look at the first page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEest seen se greene so wepes do keene;<br>\r\nTal Anarin, por morach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt...looked like Olde English, but it didn't mean anything as far as he was sure.

But, we do know some magic which is quite potent for fattening people. But we don't actually have any spells to make food. Don't be stupid, boy, why would anyone want those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp laughed heartily at Kyle's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was quite disappointed, because he could have gone for a magical cheeseburger about that time.

Nice to see you look a bit healthier.\" His mom came into his room carrying a mixing bowl. \"If you're giving up on that diet of yours, maybe you'd like to try some of this fudge cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't, and no thanks mom.

Loren tells him that they are experimental drugs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\nX1316 is designed to gently slow the metabolism, with the side effect of making the subject somewhat tired. 1-2 drops should be added to a normal-sized drink to take effect, which lasts one day per dose.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nZ9982 is a brand new drug that has barely been tested on mice. It is double-packaged, and Loren says to be careful, that even breathing it can have partial effect. The drug is designed to temporarily shut down all nutritive absorption in the body and cause food to be converted entirely to fat. The nutritive shut down also causes extreme hunger, since the body thinks it is about to starve. The drug's incredible effect only lasts a few hours, and no more than a single drop should ever be used at a time.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLoren gives him some lotions and creams designed to avoid stretch marks under extreme conditions, but says that he can only spare one of the big drugs out, or he'll be noticed.

It was the closest he had ever been to Blake and he was standing right there in front of him. Johnny could smell the gentle masculine musk of sweat and body spray fill the air as his eyes soaked in the the beauty of Blake's soft body. Blake's belly filled his shirt beautifully and his rolls flowed over his body like a work of art. Johnny could see that Blake had a deep soft belly button as his shirt was on tight and looking up further Johnny could see just a tiny tuff of chest hair and a tiny bit of stubble on Blake's round face. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm looking around at the extra clubs and such and can't seem to find one,\" Blake said pointing at the community message board.<br>\r\n\"Which one?\" asked Johnny knowing that he knew a few of the clubs and quite enjoyed the gamer group last year.<br>\r\n\"The gay-straight alliance one,\" Blake said,\" I am not seeing one, thought you might have some info about it.\"<br>\r\nIf Johnny's life was a movie he was sure those Kill Bill sirens would be ringing right now.

Blake came from a pretty average looking family, his parents looked pretty normal, his dad being about 5'10\" to 6' tall by Johnny's estimate. But what really caught his eye was that Blake had really been on a growth streak lately. About a year ago there is a picture of Blake and his Dad at a mini golf course and Blake is about chest height and slim, in a more recent picture Blake is about the same height as his father and about twice his weight.<br>\r\n'All in a year...'

Blake and his family were very open about their size, and they and their friends' posts contained lots of juicy details about their sizes, weights and appetites, with the bigger and hungrier family members taking humourous potshots at the smaller, lighter and younger folks.  Reading the photo captions and the postings, Johnny got more and more convinced that Blake was the guy for him, especially when he read in a recent posting that Blake was now carrying ______________ pounds on his six foot two inches frame</span></div></div>",

By magic, science, food, inflation, whatever you want (or someone else wants). Straight characters welcome, but keep the main ones gay. Not too many rules, but please no rape, either consensual or statutory. In subsequent chapters, there will be a stock of characters for you to use, or you can come up with your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam Ogleby, the college freshman -- William is a short boy who went to college as a communications major, much to the chagrin of his family. His courseload is light and he's got a lot of time to exercise, or eat. He has grey-blue eyes often covered up by his mop of blonde hair, is 5'6\" and currently 150 lbs and a fair amount of muscle. He goes to a medium size private college on the east coast, pretty far from his home in Michigan. He never came out at home but doesn't know anybody at the new university, which will allow him to reinvent himself a little, and quickly change as he meets his roommate and the other guys of the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen Pointer, the Young Professional -- Ken graduated from college a year ago and has since gotten a cushy job at an office. He keeps a full schedule but the work doesn't fulfill him, and he's been looking for something more. Ken is 6'4\", has short-cropped brown hair and green eyes, and currently 200 lbs. Ken wasn't a varsity athlete, but he did keep up with a lot of intramurals and an exercise program in college. The intramurals gone and unable to afford a gym membership, Kyle has seen his abs disappear in the past year and added about 15 lbs to his once sleek and muscular frame. He lives with four other guys (three gay, one straight) whose eating and partying habits don't help the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve Klinger, the ex-jock -- Steve woke up one morning and wasn't really sure where his body went. In high school and college, he had been a wonderful athlete, or at least looked the part, as though he was a Roman statue come to life. Now 35, Steve's body has gone through some major changes. He is 6'2\", has black hair and brown eyes and currently weighs 260 lbs. He has no intentions of gaining any more, but his partner might have something to say about that, and something to do with how he got to 260 in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter Leonard, the big-time gainer -- Peter is a guy with only a few big goals, and those include gaining weight and living life on his terms. A day trader several years ago, Peter ended up with the kind of money that means you never have to work again, and he decided not to. Now he travels and eats and spends as he wishes. Peter doesn't have a partner, but instead tends to pick up a posse of young guys and take them with him on his wild rides, usually causing them to gain weight themselves, whether they like it or not. Peter has red hair, green eyes and currently weighs 400 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny Underman, the small kid in a big family -- If Johnny's parents didn't know better and for certain, they'd swear he was adopted. A short kid (5' 7\") from tall parents, red hair from black and brown, and blue eyes from green and black, Johnny looks like he was born to somebody else. If his height hair and eyes weren't enough, his weight is the final convincer. Despite his family's constant supply of fatty foods and buffets, and Johnny's own significant eating habits, he's never been able to break 150 lbs. His father is 320, his mother 280, and his older bother 260. Some quirk has always made Johnny skinny. He's not really sure at this stage in life whether that's good or bad. He's 17, he's come out to his parents, and they're fine with it.</td>",
