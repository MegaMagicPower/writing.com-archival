It was short, at least in comparison to other games you had played in the past. However, the writing was phenomenal, easily leaving you very attached to the characters. You sympathized with their struggles, felt joy when you saw them happy and felt sad what you had witnessed the girls go through during the second act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Yuri's obsession grow out of control, seeing Natsuki's dad become more abusive, witnessing Sayori's death, and seeing just how lonely Monika was. You wished there was more to the game, and that you could help each and every girl, but the best you could have done was of course get the good end, trying your best to make everyone happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the month that has past, you've considered going back to the game just for the hell of it, but you've always decided against it. Something just didn't feel right about replaying the game again, maybe it just felt like you would be making the girls suffer again? You weren't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though, you were busy fixing yourself a meal, totally unaware of what was happening with your computer. Small sparks were shooting out from the monitor and computer, small and far apart at first, but slowly growing in intensity. It wasn't until it really started getting bad that you finally took notice of it, right when you finished preparing your food too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is-\" you begin making your way to your computer, but stop midway once you see just how bad the situation really is. Fearing the worst, you do the best thing you can think of; hide behind your couch. The sparks grow worse and worse, until finally-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah-!\" A feminine voice cries, a girl crashing into the wall opposite from the computer, having been launched out of the monitor. You witnessed this from behind the couch, finally emerging once you feel as though it was safe to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... Monika?\" You state in disbelief, said Monika currently rubbing her head where it had slammed into the wall. Thankfully, she didn't appear to be too hurt at the very least. Finally, she looked up to you, her emerald eyes meeting yours. She froze, seemingly in disbelief herself. After a minute, she look around, scanning her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... did it work?\" She finally asked, confirming that she was no longer in the Literature Club, looking back up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did what work?\" You asked. Slowly, you see a smile appear on her face as she picks herself up, rising to her full height, which happened to be just a little shorter than yourself, about three inches shorter than you, putting her at about 5'3\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... it worked. It worked!\" She suddenly cried out, running to you and enveloping you in a hug, crying tears of joy. You are taken back by this sudden sequence of events, but eventually you return the hug, gently patting her on the back in an attempt to console her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be an interesting night...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a nearly 5 minute crying session and almost a whole tissue box, Monika seems to have finally calmed down. Right now, you and Monika were sitting together on the couch, both taking in the current situation. Monika was looking around the room, taking in the new setting. You however, you couldn't take your eyes off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she seemed to be self aware in the game, you knew it was just all part of the meta aspect. At least, you think you knew now. This all seemed like a dream. Monika, a girl from a video game was now here, in the flesh, in your house! Suddenly, she locked eyes with you once more, a small blush appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm sorry. I'm still trying to get used to all this. It's just... different. So different.\" She said, leaning back onto the couch. \"I've just grown used to the game world. Seeing the classroom everyday, the same three girls, the scripts, the code, all of it. It's surreal being here, in the real world... with you.\" She looked back at you, her eyes soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I get it. It's new to both of us.\" You say, looking away. \"I'm still trying to process this as well. How are you here anyway?\" You asked. Monika put a finger to her chin, seemingly in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'm not sure. Ever since you... deleted me,\" you and Monika both seem to cringe at the memory. \"let's just say I had a lot of time to go through the codes. So I decided to poke around a bit more, mostly because I had nothing better to do. Eventually, I found... something, I'm not entirely sure what it was. After I tried activating it, I ended up here. That's all I can really recall.\" She said, rubbing the back of her head. You doubt you'll get anymore than that from her, because if she didn't know what happened, then there's no way you'll be finding answers anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, what about the others?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure, they might still be in there.\" Monika suddenly let out a cute little yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't realize how tired I was. Is there... some place I can sleep the night. And maybe... every other night, hehe?\" She said with a nervous chuckle. As far as you were concerned, you didn't mind her staying here with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I can set up the couch here for you. Do you want to change? I can get some pajamas for you. They might be a little big, but I'm sure they'll be more comfortable than sleeping in your school uniform.\" You say. Monika looks down at herself, seeming to have forgotten that she was still in the clothing from the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please, I'd appreciate it.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. We can go shopping tomorrow for clothes so you aren't stuck with just a single outfit.\" You say, and she nodded in response. After all the preparations were finished, Monika had a place to sleep with clothes to sleep in. Said clothes were quite big on her, the pajama pants were long enough to more than cover her feet. You said goodnight to her and headed off to your own bed, turning the lights off for her as you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Monika got comfortable, she couldn't shake this strange feeling she had ever since she got here. She couldn't describe it any other way than... unnatural. She shrugged it off as best she could though, thinking she could worry about it tomorrow. However, unbeknownst to her, the clothes she was currently wearing fit her just a little bit better as she slowly grew a single inch in height.</span></div></div>",

She was essentially jumping back and forward between clothes, seeing what was cute, what she liked, etc. \"Also don't grab to many now, I can't buy out the whole store. Plus you still need shoes too, don't forget.\" You note, as she hadn't moved on from the pants yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! But not only do I get to explore your world, but this is like a date!\" She said happily. You chuckled, rolling your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see that you haven't changed. But, uh, keep talk about 'my world' on the down low out in public. People are going to stare if you keep that up.\" You say, which made Monika realize her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yeah, you're right.\" She rubbed the back of her head with her free hand. \"Anyway, I think I've picked out all my clothes.\" She said, walking over to you, showing you her choices. One pair was a blue long sleeved shirt with gray pants, another was a simple white dress that was still pretty casual. The third was a t-shirt of a cute cat and shorts, finally, there was pink pajamas for her to sleep in. You looked over them a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? Not just a few more?\" You asked, you were expected a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, I don't want to make you spend too much on me\" She said, looking away with a small smile. How is she so cute? You smiled back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright, if you're sure. Do you want to go look at shoes now? I can hold you clothes while you do.\" You offered, gaining a bigger smile from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a gentleman.\" She giggled. As you gathered her soon to be clothes from her, you told her to go on ahead to the shoe section as you got control of the clothes. She nodded and walked on ahead. Once you could properly hold all the clothes, you headed over as well, expecting to meet her at the shoes, but instead, you found her looking down at herself, confused with a hand to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monika, are you okay?\" You asked concerned. She blinked, looking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I'm fine. It's nothing.\" She said. \"What about we walk together?\" She suggested. You didn't want to pry if it really was nothing. You agreed and began your walk to the shoe section. Monika attempted to be sly and try to link her hand with your free one, gaining another eye roll from you as she lightly blushed. You looked over to her, she was avoiding eye contact and... was she always that tall? You had guessed she had been 5'3\" last night, but now she looked to be at least 5'5\" now. Maybe you misjudged her height initially. Whatever the case may be, it was not anything to worry about.</span></div></div>",

As the coral pink haired girl regained her composer, she finally took a look at the state of the club. It wasn't well, Yuri was by herself reading another horror book and Natsuki was sitting in the floor near the closet, manga in hand. Yuri, only now realizing that there was another person in the room, looked up from her book and looked over to Sayori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Sayori. It is alright, it... doesn't seem to matter too much.\" She stated, the sadness present in her voice. Natsuki simply shifted uncomfortably, bothered by the state of the club as much as Yuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Sayori sullenly sighed, \"Monika isn't here?\" She asked. Natsuki was the one to respond this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't been at school at all.\" She stated bluntly. \"Neither has [MC].\" She turned the page of her manga, gaining a gasp from the slightly taller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think-!\" She implied, shock overtaking her face. Yuri was tempted to roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. She's the perfect student. She wouldn't sully that by running off with a boy away from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She better not. I doubt she'd even fall for someone as dumb as him.\" Natsuki blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsuki! Don't be mean!\" Sayori cried. This gained a small chuckle from the tall purple haired girl. She was always grateful for Sayori's presence, her innocence could always help lighten the mood. Even Natsuki couldn't help but smile a bit too. Sayori, seemingly sensing that the atmosphere had shifted, smiled herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Everyone is happy again!\" She cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly, but we are both thankful  for you being here.\" Yuri said with a smile. Natsuki made a small noise in agreement, not wanting to make her agreement vocal. \"That being said, since you are here, do you two want to share poems now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well,\" Natsuki said, putting her manga away and getting up. \"... Yuri, do you want to exchange poems first?\" She asked looking away, catching the taller girl by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me?\" She stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you two are getting along too! I'm so glad!\" Sayori exclaimed, running over to hug Natsuki, the smaller girl getting flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up! I just thought... I'd get some advice from her..\" She stated, this in turn made the taller girl become embarrassed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh gosh, I-I'm not that good, but if you want to.\" She responded, playing with her hair. Sayori couldn't help but smile more at the situation. Even if they were missing two members, she was still going to try and make this an enjoyable experience for everyone.</span></div></div>",

The sensation didn't seem noticeable or that out of the ordinary at first, probably just her still being shaken by the joy of seeing you again, but the feeling went from minor to major when Monika felt her legs stretch beyond the edge of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwake as she could be, Monika went to bathroom next to your room to properly check on herself. Immediately she noticed that the overly large pajamas now fitted her almost flawless, with her feet now clearly being visible. This was quite unusual since she had never programmed herself to be capable of this, nor would that be possible outside of the literature club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly put on her original outfit and noticed that her body now seemed a lot more.... exaggerated. Her curves were beyond the charts (at least she thinks so). A wide smile spread across her face at this realization, the thought of your surprised and dumbfounded face made her already sweat in pleasure. As quick as lightning strikes, Monika had already entered your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away from the doorway, she saw you sleeping at your desk with your desk lamp still turned on. Along with her hight and wide smile, her desire for you only kept grew with her every step she took towards you until she stood right behind while you remained asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took a seat at the other side of the desk and began stroking her elegant fingers of her right hand through your hair as she kept her chin up with her left. A strong feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu had come over Monika, but she didn't mind nor could've she cared less about that; you're with her, that all that mattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you just sooo cute when you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Monika finally noticed what things were on your desk</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cShit, my head\u2026\u201d You say, clutching your head as you lean against a nearby locker. Some passing students glance towards you, but pay you no mind as they continue on with their business. As soon as the headache appeared, it just as quickly disappeared without a trace. You lift your hand from your head once you feel the pain subside. \u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d You question, confused as to why the pain was suddenly gone. \u201cWell, whatever, I should get to the literature club.\u201d Once making sure that you\u2019re alright, you make your way through the crowd towards the class where the literature club was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, it still surprises me to see you coming back.\u201d Natsuki commented once you entered into the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you too, Natsuki.\u201d You lightly waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, you don\u2019t look so good.\u201d Yuri, asked, standing up from her desk, of course not without saving her spot in her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, oh, yeah, I\u2019m fine. I just got a migraine on the way here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s not good!\u201d Yuri exclaimed, surprisingly loudly. Was she really that worried about you? Even Natsuki seemed worried, though she quickly changed the look on her face once she saw you were looking, turning away with a \u2018hmph\u2019. Yuri seems to have realized what she did, and looked away shyly. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I was just worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s alright Yuri. I already feel fine anyway.\u201d You say in an attempt to dispel her worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-is that so?\u201d She asks, glancing at you. While you two were talking, Natsuki seemed to have noticed something about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is Yuri taller than you?\u201d She asked, walking up to you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You both say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand back to back for a second.\u201d Natsuki almost commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?!\u201d Yuri\u2019s face gains a shade of red, seemingly flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make this weird!\u201d Natsuki rolled her eyes. \u201cJust do it.\u201d Though a bit reluctant, the purple haired girl complied, turning so that he back is against yours. You wait for Natsuki\u2019s verdict. After a moment, she grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, let me get onto a chair.\u201d She said, mumbling something about you and Yuri, probably about your heights dwarfing hers. Once on a desk chair, she can finally tell. \u201cYeah, Yuri\u2019s taller than you.\u201d She says, causing Yuri to once again turn red, she always did seem shy about her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that can\u2019t be right though\u2026\u201d She says. \u201cI remember having to look up to him last week\u2026\u201d She says. You could confirm that she was right too, remember how you had at least 2 inches on her. But if what Natsuki was saying was right, that would either mean Yuri was taller than 6 feet now, or you had some how shrunk at least 3 inches. You turn around, looking Yuri in the eye. Natsuki was right, you found yourself having to look slightly above to meet her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026\u201d Is all you can say. After a moment, Natsuki\u2019s voice fills in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you need to be any taller, Yuri!\u201d She pouts. I guess it would be jealous inducing if the tallest person only got taller while you stayed the shortest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s not I want it to be this way\u2026\u201d Yuri sighs. Feeling a bit bad, you go to put a hand on her shoulder, until you accidentally shock her. She yelps in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d You exclaim. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, it\u2019s alright.\u201d She says, looking away. Looking forward, you see Natsuki gaping at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatsuki?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid\u2026 did Yuri just get even taller?\u201d She questioned. You raise a brow before turning towards Yuri. But what you see shocked you. Yuri somehow did get taller! Even she noticed it. Another moment of awkward silence fills the room as you three stand in shock. Eventually, Natsuki jumps off the chair and heads to the closet, rummaging around a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is.\u201d She says, pulling out a measuring tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Natsuki?\u201d Yuri asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, help me measure Yuri.\u201d Natsuki says towards you. You glance towards the girl in question, shrugging as she meets your gaze. Both of you head towards the pink haired girl. Yuri is told to stand up against the wall, which she complies. After receiving the measuring tape and taking Yuri\u2019s height, you stand shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d Natsuki asked. Even Yuri was curious to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c6\u20192\u201d\u201d You inform them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I grew 4 inches\u2026?\u201d Yuri seemingly asks the question everyone has on their mind. After even more stunned silence, Natsuki speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s check your height too.\u201d She says. Complying, you hand the measuring tape to Yuri and stand against the wall. After a moment, she gets your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c5\u20198\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! But I\u2019ve been 6\u2019 for two years now!\u201d You say. Yuri gained 4 inches, and you somehow lost 4 inches. Before any of you could say anything more, Monika and Sayori walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry we\u2019re late, we\u2026 uh, what are you guys doing?\u201d Monika asked, seeing you three in the corner of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, are we measuring each other?\u201d Sayori innocently asks. You, Natsuki and Yuri all exchange looks, before Yuri surprisingly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 not exactly.\u201d She said, slightly confusing the two girls before you three began to explain the situation.</span></div></div>",

While Monika had a look of concern, Sayori was more curious about the development. She walked over to you, seemingly comparing heights before sure smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, it\u2019s so strange being up to your nose now.\u201d She giggled, putting her hand to the top of her head then moving it towards you, accidentally touching your nose with it. \u201cEep!\u201d She cried out, seeming to receive the same shock that Yuri had received earlier. \u201cOwie\u2026\u201d She moaned, rubbing her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSayori?\u201d Monika began, concerned. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 taller.\u201d She slowly spoke. Upon hearing this, Sayori turned towards her, seeing that she was now eye level with the 5\u20196\u201dclub president, meaning she just grew 2 inches. Sayori gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, we\u2019re the same height!\u201d She exclaimed, enveloping Monika in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSayori, come on, this is serious.\u201d You speak up, getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. Eheh\u2026\u201d she said, letting go of Monika and bridging her fingers. \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you at least feel alright?\u201d Monika asked you, which you say that you\u2019re fine. \u201cI see, and it looks like if we touch you, we grow a bit too.\u201d She noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately\u2026\u201d Yuri mumbled. Natsuki on the other hand almost looked jealous, seeing that Sayori and Yuri were both taller now. She looked towards you, seemingly contemplating what she should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatsuki?\u201d You got her attention, catching her staring. A small blush appeared as she turned her face away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I feel as though it\u2019ll be best to call the club off early today, just to try and understand this situation a bit better. You guys can head home if you want, just maybe try not to draw attention to yourselves from the other students.\u201d Monika said, as you all agree. You take a glance at the girls, thinking of what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it\u2019d be best to see what\u2019s wrong, if anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nat.\u201d You called out to the small girl, getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Wait, don\u2019t call me Nat!\u201d She complained, making you chuckle. Good to know that she\u2019s still the same as ever, despite the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything alright, it looked like something was bothering you earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh\u2026\u201d She looked away, realizing what you were talking about. \u201cUm\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 stupid. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that. Remember that I\u2019m willing to help you in any way I can.\u201d Saying this made her fidget some.

After saying your goodbyes to the other girls (and receiving some slight teasing from Sayori) you and Natsuki head for you house. After making yourselves comfortable, Natsuki sits on the couch with you. \u201cSo. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d You ask, making her look away, a small blush appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s stupid, but\u2026 can you\u2026 make me taller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? Don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d She pouted. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I got jealous that Yuri and Sayori got taller. Like they need it.\u201d She said, smirking despite herself. \u201cI just\u2026 wanted to ask. You don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t\u2026 want to.\u201d She said, a frown making itself known. You got what she was getting at. She was the shortest of the club at 4\u201911\u201d. You looked at, she was looking away, her face conflicted. You did want to see her happy, plus, was there really any harm in doing so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Nat.\u201d You smile at her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? But-are you sure?\u201d She asked, you couldn\u2019t help but appreciate how much kinder she\u2019s been as of late, not that you didn\u2019t like her \u2018tsundere\u2019 side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I mean, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with it. I don\u2019t feel any different, Yuri, aside from seeming to become a little more shy, seems perfectly fine, so does Sayori. So why not?\u201d You shrug, Natsuki beams at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026T-thanks.\u201d She says, struggling to get the words out, blushing and smiling. You both stand up which Natsuki noticed something. \u201cDid you get smaller again?\u201d She asked. You did notice that you didn\u2019t have to look as far down as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 I guess I did.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh, if this keeps up, you\u2019ll be as tiny as me!\u201d She laughs. You didn\u2019t know how to feel about that notion. It would certainly be something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, just give me your hand.\u201d You say, shaking your head. Enthusiastically. She stretches out her arm, and you tap your finger onto her hand, giving her a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! You jerk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! You knew that was coming!\u201d You retort at her outburst. You two stand there for a second before laughing with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, I guess.\u201d She admits, before looking back up at you, not having to look so far up now. \u201cAnyway, how tall do you think I am now?\u201d She asked. She was way more excited than you had anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s go measure and find out.\u201d You say, going to look for a tape measure.</span></div></div>",
