He got the call and it said that they wanted a lifeguard.\u201d What\u2019s going on.?\u2019. Joey went around the set and finally found the director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s with the role change. I got the call back that I\u2019m the life guard. Now the script says I\u2019m somebody else. \u201casked Joey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I should have fired that young foolish intern. There was some miscommunication. You got switch role from life guard to boardwalk owner. Your new role is that you <br>\r\nwere a former lifeguard that got an injury that cost you your lifeguard career. You fell in depression and filled the void with food. You slowly bought all the lands and shops on the boardwalk. Many people see you as a shady man as you do and underworld connection. \u201csaid the director as he explained the new role to Joey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the role change is okay, but I should have been notified and the new role does cooler like I\u2019m the bad guy.\u201d said joey as he thought about the new role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. You\u2019re the shady owner that is later reveal with illegal chemical dumping and environmental damage. You have three sexy hench women who are trained bodyguards and assassins. You dress in luxury clothes which cover your bulk frame. Your lifeguard body change to a more of hefty fatty body.\u201d Said the director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are doing fine job of getting the body, but it could be a lot bigger. \u201csaid the director as he poked Joey\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold up. I can\u2019t get fat. What about wearing a fat suit. \u201csaid Joey as looked down at his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo can do. All fat suits can\u2019t be worn as the factor who created them recalled as there was chemical that cause the wearer\u2019s skin to break out is rashes and white bumps.\u201d said the director.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not sure if I want the role. \u201csaid Joey as he pinched his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ashamed as you have the perfect face and the actresses who play your hench women want to me.\u201d said the director as he pointed to three sexy women who were <br>\r\ncoming towards. An intern came to the director and whispered something in the director\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook if you don\u2019t want the role then tell me by the end of the day shooting, come find me if you want it or not. I have to run there\u2019s a problem in the prop department. \u201csaid the director as he sprinted off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey heard his name being called and he saw three sexy women coming towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. It\u2019s great to meet you. I\u2019m Sandy. \u201csaid one of the women who has slight tan skin long curly blonde hair with blue eyes and wearing a pink bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here.

His butt grew slightly but in comparison to the rest of him it had hardly grown. Joey loved this life style, he wasn't sure why he hadn't got fat sooner; his only issue was that now he was bigger, everything was sensitive to the touch, especially when he was really full. It was like the nerves in his body were going haywire but in a good way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey stood up and let his body get used to the balance as he arched his back slightly before heading down to the studio to meet the director. He decided to for go any attempt at finding clothes that fit and just went as he was; his t-shirt rested firmly half way up his belly; revealing his very deep belly button and his jeans would no longer do up now that they had popped open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half an hour drive Joey arrived at the studio and knocked on the directors door; he gestured for Joey to come in whilst he finished a phone call; at which point Joey noticed that he had also put on a fair amount of weight over the last month too, buttons strained to keep that enormous belly in and Joey was really eager to see each pop off one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah Joey; good to see you' the director called Mac said as he stood up and walked over to Joey, giving his belly a pat, 'thanks Mac' Joey said giving Mac's very large belly a returning Pat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe smiled at Joey, 'now then....I'm glad you came down actually, there is something we need to discuss' Mac said, 'Oh?' Joey said confused, 'its about your weight' Mac said gesturing towards Joey's rather plump appearance, 'my weight? You want me to lose it?' Joey said in a worried way; he had grown a custom to being fat now he didn't want to stop now. 'Oh god no Joey, its just we need you to gain more!' Mac said, 'more?' Joey said with slight glee on his face, 'yeah, but the problem is, that even though your doing an amazing job...its just, not quick enough... we need you fatter faster' Mac said, 'oh.....well umm ok, not sure what I can do with that' Joey said, 'I thought you might say that; which is why I have arranged.........' </span></div></div>",
