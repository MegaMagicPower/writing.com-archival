Swaying as the vehicle pulled up the the stop, he was thrown gently into one of the strangers that squeezed in on him. He barely took notice of the older woman he had just collided with as he muttered a half-coherent apology. He reached for the exit, a wave of sudden vertigo hitting him, sending him staggering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft hiss, the door slid open and Chris found himself tumbling face first into the street, flailing. Behind him he was vaguely aware of the bus pulling away, leaving him rolling on the concrete. The world spun around him, and he felt as if his whole body was warped out of proportion. His sense of size and weight seemed to make no sense to him whatsoever as he rolled on his back, blinking up at the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, are you ok?\" A unfamiliar voice asked. Chris didn't register that the man was speaking to him. Not until the question was repeated and a tentative hand was pressed to his shoulder did he look towards the speaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? What?\" He stammered, shutting his mouth quickly as he heard his own voice escape his lips. It sounded squeaky, more nasally, and much higher pitched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, are you ok?\" The strange man repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, pushing off the ground with his hands, he wobbled to his feet, leaning on the kind stranger for support as his body seemed to teeter back and forth, off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah I'm fine. I'm fine.\" Chris replied, pushing the man away, a flush of embarrassment burning his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting his eyes downward he hurried off down the street towards his house as best he could, still stumbling and holding his arms out for balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked down at his arms, eyebrows knitting together. His arms were wrong. The skin sticking out of his t-shirt was dark and tanned. Not only that but his limbs looked shorter. Bringing them up to his face, he looked at his hands. They were smaller, softer, with perfectly cut nails. His fingers found his face, gasping as he discovered more irregularities. His face felt somehow more puffy, his cheeks were in the wrong place, and there was no trace of stubble on his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, confused, he turned towards a shop window and looked at himself in the glass. the reflection staring back at him with wide eyes and a dumb expression was not his. In fact, it was a woman. What he saw was long blonde hair tied behind his head, bright blue eyes, light lipstick on a pair of small lips, a round face, and a body that would definitely qualify as curvy. If he had to guess he would say he was now about 5'4\" tall, weighing around 150 pounds. Forgetting he was in public, he brought his hands reflexively up to feel the alien sensation of two huge breasts on his chest. He also appeared to be older now, seemingly in his mid thirties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his mind back, he suddenly became aware he was groping himself in the street. Blushing, he yanks his hands back to his sides, panting, about to lose his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthere was something familiar about this woman, but he couldn't place it. Then it hit him - the woman on the bus! The one he had slammed into for a second. That's who was looking back at him from the other side of the mirrored glass. How was this possible. Had they swapped places? No, that didn't make sense, he was still wearing his own clothes, the shirt now riding up as his chest stretched the fabric to its limit, his pants constricting his hips painfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had become her, that much was sure. But how? and what the hell should he do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I have no idea where she went, even if she knows anything but maybe I can track her down later. So where can I go? I cant keep walking around like this I look like a crazy woman. Can't go home they will just think I'm a stranger. I've got to convince someone that I'm really me. Tom, I gotta find Tom, he will believe me if I can talk to him alone.!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was as much of a plan as he could come up with under the circumstances, part of him still refusing to actually even believe that he just turned into a clone of a stranger on a bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully his best friend Tom didn't live too far from Chris. Which means he was in the right neighborhood. It took him 10 minutes of quick, uncomfortable speed-walking to arrive outside the house. Thankfully, while Tom still lived with his parents, he slept in a small basement suite that had its own back door. Looking around to make sure nobody saw him, Chris crept up to the basement window and peeked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside he saw a scruffy looking Tom sitting in front of his computer, seemingly very interested in whatever he was watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Chris walked and knocked as softly as he could on the basement door. then again, louder, when he got to reply. Finally the door cracked open and a very confused Tom looked out at him, running his eyes over the older woman in the inappropriately tight men's clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, yeah?\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, just give me 30 seconds to talk, please,\" Chris said. He had rehearsed this in his head on his way over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I look like but you have to believe me that I am actually Chris. Somehow I turned into this woman I bumped into. We have been friends for five years, we met in the worst summer camp ever, Camp Sunlight, where one night we decided to try sneaking out and you were mauled by a raccoon and needed a rabies shot. The next summer you thought you were going to lose your virginity to Carol Harris but she suddenly moved to Idaho. You still have a pair of Batman Pj's from when you were 12 that you refuse to throw out. Do you want me to go on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause of silence before Tom replied with a decisive, \"Um, what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had to slow down and explain everything in detail, trying to act calm as he stood outside his best friends door feeling lost and exposed, nervously shifting from one side to the other. After what seemed like hours but was in reality only about 2 minutes, tom finally started to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, can I just come in before someone sees me?!\" Chris hissed in his new, female voice as his eyes pleaded desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a seconds hesitation Tom stepped aside and let him in, saying \"Ok but if this is some kind of elaborate scam I swear I'll mace you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have mace.\" Chris stated flatly as he rushed into the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's really you? Like, how does it feel, it must be insane. you have, you know, tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? I didn't fucking notice!\" Chris spat back as i opens his arms and gestured to his huge chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was silent for  moment, as his eyes locked in to Chris's breasts, the nipples clearly visible through the stretched out t shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She added, crossing his arms again, \"did you just check me out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, but those clothes really ain't covering anything and that body isn't bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, what are you gonna do?\"</span></div></div>",

He scrambles around the room as Jessica get closer to the bottom of the stairs, staggering as he tries to deal with his new, unfamiliar body. Tom frantically points to a closet next to his bed. As quickly as he can, Chris jumps inside and quietly closes the door, holding his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching in the cramped closet Chris listens as Jessica starts telling tom some mundane details about dinner and laundry while his best friend tries to act calm and agrees to what she is saying. Along with Jessica's footsteps, Chris also hears the clicking patter of Ribbon , the family dog. Chris grits his teeth as the border collie starts sniffing towards the closet, curious, a low growl in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris silently cursed under his breath, trying to will the dog away. Obviously in his present form he must smell unfamiliar and threatening hiding in the corner of the room. The door of the closer didn't latch closed properly and Ribbons began pawing at the crack,pulling the door open. Chris tries to wave his hands, shooing the dog away, whispering for ribbons to leave, but it only make her more curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog began to bark, quietly, but insistently. If Chris didn't shut her up Jessica would find him to be sure. </span></div></div>",

Which wasn't exactly any more useful in keeping her quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush!\" Chris whispered sharply as he tried to hold Ribbons close, petting her head, trying to placate her. Pulling the closet door closed again, it seemed like nobody had noticed the dog vanish into the closet - yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be quiet...\" Chris pleaded as he held the canine, terrified of having to explain this to Jessica. \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was thinking desperately about how much he wanted out of this situation how much he wanted to be someone other than this strange woman he didn't even know. thinking if there was just another way out of this trap. And then he felt the dizziness close in on him again, and he started falling forward onto his hands as his body went numb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just enough time to say, \"awwwwww shit...\" Before he let go of Ribbons and landed on his hands and knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet seemed to grow around him as he clenched his teeth, his hips snapping and reshaping themselves, his fingers shrinking and fusing together, a hard lump forming at the base of his spine as a tail pushed out of his body. Tangled in the human clothes, the exact copy of ribbons the dog fumbled around trying to get free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Ribbons barked again, tilting her head in confusion as another female border collie rolled out of the twisted t shirt and tried to stand up. ribbons moved over and gave her a sniff, yipping and licking her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Chris was afraid before, he was completely terrified now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down girl!\" he tried to say but all that came out of his mouth was a canine whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to walk  away from the baffled and curious dog, only to find himself awkwardly trotting on all fours. around the messy closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris whined again, trying to curse but unable to make human sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ribbons, where did you go?\" He heard Jessica say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had been so distracted he hadn't noticed that tom and his mother's conversation had come to an end and she was leaving.

With another sudden sinking feeling he remembers that he is a FEMALE dog. In fact, the term is quite accurately 'bitch'. Thinking that word sends shivers though him as he tries to back away again. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHey um, have you been fixed, boy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis question is answered when the larger dog licks at him again and sits up, and Chris's eyes see something growing between his hind legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris turns to run but the bigger dog pounces, his front paws pinning Chris's hips and knocking him off balance. With a frantic bark he wiggled on the ground. with no preamble, the male dog starts grinding and thrusting his hips frantically his tool poking clumsily at Chris's new slit. All of Chris's cries for help just come out a whining yelps as he tries to squirm away, feeling the cock prodding closer and closer to its mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris lets out a loud, frantic howl as the tip of the drooling male's cock slams unceremoniously into his pussy. Chris's eyes go wide as he fees the very new and alien sensation of being mated as the other dog starts mindlessly humping away at his tighter, smaller body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the things attacking his senses, Chris couldn't even tell what he was feeling when the knot started pressing against the surprisingly wet opening to his pussy. Despite the shock, his body was responding like the animal he was, opening to his larger mate as he whimpered and begged, his tongue hanging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He realized he was cumming, having a climax as a not only a female, but as a DOG! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for that moment, he loved it. He had never felt so full and complete. He was literally a bitch in heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he yelped and whined he could feel the German Sheppard pound him harder as he growled, and Chris felt a warm, sticky rush as the bigger dog filled him with his semen, falling on Chris, trapping him as he laid on his mate in a satisfied heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris panted, trying to catch his breath as the other animal pinned him down.

The most difficult thing was crossing the street, and more than a few people gaped at the dog who was clambering up streetlights and pressing crosswalk signals on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, eventually he made it, despite the curious and concerned people who tried halfheartedly to intercept him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ok\" </i> Chris thought to himself, <i>\"Now I'm home...how do I get in\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis family had no pets, so there was no doggy door or other obvious means of entering the house. He could bark at the door until someone opened it, but its not like he could explain who he was when he tried to rush inside. No, he decided, he needed to sneak in somehow, get to his room, and then try to concentrate on changing back now that he knew he could change more than once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving cautiously, he walked around the house. A trail of rising steam caught his attention, and his dog nose could smell the shampoo and soap coming from the first floor bathroom. He could hear the shower running. He had no idea what time it was, but it was probably his sister cleaning off after soccer practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris crouched in a bush, listening. Soon the shower turned off, and he heard Clara finishing up and leaving the bathroom. She also, Chris saw gratefully, left the window open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom window was high enough that he couldn't just hop up, he would have to find another way to climb up the wall. Looking around quickly, not knowing how long this opportunity would last, he frantically grabbed a flower pot in his mouth, wincing at the earthy, musty taste, and dragged it over to the window. Taking a running start, he jumped up off the planter and managed to get his front pawn on the window sill, scrabbling for a second before tumbling into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthankfully he landed on the plush bath mat next to the shower, and he laid still for a few tense seconds, wondering if anyone heard him. It didn't seem like it, however, and he slowly stood up, shook himself off and crept to the bathroom door. Chris nosed it open and slunk out to the hall, trying not to let his paws clack too loudly on the floor until he got to the door of his own room. </span></div></div>",

Finally he had some privacy to try to and think without being chased around by people ten times his size. He waited for his heart to slow down, though he had no idea what a resting heart rate for a dog his size was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute he closed his eyes, focusing. Last time he changed he was terrified, desperate, and he had all his attention on Ribbons the dog. It was a good a theory as any that he just had to concentrate really hard and he could take a new shape. But in all those cases he was touching the person, and now he was trying to get back to his own form without anyone to steal from. Still, he had to try, he just couldn't believe that he would have to live the rest of his life taking the forms of other people and animals. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"I want to be me, I want to be me, I want to be ME\"</i> Chris repeated to himself as he pictured his own face. But nothing happened. After what seemed like hours he collapsed, mentally exhausted, not to mention physically worn out from running on his tiny legs across the neighborhood. He wasn't sure if dogs could really cry, but he felt like he was going to, and a forlorn whimper almost escaped his mouth before he snapped it shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated he crawled on the floor under his bed and flopped down, sighing. His fate seemed hopeless and, with a final beaten whimper, he fell into a depressed sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure how long he was out for, but eventually some stomping on the stairs woke him up, and he jumped up, startled. His head collided with the underside of the bed and he cursed, rubbing his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his skull with HANDS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Chris said to himself, as he realized he wasn't a dog anymore. Rolling out form under the bed, he grinned, overcome with relief as I stood awkwardly up and faced his small mirror. </span></div></div>",

He was determined not to come into any contact with anyone else unless it was intentional. He spent the next half an hour trying to research anything remotely resembling what was happening without having much success. That is until he came across a small forum simply called \u201cImpersonators\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe content on the forum was phrased as fiction \u2013 stories about people who could change into copies of anything alive though concentration, adrenaline or sometimes just by accident. It was my no means a published scientific journal, but the way the transformations were described, and fact that they always centered around people roughly the same age as Chris, struck a chord.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris read as many of the submitted stories as he could, trying to figure out if any of them might have been true. He posted a brief account of his own experience on the previous day anonymously, and commented on a few of the submissions that seemed to mirror his own, hoping to get in contact with someone else who had this unwanted power.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Chris was finally starting to feel like he might not be alone in his predicament, Tom trudged up the stars and opened his bedroom door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting it quickly behind him, Tom said in a eager whisper, \u201cDude, tell me I wasn\u2019t going crazy, you actually turned into some random woman and a DOG?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish it was just you going nuts, because yes, yes I think I did. Unless we were both hallucinating. I still have no idea what caused it but look at this,\u201d here Chris pointed to his laptop screen, \u201cthere is this whole little community of people who post stories about EXACTLY what happened to me. They describe the change the same, they describe the first time it happened the same, and they all say that they finally turned back when they slept for a full night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s like, a Facebook group for people like you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, they phrase all of them as short stories, but...I don\u2019t know it\u2019s too similar, someone must know something here. I\u2019m waiting. To hear back from anyone on this board.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes is say how it happened?\u201d Tom asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, just that some people develop this ability at the end of puberty, and nobody really seems to be sure why. Some people say it\u2019s from being descended from witches, some say it\u2019s a mutation. Either way, if any of this is based on things that have actually happened then at least it seems like I can control it. It\u2019s the closest thing to an answer I have.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s try it! Turn into someone again.\u201d Tom said, eager to see the power in action.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! What if this is just bullshit, what if I can\u2019t turn back on my own, what if someone sees me before I can go to sleep, what if I just get stuck and can\u2019t change back at all?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have this power, and you are never going to try to use it for your whole life? What about accidents, you said you changed just by bumping into someone. Don\u2019t you at least have to practice NOT changing? I mean are you never going to touch anyone ever again? Because let me tell you, that\u2019s gonna make dating a bit of a bitch\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris ran his hands through his hair and sighed. He hated to admit it, but Tom had a point. He would have to figure out how to touch people without turning into them every time, or else he was going to end up in some very awkward situations. Tom made a \u2018see, I\u2019m always right\u2019 gesture that was far more confident that he deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, you win that one...\u201d Chris said, taking a deep breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter skimming a few more stories for pointers, Chris and Tom decided on an experiment. Tom held out his hand and Chris tried to stay calm as he reached out for it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of the people on this site said that it just takes some time, kind of like, well puberty again. Like how when you are younger you can get turned on for no reason at all but then it ort of balances out as you get older and you actually have to think about sex to get worked up. So, in theory as long as I stay calm, and give it time, my body will adjust and soon enough I will have to really try in order to make the change happen. But again, these stories could just be fiction.\u201d Chris said, more to psych himself up than anything else as he reached out to touch Tom\u2019s arm. </span></div></div>",

He shuddered as he felt his body warping, rippling. It wasn\u2019t as disorienting changing into another human male, but it still sent him reeling back in his chair, overcome with vertigo for a few moments. When his vision cleared and he sat up he could tell by Tom\u2019s face that his experiment failed.

That way my mom won\u2019t keep looking for me, I can just text her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was hesitant, not wanting to have to hide in his own house, but there didn\u2019t seem to be a better plan.

He says, a little too deliberately, \"Why did you make me come all the way back here just to leave again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris rolled his eyes at the poor acting, but slipped out the kitchen door without anyone seeing him as Tom banged out the front door. Circling around the house, they met in the back lane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now we are twins walking down the street, that won't attract attention at all,\" Chris said with a sigh, \"We had better go different ways so nobody sees us together, I'll meet you at your basement door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, still annoyingly unconcerned, shrugged and headed off left while Chris walked to the right. Taking a longer way around the block, Chris made his way back to Tom's basement room on his own, trying to think. He avoided eye contact with anyone as he walked quickly, frustrated. It seemed to be taking forever to walk the short distance to his friend's house, and he wasn't looking forward to having to either hide or pretend to be Tom every time someone walked by his room. His mind wandered and he found himself distracted. Suddenly he looked up, started to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris staggered to a top, nearly bumping into the short, brunette girl in front of him. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"That was close\"</i>, He thought to himself with relief. That relief didn't last long however, as he suddenly recognized the thin, bookish girl he almost collided with. Her hazel eyes met his as he realized it was Kimberly, Tom's ex girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrection, right now she thought she was HIS ex-girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach rolled over inside of him as he tried to think how in the hell he was going to play this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, hi, Kim.\" Chris said bashfully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hi.\" She said without any enthusiasm, lips tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good, at least she doesn't want to talk.\"</i> Chris thought. \"How are you?\" He asked, not wanting to simply keep walking away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great.\" She says flatly, moving past him tersely. Chris let it happen, relief slowly creeping back in. Then, just before he could step away and keep walking, she suddenly turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was caught off guard as she slapped him in the arm. It wasn't that hard, or that angry, but it was not what he expected. Clearly Tom and Kim's breakup had not been as mutual as his friend had implied. What was more concerning is that he began to feel his skin tingle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body went cold as he realized that the stress and the contact was triggering the change again. Kim was going to see it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, in a small piece of luck, she turned and stormed off with a mutter of \"asshole.\" Under her breath. Hurrying away as well, Chris ducked behind a bush before she had a chance to look back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell to his knees as he looked down, watching as he chest puffed out, filling the loose t shirt with Kim's B cup breasts. Messy dark hair fell over his eyes as his face became narrow, petite, and a little more tanned. He watched as his hands shrunk, the nails growing a little longer. The world grew around his as he soon found himself only 5' tall. Soon he was a copy of Kim - short, thin, dark hair, wide hazel eye and, once again, female.  Adding to his disorientation, he found his eyes were not focusing on anything farther than about ten feet from his face. It clicked in his mind that Kim needed glasses, and he didn't have any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing to himself, hearing the words come out in Kimberly's tiny, high pitched voice, he checked to make sure the real Kim was gone before rushing away towards Tom's basement door, which was still a few blocks away. He nearly tripped, thrown off balance by the tiny frame and lack of body mass. It felt like one of those dreams where you just ant run fast enough to escape a monster. But soon enough he staggered up to the basement door and fell into it, trying the handle. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris wrenched the door open and fell inside, slamming it behind him and turning to face the room. What he saw was Tom's face, mouth open, gaping at him like a idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim?! what are you doing here?\" He stammered, awkwardly unsure how to react to his ex bursting into his room without warning. \"I thought you said...\" Tom's voice trailed off as he took in the oversize clothes that were hanging loosely off Chris's new body, and he recognized the outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... is it?\" Tom began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its Chris. Guess who I bumped into looking like you on the way over here. Fuck.\" Chris groaned in his feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, that's why I never walk that way, it goes by her house.\" Tom said, mostly to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris rolled his eyes, stepping into the room and crossing his arms over his chest, feeling tiny and vulnerable, though admittedly not as much as when he had been Ribbons, the dog. He pushed that memory to the back of his head and scowled at Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks for the heads up.\" He hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom couldn't help it he started to laugh. His best friend was now a clone of his ex girlfriend, and his mind was trying to separate his memories of her from the person he saw in front of him dressed in a t shirt that reached to their knees and jeans that were falling off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad you think this is funny.\" Chris began, holding up his pants in both hands to stop them from sliding down his slender legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, it's just so weird,\" Tom chuckled as she moved to his dresser. \"Here, Kim left an old pair of tights here one time, at least you wont have to hold your pants up like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you kept her tights?\" Chris asked, pointedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i mean i just forgot about them for a while and now its too awkward to give em back and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Never mind, just give me the damn things so don't have to trip over myself.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom threw Chris the leggings - simple dark grey tights that seemed impossibly small as Chris caught them. As soon as he grabbed them in both hands he felt his pants slide down, tangling around his knees as he stood there in front of his friend. tom laughed again and Chris glared as she kicked off his now-oversize jeans and adjusted the boxers that were barely clinging to his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think those are gonna fit over baggy boxers dude,\" Tom smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you aren't making this weird.\" Chris replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey just trying to help, and yeah, so I kind of always wanted to see Kim without her pants on one more time. So are you actually like, fully female down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell, so stop being a creep and so stand in the closet or something so I can put on these stupid tights!\" Chris said, probably louder than he should have considering he was technically hiding and didn't have Tom's voice anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom held out his hands in a gesture of surrender, and moved to face the closet as Chris quickly stripped off his shorts and stepped into the leggings. He paused for a second, blushing as he looked down and saw Kim' trimmed pubic hair, short and brown, over the slit of her sex. Struggling to wiggle them up, he quickly squirmed his way into the stretchy pants and straightened up. Then he blushed again as he caught a sight of his reflection on the small mirror across the room. the tights didn't really cover anything, he could still see a perfect outline of his currently perky, petite backside and the swell of his pubic mound though the flimsy fabric. Still, at least he could walk without tripping now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the t shirt he was wearing was practically a dress on him now, and he pulled it down to cover himself up so that just his legs were showing from under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom turned back around, smirking again as he said, \"Damn, that look works for you, or er, her, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was about to make another fake apology when suddenly the sound of footsteps sounded outside the door, approaching quickly. Chris froze, as did his friend. It took a second for him to realize he should probably hide again, but it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hon, do you have anything you need from the store -\" Jessica began, stopping in her tracks, \"OH!\" She then exclaimed, looking embarrassed, \"Hi Kimberly, I haven't seen you in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom,\" Tom broke in, \"We just needed to talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris decided that playing along as Kim was better than trying to explain who he really was at the moment, so he managed a weak, bashful smile at Tom's mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sorry.\" He said meekly, waving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked Chris over, and Chris followed her gaze, realizing that although the t shirt and tights was a passable outfit for Kim, the lack of bra meant that his nipples were poking out clearly though the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris quickly crossed his arms and turned away, wincing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell text me if you think of anything you need.\u201d Jessica added with a sly slime, moving to close the door as she left. \u201cnice to see you again, Kim.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the door closed Chris banged his head into the wall and groaned. Tom covered his mouth and tried not to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry she caught us like that, babe.\u201d Tom said, joking. Chris grabbed a handful of pens from the desk next to him and threw them at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!,\" Tom said as he ducked, \"At least you don't have to hide in the house anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was still embarrassed and furious, but he had to admit Tom was right - as long as he was Kimberly he could move freely around Tom's house until he could change back. At least, provided he never bumped into the real Kim somewhere.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris banged his wall against the wall a few more times as he groaned. He was about to protest when he realized that Tom was right - as Kim he could move around freely in his friends house without anyone suspecting anything. The only person he had to avoid was the real Kim, who was unlikely to show up any time soon. Considering where he was, it was actually the perfect cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris slumped down on the desk chair, chin resting on his hands. \"Fine! I'll pretend to be your god damned ex-girlfriend for now!\" Chris said as he shot a glare at his friend, \"but don't make this weird, i just need to hang here until I'm tired enough to fall asleep and change back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom gave a non-committal shrug and leaned back on his bed, trying not to make it too obvious that he was checking out the close of his ex's body that his best friend was now walking around in. Chris rolled the chair over to the edge of the bed, picking up a pair of console controllers on the way and throwing one to Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" he said, \"I need a distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later they were still shooting each virtually, and the tense competitiveness was at least keeping Chris's mind off of his predicament for the moment. As long as he focused on the game he felt normal. Without thinking he stood up between rounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta pee,\" he muttered and started to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun with that,\" Tom chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you - aw shit.\" Chris groaned again, but as far as problems go, the fact that he had to sit to pee wasn't the weirdest for him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the basement had its own dingy bathroom, so he wouldn't have to walk past Tom's family. As quickly as he could he pulled his pants down and tried not to think too hard about it as he relieved himself without a penis. Following what he had heard he quickly dabbed his new organ and stood up. As he was doing so he paused, looking down the short pubic hair and soft-looking slit beneath it. This was the first time he had had any privacy since the last switch and he realized with a flutter in his stomach he could take a good long look at his new body. After all, Kim was pretty cute and he could see whatever he wanted right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe make a quick check that the bathroom door was locked and then blushed as he pulled his pants down and off, along with the borrowed panties. He then tugged his shirt over his head and stood in front of the small, dusty mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" Chris muttered to himself as he saw the pert, petite body in front of him with its lightly tanned skin and dark, pointy nipples. He rain his hand over his smooth, thin frame as he shivered, feeling another flutter lower down in his body as he watched his reflection mirror him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He gasped, despite his effort to stay quiet, never imagining that just groping his own chest would make his body respond so well. Watching the free show in the mirror, he keeps massaging and pinching his new breasts, suppressing his sighs as he slowly begins to feet a heat building between his legs. His knees feel weak as he experiences the sensation of moisture growing in his groin as he moves one hand lower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds of exploration for Chris to locate his clit, and when he did he almost fell over, barely stopping himself from yelping as he leaned back and raised one leg.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck it,\u201d Chris said to himself as I begin teasing his finger around his newly discovered pleasure button. \u201cthis whole thing has been a nightmare so far, this time I\u2019m going to find a way to have fun.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stopped worrying and just focused on himself for the moment. His fingers soon found just the right spots to make him gasp with pleasure. He kicked down the lid on the toilet and sit down, looking down at himself as he manipulated his lithe, smooth body. Chris had to chew his lip to stop from moaning out loud as he got into a rhythm, hips moving in type with his fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity pushed him further and he moved his other hand down, rubbing a finger up and down the now-soaking pussy lips before pushing it inside himself. His head shot up and his mouth gaped open as he felt what it was like to slide something inside his snatch for the first time. He curled his fingers just like his own ex-girlfriend, Jean, had always liked. The combination was incredible and soon he started to feel a deep, growing pleasure building inside him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to shudder and kick his legs as he came as a woman, his pussy soaking his fingers with thick, slippery juices as he climaxed. He kept pushing, kept shoving his fingers deeper. His clit was soon too sensitive to keep rubbing but his other hand frantically fucked himself as his pleasure peaked and he let out a long, suppressed whimper.  </span></div></div>",

He was not sure how long he had been sitting there, trying not to make noise as he curled his fingers inside himself to tease out his second climax, but he was beginning to worry that Tom would come looking for him soon. Reluctantly he pulled his hands away from himself and stood up, knees feeling a little weak, head a little light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was what masturbating as a woman was like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing as he saw his own disheveled appearance in the mirror, she quickly started washing his hands, trying to get the smell of his body off of them as he hurried to straighten his borrowed clothes and finger-comb his hair back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath and forcing his face - or rather HER face - to look casual as he reached for the bathroom door and quickly walked back to Tom's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to act like himself, whatever that meant now, Chris flopped down across from Tom on the bed and grabbed his controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, lets do this!\" He said, still taken back by his own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shot him a quizzical look and opened his mouth to say something, then snapped it shut again as they resumed playing their game. There was a few moments of awkward silence before Chris looked back over, seeing how hard Tom was trying not to speak up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what now?\" Chris asked, pausing the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? nothing,\" Tom babbled, \"I just. You just went to the bathroom as a girl. I mean, how was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think it was, I had to sit down and had nothing to aim, what do you think?\" Chris fired back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i guess. It's just that, your not just a girl you're Kim, its a little weird thinking that you basically just watched Kim...you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, you need to shut up and stop making this weirder than it already is.\" Chris laughed, trying to cover the fact that he was now thinking about the extra time he spent alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" tom Said, embarrassed for once, looking back to the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey brushed that moment off and kept playing, starting to get back to something like casual fun while tom occasionally snuck sidelong glances as his transformed friend. Chris noticed, but didn't say anything this time - after all it must be weird sitting here hanging out with your ex who was actually your best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time as Tom flicked his eyes over, Chris followed his gaze and realized that his friends was staring at his chest. He looked down and noticed that, while his new breasts weren't that big, his nipples were standing out through the fabric of the shirt, clearly visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tom tried to look again Chris stared back at him, clearing his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Tom blurted, \"its just, I can see your tits right through that shirt. Wouldn't you be distracted?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was about to snap out a comeback but then he shrugged. Tom was right, if he was sitting next to what appeared to be a cute girl with her breasts poking through a shirt he would be staring too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch it...\" Was all he said. </span></div></div>",

His back arched and forced him to bend over as a lump pushed out from his tailbone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fearful wail that became a high-pitched squeak, he found himself looking around with the small, black eyes of a mouse. The tiny bathroom now appeared the size of a warehouse as i scurried back and forth, heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"how could this be any worse!\"</i> He squeaked to himself. He was not only a few inches tall, alone, and in a form where the whole world wanted to either kill him or eat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knocking on the bathroom door sounded like thunder, making him shriek again and dive behind the toilet as he heard Tom's voice call out, asking if he was ok.

He spots the gap under the sink where the other mouse ran to and comes to s decision,<i> \"Well that other mouse must knows what to do...Fuck it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ribbons begins to bark, Chris sprints, or rather scurries on all fours, into the dusty gap under the bathroom sink. It takes as second for his eyes to adjust, and he sees a path that leads into the walls of the basement between some cracked drywall. His tiny noise twitched as his new senses kicked in, and he could smell the other rodent somewhere nearby. It takes a few moments of sniffing and exploring before he came to a small area littered with shredded paper and smelling strongly of mice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Chris says, his word simply coming out as a tiny squeak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a low rustling behind him and he turns, seeing the white and brown body of the mouse, now eyes to eye with him. Nervous, Chris tries to figure out what the mouse equivalent of a friendly wave is as they get nearer to each other, and he then spots the three tiny infants behind the adult mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're a mother!\" she gasps, still in tiny squeaking, as he looks around nervously. \"And where is daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris can see no sign of a male mouse, for now at least. As he lets out a tiny sigh, deducing that he has once again had the luck to end up as a female animal. Well, he decides, for now he is safe. He just has to stay that way long enough to take a nap. Looking around the mouse den he groans again, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn it, if I fall asleep here ill end up stuck in the wall!\"</i> He thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted as one of the baby mice suddenly poked at his belly with its nose. Chris looked down, confused, trying to figure out what the little guy wanted. Looking over he saw its sibling latched on top their mother, nursing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously!? I'm a nursing single mom of a mouse?\" Chris whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the pleading eyes of the baby his anger softened a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not enough left to go around?\" He asked it, not that he thought it could understand him really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. Well he wasn't going to let some tiny, helpless mouse starve, he supposed.with an attitude of resigned benevolence, he awkwardly laid on his side and winced, waiting to see what would happen. He let out a little squeak as the baby latched on to one of his nipples and begin to suck. With all the other sensation he was dealing with he hadn't really noticed the pressure in his chest until the infant started revealing it. Hoping the infant's mother would appreciate this, he tried to relax a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Actually this feel kind of nice...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He shrugged it off, figuring she went to find more food. The infant that was nursing from him seemed to be satisfied and detached from Chris's nipples with a 'yeep'. Chris stretched, wondering what to do as he waited for a chance to sleep somewhere safe and get out of his current mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a lithe skittering and looked up to see the other mouse returning. At first he didn't pay any attention, but something soon started nagging at him. He wasn't sure if it was the smell, or the way the mouse moved but it suddenly clicked for him that his new companion was not the same mouse from before. He looked again, seeing that this newcomer was a little larger, and had darker fur. He began to try to speak to it as it rushed over to him. The mouse began sniffing and bumping his nose affectionately, chittering. As Chris tried to think of how to react, his eyes glanced down, confirming that this new mouse was, in fact, male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all made sense very quickly - this was the daddy to these babies, and he couldn't tell the difference between Chris and his mate. Once again that tight feeling gripped his stomach as he found himself in the role of a rodents mate and mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris turned to move away from the male, which he quickly found out was a mistake as the other mouse jumped up on his back, paws grabbing his fur. He tried to yell out, but the squeaking only seemed natural in the situation. As he staggered he found himself with his face on the ground, his backside up, and a hard prodding erection trying to find its mark on his tiny pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris let out a high-pitched whine as his new mate mounted him and pushed inside. He had never thought of mice having large equipment, but proportionally this male felt huge as he started frantically slamming his junk into Chris. There was no warm up, just a desperate need if this mouse to fuck his female. Chris struggled and kicked at first, but then slowly begin rocking his tiny hips, pushing back into the male. His body responded as a female mouse would - not needing the attention of a human, just starting to enjoy the raw sensation of being taken, claimed and fucked fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis squeaking stopped being panic and started being lust as he closed his eyes and just enjoyed the cock that was drilling him so fast it was nearly vibrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't last long, however, and soon Chris was laying on the floor catching his breath as the larger mouse pulled out of him with a small wet pop and went on about his business, ignoring his supposed mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuuck,\" Chris said in mouse talk, \"That was more fun that I expected...\"</span></div></div>",

He tries to cover his face in his hands, which only results in a embarrassingly adorable posture with his paws over his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hang on...\" Tom says, putting pieces together.

The gurgling sensation in his stomach intensified into a constant pressure. He initially tried pressing down on his stomach with his still tingling hands to stop the bloating feeling, but the effort was fruitless as he felt the paunch surrounding his stomach grow, Sitting up in the hospital bed, his unsupported breasts wobbled awkwardly beneath his gown. The same bloating feeling he felt before filled his chest and he could feel them expanding and sliding down towards his rounded belly. He gasped as the tingling sensation focused on his nipples for a few seconds before dissipating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sat stunned as the changes continued. His mind was focusing of the various cracks and creaks his bones were generating as his skeleton shrank and his flared more than the blonde's abundant form. The vinyl mattress squeaked as his ass proportionally grew to match his hips. The hospital panties struggled to contain it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" he moaned as the tingling feeling traveling through his nethers and further spreading down his legs. Layers of fat were added to his thighs followed by his arms. Finally, his face and head tingled as his face rearranged itself and his blonde hair darkened to black and slithered down his back. A final tingle zipped across his body and faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was breathing hard, but luckily he didn't pass out like last time. Chris calmed himself down until he was breathing normal, or what was now normal with two weights on his chest. Still weak, Chris was determined to see what happened to him. Chris gingerly moved to the side of the bed and headed to the room's bathroom. Switching on the lights, he looked into the mirror over the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the reflection of the mirror showed the same woman who had just his room not more than 15 minutes ago. The black hair, the almond eyes, the Indian complexion, and the two sagging breasts hidden in that sweater now hidden in a hospital gown that was a bit tighter than before. He wasn't sure if he was shorter but what would be a couple inches compared to the six he lost already. He looked to be even older, maybe around 40.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" mumbled Chris, surprised by how soft his voice was, but also the slight accent he now possessed. He lifted his breasts and felt them enveloped his small hands. They were just as large as before but were losing to time. He sighed and ran his hand across the rest of his plumper curves. He wasn't obese, but he was heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris knew if he stayed in the hospital any longer people would notice two Doctor Singhs. He had to escape the hospital as soon as possible. But how? He was still in his hospital gown and he didn't have his old clothes. But was it worth trying to get new clothes or find his stuff? Chris leaned on the sink and decided.</span></div></div>",

Worse yet, if he suddenly transformed again, he was sure he would be subject to some lab experiment. Getting his clothes back was also risky considering he had no idea where they were. A few bucks in change a now useless drivers license wasn't going to help him figure out what was happening to him. He had to get some normal looking clothes and hopefully escape without drawing attention to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris peeked through the long thin window that was part of his room's door. He could see various nurses and doctors walking about looking busy. A nurses station was stationed right outside his door with some lady moving some files around. Most importantly, he didn't see Dr. Singhs around. Pressing his luck, he confidently opened the door and walked straight out. With his eyes looking forward, he walked toward the red exit sign directing him to the elevators. In his head, he feared everyone was just staring at him wondering why the doctor suddenly changed clothes. In reality, most people were too busy with there various tasks to really care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the elevator, he pushed the down arrow, not really sure where to go next. He figured the hospital had some locker room where the staff changed into their scrubs, but he didn't know where. However, maybe it would be better to grab clothing out of a patient's room. The hospital was big and he would have a bunch of choices, but he would be more visible to others. He decided...</span></div></div>",
