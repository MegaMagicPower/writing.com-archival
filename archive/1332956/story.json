I will stop at nothing until I achieve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so I keep telling myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, I'm walking down the ever-trendy Seventh Street, which is full of eclectic shops that women just seem to love.  I figure I should have plenty of options here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I'm going to spot a pretty girl, and I'm going to go up to her and start flirting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay...gather courage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh.  Standing at the corner there...She is hot.  That is a body there.  Probably like 23 or so.  She's got long blonde hair, pretty face...nice chest...ass has such a presence...Can't see her legs under those jeans, but I'm guessing those are nice, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could stand to smile.  Maybe I'll make her smile...and maybe she'll like me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk up to her and say, not as smoothly as I'd like, \"Hi.  You are just, uh, stunning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to me and scowls.  \"You came to the wrong girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"  Wasn't expecting that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can sense what you're all about.  You just want to get laid.  You don't want to admit it to anyone, certainly not yourself, but that's all you care about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues, \"You see women as sexual objects.  But I'll make you see them in a whole different way.\"  The woman snaps her fingers.  \"Right now, until I leave this spot, no one can see us.  No one can see what I'm going to do to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she talks, she starts growing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I realize, no, I'm shrinking.  I stop at her waist, the size of a small child.  I look up at her relatively giant form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, she's tall now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends down to look me in the eye.  \"No.  Not small enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start shrinking again, and this time I don't stop until she looks incredibly huge.  Everything looks enormous.  I must be about the size of an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a bit beyond tall now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman squats over me and explains, \"Here's the deal, big guy.  Your size may be miniscule, but your voice is almost as strong as it is at full size.  Flirt with ten women, but only if you find something attractive about them beyond their body.  Just get their attention at least.  With each passing woman, you'll regain some of your size.  After the last one, you'll be back to normal.  And then I think you'll have learned something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up to her full, towering height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long, tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch as she walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this angle, she really does have a nice--And that's what got me in this in the first, so stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd do not panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmigod, I'm really really really small...What do I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo panicking!  I'm just the size of an ant in a busy part of town!  Nothing to be afraid of, no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then everything grows dark...Oh, damn, someone's about to step on me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dive out of the way, just barely having avoided being squashed by a second giant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, neither her nor the witch girl were actually giants.  I really am teeny tiny...and my only hope of returning to normal is playing her stupid game.  I certainly can't stay like this forev--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAH!  More giant shoes!  Lots of them!  A whole bunch of people are crossing the street toward me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instinctively jump up...and find myself looking at people's knees before I go crashing back down to the ground, my fall slower than I would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more jumps like that, and I'm along the side of the nearest building, out of harm's way for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it seems I have some modest leaping ability.  I can leap ankles in a single bound.  I suppose that can't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so...Calm...Stay calm...Just focus on finding an attractive woman...preferably one that won't think I'm a bug and try to squish me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to go first?</span></div></div>",

And a bunch of really big heads are blocking it anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slip in right after a middle-aged couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're greeted by a pretty young girl who's obviously working here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.  How old is she?  I can never tell how old anyone is anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm pretty sure she's like 21 or 22.  Yeah, I'm going with that.  And she's hot...a petite brunette with a nice body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...Remember the crazy magical witch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to find out more about this girl, and it won't exactly be hard to spy on her a bit at this size.  How will she even see me when I try to talk to her, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere might be magnifying glasses in the store...It's full of all random sorts of stuff.  Like that bucket of bouncy rubber balls over there...OOH!  That might be fun to jump in like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I gotta be tiny for a while, I might as well have some fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a model train up there!

It's garish, covered in vered in improbably-coloured flowers that gleam with a high-gloss finish.

I reach the height of my arc long before I near the top of the pile of balls, but that's fine; once I land on one, climbing to the top will be a piece of cake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch!  I hit the object, the vast red sphere, but I simply land hard, knocking the wind out of my lungs.  I'm scrambling desperately to cling on to the smooth surface and maintain the height I've gained, my mind wondering what the Hell happened all the while.  My weight.

Although I suppose pretty much everything will seem like the \u201clargest ever\u201d until I get my size back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo wait, I must\u2019ve been out all night. And yet I\u2019m not hungry.

Hope I don\u2019t have brain damage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, this is the teacher\u2019s desk. Those huge student desks out there are all empty, but the young teacher is seated here, typing away at her computer. Good Lord, it looks like the sort of giant clunky computer they must have built back in 1970...at least to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, I\u2019m puny, and her breasts really are not...They\u2019re quite shapely, and her face is stunningly pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember at the grocery store, she was talking so fondly of her work, which is kind of cool for her to do something she loves. So if I just start talking to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder interrupts my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, twenty-some pairs of youthful feet pouring through the door and toward their desks, the twenty-some most titanic teenage girls I\u2019ve ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a mostly good-looking group of girls, but of course they\u2019re too young for me. It\u2019s a shame, really. This situation, shrunk to micro size in an all-girls school, it would\u2019ve been heaven when I was 14...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute...Wait...I think I\u2019m having an idea. A couple of bumps on the head, and suddenly I\u2019m having a brilliant idea. Or maybe I only think it\u2019s brilliant because I just had a couple of bumps on the head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese teenagers will someday grow up into the type of beautiful, confident young women I\u2019m attracted to. These are those women in their formative years. Just think of all I can learn by hanging around them for a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not going to spy on them in the locker room or anything like that--nothing perverted, because that would be sick at my age in this place. They\u2019re kids, essentially, which frees me up to learn about the opposite gender in a totally asexual environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat teacher really is hot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, nearly asexual environment. But close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, look at that giant stapler. Looks like some crazy military super-weapon from this perspective...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really am distracted by shiny objects, aren\u2019t I? And everything\u2019s a shiny object in this brave new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, decision time: Do I spend the day eavesdropping on these young ladies in hopes of better understanding them? (I\u2019d have to make sure I keep my mostly normal-sounding mouth shut. If I\u2019m spotted, I\u2019m dead meat...not a lot of dead meat, of course, but still dead.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should I just find my way out of here ASAP and get to somewhere with more adults? After all, I\u2019ve lost a lot of time already, and I do have something resembling a life I need to get back to eventually.</span></div></div>",

You ready to tell me how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, it\u2019s weird. I ran into this feminist witch -- not a witch because she\u2019s a feminist. I mean an actual witch. She\u2019s out to teach guys a lesson, so she shrank me to the size of an ant and challenged me to meet ten women who are attractive on the inside. I get a little bigger with each one I meet. Adult women, which is why I asked if you had a big sister. Your teacher was the first. So, nine to go.\u201d Oh, dammit. Nine to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickers. \u201cYou think Miss Morrison\u2019s attractive?\u201d The snicker grows into laughter. \u201cYou should ask her out on a date. That\u2019s an image. Miss Morrison and teeny tiny you having a romantic candlelit dinner. Ha! She must look gigantic to you. I guess I look gigantic to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not small.\u201d I quickly add, \u201cTo me. Though I\u2019m sure you are. Small. To normal people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hear a new voice. \u201cBrittany? What are you doing there? Who are you talking to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speaker is...</span></div></div>",

Warmth and noise aplenty, yet time enough to collect my thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany is friendly, a solid, dependable fact.  Miss Morrison is still an unknown, and being so vulnerable at the moment I shouldn't risk everything for a small shot with a great pair of tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhaddaya know?  I'm learning my lesson already, witchy-poos.  I'm growing as a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick check shows that I'm not literally growing, and with a sigh I relax in the loose grip of this gigantic teenager and await release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand opens to deposit me on a table-top, one from the classroom, with Brittany a wall ahead of me, behind me the upturned pages of an immense paperback book.  The words are massive, but to read a line would require turning my head quite considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany smiles down at me, but her eyes flick upward again as Miss Morrison announces that it's her turn to read from the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clears her throat, a rumble passing through the cliff-face of her body, and her hands settle their tree-trunk fingers on the pages.  A loud, clear voice reads out the beginning of the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c'My Mistress had a Daughter of nine Years old, a Child of towardly Parts for her Age, very dextrous at her Needle, and skilful in dressing her Baby.'\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, great.  It's eerily appropriate reading material.  I settle down behind the book, alternately glancing up at my own Glumdalclitch and peering past her arms at her classmates.  None are even glancing in my direction, so I'm safe for the rest of the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the recitations, Miss Morrison leads a discussion on the themes raised, and I have to admit that I zone out for that.  Great work of literature or not, there's not too much thinking to do with regards to what it's about!  Still, I close my eyes and bask in the teacher's voice, imagining her speaking just to me with those delicious syllables...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany's hand lies palm uppermost beside me as the class is dismissed, the book still propped up to shade me.  Time to go, it seems.  Being carried in hand or bag doesn't seem very appealing though, being cut off from all sensory perception of the outside world.  If I'm to be stuck in an outsize world for the immediate future, I want to enjoy what I can of it!  Maybe I'll whisper a suggestion to the sweet girl...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd like to be in the open air, if possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face is bemused, but still she raises her hand up high, and I scamper onto the thick cloth covering her, nestling down far away from the thick hair that could easily whip me from my place with an ill-considered head turn.  \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rises from her seat, and I'm surprised how easily I keep my balance.  I remember not to look down, and instead turn my gaze upward, but her not-inconsiderable neck blocks a lot of my view.  Instead I can scan the other teen giantesses, ambulatory skyscrapers that stride about with a terrifying grace and speed.  Beyond them all, Miss Morrison...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I shan't look at her again.  I'll just sit her on a shoulder, think small thoughts, and hope no one sees me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe pass through immense corridors, familiar in theory yet alien in reality, so outsize.  Monstrous forms pass by so quickly that I can barely register them, and beneath me my platform rises and falls in time with a thunderous tread...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany steps out into sunlight, and the wider world rises some small amount of agoraphobia, I admit.  A vast landscape, with distant figures of giants and their vehicles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's hand comes up toward me again, and I start from my place.  But it carries on past, sweeping aside her hair (I knew it was a good idea to keep clear of that safety hazard) to display a cave of an ear.  The hand drops again, then rises with a cellphone, clamping it to the ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow's that?\u201d Brittany says brightly.  \u201cNow we can talk without me looking crazy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still have to whisper, though,\u201d I whisper, as amazed as ever that my tiny voice can carry to the behemoth beneath me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's fine!  Anyway, I'm gonna walk home now, and once we get there we can decide how we'll go about curing you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you again for doing this.  You didn't have to save me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, it's not as if it's a lot of effort to carry you about, bug-boy!  Just make sure you hold on tight down there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do.  If she's walking home from school, I know that the journey can't be too far, but I still dig myself in for the long haul.  The fibres of her top are like cables, and I almost begin crying when I discover how feeble I am now, unable to lift or bend a thread.  It's almost enough to make me forget to watch the world around me, and I'm distracted by my own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts about Brittany's quick exit.  She is walking home alone, and didn't pause to say goodbye to anyone at the school gates.  Does she have no friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my mouth to ask about that, but then see the oncoming woman.  I can glimpse her far enough away that I can see more of her body, loose top and shorts perfect for jogging, sunglasses and headband keeping her dark hair swept back.  A light sheen covers what skin I can see, and that only highlights her perfectly shaped musculature...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approaches even faster than the walkers, and as she grows in my vision I am reminded how pathetic I am now in comparison to these beautiful women.  Utterly pathetic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany's smaller too, as I'm left with a magnificent view of a giant chest as the jogger stops before the girl, who similarly ceases her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlone again, Brittany?  If you want, I could keep you company?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, that's okay, Miss Dunlow...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many times have I got to tell you that's it's just Mel?  I'm not an old woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey know each other!  And this Mel seems like a nice, friendly person (with a fantastic rack, although I'm not thinking about it as I watch its movement from every utterance form her mouth ohGodIcan't lookaway...).  Maybe I should give her a compliment, see if I grow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that may complicate matters, giving my position away this early, before Brittany's even gotten home...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They shrink as well, as my size doubles, taking me to a mighty inch tall!  I'm sure that Mel is going to speak, but then I'm knocked from my feet as Brittany speeds up, moving to a jog this time.  She's faster and I've got a lot more mass to care for, so I'm sprawling, clutching for any support I can on her tough outer garment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Miss \u2013 Mel!  Gotta go!\u201d the girl says as she takes off.  Despite the tremendous velocity she's managing, she still finds the breath to add \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d once we're out of the woman's earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I reply, finally hooking myself down securely, and looking up to see strands of hair whipping out past me.  \u201cI've got to get myself back to normal, and I'll take any help I can get!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I understand that,\u201d she says, slowing after a little while, \u201cbut you can't just go blurting this out to anyone!  Everything's crazy enough as it is..!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I'm sorry -\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany turns to look at me, her Rushmore face effortlessly pivoting into view and her eyes glancing down a long nose at my tiny self.  \u201cNext time, check with me first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY- yes,\u201d I manage, embarrassed as much as terrified by the teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe enter her house after not too long, Brittany opening the immense front door with her own key, and sparing only a quick \u201cMom, Dad, I'm home!\u201d  before dashing up the stairs to her room.  It's another bumpy ride, and she slides her door closed behind her not a moment too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl crouches before what I take to be her desk, and I jump to its wooden surface when it sinks level.  Leaning against a pencil-pot for balance, I catch my breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay here, okay?\u201d she says, looming over me and reaching past for a light switch.  \u201cI'll bring some food up when I get the chance, but you've got to stay out of sight!  Mom and Dad can't see you, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't wait for an answer before striding across to the door and wrenching it open again.  Then she's gone, leaving me standing in a spotlight from her desk-lamp, the rest of the cavernous room in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying here is the safe choice.  But if she has a mother, and that woman is as kind as the daughter she's raised, that would be another step on my recovery plan.  I reckon it shouldn't be too difficult to jump down from the desk, and I can get out into the house proper through that crack under the door.   What could possibly go wrong?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All these gigantic artifacts, each wondrous in its own way yet beneath the notice of any regular person.  I admire the wood graining in a pencil, drag a foot through a patch of dust at the very back of the desk, and practice jumping up toward the lamp light, as if trying to catch the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are pluses to my condition, but I'll still be happy to look down on all of this again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been hours that passed before the door opens again, Brittany silhouetted against the landing light.  She casually strikes on the main light before walking across to me, opening a fist to reveal a meagre spread of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeagre to her maybe, a feast to little ol' me.  There's a biscuit, a bottlecap of water \u2013 more a bath to me than a drink! - and some objects that it takes me a while to recognise as scraps of meat, potato, some greenery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tuck in as Brittany beams down at me from above, but the texture of the meat fibres is too tough for my miniscule teeth to chew, the liquid clogs my throat in great drops as I try to swallow it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sees this, the girl lifts the biscuit in one hand and crushes it, a mighty show of strength that reduces it to crumbs, raining down before me like boulders.  Then the palm slams down to grind them down even further, and soon the dust is small enough for even me to bite and chew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushes her hand off casually, as if it wasn't a great feat to annihilate something bigger than a car.  I'm too absorbed in sating my hunger to watch what she's doing, but that hand returns with a cloud clutched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cotton wool soaks up the water, and I can comfortably suck from it to quench my thirst.

You just stay here in my room, and come Saturday we'll head out to find some women for you, get you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a sound enough plan, and less than a day in my condition has already seen me almost die so many times...  \"Good night,\" I agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light goes out, and I'm left all alone, with a giant teenager wrapped up soundly in her city-sized bed across the room.

I'm unsure, but I know that the calm is only broken by a monstrous roar, accompanied by the plodding footsteps of the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds a dragon by her side, a hungry vacuum that desires nothing more than to devour me and all else at my level.  It's a methodical approach that she takes, ensuring that no corner of her country carpet goes unscoured, and that gives me time to think.  I'm far from trapped; I can always head back to the stairs and leap up if I ever really got into danger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, calm and collected, I turn my attention to watching the magnificent sight of a woman pushing a titanic machine back and forth.  Here's the encounter to enjoy!  Not dull, immobile scenery, but an otherwise mundane act seen as an act of God, on a scale impossible for a normal man to see.  Humility, awe and excitement, all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's covered half the room before I think to back off, a leisurely pace afforded by her slow sweep of the area.  Methodical.  That's a praiseworthy trait, right?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen comes a ring of the doorbell, and the vacuum ceases its ravenous drone.  I duck for cover beneath the overhang of the immense sofa as the woman scurries to the front of the house, smashing through the area where I was standing but moments before.  I think better of stepping out after she's passed, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a buzz of conversation after the door is wrenched open, one voice familiar as it apologises for being late.  \"Oh, I just caught up on a little cleaning, no bother really,\" Brittany's mother says.  \"Just be careful to remove your shoes before entering, if you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGee, what a pompous way to phrase that!  And it's not as if she removed her own footwear before stepping in!  Curiosity betters me, and I peer out just enough to make out the immense trainers deposited in the doorway, socked feet striding into the living room.  Oh, so much more hygenic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea will be fine, thank you,\" the newcomer continues, and as she plops her several-tonne self into the seat above me - straining the ceiling, it seems to the little man beneath her - I put my finger on who it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel Dunlow, that jogger that Brittany met on the way home from school yesterday.  She gifted me my second growth spurt, the kind soul!  Judging from the stench her socks are even now spreading into the under-sofa area, she's been jogging again this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two converse, and hearing the talk gets me a better picture of Brittany's mother.  I can't hear very much, of course; my own voice speaks at normal volume, without deafening me, so I reckon that witch must have dulled my hearing as much as she amplified my vocal chords.  So through the sofa those voices are very muffled, even though they come from towering giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut anyway, Brittany's mother: very uptight, it seems.  Set in her prim and proper ways, and very suspicious of any odd activity that her daughter may be getting up to.  Mel almost mentions her encounter with me, but swerves aside at the last moment, no doubt worried over how crazy that might sound.  She grows in my estimation, even as I watch her immense heels slide every now and then, gently crushing carpet fibres with casual motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could crawl out from under here to get a better handle on what exactly's being said, although sitting out in the open offers more opportunity of me being spotted, which carries obvious risk.  There's little point to sticking around otherwise, as once the mumbled talking is over, it'll be straight back to avoiding a vacuum cleaner.  Perhaps I should just head back upstairs, take another peek around?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No looking back, as that's just asking for trouble; either I'll be noticed or I won't, where I've set my gaze will make no difference to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a nice surprise to make it to the foot of the stairs unmolested, and I look up at the mountain.  Did I really descend those fearsome steps?  Each one is taller than a two-storey house!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA run up, then.  A few inches and a leap, and even then I hit solidly against the wall of the first stair, driving the breath from me.  I scrabble at the lip, pulling myself up with only a minimum of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I have to do that several more times, with less of a run up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how long that took, and I don't count the bruises, neither.  My super-jump has limits, but it's pure triumph that flows through me after having made it back up to the landing.  Heh, when Brittany gets home, she'll never know that I ever left her room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices pass into earshot, and I cast an eye downward to see Mel and Brittany's mother walk into view, approaching the front door as the former looks ready to leave.  She kneels to put her shoes back on, and I can marvel again at her simple beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a good look I got yesterday, but from a higher, more distant vantage point I can take in the whole package.  Mel's face is as beautiful as I remember it, and matched to an equally attractive body.  Her breasts are modest, but that's only to be expected on such a perfectly athletic frame; all that jogging must be paying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch said that I should pay more attention to a woman's personality than her appearance, but Mel has both.  That easy smile, that casual politeness!  Why, when I'm full size again, I should definitely find this area, meet her on a jog, get to talking and maybe something more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's tied her laces and risen to leave, her every movement a delight, I turn my attention to Brittany's mother.  For someone with a teenage daughter, she's not too hard on the eyes.  How much of that is down to cosmetics I couldn't say, but with her carefully coiffeured blonde hair and immaculate blue suit dress I'd wager on it being quite a bit.  She's all smiles and friendliness to her guest, but as soon as that door is closed her expression sours, and I'm glad I'm not an insect near her ready to be crushed.  No good heart, her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman strides away, and not too long after the vacuum cleaner starts up again.  Well, time to explore again.  Should I try a mystery room, or - since time is of the essence - return to Brittany's bedroom?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So I squeeze under Brittany's door, back among the familiar clutter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes are of no interest - the dried sweat smell clinging to some of it is enough to compel me to keep my distance - so I head on over to examining a selection of artwork.  What would otherwise be little doodles are blown up to art gallery billboards, so a greater appreciation is possible for one of my shrunken stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's gruesome subject matter, with zombies featured prominently in the figures depicted.  Yet for all their horror, they stand amidst scenes of tranquility, landscapes painted with delicate care, brushstrokes that I myself find fiddly.  A casual glance would see only the monster, and not the art around it; these are pictures that reward attention, and careful viewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd view them I do, even if it is quite the feat to turn the pages of a sketchbook five times as wide as I am tall.  So it takes time.  I lose track of it, panicking as the door opens.  Is Brittany back already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, the towering frame crossing into the room is her mother, delicately stomping her way around the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting,\" she says.  \"Why can that girl never tidy up after herself in a lady-like fashion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half-hearted attempt is made to pick up some pieces of clothing, elegantly manicured fingers that could peel a car open pinching up discarded socks and t-shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she happens upon the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've already distanced myself by this point, scurrying for the bed rather than remain in the open.  The book is held at arm's length, and I can imagine the nose wrinkling in disgust as the words escape:  \"This is what she spends her time with?  I'm going to have to have words with that girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems that this discovery has turned the woman's mind away from tidying her daughter's room, and she turns on her heel to leave, the door closing behind her with a neat 'click'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait minutes more, just to be safe, before stepping into the light once more.  The landscape has changed, even the few alterations made by that woman rendering the room's floor a whole new world.  Getting my bearings back again takes a little more time - how dependant on the whims of the overworld is the life of an inch-tall man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping up the chair to the desk-top is more exerting even than the stair-climb, and I sit panting, knowing that is my life were a movie, Brittany would walk in at exactly this moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One motion of her powerful arm casts her school bag across the room, its unthinkable weight crashing down onto her bed.  \"Miss me?\" she grins, sitting on her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beams down, and I gladly skip into her palm as she offers it, lifting me to her face for a closer view.  \"My day was very exciting, thank you, and tomorrow you can share in my good fortune!  I hope things weren't too boring around here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles, perhaps too loudly, and the reply comes from the doorway, in the voice of her mother: \"No, things weren't boring around here at all.  I found some very interesting items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany stands bolt upright, myself rolling in her palm as her arm lowers and she faces her mother.  I stare up at the gulf between the two giants, realising that with her heels, the older woman only just matches her daughter's height.  She's still hundreds of feet taller than myself, of course, but the height disparity may account for some of the vehemence she shows as she waves that sketch-book before Brittany's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you spend your time doing?\" she thunders.  \"Drawing such obscene images as these!  What are you thinking?  No lady of quality would come up with such horrors!  Are you doing this to embarrass me, is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany stands strong in the face of such words, but the hand on which I'm standing trembles at the indignity.  The angle I've got isn't the best, but I swear I can see the malicious glee in the mother's eye, an expression that I'd just love to wipe off her smug, giant face...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should support her in what she chooses to do, not judge her!\"  I'm getting into the swing of this now, but a thrill of fear courses down me as the woman tilts her head, my view of her chin's underside replaced with a massive, gaping mouth as she reels under my tirade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... should be ashamed!\" I lamely finish, awaiting punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't come.  Instead, the woman almost instantly turns from me, her own voice shrieking.  \"Really?  You take her side over this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man's voice - Brittany's father, if I recall this morning well enough - replies.  \"Um, no?  Or yes?  It'd help if you caught me up with what it is you two are talking about.  This isn;t exactly how I best like to be greeted after a hard day at work, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is more discussion from the parents as they leave the room - \"this isn't over, young lady!\" the mother leaves as parting words - and I'm brought back before Brittany's face.  There are tears in those big eyes of hers, but teeth show in a smile directed at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the bravest thing I've ever seen!  She could have killed you just then, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.  No way anyone gets to go around saying things like that!  And I've got to build up my confidence for talking to the larger ladies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany giggles.  \"Well, I guess that I almost owe you one now!  Shame you didn't have anything nice to say about Mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that...  Anyway, what was that news you wanted to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my friend Scarlett is back in school again, and invited me for a sleepover tomorrow night!  It's an excuse to get out of this prison for a night, and after I told her about you, she was thrilled to help!  We can both take you out on the weekend to find some women, get you back to normal in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!  Does that mean I'll be tagging along with you to school tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so be prepared for another exciting day in the bag!\" Brittany smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening passes in quiet conversation, Brittany's father making a brief appearance to offer a plate of food apologetically, explaining that maybe her mother will have calmed down by the next day, and it may be for the best if the girl stay in her room.  As I listen from behind a gigantic stuffed platypus, I think over how much more reasonable this parent seems!  He comforts his daughter, encourages her upon being shown her artwork, and is all around pretty cool.  I tell Brittany as much once he's gone and she reclines next to me on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess one out of two ain't bad.  Now, you rest up,\" she says, plucking me from my perch and placing me back on the desk, \"because it's a big day tomorrow.  Scarlett can be... a little intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI settle down to sleep with my imagination going wild about what sort of person this other teenage girl is, the thoughts enough to distract me from the noises of the giant night world and bring me a restful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I oversleep again, and Brittany has a piece of toast clamped in her mouth as she shrugs her coat on.  Seeing my eyes open, she places the food before me and inclines her head toward the open mouth of her rucksack on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've already begun tearing at the rock-like bread before I look up to see the cavernous interior of the bag.  \u201cJoking, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.  After your little stunt on the way home, you're riding with me out of sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I argue the case, I wonder?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then I'm wrenched into the air, praying that this girl knows not to squeeze too tight as the rest of a hand joins in forming a fist around me.  My head peeks from the top, and given my two-inch height I'm pleased to feel my feet settle atop the pinky finger as it closes off beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world goes past in a blur, but I can see the bare legs of the girl that scared Anna away, then I pass beyond her shorts to the light blouse and up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I get bigger, I can get a better handle on faces.  I don't have to pan my eyes around quite so much to get the whole view, and expressions come into focus that much easier.

While delicate, I accrue a few bruises before ending up in her palm, looking up at a smile I can only describe as smarmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo..\" she begins, taking a breath.  \"His name's Jim Harrison and he has the sweetest eyes!  He's captain of their soccer team, and we can see them practicing on days when -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, enough.  How am I meant to find this kid?  It'll take me days to search a school, even if I don;t get stepped on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Scarlett offers, looking away, \"I <i>may</i> know his schedule off-by-heart, and know that he's due for French next.  That's in room twelve on the ground floor, bee-tee-double-yoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh.  \"So I get inside this school, track down this Jimmy -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim, and then wh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasp as Scarlett hurriedly tips her hand, dropping me into Brittany's waiting embrace.  I share a look with my original rescuer, and smile as she mimes a crazy face.  \"You're not quite so enamoured of Jim Harrison then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore her,\" Scarlett says.  \"She thinks I can't see her looking at Will Terrence, and he's gross.  Now, hold still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose last words shock me, but not as much ad Scarlett's fingers squeezing my sides again, but this time one of them prying at my trousers.  \"Hey!\" I shout, struggling to look behind me.  Then a hard,cold feeling down my back as something is tucked into my pants.  \"My phone number,\" she explains, patting me on the head.  \"Just make sure that Jim gets it, 'kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it's in place, Scarlett lifts me from Brittany's hand and wastes no time in beginning to walk.  With my own feet dangling in mid-air, I can't help but look downward, watching the girl's immense, sandal-clad feet stomping across the tarmac.  In seconds, she's striding onto dirt, stopping before the metal fence that separates the girls from the boys.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her left foot goes into overdrive, pawing-at and gouging the earth, heaping a mound of soil.  Then Scarlett descends, knees bending to bring the ground up close.  Her pinch releases, allowing air into me again as I touch down on my own two feet.  Here, closer to, the mound that those monstrous feet kicked up is huge, and the hole is big enough for someone of my scale to scramble underneath the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to see Scarlett standing up to her full height, waving a hand forward to urge me on.  Brittany stomps up to join her, and the two girls explain themselves to me in one line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember: room twelve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll stop by here when we can through the day, to wait for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they have to get inside now that the bell has gone, and I can't waste any time myself.  I spare a wave before venturing into the under-tunnel, scuffing through the dirt and scratching at the massive slip of paper at my back.  Once into the sun again, I can see the departing form of black-uniformed giants, the boys heading inside with a haste just as lacking as that of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I need to run after them if I'm going to get into that school building before the door closes in my face!  Throwing a few leaps in with the spurts of sprinting, I keep myself at their heels, and duck inside moments before the monolithic portal crushes closed in my wake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause to catch my breath as the giants crush on their way.  What a miracle that none of them spotted me!  Once their forms have receded somewhat down the corridor, I can walk on, looking around to see any landmarks.  And indeed, room numbers are visible high up on the receded wooden surfaces sprinkled amongst the sheer walls.  Number twelve will be a way on in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a trek through the hallways, an asexual environment as much as the girls school was.  Okay, maybe the future potential of the female form had me a teensy bit distracted, but it's odd that my day of trying to pick up chicks has left me sheltered away from any women!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost laughing, I turn a corner to find myself proved wrong.  She's wearing a trouser suit, so her body is concealed from my sight, but with just her face revealed, killer cheekbones and an easy smile surrounded by blonde hair, my giggle turns into an awed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an all-boys school, a woman of this quality must be treated as a goddess.  To me, she is one in physicality as well as beauty, and I nearly fall to my knees.  Is she a teacher here?  No reason I shouldn't stop off to talk with her and get a little height in this desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I really owe Scarlett and Brittany anything?</span></div></div>",

What are names coming to these days?  I feel old just thinking that...).  The bulk shields me somewhat from the chatter of their classmates and teacher, and I can hear slightly better, funneled from directly above, their own conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gist appears to be Scarlett trying to convince Brittany of all the awesome things they can do with me - to me - now that they have me.  Not thinking of me as a person, but as a thing, an object to be used!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany refuses her, laughing off the wilder ideas and telling her friend that she was going to help me.  Yeah, that's showing her!  I walk over to those giant toes, wagging a finger dramatically.  Why, if I were my real size, she'd never think of doing such things to me!  Who is she to talk that way about me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Scarlett moves her foot casually, smashing into me with horrific force to send me tumbling head over heels.

With a heavy heart (for a two-inch tall dude, at any rate) I edge around the feet and back to the wall of Brittany's bag, and put my all into climbing it.

Just a little nap, I think to myself, that's all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's jostling that wakes me, and motion, as of the bag around me being jolted in an unnatural manner.

As I emerge into the light, I can see the speaker clearly, a stooping girl whose smiling visage is looking around as one of her hands reaches toward the bag.  To one side, Brittany is clambering to her feet, still a little woozy, not really paying attention - a perfect chance for this stranger to snatch me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your stinking hands to yourself!\" I shout up at the smirking teenager, and she seems quite taken aback, stumbling slightly into another towering form, one that I recognise as Anna.  \"Are you all right, Brittany?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend smiles as she swoops back into my field of vision, effortlessly lifting the hangar-sized bag onto her shoulder and scooping me up in her free hand.  There are no words as she places me on her shoulder again, but Scarlett whispers as she moves to her side: \"lunch time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining hall is the biggest room I've been to yet, and being carried at shoulder height doesn't diminish its epic proportions, with hundred-foot tall schoolgirls of various ages queueing for food and settling down at tables to talk and eat.  Scarlett sidles ahead of us and grabs a tray, and I take the chance to whisper to Brittany:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is safe?  I feel awfully exposed up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the trick they pulled in the corridor back there, I'm not taking any more chances with their light fingers.  Just don't fall off and stay quiet.  If you're lucky, there'll be enough grub at the edge of my plate for you to eat too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up too late to see if she was smiling at that last comment, but there's a bigger distraction: laid out before me, steaming away behind sheer walls of glass are swimming pools of food, all major food groups covered and in such quantity that I'd never finish them in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming over it all is a smiling woman in a dinner lady uniform; unlike all the staff at the school where I grew up, she's fairly trim, if a little old for my tastes.  But she's smiling a big smile, with big teeth, and happily chatting away with the girls as they approach to order their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe deserves a compliment, just as I deserve a size boost...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Half again!  Three inches?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner lady has seen me all right, her gigantic eyes widening even more behind the magnifying lenses of her glasses, but Brittany is already moving on, the next kid in line ordering food, and I'm in the clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty risky tactic,\" Brittany confides as she sits, leaning awkwardly at first so that I may scamper down her arm to the the table top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the tray hits, and while Brittany is of course careful enough to keep it from crushing me, I still jump backwards at the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett's tray is already on the table, and my recoiling brings me closer to it.  I watch the outsize food and juicebox for a few moments before a second incredible impact thuds down to my left, and I jump again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my eyes consent to opening, I find myself looking at the meaty mass of Scarlett's fist, having smashed down next to me.  It's pretty hefty, each individual finger probably weighing more than my entire body, that ring too big to even serve as a hula hoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't kidding,\" Scarlett's voice mumbles from above through a mouthful of food.  \"Look how much he's grown compared to my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up to her, mind already composing some caution against nearly crushing me, when her fist becomes a hand, thumb and forefinger effortlessly plucking me up by the waist and lifting me upwards, the second hand hovering a fork in front of her face, slathered in steaming goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyself, I can't look away from those vast eyes as they sweep over my body, squinting as the giant girl examines her tiny catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you can almost make out a face now,\" she grunts.  \"He's pretty cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't say any more as her lips part to allow the fork to deposit its cargo, and I am absorbed less by her eyes and more by the mouth as it chews over the week's worth of food in one bite, squelching and crunching speaking of the unseen havoc being inflicted behind that face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's awe, but something else, as the heat and gushing pulse in that thumb sitting over my crotch invite unwelcome feeling, and I'm blushing as much at that as I am the 'cute' comment.  Scarlett seemingly doesn't notice, bored green eyes continuing to take the angles of my head as her jaw pulverises its way through the first step of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany saves me:  \"Put him down!\" she says.  \"Don't draw even more attention to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, little guy,\" Scarlett smiles, meaty breath and a few tiny pieces gushing forth as she lowers me to the table, unpinching me and letting me stand on my own two legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany has prepared for me already, and the tiny dollop of sauce and a pea the size of my head that she has dropped to the table is more than enough to sustain me.  \"Careful, Scar,\" she says, \"it's bad enough that he's making a big scene without you helping him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, just checking him out a little before inviting him along to the slumber party.  Can't have you bringing strange boys along, Brit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talk sweet nothings above me, and I'm too busy tearing into the tough, giant food to pay much attention.  There's another voice that cuts in, unfamiliar and cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is that thing?  Let's have a look, girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up to see yet another humungous teenage girl smiling down at me, teeth bright against her dark skin.  Her tray is empty, and so is the hand that reaches for me, fingers outstretched as if to blot out the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany's refusal is cut off as her hand envelops me, albeit not as fully as in previous instances, my feet jutting out as my face is smothered within her rock-hard palm.  I only gasp for a few moments before I'm released, back into the darkness of the grimly familiar bag of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like I'm drawing a little too much interest, huh?  Small comfort in knowing that my tiny body is quite tantalising for teenage girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess I'll just sit here nice and quiet until school's over, or just nap that meal away?  That's what she expects of me!   Haven't I been cooped up too long already, though?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I busy myself, examining the objects within the bag new now that I've grown half my height again since my last encounter with them, but it doesn't excite the mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world shifts and rumbles as Brittany transports me with her, but the peeks at her face against the harsh light of the outside world are few and far between.  Only once does she pause to whisper to me - \"I know this is tough, but hang on.  Gym class next, you can stretch your legs there.\" - not even waiting for an answer before once again lifting free a colossal book with practiced ease.  She watches me at the conclusion of each class, carefully avoiding crushing me as she places items back, but that's hardly comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a frustrating few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay put for now,\" Brittany advises as she opens the bag at the start of gym class, \"it'll take a few minutes for all the girls to get ready.  And be sure to get back in before we get back, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't even have time to nod before her head withdraws from the sky, and I listen to the muted chatter of girls readying themselves for sports.

The climb is refreshing, and as I crest the bag I notice Brittany across the room, standing in a doorway.  She smiles and gives both thumbs up before departing, off to exercise those titanic muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around at the benches, lockers and discarded bags and clothing of this world, wondering where first to begin my journey.  I'm not even limited by this room, if I put my mind to it!  If I ever wanted to cut my ties to Brittany, now would be the ideal time for some unsupervised rebellion!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once freed from its prison, the foot's build-up of sweat from the hour or so of sporty exertion is also released, and the odour hits me full on.  I can only begin to gag, but once that foot frees its partner in crime, I'm actively coughing and struggling to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like some guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I realise, as the feet move away and a face slides into view at a right angle, my voice is full-sized!  Even my coughs are loud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to run, but the girl's arm snaps out at me, finger and thumb painfully clamping down on my rearmost leg, pulling me up and away, whipping me out into the open air as she stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm dangled upside down in front of her face, agony in  my ankle and vertigo in my head.  It's that same girl from the lunch room, and she's smiling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this little perv!  What does he think he's doing in here, huh girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spin gently as she waves me, and I get flashes of other giant faces, shock and laughter warring on them as much as my stomach is demanding to return its contents.  That one there, could it be Brittany?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him here, Drea!\" she shouts.  \"He's not a toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't see much as I'm flipped into the air, spinning end over end and definitely losing at least some of my lunch before Drea's other hand clamps tight around me, a new crushing pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy imagination is the only record of the conflict outside my fleshy prison, gigantic female teenagers warring over me with blows that could shatter mountains.  I cannot see, can feel only pressure and taste only sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrea's hand opens in time, and I roll out onto the floor to see the girl and Brittany both on their knees, disheveled, breathing heavily.  Can I stand? I wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you girls doing?\"  A more mature voice, distant, getting closer.  Large running shoes crash into my field of vision between the fallen juggernauts, supporting the bare, shapely legs of a full-grown woman.  The gym teacher?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The headmistress' office immediately, both of you!\"  Maybe it's the dizziness speaking, but she sounds hot.  And well worthy of a compliment.  I stand unsteadily, raising a finger as I clear my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fighting over a doll?  What were you thinking?\"  The teacher stoops to snatch me up, a sudden impact knocking me flat unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy last thought: am I going to see the principal too, or is this woman taking me for herself?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A quick peek shows that no one's watching me, and the chatter of the girls above me is all about the homework that they're going to ignore this weekend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step out into the world, the feet of each girl either side.  They're still big, but much smaller than previously.  I wouldn't want to take a kick from Scarlett, but not too long now before I'll be able to look down on those monstrous toes as merely tiny piggies.  Just five more women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I stroll under the bus seat, leaving the girls behind.  They'll keep.  Wherever will I find a sweet young woman to impress right now?  I peek out from under the seat at each bus passenger as I go, delighted to find that this is a public vehicle, not a schoolbus.  Adults, not just kids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few are men, and I scramble past their feet quickly enough, eventually finding a delightful pair of what I assume are 'designer' shoes, all angles and buckles, tapering to skinny jeans along some killer legs.  The woman they belong to is chatting away carelessly on her 'phone, loudly enough for me to hear at her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" she says, her voice a delightful, amused trill, \"I definitely managed to get it!  Spending a week searching would be wasted if I'd just given up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersistent...  Is that admirable enough to trigger a growth?  I'll listen on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you've said before.  But the look on her face?  C'mon!  First time in fifty years...  Gram'll be blown away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh.  Going to a lot of effort to do something special for her grandmother!  I don't know what it is - and I myself am not so caring as to even speculate - but it's the thought that counts.  It's one that deserves recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So selfless of you to take so much of your own time to help another!\" I say, hands boldly on hips as I grow, doubling in height - is this my first full foot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo other full feet - in such nice, designer shoes, press down harder onto the floor.  \"One sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman leans forward, pushing back the hood of her red sweatshirt to allow long, luxurious black hair to cascade down along with her eyes.  \"Yeah, little guy?  And what's it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh.  A little aggressive maybe, but it must be quite a shock to see a foot-tall man at your feet.  Um, I should probably apologise.  Or maybe just skedaddle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she returns to her conversation, and I scuttle past the passengers again, I reflect on the lesson of the day; just because someone seems nice when you first meet them, it doesn't mean they're like that all the time!  Are you seeing this, witch?  Are you seeing me learn as I grow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand grabs me around the waist, hoisting me into the air awkwardly.  \"Have you been talking to strange women again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my darling Brittany,\" I return, folding my arms over the knuckle of her heavy thumb, \"why ever would you suspect me of such a misdemeanour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.  Could it be because you've somehow become too big for me to properly hold in one hand?\"  To reinforce this, a second comes up under me to support my legs, allowing me to settle my weight better.  \"Oh, maybe I'm shrinking!  Wouldn't that be terrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give him such a hard time,\" Scarlett smiles, with a wink directed at me, \"good on him for getting out there and meeting people!  Something some other people could learn to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, it's dangerous, and it's back in the bag you go,\" Brittany decrees, and I can do little but splutter as the slightly-less-giant girl tumbles me again.  I'm noticing a pattern here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag is getting more cramped every time I get dumped back here, even without no further contents being added.  Still boring though, and I instead reflect on those recent faces of anger, humour and worry that I have seen, reflecting on the different emotions I myself have evoked in others.  One little dude can make quite the difference.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes any of this help me with my original predicament, though?  Will I be any better at scoring with chicks once I'm full size again?  Is chicks considered an offensive term?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus journey is quicker than I'd dreaded, and it seems that Scarlett's abode isn't too far from the last stop.  I gleefully jump from musky interior to carpeted floor once Brittany opens the bag wide enough for me to escape, and I grin up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself at home,\" Scarlett says, casually striding past me.  \"I'm gonna order us some pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm a long way past that time where a mis-placed foot could simply crush me underheel, but even a glancing kick from a thirty-foot woman is going to hurt like Hell, so as I jump to one side I shout out: \"Hey!  Watch where you're going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany stoops, grasping me by my sides, thumbs hooking over my shoulders as she air-lifts me onto the safety of a couch.  \"Just sit here for a bit, then.  And try to relax; nothing can hurt you here!  I'll protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, with a teenage girl looking out for me, what could go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany gives me a glare over her shoulder as she leaves the room.  \"Whatever.  Just sit tight, and we'll be back in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I take the time to walk up and down the couch a few times, stretching new, longer legs.  The decor of this room is quite different from that of Brittany's house, far less studiously organised, for one thing!  There are clothes draped over an ironing board in one corner, a number of unwashed plates scattered over the floor - either Scarlett's whole family is rather messy, or she's been left to her own devices for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls return, clearly ready for a sleepover.  Brittany is wearing fairly amorphous pyjamas, striped blue, and Scarlett is clad in an outsize man's shorts and t-shirt, some obscure cartoon character winking at me from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think we've forgotten you,\" the latter laughs, her hand shooting forward and a bundle striking me in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't fall, which clues me in to it being pretty light, and I unbundle the doll's size pyjamas.  \"If you're going to be here, you have to look the part as well, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I'm not going to deny these two girls for fear of them forcibly dressing me, but no way I'm taking off what I'm currently wearing.  It's grown with me so far, (magic, I guess) and that property might not pass on to other garments.  So, as a compromise, I layer the pyjamas on top of my (somewhat raggedy) regular clothing.  I gesture up at Scarlett once I'm done, only to behold an incoming ass, descending rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scooch up a little, give me some room!\" Scarlett laughs as she impacts, dust thrown up as she sits, causing me to cough violently.  Brittany scoops me up moments later, cradling me almost as a doll in her lap as she sits cross-legged.  \"She's just kidding, you know.  That's what happens at slumber parties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I haven't been to many of those, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fun!\" Scarlett laughs.  \"My sister trusts me here, and we're totally free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your parents..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laugh dies on the giant's face, and Brittany quickly raises me to her own face, her voice a thundering whisper.  \"No parents.  We don't talk about that.  She lives with her older sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seriousness on that great face shuts me up, and I am lowered once more to the lap, sitting amongst leg ramparts with a comforting hand to recline against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  Girly stuff tonight, and tomorrow we take you out to pick-up chicks!\" Scarlett's mood returns almost casually.  \"Or have them pick you up, I guess.  Maybe throw you around a little?  We could do that tonight, in lieu of the traditional pillow fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smile doesn't convince me that she's kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez!  Relazx!\"  A hand moved forward, ruffles my hair roughly.  \"Tonight, you're one of the girls.  At least act like you enjoy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight is gonna be a blast!\" I manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\"  A doorbell.  \"That'll be the pizzas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett leaps bodily to her feet, and dashes for the door, and I'm tempted to follow, to see this pizza delivery person - perhaps even a delivery WOMAN.  But that would require prying myself free from Brittany's embrace, and that would hurt her feelings.  I don't care about those though, do I?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I push myself up from her calf, newly humbled.  \"Point taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads up!\"  Brittany catches the pizza box neatly, but again that movement sends me tumbling.  A new heat intrudes on my world as the food is brought closer, a lid lifted to reveal the greatest sight I've yet seen in this monstrous scale -  a veritable field of pizza!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne slice is too much for me to possibly eat!  But the smell brings me striding amongst the toppings, snatching a mushroom slice up in one hand to take a bite.  For her part, Brittany tears an entire slice free of the strong pull of the cheese, mashing her way through more in a mouthful than I could manage in a month.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett is similarly ravenous, and while my own pace cannot possibly match there's, I'm no slouch, wandering amongst the scattered toppings, taking what I want and avoiding probing fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eating slows more as the television rumbles to life, and movies play, big as a cinema to me.  Contrary to what I would have imagined, it's not all 'chick flicks'.  There's action, there's comedy, there's horror... Who knew that women had just as varied a taste in films as men?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPizza eventually gives way to popcorn, crunched mightily between teen teeth while I scrape and lick sugar coating from a kernel as big as my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's all jolly enough, but when the movies wind down, the Truth or Dare starts.  I guess that some beliefs spring up simply because they're true...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull fed and lulled to a warm stupor by comfortable surroundings, I barely listen to the words passed between the giantesses, personal secrets and embarrassing revelations of no interest to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Scarlett's words are directed at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shorty?

That distant face gets a bit closer as my own eye level crawls somewhere above her knee, but the full effect is spoiled when that knee draws back, allowing the leg to deliver a kick to my chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more from full-size, but a woman's kick breaks something in me, hurling me backward and bringing all to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come to on a table, three mildly worried females looking down at me - even Scarlett isn't as jovial as usual!  Her sister smiles at my consciousness, standing a bit further back and folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.  My name's Fay, and I'm sorry for what happened.  It's just, I heard a strange man's voice in my home at night and just lashed out.  Now that these two have explained everything, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky that my sister is a doctor, basically,\" Scarlett says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're okay now,\" Brittany says, reaching down to lift me, to cradle me like a baby to her chest.  \"I'm so, so sorry for causing all this -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I cut her off, struggling to push myself from her shoulder.  What am I, two feet tall now?  \"Never blame yourself for anything.  All that's happened, it's on me, my choices.  Although, you could do with hugging me a little less tightly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fay adds, moving in to loosen Brit's grip with a hand on her wrist.  \"I've patched you up, but I'd go careful - your chest will still be sore for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit looks me in the face as she relents, and I see the dried tears there.  \"Oh, don't worry about that, Fay.  Every time I get a new growth spurt, my wounds kinda re-knit themselves away?  I'm always in pristine condition afterwards.  One good part of this, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of growing,\" Brit smiles, finally setting me down on the table, where standing I'm almost among peers, only having to crane my neck slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have Scarlett's old pram around here somewhere,\" Fay says.  \"Tomorrow, the girls can take you around in it, like a baby -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are baby-sized,\" Scarlett interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  And when women inevitably walk over to look at you, you can hit them with a comment and BAM!

That would draw too much attention, and there's no way that either girl could carry me around all day.  At two feet tall, I'm getting WEIGHT.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sides of the pram cut off much of my world view, and most of my time is spent looking up at the face of whoever is pushing me along.  Fay is working all weekend, so the two girls take it in turns, Brit smiling when she gets the chance, Scarlett instead sticking her tongue out when she catches me peeking.  Each time, I pull the covers tighter over me, glad for their warmth.  My small size means I retain less heat, and even on a warm day like this, denied the warming closeness of a full-size human I shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, it's been old ladies that pop by to squeeze my cheeks and coo over me.  Elderly grandmothers don't exactly do it for me, so at those times I've had to smile and bear it, and suffer through Scarlett's mocking afterward.  Their eyesight has been poor enough that they haven't noticed my non-baby proportions, and instead say how cute I look, the most beautiful baby they've seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsincere.  Not compliment worthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it's a young mother looming over me, backlit by sunlight, halo-ing her soft face.  To my shame, I notice that her bosom is most prominent as it dangles above me, and it takes an effort of will to tear my eyes from her swaying, low-cut chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yours, I take it?\" she smiles.  \"He's got a very clever look about his eyes, doesn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's complimenting me!  To repay that would be egotistical, not nice, right?  'Good taste, lady!' is not gonna get me some growth, is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look too comfortable there, though.  May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't hear the response, and I'm in shock as this gorgeous, gigantic woman reaches down to pick me up, expert hands carefully shuffling me into a comfortable baby-cradling.  I react to that warmth I've been missing, clutching tightly in return, my grip clearly noticeable.  \"Oh!  There, there,\" the woman says, rocking me back and forth.  \"Everything's all right, don;t be scared of the strange lady...  See girls, you might have a lot to learn before you start raising kids of your own.  No kid likes being in the pram for so long - it's pretty boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's not wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every now and then, take them out, let them get a little air, see your face -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts me, holding me away from her and before her face, that wonderful, kindly face, smiling at me and making sound-shapes.  Now, in the open, in the light, my adult form must be apparent to her.  Eyes widen, mouth freezes in mid-burble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow's my time to act.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everywhere, giants who are bound to be weirded out by a three foot tall shrunken man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA detour, then.  Into those trees, where no one will follow.  The undergrowth is thick, but I'm small, so I can leap past roots in ways that a larger person wouldn't.  I'm like a kid, and I still have the slightest amount of increased jumping capacity in me, so it's easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd refreshing.  Just to run, with no care as to destination, no worries for consequence or peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees clear, but there are still large, tall shapes looming over me within that space.  Teenage girls, sitting or standing together in a dappled glade, discarded bottles, cans and cigarette packets around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathe heavily after my exertions, and the half-dozen or so giantesses can't fail to hear me.  They rise, turn and gape at me.  Two among their number are slightly less shocked, resentment replacing it.  Drea and Anna snarl as they recognise me, the former crushing an empty beer can in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look who it is.  A little bigger now, huh?  Now you're done getting me in trouble with the principal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls take courage from their leader, walking to form a circle around me.  I've been the size of an insect, under threat of being crushed underfoot constantly, yet never have I felt more in danger than this present moment, surrounded by teenage girls only a foot or so taller than me.  They're intoxicated, unpredicatable, and clearly unhappy to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too good to play with me,\" Anna says, stepping forward.  I try to back away, but powerful arms pin me from behind, each teen out-muscling me.  Anna lays her huge hands on me far more gently, tracing the outlines of my face with massive fingers.  She imagines a gentle caress no doubt, but either intoxication or an underestimation of strength rips her skin contours across me like sandpaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she kisses me, forcing her monstrous lips onto mine, tongue prying me open to explore with a brutality that leaves me gasping once she pulls away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" she slurs, taking a pull from her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't deserve anything that nice,\" Drea thunders, stomping forward.  Before I have a chance to express my own disagreement over just how 'pleasant' that previous experience was, she's laying into me with her fist, each blow opening new damage where my previous rib-cage had healed.  She's shouting at me all through, calling me names, clearly drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paces herself well, although the two restraining me have released me as they realise the brutality they're witnessing; quite sobering, I imagine.  \"Won't someone help me?\" I whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do think you've gone too far, Drea,\" one girl speaks up.  \"This was meant to be a little joke, and you're killing him-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.  It's not as if he's a person, is it?  He's some tiny little guy, some toy of Brit's, and we're playing along.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a moment here, where I could escape if I'm quick enough...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pursuit is not immediate, so I imagine some disagreement between Drea and her peers has held her back, buying me time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI purchase some more myself, forcing my shattered body to change direction, doubling back in a direction contrary to where they'd imagine me to go.  I don't think my light form is leaving much in the way of a trail, and those girls are pretty wasted anyway, so I think it should work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the treeline, I find sunlight illuminating a woman strolling along, pushchair containing a baby.  The child gurgles at me, no doubt amused to see a man almost as small as she is.  I don't know why I thought to wave to her, inviting a laugh and a hand-clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman herself hustles over to me, her long skirt throwing me into shade before she stoops, halfing her height and bringing herself down to my level.  Concern on her face, she's quite different to that last woman I saw, her eyes flickering over the bruises I imagine cover my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?  Who did this to you!  Where are your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the worry,\" I manage through puffy lips.  \"But your care is better off elsewhere.  I'm okay on my own, believe me.\"  I meet those large, blue eyes of hers, and do my best to smile.  \"Just knowing you're thinking of me will be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I grow, rising above her.  She stands again, and I find that she's still clearly at least a head taller than me.  One more, that's all I need.  One more, and I can reclaim my old life, casting away all these people I've met over the last week, and incorporating my lessons into an improved manner of picking up girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbandon Brittany, embrace a life with love ahead...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has an exotic look, an uncommon dress sense complimenting that, defying the conventional fashions so prominent in this conservative environment.  Bold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit next to her, having to do a little jump to haul my tiny form alongside.  \"Whatcha readin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes hooded, she flicks the cover in my direction.  I can't say that I've read it, and it looks pretty heavy stuff from the lack of illustration on the cover.  \"For college, or personal enjoyment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't it be both?\" she mutters, struggling to read with my distraction.  \"The themes within are relevant to the entire human condition, but the satire makes it readable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So cool to meet someone interested in true literature,\" I say.  \"Not just skim-reading this stuff, but finding enjoyment in a calling.  I'll bet your paper will be fascinating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives me full attention at that point, but slowly enough that she misses my final growth, my original height restored.  Inside, I'm jumping for joy at my torment being over, and this woman seems genuinely interested in me, but as she scooches slightly over, my heart sinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems so small!  I'm looking down at her, and that book is held in such dainty fingers!  It's unnatural.  Women should be bigger than me, should be powerful, intimidating figures!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offers me a smile, tiny, insignificant teeth gleaming, but I'm already rising and backing off.  What's happened to me?  Why am I not seeing the joy in this meeting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman rises, worried.  \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this won't do.  I'm running again, away from her, away from everyone.  But I'm trapped, stuck in this world of tiny people, freakishly small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only I could find that witch, she could make me small again, make me find a place I belong!  I've learned my lesson, and she'll help me!  If only I can find her, and I'd better not stop searching, looking, desperate for another pick-up challenge...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's someone I've got to catch up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give her a nod, the baby another wave, and I'm jogging off.  Brittany!  I'd almost entirely forgotten about her, and I'd left her with that woman that was troubled and calling for help.  I increase my pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park isn't one that I'm familiar with, and it takes me a while to get my bearings, especially considering that I saw none of the route while I was pram-bound!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear Brit before I see her, calling my name.  I reply, and we meet on the pathway.  Scarlett and pram are nowhere to be seen, and as I run to the girl, I find that I'm precisely her height.  So close to the final spurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis leaves the girl slightly bulkier than me, her outsize presence slightly odd, but she smiles and hugs me, powerful arms gently emphasising her relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more,\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!  So, where shall we look for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head, and she stops looking around.  \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you,\" I tell her, honest realisation surprising me as much as her.  It's not physical, not for this teenage girl, but her personality has struck a chord, ringing as clear in my ears as my voice in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she stammers.  Her eyes continue to stare into mine, my height not increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't grow, because you're too young.  But I don't want to grow that final foot without you.  I want it to be you that I see when I reach the end of this journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a beautiful sentiment, and at that point I don't realise the work that it entails.  Staying clear of the world, sheltering with Brittany and her family in secret, each day reminding her of my feelings, years passing in solitude and loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day that the curse broke, when the girl had become a woman and we embrace as one, I still think as the happiest of my life.  The witch's magic had preserved me, and I grow back to my original form, as if no time has passed since that first shrinking.  The age gap, therefore, isn't so distant as one may imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's still strange, I admit that freely, but as I explain this story to you, my child, I hope that you can see past the facts of my challenge to the lessons that they taught me, for without the challenge of a giant world I would never have met your mother, and you would not have been born.</span></div></div>",

This may be the best fall I've ever had, landing on this pleasant expanse of blue fabric, beneath which beats the heart of this gorgeous woman.  Of course, slightly closer to me than that mighty organ are her -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy less than chivalric thoughts are interrupted by another giant addressing the woman to whose chest I'm clinging.  I can't turn my head far enough to see who this newcomer might be, but as their thunderous words wash over me, I chastise myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss.  I was wondering if you might help me out with which of these toys might be best suited for my son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, here comes the sales pitch.  But no; against all expectations, the woman doesn't immediately suggest the most expensive of the options available.  Instead, she launches into a passionate speech (much bosom-rising beneath me - Must.  Not.  Think.  About.  That.) that shows a deep understanding of the various ranges peddled by her store, and an appreciation of what children look for in their playthings.  I hear the jolly ringing of a cash register, and know that one customer has gone away happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was very considerate of you,\" I say, looking upward to the underside of the woman's chin.  \"You clearly love your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head moves from side-to-side, wondering where the voice came from, and as it does so, it shrinks.  No, I'm getting bigger!  The witch wasn't lying after all!  I've almost doubled in size!  Sure, I can still be casually crushed by any that would have a mind to, but at half-an-inch tall they're much more likely to do so intentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this newfound stature is why I feel the urge to intervene when the manager comes over, lambasting the lovely lady for not doing her best to push the latest range of overpriced, shoddy mechandise that the store has in.  It's the final warning, and the woman to whose shirt I'm clinging may well lsoe her job over this incident!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this newfound stature is the reason why I feel so bold as to consider stepping in when the girl's manager approaches, doling out harsh words for not attempting to push the newest line of overpriced, shoddy merchandise that has just released (not that she calls it that, of course).

Immediately Super-Barbie released Sadie and fell to the ground, limp and lifeless. The witch dropped me and I fell to the ground, landing on my back. I rolled to my feet in time to see the witch start growing. Then I was back to being incomprehensibly small. I stared up at the Sear\u2019s Tower-sized witch. She crouched down to look at me with that blasted smirk on her face. <br>\r\n\u201cHave fun little man!\u201d she said, laughing and walked away. I would have liked to say a few coarse words to her, but she wouldn\u2019t have heard me anyways. Now what am I going to do? Sure, I just saved Sadie\u2019s life, but now I\u2019m ant-sized and I have to find a way to communicate with four more women, or is it four? Did the challenge start over or did it just continue? Ok, ok\u2026I\u2019ve got to focus, come up with a plan. I can\u2019t panic now, I mean, I got this far right? I can do this again.<br>\r\nJust then I felt the ground tremble from an earthquake. Well, actually it was now normal-sized-Sadie getting up off the ground and rubbing her neck where the Barbie had tried to strangle her. She looked down at the doll and stomped on it until its arms and legs popped out of the sockets. With each of her footfalls, I was knocked off my feet and onto my butt, bouncing across the ground. I stood up on my feet to see Sadie get down on her hands and knees and start searching the ground for me. Hey, she actually cares about me! Cool! Maybe if I every get out of this situation I\u2019ll ask her out. She sure is hot\u2026<br>\r\nI was snapped back to reality as her hand landed near me, knocking me (again) onto my backside. I jumped to my feet and started waving my arms and calling her name, which was really stupid since my voice was proportionate to my body. Her hand lifted up again and started coming down\u2026straight for me! There was no way I could avoid it. Oh, man, this was not the way I wanted to die! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m going to die! \u201cAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d Hey, you would scream, too! Don\u2019t judge me! But then her hand stopped, hovering above me like the sky. She slowly pulled it away and put it down on the floor far away from me (which was probably just a few inches away in real life, but it\u2019s hard to tell the proportions of size at this height). I looked up to see her gargantuan eyes looking straight at me and a smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness I found you!\u201d she whispered. She leaned back on her knees and carefully placed her hand near me. I climbed onto Sadie\u2019s fingernail and she gently lifted me up and dropped me in the palm of her other hand. It was like standing on an ocean of flesh. I could see every wrinkle, every crevice of her palm. Sadie slowly raised her hand up to her face and I sat there staring into her massive eyes. The warm breath of her nostrils ruffled my hair  and I felt extremely puny when she opened her mouth to speak and revealed teeth bigger than I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to find more women to talk to!\u201d I yelled at the top of my lungs, but from the look on her face, I knew that Sadie couldn\u2019t hear me.

I\u2019m not staying this tiny forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf what the witch said is true, my voice hasn\u2019t fully shrunk, but at this distance, I\u2019d have to shout, which would alert the employee.  Probably best to shock only one damsel at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve got seconds before she finishes tying her shoelace.

I have no control.  I\u2019m on a collision course straight with the small of her back (small of her back...right...like anything\u2019s small...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she stands up and resumes walking away, as my flight path begins to drop off.  I crash into her giant butt, and it bounces me off across the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I\u2019m totally out of control.  And I really don\u2019t want to hit the ground from this hei--Oof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slam into something soft, so I grab it.  It\u2019s a gray surface.  It\u2019s clothing.

Granted, her breasts block my view of her face, but the color combination matches the outfit I saw earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all started because I wanted to get into a woman's pants. I suppose being on a woman's pants is some progress.  I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis angle really emphasizes how massive she is.  She rises up and up and up...Whew.  What\u2019s it--Heh.  That\u2019s funny.  I was just about to wonder what it\u2019s like to be her size, but of course, I already know.  Hard to believe, looking at her now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems I\u2019m a little above her knee. I\u2019d probably survive the drop, given how slow I fall, but I\u2019m not sure I want to bet my life on that theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could climb up to her waist and hop off onto a shelf, or I could make things even simpler and just call up to her and ask for some assistance.

And the brown hair/blue eyes combo is certainly distinctive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s pretty.  Quite pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s also incredibly confused.  \u201cSo sorry if I startled you,\u201d she whispers.  \u201cI just, you see, you\u2019re, you know, tiny and all, and I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI realize it\u2019s unusual,\u201d I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah, but the thing is, I didn\u2019t think Dr. Cassidy had achieved actual human miniaturization yet.  I knew she had a prototype ready for testing, but I thought she would\u2019ve told me if she used it--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Dr. Cassidy who\u2019s working on shrinking people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s, yeah, and objects, too, but--You mean you never met her?  You\u2019re not like this because of--Oh, shoot.\u201d  She brings her hand to her mouth, though she\u2019s too late to keep the cat in the bag.  \u201cNo one\u2019s supposed to know about that.  I\u2019m her assistant, and I\u2019m supposed to keep it all a secret--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could stand to relax a little.  After glancing around the store, we both see that there are only three other people present: the pretty clerk, and a parent and child, but they\u2019re all on the far side of the store, talking to each other. So my new giant acquaintance feels comfortable continuing to talk to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re not with Dr. Cassidy, how are you...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA woman did this to me right outside here.\u201d  No need to give the full details.  \u201cShe didn\u2019t look like a doctor, though--far too young for that.  Early 20s, 25 tops, maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Cassidy\u2019s in her mid-30s, so it wasn\u2019t her.  Did this other woman use a device of some sort?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...I didn\u2019t see one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she just stranded you at this size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible!  I can\u2019t imagine--I mean, you must feel so helpless--Not that you\u2019re weak or anything--I mean, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re normally very independent and capable, but--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.  No offense taken.  Everyone\u2019s a giant to me, so I\u2019m certainly not feeling my most macho.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what.  I can take you to our lab, and we might be able to test the prototype on you and make you big again--Don\u2019t worry--I can run some tests to make sure it\u2019s safe.  But we have to do it without Dr. Cassidy ever finding out.  She will so fire my ass if she catches me playing with her machine.  And if we tell her about you, she\u2019ll want to study you like some lab animal, and that wouldn\u2019t be right.  That would be so horrible and degrading.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she babbles, I\u2019m struck by just how adorable this giant woman is.  I can see every flaw on her face magnified a thousandfold, but she is still absolutely precious and kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, I sprout up...a little, anyway.  I grow to--I don\u2019t know--maybe half an inch tall or so.  But much larger than that puny ant size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d my new friend says.  \u201cIs it wearing off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t really know what to expect.\u201d  True enough, I suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you want me to take you to the lab, just in case?\u201d</span></div></div>",

For your first woman, Katlin is really setting the bar... but now there's the chacne you migh be parting company unless she can think on her feet quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately she seems to do it as a warm, slightly embarassed smile appears on her face. \"I'm sorry to worry you... it's just that I dropped my...\" At this she seems from your vantage point to adopt a even more uncomfortable look as she leans towards the shore worker, clearly not wanting anyone else (not that anyone else appears to be looking) hear what she whispers. \"Erm, my tampoon. I was a little clumsy and I didn't want to draw attention so... if you want to check...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sure, that's ok, my mistake madam.\" The pretty worker appears to have fallen for Kaitlin's lie perfectly, and you can see the akward look on her own face. A pity really, she's only doing her job. But the fact remains that you have the chance to get back to normal and you intend to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to go out of character for the sake of the shop worker, Kaitlin heads over to the woman's bathroom at the back of the shop for a few minutes and enters a cubicle. The slight perv in you is more than keen to examine the circumstances behind the running water you hear from outside, but the witch wanted you to become a gentleman and frankly you're keen to prove her right, not to mention asking Katlin out once you're back to normal. Because what she's doing for you proves she's the kind of person you'd like to know better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarn it, you didn't return to full size. But still, you progress in personality. But if you can't cheat the system and grow a little, so much the better. After her loo stop Kaitlin heads outside and you feel your world swaying. Whilst you're on the way you try and use your environment to figure out a little better about your possible future love interest, just seeing lipstick, a perfume bottle and indeed a tampoon. Looks like Kaitlin was able to back up her story with the store worker if she was pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you feel the purse placed down, very gently. Looks like Kaitlin really wants to keep you safe - you admire her for that. As the zip opens up you see where you are...</span></div></div>",

She zaps me with the scanner, and the red light is nearly blinding at this scale -- had I looked directly into it, it might actually have blinded me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird,\" the cashier says. I stay stiff as I can as she holds me up to her gorgeous face. \"I never saw anything like this before today, and there's no barcode of any kind. And it looks so real, doesn't it? I would almost think this is actually a tiny person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? If you want it, just take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead shoves me into her jeans' back pocket. As she walks off, I feel the denim tightening against me and relaxing with every step. I'd rather have been this close to the cashier rather than up against the redhead's slightly too large ass, but hey, it's surprisingly pleasant. I do need to be careful when she sits down, though.</span></div></div>",

I've made pretty decent progress so far, haven't I? So, break time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI poke my eyes out just above the lip of the pocket and watch the giant world pass behind the woman as she strolls down the sidewalk. Lots of attractive women out and about, so I decide to hang out in the pocket a little longer and admire the view whenever my ride stops for traffic at an intersection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon I start to notice something. Guys keep staring at this woman's ass. Some just glance quickly, then move on. Others linger a little too long. A few look really creepy about it, like they're salivating over a delicious meal or something. I would not want to be alone in any dark alleys with some of these fellows. Oh, God, I hope I never look that creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one notices me. To the horny gaze, I'm practically invisible against a large butt, but the attention is making me a tad uncomfortable nevertheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what's up with that dude? He's walking alongside this total knockout, a stunningly gorgeous woman, got his arm around her, and he keeps checking out this woman's fat ass? His girlfriend's really skinny, but what, is she too skinny for his tastes? Hey, man, learn to be satisfied. Take your victory and appreciate the lady who clearly wants to spend time with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhh!

Of course, those same girls would now appear to be a thousand feet tall...like all these people walking past me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, I\u2019m huddled against the store\u2019s brick wall, so it\u2019s unlikely any of these giants will step on me as they make their way down the sidewalk. So, for the first time, I have a chance to take in just how humongous they all are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumongous is an understatement. Look at these people! All of them--women, men, kids, teens, adults, seniors, the occasional dog--I\u2019m nothing compared to a single one of them. But to me, their casual footsteps cause minor tremors. It\u2019s quite a humbling experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it\u2019s temporary, as long as I follow through with this ridiculous game...So into the bookstore I--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--I cannot open that huge door.

She opens the door, and I have my way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I needed a child to open the door for me. And she didn\u2019t even realize she was helping me out, because I\u2019m too small for even her to notice easily. Shoot me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m going to set a world record for the greatest number of humbling experiences in the shortest amount of time. Why did that witch have to shrink me? Why not shrink a rapist or a wife beater? And leave them at the mercy of their intended victims. Those bastards would deserve it. That would be justice. I\u2019m just a guy who enjoys looking at pretty women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which--that little girl\u2019s mother--quite a nice-looking lady, I must say, even if she is a skyscraper. But she\u2019s a bit above my age range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now that I\u2019m inside the bookstore, it\u2019s time to find a pretty young adult lady. I stand against the door and survey the land of giants before me. I see several young women browsing the shelves and tables. They look pleasant enough, but no one\u2019s really standing out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, wait. She does--a girl in her early 20s, I think. She\u2019s wearing high heels, and her legs stretch up forever and ever. Ohhh, those are nice legs, and they reach up into tight shorts. Above that, a tight shirt, and finally, a gorgeous face with long brown hair. Her butt and breasts stick out, demanding my attention. They\u2019ve got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the witch said I\u2019m supposed to find something attractive aside from her body...But that\u2019s all I know about her so far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must talk to her, and since the witch left my voice close to normal, I can.

We\u2019re in the ladies\u2019 room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one else is here,\u201d she says.  \u201cWas it a very pretty woman, about my age?  Who shrunk you, I mean?

She\u2019s put you through a contest kind of thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and yes.  So I\u2019m not her first victim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh, no.  You see, she and I went to college together last year.  We were in this Wicca group, and she--Courtney\u2019s her name--she was really into it.  Really into it.  I got involved just as a fun spiritual sort of thing, but she somehow gained access to real magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat part I figured out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara bends lower toward me, attempting to meet me at eye-level.  \u201cRight.  Sorry.  Anyway, Courtney\u2019s the craziest feminist there ever was. Guys offend her so easily.  One day, I learned that she was shrinking guys as some kind of twisted punishment for the great crime of finding her attractive,\u201d she says with a sarcastic edge.  \u201cI called her out on it, and she told me everything.  And then to make sure I never told another soul, she shrank me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look shrunk to me,\u201d I say, looking into her pores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got better, but it was an experience.  She shrank me in my dorm room.  Left me maybe a little bigger than you are now, but still like a tiny insect.  But unlike with you, she didn\u2019t leave me with my normal voice.  My roommate returned soon and thought I was a bug, and that girl really hated bugs, found them to be the ickiest, nastiest things ever.  So she wouldn\u2019t even try to get a decent look at me.  She just went in for the kill.  I spent several minutes avoiding her attempts to squash me.  And her bug spray.  I was never so scared.  And I had never realized how dirty we left that place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you kind of notice new things from this perspective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.  My roommate, a sweet girl, was suddenly this huge giant--which made her ass look really, really fat, by the way.  It wasn\u2019t usually, but that size was not flattering for her.  Do I look fat to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d I say at once.  Like hell I\u2019d say anything else.  \u201cI mean, to me you\u2019re big, yeah, but so was a ten-year-old girl I saw right before you.  Gives a whole new meaning to \u2018girl power.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d she says with a cute little laugh.  \u201cAnyway, after my giant roommate left over an hour later--which seemed to last forever--Courtney returned to grow me back, warning me to keep things to myself.

Dammit, dammit, dammit...A greenhouse is really not the best place for someone of my current stature, given how plants and soil tend to attract bugs...and there are bugs that are bigger than me right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reason to panic just yet. I\u2019m still hanging onto the hottie\u2019s shirt here. I doubt she\u2019s going to stay here forever, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh.

I hit it, and roll downward onto another huge leaf before dropping onto another, and...yeah...this part is less fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof!\u201d I crash into soil, very rich and textured soil. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the softness of the ground or my lack of weight or the leaves breaking my fall, but I\u2019m uninjured after what felt like a massive fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take in my new surroundings.

Does she realize what an inconvenience that was for me? Doubtful, but it\u2019s still frustrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow how do I get out of this jungle? And what do I do if a bug finds me before I find an exit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can still jump high, so I could try that, but there\u2019s no telling where I\u2019d land that time, or what I\u2019d land on.

But speaking of art, though it didnt interest you much, there was one particular painting on the other side of the room that kind of interested you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could you get there with so many stomping feet? You survey the room for a possible safe route to get to a position that will give you a good view. But instead of a route, you find a potential ride in the form of a gorgous woman going from painting to painting, if she continued this pattern, then she would be able to take you to over there... but more than that, she was gorgeous. Maybe this was an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman --a girl in her 20s, early, you think. She\u2019s wearing open toed slingbacked  heels, and her toned legs stretch up a couple of miles before they reach up into tight denim cutoff shorts. Above that, an oversized long sleeve grey shirt with sunglasses clipped to the collar and a cord necklace with a small gold fang shaped pendant on the end, a beautiful face with long blonde hair, with a straw sun hat rested on her head. And finally, with an ass and chest that demanded attention, they\u2019ve certainly got yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the witch said im supposed to find someone i find attractive other than their looks, but at this point in time thats all i know about her. Perhaps when she gives me a lift to that painting, I can strike up a conversation on it. Alright then, enough time wasting, time to get moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jog towards the woman in a straight line for a couple minutes and I reach her foot. I look up and see from the looks of her posture (cocked hip and crossed arms) that she was getting a good look at this painting and would likely not be moving soon. You hop onto a small statue near her, jumping from part to part until you reached the peak of its height. The statue was almost as tall as the woman so with the brim of her hat targeted as your landing zone, you take a mighty leap across the open air. You find yourself flying and your not gonna lie, it was fun. But then you land with a thud on the womans hat, then walk to the front just as she starts to move to the next painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rolling her eyes, she expected this disembodied voice to belong to some asshole standing close behind her and pretending to be looking at the art over her shoulder. Though it was strange, aside from the voice, she had no inkling of a sense that someone had invaded her personal space even though it sounded like he was right on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thats a clever way of looking at it.\", she said dryly. \"Too bad its...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen turned her head and saw no one. At least, none around her immediate person. Then who said that? Did they drop that crappy line then just take off? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Again! Who's doing that?!', she thought to herself as she scanned around her, even tilting her head to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Wait Agh!... Oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sudden change of angle sent you tumbling down from the brim of her hat to the crown, colliding your face against the tough bristles of straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distressed noises startled Jen enough for her body to jump, which once again caused havoc for the tiny admirer on board her hat, launching him into the air not very high, but high enough to knock the wind out of him when he once again landed back on the brim of the hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... (cough, cough), stop moving please! Just... hold on, stay still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this backfired. You figured you better reveal yourself before you break something.  Judging by how still the womans head is right now, she seems to have accepted your plea's for her to keep still, so you drag your carcass to the edge of the brim, grip your hands tightly on to it and delicately lower your body over the edge. Now you were hanging above eye level to this womans confused bright blue eyes. Her brows furrowed as she looked left and right for you, unaware that you were right under her nose the while time, or in this case, dangling above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is just annoying. Why dont you quit playing hide and seek or just get lost.\", said Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if its fine with you, I'd like to hang around a bit longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Jen listened to the voice come from directly in front of her, at first seeing nothing, until she caught the sight of a small shape in her peripheral dangling from the brim of her hat. She looked up and focused on it, watching as its fuzzy shape took clear form as a incredibly tiny man hanging by his hands in front of her! Her head recoils for an instant in shock of whats so close to her face, launching you right against her forehead! Jen winces and tenses up, raising her hands in palms open to chest level in an attempt to keep herself from screaming, though a gasp does escape her. Thankfully, she doesnt cause a scene. The art gallery was currently experiencing a slow flow of customers due to it being the middle of a week day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clung to the womans forehead with as much might as you could manage, but you knew you couldnt hold a conversation here, so you carefully descended down her face until you came atop the bridge of her nose. Jen crossed her wide eyes and kept them locked on you as you approached the tip of her nose and turned around to face those beautiful blue orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you remained still, unsure of what move to make next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh... hi there. I'm...\"</span></div></div>",

The momentum caused by her strides was reminiscent to the feeling of being on a roller coaster, each titanic step that brought her forward caused your stomach to drop, not to the extent of a monster roller coaster, but each stomach drop after the other was taking its toll on you nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou counted your blessings when this woman finally reached her high end car and with the worst drop of all, as her head tilted downward and she entered her vehicle. You had to cling hard to the straw floor you stood on and suffered a massive wave of nausea before she finally settled in her seat and drove off to god knows where. You took this opportunity of calm and stillness to lay on your back and clutch your throbbing head in your hands. The migraine was seeping away slowly from your cranium, that is until this big beautiful bitch decided to flick on her radio and blast some screechy pop song, then started singing along to the lyrics herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>THANK YOU, NEXT! THANK YOU, NEXT! IM SO FUCKIN GRATEFUL FOR MY EX!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps if you were regular sized, you would enjoy this woman's singing voice, but at this moment it wasn't doing your head any favors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suffered through an entire car ride of this until finally, she stopped the car and turned the volume down to an acceptable level before pulling out her phone and calling someone on her cars bluetooth. Once again, the heavenly respite was slashed in half when the ringing phone tone screeched out the car speakers. You had just about enough at this point, if this person didn't pick up in the next couple seconds you were gonna reveal yourself in the most blunt, impolite, frightening way possible. An idea you had was perhaps you should make your way off the hat and enter this woman's ear canal then travel deep into her head until you reached her eardrum and from there, proceed to punch and yell your heart out at it! It was a precious thought, dealing out some punishment to this unaware tormentor. However, though you were suffering now, this could be one of the women that could put you a step forward in your height problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringtone abruptly ceased and was replaced by the sound of another womans voice. A young woman, probably in the same age range of your gracious host here. She must be picking up a friend! Great! Another contestant to give you a helping hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jen. You outside?\", the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen huh? Pretty name for a pretty girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes maam. Get that big beautiful bum down here babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed and told her she was on her way before Jen confirmed and hung up. It wasnt long before you saw her exit the building the car was parked outside of and walk with a cheerful strut towards you... well actually, towards Jen. This woman... you had hit the jackpot... two gorgeous young women were gonna be spending time together and you got to tag along for the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was white and blonde like Jen, except her hair was a slightly darker shade than her friends. You figured it would be a good plan to try and keep yourself hidden until you learned a little more about them, just to up your chances of hitting things off well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was holding a small duffel bag over her shoulder. Why? Beats you. Perhaps they wanted to work out or something. Noting that Jen also had a bag in her back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passenger door opened up and the women greeted each other lovingly, with Jen leaning over and embracing her friend in a hug that took you off guard and threatened to send you tripping over straws and falling off her hat, but with sharp tuned reflexes, you managed to hold your ground and stay put on the hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no desire to fall off of your perch yet, so you secured yourself to the hat by slipping your arm beneath a single strand and wrapping your elbow around it. It did secure you extremely well and kept you safe from falling out, so you sat for the next couple minutes, listening to these women chat. This was a great place to eavesdrop on conversation, and you learned all about these fine women. They had been friends for years, and you learned that Jens full name was Jennifer (obviously) and this friend of hers was named Genie. Aside from that it was mostly just a lot of chitter chatter about people you didn't know and inside jokes that had them bursting out with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh.\", you quietly said to yourself. \"These chicks can ramble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another few minutes of listening in until you learned the plans for the day. They were on their way to a restaurant and afterwards would go to the gym and then spend the night at a party at Genies apartment suite. Obviously, these girls were financially secure to say the least. This could be your way of living the life of a one percenter vicariously through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the car pulled into the parking lot of a bay side restaurant and came to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie:<br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiFgczcsI7nAhWRVs0KHT5mB4kQjRx6BAgBEAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsport%2Ftennis%2Farticle-3406234%2FEugenie-Bouchard-plays-swingball-meets-Genie-Army-Australian-Open-enjoys-upturn-form-2016.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw1Dt4zZehTB9WJnfyFymjXy&amp;ust=1579479199555145\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=i...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/ff/58/cbff586b5553f46a61e5be75e733fe22.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/ff/58/...</a></span></div></div>",

Whoever they got to handle the name of the restaurant must have been a few D.N.A strands shy of a chimp. But, despite its lazy name, the place got stellar business day in and day out. From your perch ontop of Jens hat, you could see most of the outdoor tables were occupied as she and Genie walked across the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt escaped your mind unfortunately, that this was a waterfront food establishment, and the most frequent customers of such a place besides paying humans, are thieving seabirds! A fact you were unaware of even as the passing shadow of a flying seagull rolled over Jen and you. You were of course, aware of the birds presence overhead, but you weren't used to some retarded bird actually being capable of eating you alive like a bug, so you chose to instead of get your guard, you were going to walk over the brim of the hat and rest against the crown for awhile as if you were without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen and Genie had almost made it to the front entrance when suddenly, a mad seagull dive bombed at Jen and began attacking, aiming for the \"bug\" that rested on her hat! You, along with the two girls began screaming for the bird to fuck off. In all the chaos, the girls werent even fully aware that a seemingly disembodied voice of a man seemed to be coming from right on top of them when there was no one else with them, but for them, there were more pressing matters at hand than that at the moment. Jen was swinging wildly around her ducked head while you hanged by one hand off the brim of her hat above her face, trying desperately to hold on as your body was violently swayed back and forth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie did her best to help her friend by employing the same tactic Jen was... mainly screaming and flailing at the hungry sky scavenger as it pecked away as accurately as it could at you, narrowly avoiding its orange beak by a hair at some points!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't keep this up! So many things were threatening to end you right now! This damn giant bird, Jens panicked swats that could flatten you thin as paper, her head movements that could send you flying to the pavement where you would grind into paste!<br>\r\nSomething had to happen now or it was over for you!</span></div></div>",

Her immeasurable arm still swings at the bird above her, and you are moving once more, falling into the depths of her gym bag.

So if I must be shrunk down to the size of an ant, then dammit, I\u2019m going to have some fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy idea\u2019s inspired by the painting across the room.  It depicts a surreal human face with a wide open mouth.  I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s supposed to be screaming in pain or chattering obnoxiously, or maybe something else entirely.  But I can work with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hop across wide open floor space, unnoticed by the giants around me.  Side note: That woman I just passed by has some great legs.

It\u2019s waaaaay up high there.  Fortunately, there\u2019s a tall and oddly shaped sculpture on the floor beside it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hops later (good Lord, that was exhilarating), I\u2019m standing on the bottom edge of the painting\u2019s frame.  Above me looms the strange open-mouthed face.  Time for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaahhh!  I\u2019m trapped in a painting!  Trapped, I say!  Help me!  Help meeeeeee!\u201d  I say in the most ridiculous voice I can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI draw a small crowd of observers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that painting just talk?\u201d someone asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue, \u201cThe painting ate me! No one\u2019s safe! Hide the women and children! Oh, the humanity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome anachronistic hippie-type person says, \u201cWoah, art isn\u2019t just imitating life.

This lady is no stick figure...But at my size, I suspect even a stick figure girl would appear full-figured.  Yeah, that's a nice body.  I'm curious about her face, and why did a shadow just fall over me...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh!  Giant shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leap out of the way, narrowly avoiding death-by-sneaker.

I'm here to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom under here, I've got no chance at establishing eye contact, and my odds are slim to begin with, given how much bigger her eye is than my entire body.

I reach an angle where I'm able to get a glimpse of her face as she leans forward, glancing from side to side.  Is she waiting for someone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face comes into view for a quick second, and--Hey!  Is that--?  I think I know her.  That looked like Miss Grey!

I feel like I should bow down before her or something, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not quite the sort of appreciation of women that feminist witch wanted me to develop. Or then again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut dammit! I used to be taller than her! Now she\u2019s thousands of feet taller than me and could kill me with the tiniest motion of her foot here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking away now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is humiliating. If I did talk to her, would I even grow? I already know her. What are the rules of this thing? I don\u2019t know if I could stand Amy seeing me like this. But she would hardly be seeing me. You know, I\u2019m so small, she might not even recognize me. I\u2019d just have to disguise my voice a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, to hell with it. I could just mess around with her and have some fun.</span></div></div>",

You dove out of the way in time, fortunately. But oh well, there went your chance of growing a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you took advantage of the absence of people on the bench. You went to one of the legs and began to climb. Since you were ant-sized, it took a very long time, but it also allowed you to grab on to certain parts more easily.

Thankfully, the doors are propped open, so my little flea-like self can hop right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat store is this?  I look left, right and forward and see nothing but clothing.  I think it\u2019s all women\u2019s clothing.  A couple of teenaged girls straighten and fold the merchandise, so they\u2019re clearly the employees on duty.  And now that I have a moment to catch my breath, it dawns on me just how humungous those girls are.  They\u2019re only teenagers, and look at the size of them!  They\u2019re like a million feet tall!  Well, not that big, but I\u2019ve seen skyscrapers in New York that were shorter than these young ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to talk to a girl that big or stay this tiny forever.  How can I do that when even those teens look so intimidating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why do I hear thunder?  And why\u2019d it get darker...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgh!  Shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope out of the way, barely avoiding being crushed by some middle-aged woman who\u2019s even bigger than the two teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know if I can survive this.  Anyone, even a kid, can accidentally crush me and never even realize.  I need to think.  I need a moment to think without any danger of being stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store\u2019s not too big, thankfully, (well, to most people) so I\u2019m able to run to a corner soon enough and hide below a shelf of folded jeans.  No one can step on me down here, but there could be insects.  The dust is kind of thick, too.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to linger here for too long.  Don\u2019t they ever vacuum?  Actually, I hope they don\u2019t vacuum, not anytime soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy phone!  I have my cell on me, but does it work?  It would defy the laws of science if it still did, but since it was magically shrunk and magic destroys the rules of science anyway, it\u2019s worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to call?  I\u2019ve got it.  My roommate, Lana.  I know she was home finishing up that paper for her grad school course, and home isn\u2019t too far away.  She\u2019s a good friend, one of the best I\u2019ve got.  She can be my wing-girl--my giant-sized wing-girl.  It\u2019s going to be weird seeing her like this, but I have to admit: I need help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hit her number.  The phone rings.  Good sign.  She just better pick up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d she says.  Her voice plus some strange static almost blows my ear out, but it\u2019s bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Lana, it\u2019s me.  I need your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong with your phone?  It sounds funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d I say, holding the phone at arm\u2019s length.  \u201cBut look, I\u2019m in a bit of a situation, and I need your help.  I\u2019ll owe you big time for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t believe me until you see for yourself.  Can you meet me in the clothing store at the corner of Seventh and Central streets?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe women\u2019s clothing store?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see.  You\u2019re buying something for a girl and need my expertise, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that.  Now, when you walk in, you probably won\u2019t see me right away, but I promise I\u2019m here.  I\u2019ll come to you.  Just, uh, watch your step.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to step on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will all make sense when you see me.  Just keep an ear out for my voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo look at the ground, listen for you, and is there something my nose should be doing, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust please come right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I can use a break right about now.  All right.  I\u2019ll be there in a few.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re my hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat.  Just need to hang out for a few minutes.

Look at the detail of her sneakers, all those wrinkles...I can see every step she\u2019s taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI poke my head out to look straight up at her, and wow...I\u2019m so damn tiny.  A leg of khaki stretches up, up and away, and she doesn\u2019t even end there.  It\u2019s a shame she\u2019s too young.  I could maybe have started talking to her and gotten at least one of the ten out of the way before Lana shows up.  Oh, well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!  THOOM!  THOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey!  Footsteps!  New footsteps!  I\u2019m feeling lucky, so I run out between the sneakers and hop toward the door, and OH MY GOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s Lana all right, and sh-sh-she\u2019s just so big!  Lana\u2019s like two-thousand feet tall!  Yikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks across the carpet, her eyes scanning from side to side.  She\u2019s already passed me, as I was too stunned to say anything.  Look at her!  Wow.  She has a great body--Stop that, she\u2019s my roommate and dear friend!  And she\u2019s a goddamn giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, no, don\u2019t get scared.  This isn\u2019t a huge store (not to her, anyway) and if she doesn\u2019t see me in another few seconds, she\u2019ll be out of here, and she\u2019ll be pissed at me for wasting her time.  And no way in hell am I pissing off a girl who\u2019s that effing BIG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing my special hopping ability, I gather up speed and bounce my way toward her, calling out, \u201cHey, Lana!  Down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana stops short, but I don\u2019t.  My momentum sends me crashing into the back of her jeans-clad ankle.  I ricochet onto the floor, falling flat on my back.  But I\u2019m mostly unhurt, just slightly bruised maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, the giant Lana fills my entire view, as she turns around and is about to walk...toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Lana!  Don\u2019t step on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops again, and looks from side to side, curiously.

Here!\u201d I say, getting off my back and rising to my full (such as it is).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she\u2019s found me.  \u201cBilly?\u201d she whispers, astonished, as she puts her hands on her knees and bends down--way down--to get a better look at my tiny body waving at her.  \u201cYou\u2019re--you\u2019re little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope she\u2019s able to handle this shock.</span></div></div>",

And why am I checking out my roommate?  She\u2019s my roommate!  Don\u2019t cross that line!  She\u2019s off-limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes the temptation away by lowering her head back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly, tell me, please, what happened to you?\u201d she asks.</span></div></div>",

The old chair creaks under her weight.  I don\u2019t normally hear creaks from these chairs, especially from someone as thin as Lana, but I guess I\u2019m perceiving all sorts of things I wouldn\u2019t otherwise.

And those lips, even closer to me...Okay, stop that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and she thinks I need to learn a lesson about appreciating women, so she wants me to meet ten girls that I find attractive for reasons other than looks.  With each girl I talk to, I\u2019ll grow a little bit. After number ten, I\u2019ll be back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana smirks.  The smirk turns into a chuckle, which bursts into a great huge, \u201cHAH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer explosive laughter literally knocks me over, flat on my back.  And she continues laughing.  It\u2019s pretty damn loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering my ears, I call up, \u201cLana, you\u2019re a little too big to be laughing so loudly...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees me knocked over and lowers her head to me, apologetic.  \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d she whispers.  \u201cIt was just the thought of tiny you trying to flirt with a normal-sized woman, plus the whole thing is just so ridiculous.\u201d She almost starts laughing again, but restrains herself to a big, kind smile.  \u201cAre you okay? We\u2019ll figure a way out of this.  We\u2019ll get you back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her over-sized face, full of genuine concern for my well-being, right after that giddy playfulness, I can\u2019t help but think it: She\u2019s an adorable person, inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, Lana becomes the Incredible Shrinking Woman, at least to my eyes.  I grow until I\u2019m about a half-inch tall or so.  Still puny, but a mountain of a man compared to what I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana\u2019s smaller to me, but still hundreds of feet tall, and quite confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou grew.  But didn\u2019t you say you only grow if you talk to a girl you\u2019re attracted to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah.  I can\u2019t lie to myself anymore.  I do have some feelings for her.  But she\u2019s my roommate!  We share an apartment!  We\u2019re good friends!

If this yarn gets loose, I\u2019m dead.

I wouldn\u2019t mind it going through a thorough safety inspection first, but in a way, I feel more alive than I have in ages.

I land on the driver\u2019s seat -- a huge, expansive driver\u2019s seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh at my good fortune, and my bad fortune. Really, I have to laugh at my whole ridiculous situation at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I look up and notice something that fills me with horror.

The chair\u2019s crevice affords me just enough room to breathe and for my blood to keep flowing, but this is not a comfortable position right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor I second, I get nostalgic about my time at ant-size, but if I was still that small, I never would have made it to even this small measure of safety in the safety.

Maybe he was just feeling lonely, and there you were. Like you said, he didn\u2019t cross any lines. He just had a moment of being human. People need people, and let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re lovely. Why wouldn\u2019t he be interested after all this time getting to know you better?

Depending on a giant fork for survival because my giant (ex?) roommate poured me out of a giant cup and into a giant sink. My education did not prepare me for this. I feel let down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m prepared to reach out and grab the prongs, but there\u2019s no need. That\u2019s where the current is taking me anyway.

This is disgusting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she starts reaching into the sink to pick up dirty dishes and put them, presumably, in a dishwasher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she targets my fork. She doesn\u2019t bother to look at it, and course not. Who wants to study dirty silverware? I can\u2019t fault her for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she is placing me in the dishwasher.

As long as she doesn\u2019t close the dishwasher quite yet, I have a chance. Her ankles are right at the edge. Maybe I can grab hold of one. Of course, I\u2019m starting from the far side, darn my luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends down to throw in a couple more dishes.

Directly below are the tips of several huge knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness consumes the place, and I hear Lana locking the dishwasher shut. The mighty machine starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m going to die in a dishwasher. How does the inside of a dishwasher even work? Will I drown or suffocate in the steam? Or will I fall onto one of those knives?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder what would have happened if I didn\u2019t come on to Lana like that. What was I thinking? Did my brains shrink with the rest of me? Well, they did literally. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was lonely and I tried to plug Lana into that hole. She doesn\u2019t exactly fit, but my imagination manipulated her until I was convinced she would. The ironic thing is, she\u2019s such a good friend, how could I possibly feel lonely with her in my life in any capacity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she overreacted a bit when I pathetically admitted the feelings I was so sure I had, but I\u2019m also guilty for expecting her to make me happy. It was unfair of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I surrender to the dishwasher, I have one more thing to try. \u201cOkay, witch, I learned some kind of lesson here. Do you really think I deserve this? Are you there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight blinds me for a second, and I see the witch appear before me. She sits on the same bar, roughly twice my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had no idea you were going to be so entertaining. Honestly, I just thought you\u2019d try to hit on some random girl, and she would accidentally step on you and I\u2019d have a good chuckle. But this whole soap opera and death-defying escapes--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you hurry it up? There\u2019s going to be some really hot water splashing around any second now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snaps her fingers, and we\u2019re outside the dishwasher and on the kitchen floor. I look up, and there\u2019s Lana, still large as large can be. She turns to walk toward the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLana! Wait! Don\u2019t leave!\u201d I shout, but it\u2019s even more futile this time. I\u2019m competing with a giant dishwasher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d the witch says, with a sadistic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh.</span></div></div>",

How much trouble are we in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you were big and unaware of me, you tried to stomp on me, then almost accidentally stepped on me, sat on me, lied down on me, drank me, poured me down the drain, and washed me in the dishwasher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all takes a moment to sink in. \u201cWow, that\u2019s all very, well, embarrassing.

Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I was so caught up in myself while you were--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lana. Don't take the blame. It's all mine. I was caught up in myself. My insecurities were trying to force you to be something you're not, to fill I role I feel I desperately need filled. I wasn't respecting you as a person, just as a means to my own selfish ends.

So, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge face softens, touched by my words. \"Aww, honey.\" She sets her flat hand onto the floor, and I accept the unspoken invitation to climb aboard.

I've been where you are...well, not tiny, but...We're all a little lost at our age, aren't we?\" She extends a finger toward me. \"Friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI touch the digit, and we \"shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Lana.

Looks something like a team meeting, prior to opening up to the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Claire?\" Lacy asks, and some teenager grunts in reply.  \"Out back, getting changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's my chance.  Sure I could wiat for Lacy to meet Claire, but if I jump off here and go seek her out, there'll definitely be no suspicion on her part!  Then again, I could hang with one of these other workers, see if Claire has any accomplices...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a purpose beyond chatting up chicks has got me all energised!  Of course, there are a few girls here at the store, and I could try to pick them up while I'm here!</span></div></div>",

All the way down,\u201d I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finds me, and she replays that dumbfounded look she had earlier in the clothing store.  \u201cBilly?  You\u2019re--you\u2019re little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can multi-task well enough to accept this strange new reality without going deaf.  So I talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, little, tiny, itsy-bitsy.  Now listen, Lana,\u201d I say.  \u201cYes, I started to develop feelings for you, but they were as much a surprise to me as they were to you.  This hasn\u2019t been some long-term master plan of mine.  I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t handle it better.  I\u2019ve always cared about you as a friend, and you\u2019re a great friend.  Couldn\u2019t ask for better.  I know that\u2019s all you see me as, and I accept that.  As you can see, I\u2019ve been having something of a bad day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a little more concerned about your height right now.  Or lack of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tell all.  Again.  The whole truth.  As she listens, Lana lies down on her stomach in order to, as best as possible, align her face with mine.  She rests her chin on her crossed arms and looks on me, and she begins to appear guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, \u201cYou mean you were tiny when I exploded like that?  I can\u2019t believe I would be so insensitive to your, your situation.  But if you\u2019re half an inch tall, I suppose anything\u2019s possible.  But really, how could I?  Thinking of myself when your whole life is on the line right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I threw a bombshell at you.  It\u2019s only natural you\u2019d explode,\u201d I say as I walk up to her and place a consoling hand on her arm.  Technically, I\u2019m barely touching her, but the thought has to count for something, right?  But damn, weird how her face is so big... \u201cSo are we good?  Let\u2019s just chalk this up to crazy circumstances, and I\u2019d be perfectly happy just being friends with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re good.  But now we\u2019ve got to figure out how to make you better.  We\u2019ve got to get you meeting some nice young ladies.\u201d  She winces.  \u201cBut oh, it\u2019s starting to get dark out.  You know how dangerous this area is after dark.  Do you think you could handle spending the night small, and then in the morning we\u2019ll go out and get you fixed?  I promise I\u2019ll stay with you all night, won\u2019t let anything happen to you. We\u2019ll just hang out.

I approach it tenderly, the top just above my half-inch high head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch grabbed me in her hand to place me on the floor here, but that experience was over before I realised it had begun; I didn't have the luxury of exploring the sensation at my own pace.  Now, as I reach out my own hands to tug at gaps in my room-mate's skin to pull myself up into her warm palm, it lasts an eternity.  The strain as I climb reminds me how much I need to get exercise, but I'm almost there, and the triumph will be so sweet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's hand rises effortlessly into the air, my legs dangling in space for a second before she nudges me all the way up with a fingernail.  As I roll to a halt on her flesh, I look up at her smirking face and grimace.  I just hope she can't make out that much detail in my expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you something to eat,\" she says, and imeediately all thought of athletic emasculation are gone from my head: I'm starving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain in Lana's hand as she opens cupboards and fridges, revealing titanic food that could feed a person like me for months!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting into a succulent green apple with dautning teeth larger than me, Lana allows the juice to dribble down her chin before offering some to the shrunken guy in her hand.  Eagerly I rush at the fruit, tearing at its surface with my hands and mouth.  It hurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this size I'm just too small to damage an apple!  I'd never be able to chew it, even if I managed to get a piece small enough to place in my mouth!  Looks like the witch added another clause to my curse - if I don't get bigger soon, I'll just plain starve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana has finished crushing and swallowing her building-sized bite by the time I inform her of this, but thankfully hasn't wiped away that trickle of juice.  In a moment of quick-thinking, she lowers her chin to me, allowing me to drink deep of the delicious liquid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I'm done with the juice, and find that my tongue has met her skin...</span></div></div>",

Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see the ant moving towards me at a stuttering, halting pace that only further accentuates it's alien nature, it's long antennae furiously rubbing up against the carpet fibers and producing an unholy scraping noise that itself is comparable to some infernal industrial machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an ant on the carpet, Lana, you have to kill the ant on the carpet!\" I yell towards the heavens, looking feverishly out of the corner of my eyes at the approaching ant all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an ant...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds like a warzone. Lana must be moving. The world of the small had been full of strange noises before, it's true. Even such a simple act as Lana crossing her legs or scratching an itch filled my soundscape with the loud din of shifting fabric and lord knows that it would be impossible for anything that large to move in silence to a being of my size. Yet at this height (whatever it may be, is beyond my comprehension) the simple act of Lana moving from the couch to the carpet in front of the couch sounds to me like what I imagine those G.I. must've heard storming the beaches of Normandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the ant is getting perilously close. \"Lana..! The ant!\" I manage to yelp out, impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for it, it must be really small I'm having a hard time...oh wait!\" She stops in the middle of the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot believe the sound of her voice, but luckily whatever magic keeps my loud voice (which strangely doesn't sound that loud to me) from making me go deaf also stops other sounds from doing the same, although their volume is still immense. Then suddenly, I see it. It would be an exaggeration to say that Lana's index finger is now larger than her entire body was at my prior height, but it's definitely tough to tell. That same finger falls upon the ant and immediately pin it into the carpet as she begins grinding it into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana, careful, I'm right next to it!\" I wasn't, really, at least to me. On my scale I must've been over 200 yards from the ant, but who knows how small 200 yards was to Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her finger pulls away my eyes follow it upwards. It's hard to tell what I'm supposed to be looking at. If Lana's near me, at my scale she's so far away it's hard to tell, until her face starts to descend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you Billy? I can't see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words release hurricane force winds. Luckily at my size the tiniest imperfections in the fiber allow me to hold on tightly. I look up to see her eyes gazing directly at my minuscule form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk so much, please! You're blowing me all around with your breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait a few seconds to compose myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking right at me, Lana. Please, Lana, you have to be able to see me. If you can't even see me anymore...then...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

There's this whole giant world out there, and I'm killing time lounging around on a high shelf, with nothing to do.

So I'm left alone with my thoughts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, did something move down there...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, dammit.

I've got a few hours left waiting here, so it's only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office door swings open, and thunderous footsteps alert me to the presence of a giant. I hope it's Diana, but no, it's the blonde girl, Jenny. A girl her size could preemptively take care of my potential spider problem...assuming she's not afraid of spiders, which would be an absolutely ridiculous notion from my present perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would just have to reveal myself. But I see a few pins lying nearby. They're light enough that I could wield one like a spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny reaches for a tin container in the middle of the shelf, in the wide gulf between me and the spider. She hasn't noticed me, but that's easily remedied...if such a situation would indeed be a remedy. I don't know how much I can trust a giant teenage girl. But she's no doubt preferable to getting caught in a spider's web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo do I pick up a \"spear\" and handle my problem like a man?

I watch with neck craned to take in every detail of the colossus, staying still so as not to invite a stomping.  The earphones dangling from her neck explain why she didn't hear Diana's knocking at the door, and presumably she's heading to the kitchen for a little snack in between studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta and I - 'Bob' for short - never shared more than a 'hello', as she's more Lana's friend than mine.  I don't really have a good idea of what sort of person she is, but she should be able to get me past this one inch height before Lana arrives.

She's huge! This giant is actually my dear friend Lana! It's one thing seeing giant strangers who I never met at normal size, but this is now someone who's supposed to be a few inches shorter than me. But she's got to be anywhere from five hundred to a thousand feet tall. Lana! A giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's talking on her cell phone. \"This class is killing me, and I almost mean that literally. I've barely had a chance to exercise in weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls her shoes off and casually drops them on the floor. They land almost like bombs.

I better reveal myself soon...even if she's much more intimidating than I was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer conversation continues as she strides over me toward our living room area, each step creating thunder and tremors. \"My butt is getting huge. I walked by a mirror in a department store, and I was like, is that gigantic thing mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wouldn't argue at the moment. Well, I would, but only in the interest of self-preservation rather than honesty. But honestly, in normal terms, she's not getting fat. She may not be at her slimmest, but she's being hard on herself. Although, the few pounds she's gained equal more of her that can accidentally wipe me out of existence. So I better get talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana plops herself on the couch and wraps up her conversation as I timidly approach. This is very daunting.

Staring at her is no chore, but I have to do more than that if I don't want to spend the rest of life being, for all intents and purposes, an insect compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it is very tempting to indulge in some ogling before I figure out a way to draw her attention.</span></div></div>",

Apparently, when you're half an inch tall, it's very difficult to come up with plans -- your say in your own fate is significantly reduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up and see Lana looming above me, bug spray in one hand, a plastic cup in the other, her eyes scanning the floor. She must've seen me scurry in here, and she's out for blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, bug,\" she says. \"No escape for you. Fe fi fo freakin' fum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana really despises bugs. Apparently, they even drive her to talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps over me and crouches down, to better survey the floor. She won't see me, though, because I'm behind her, and damn, I cannot get over how huge her ass is. Of all the times for her not to be at her slimmest...oh, who am I kidding? She still looks great. Hell, the additional curviness suits her splendidly. I could stare all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut dammit, that's what I'm trying to avoid. This is the problem -- my problem. Even before I shrank, I enlarged Lana into a giant, like a monument to be admired and revered, rather than a complex person to look in the eye and get to know without trying to get something out of the interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's over now. Time to be a real man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run toward her, shouting, \"Lana! It's me! I'm down here! A crazy girl shrank me! Lana! Help me, I've shrunk! Lana! Help! Lana! Lana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould've been more masculine, but oh, well. She gives no reaction anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally approach her front, and an overturned cup immediately slams over me, trapping me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah...we tiny people are pretty much at fate's mercy.

After my slimy behaviour, maybe I'd be getting off lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick white walls of the cup move, one ramming into my side and knocking me from my feet.  My breath leaves me as I impact against carpet fibres, my legs splayed in the air.  Then the cup tilts, the wall seeking to pry me loose from the floor, and catching my legs against its lip.  I'm flipped onto a rapidly verticalising wall, sliding down to the cup's bottom as Lana lifts it from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No getting away this time, you little fucker,\" she sneers, showing a side of her I've never seen.  Such hatred, focused from a face of fury, dominating my circular view of the outside world.  Those vast eyes narrow into slits, and that heavenly upper lip peels back to display crushing teeth.  Insects must be brave indeed not to run in terror every time they see a human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up, dusting myself unconsciously and preparing to state my case.

Since you went to oh so much trouble to get my attention...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God she's going to kill me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's lips purse, and she blows a small breath down into the cup.

I get a brief moment to enjoy the fresh air, but no time to enjoy the sun -- because Lana is blotting it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands at her full height and lifts her sneaker-clad foot over me, ready to bear down. Is this how I die? Death by giant roommate because she mistakes me for an insect?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's no longer taunting me, I guess because we're outdoors and she doesn't want to look or sound crazy to anyone who might be walking by. But yeah, definitely about to murder me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dive away from her mighty stomp, but then her shoe bumps me on the head and lightly pins me to the ground. Well, I wouldn't exactly say lightly, but a lot lighter than she could bear down. I'm stuck beneath her shoe, no wiggle room at all. Not a pleasant environment -- neither the ground nor her heel epitomizes cleanliness. Really unsanitary way to die. Oh, God, I'm about to die. I feel the pressure increasing. Won't take long before she squishes me. A slow squish. Oh, please, no, no, no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGotta try one last time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana! It's me! Don't squish me! Lanaaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" a familiar voice calls out, but not Lana's. Another girl's, but I can't quite place it. \"Don't step on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's a bug,\" Lana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, collect exotic insects,\" the other woman says, sounding embarrassed.

I don't know any Courtney, though. A new neighbor? Maybe I just overheard her as she was moving in or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cup flies off me, and fingers swoop down and pinch around the back of my shirt.

Sweat oozes from every orophus on my body, dampening my forehead and the bangs resting on them.  The salty drips cruise through my thick eye brows and gives my eyes a buring sensation I could surely do without.  Pools of sweat grossly gather just beneath the pits of my arms.  The thumping within my chest places my upper body into a near convulsive state, creating the illusion that it is the world that refuses to stand still.  My depleted body is sending my brain the message of pacing itself on future journeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe common sounds of everyday downtown life are more audible to me now to say the least.  The slight clicking of high heels clicking could now be better compared to cannon fire.  I am able to catch an occasional word admist the chaotic non-stop thunder raining down upon me from what I would have once considered casual cellular phone conversations far overhead.  Car horns honking in the distance remind me very much of light house horns I've heard in the movies, and also much like the movies, I'll take their sounding as a sign of danger and avoid them at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I must gather my wits about me and figure something out.  This is no time to let my surroundings get the better of me.  I have to figure something out.  I have to...what is that magnificent auroma?  It fills my nostrils with a heated smell of freshness.  This is coffee!  What luck!  I've unwittingly manuevered my way beside Baxter's Coffee House.  I've heard that coffee houses are great places to meet girls.  Time to make a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the door is propped open on this fine Spring evening.  The lowering sun lights the exposed doorway as though to point my in the right direction.  I have a really good feeling about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stay to the left edge of the small inclination leading from the ground to the slightly erected gateway to hopeful salvation, avoiding most of the heavy traffic coming and going from the coffee house.  The quakes created by the various buildingesque feet slamming ever so hard into the cement earth makes keeping my balance somewhat of a difficult task, but I think I can handle it.  I am proven wrong, however, as I promptly fall on my backside and tumble all the way to the bottom of the foothill and come face to leather with the gorgeously crafted red Itallian high heeled shoe which landed mere inches from me.  That's it, this time I'm crawling up on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finally enter the bustling coffee shop, I begin to forget about the emense pain throbbing through my lower back.  Alright, time to get down to business.  So, the witch said someone as attractive on the inside as the outside, eh.

The thunderous voices of the outside world have somehow lost their intimidation upon me, sounding more like echos within a deep cave.  The deep, rich stench of freshly baked brownies almost takes hold of me and pull me towards them.  Spicey cinnamon and the light auroma of newly risen bread outflank my distracted nostrils.  The dryness of my mouth of which I was previously unaware has now been remedied by a river of saliva running beneath my tounge, causing slight flooding to escape my lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dimly lit room coincides with the last rays of sunlight to give off the appearance of candle light.  The ground beneath me is smooth as ice, yet the dark-finished wood surface is hard as steel as well.  Dark purple refracts from the walls surrounding me.  A lone bright light from behind a massive fortress of transparent glass protecting various entrees erected far to my left serves as the sun in this relaxing universe.  This being my first time in a coffee house, the atmosphere has really taken me aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver to my left stood an elongated pillar of silver reflecting what little light came its way.  Pointing my chin skyward, I see that the sky scraping shaft lifts a thick white disc of an unimaginable circumference off of the ground.  Beside this impressive structure stood two silk-like columns overlapping each other at their rounded peaks.  At their bases, two slightly declining ramps of flesh complete with five well manicured appendages with their tips dressed in bright red each were housed by light brown, curvey bottoms held in place by several straps hugging their tops.  The overlapping leg sways to and fro effortlessly yet tauntingly, with the foot hanging above you as would the blade of a pendulum.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this is as good a place to start as any.  The question now becomes how do I reach the summit of this great structure before me.  I daren't approach the bottom half of the lady in fear that my trek may end prematurely under her soles.  Yet, there doesn't seem to be any foot holds on either the pilliar nor the chair across from my target.  There is a \"slight\" breeze entering the room through the gapping entryway. Perhaps I could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter testing the currents charging through the door, I am ready to enact my plan.  I run towards the door counting in my head.  Once I reach four, I leap with all the strength my legs posess.  At the apex of my jump, a strong gust of wind rises from beneath me, propeling me much higher than I could ever hope to reach on my own.  For a moment I feel the indescribable sensation of weightlessness, however this feeling doesn't last long.  I soon begin to plummit at an ever accelerating speed.  I would like to look downward to see where I am going to land, but the force of the wind counteracting gravity won't let me move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy free fall was going to last an eternity, or so I thought.  However, this dream was soon shattered by the impact of my body against a soft gooey landing pad.  That's not to say the landing didn't hurt, though.  I scoop a handful of this mysterious substance in my hand and push it into my mouth somewhat greedily.  Sweetness and honey stick to my taste buds almost immediately.  My fall had been broken by a gigantic honey bun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in my new environment, I take in a truely lovely vision.  Her ocean deep baby blue eyes sucked me in at first.  Her well rounded nostrils were the framework of a cutely petite nose.  Those gorgeously ruby red lips parted to reveal the sparkling white jewels encased by them.  Curly strands of brunnete ran from the top of her head to her strong shoulders.  Her bussoms floated just above the table top, threatening to capsize it with their emense weight and perfect form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day dreams which I was starting to have are interreupted by her monstrous claw digging into the back end of my support.  Now would be a good time to make my move.  I open my mouth, yet I am unable to find the words.  This could be trouble.  Now is not the time for me to lose my nerve, but that's never stopped me before.  </span></div></div>",

She remains humongous. Since I did my part by saying hello, my reward was to grow up from ant size to...Well, I'm not really sure. I'm probably still well under an inch tall, though, given the size of that face that just spotted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, God. She just spotted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers her head down, and holds it right above me. Her eyes are like these two huge UFOs floating in the sky.

Of course, I never saw a pair magnified to this extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...are you a person?\" she asks, whispering. I'm not sure if the whisper is for my benefit or hers.

I can't exactly date you at this height. You're soooo cute and all like this, but I think I'd get tired of all the crouching down and watching my step and making sure I don't accidentally sit my big ol' butt down right on top of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy reflex, I say, \"You're...You're not that big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs again. \"Oh, you little liar! You cannot tell me that I'm not big. Not when you're looking out of those itty bitty eyes. My pinky's big next to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lower my head and mutter, \"Okay, fair point. Sorry.

I can't imagine any of them will be prettier or nicer than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives that smile again...that adorable smile. \"You do have motivation to be nice to me, don't you?\" Before I can open my mouth again, she lights up with a new idea: \"Hey!

Hell, it'd probably be enough to get me to swear off ice cream for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I--I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I realize something.  Yes, from the glance I got earlier, she has a nice butt.  Really, really nice.  But it's one body part.  It's not her.  It certainly reaches out, grabs your attention and refuses to let go, but it's far from being the full story of this person.  But so many guys are constantly looking at it whenever she steps out in public--and not just there, but the rest of her.  She's being watched non-stop.  And judged.  And evaluated.  If they like what they see, they like her.  If they don't like what they see, they don't like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything she does, someone's probably watching.  They're getting so hung up on the specific pieces, they're failing to see the big picture.  They reduce her to a fraction of her true self.  I reduced her--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhhh.  I get it, witch.  Very clever.  Lesson learned.  Can I grow up yet?  (Guessing not.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway...How does Kirsten not go crazy?  It's a type of strength I never considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's still only human.  She's bound to be at least a little self-conscious of what people are seeing.  How could she not be?  It's like paparazzi-lite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Kirsten\" I tell her, \"you're a beautiful woman.  Inside and out.  That's all you need to know.\"  I'm totally sincere, and--despite my pitiful size--it shines through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is sweet,\" Bethany says, in that \"awwww\" type of tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and we need to get him bigger,\" Kirsten says, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...</span></div></div>",

And I am most certainly the strangest sight any of these girls have seen in a long, long time--possibly ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirsten, why is there a teeny-tiny little guy in the palm of your hand? Are you shrinking guys? Are you some serial guy shrinker and never told me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten starts, \"Well, Lauren...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses, as the amazing happens. I grow! I grow all the way up to two inches tall, maybe slightly taller, but still. It's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it worked that time!\" Kirsten says. \"Guess there was some kind of fluke last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren says, \"Kirsten. You have a tiny guy that just became slightly less tiny, but still tiny. I'm used to feeling tall and all, but come on...Is it witchcraft? Are you dabbling in the black arts?\" she joked. \"We've talked about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kirsten recaps the situation to Lauren, I wonder what's wrong with Bethany. The witch wanted me to meet good girls and appreciate them. Kirsten, a genuinely nice and decent human being, allowed me to grow from ant size to half an inch. With Lauren, who so far seems to have this interesting and quirky sense of humor, I at least quadrupled up to a plural number of inches (barely, but still plural.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's the deal with Bethany? Or was it something I said?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten finishes the review, and Lauren lowers her head back down to my level. \"You know, I've always wished to be a little smaller, but after seeing you, I think I'm gonna stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cell phone rings. It hurts my diminutive ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's me...\" Kirsten says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany steps forward. \"I'll hang onto Billy while you get that...\"</span></div></div>",

She's involved in her phone conversation and not looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, Mom, I'll drive safely,\" she says. \"Yes, I'll wear my seatbelt. I always wear my seatbelt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rush forward, for some reason deciding that waving my hands above my head is a better way of attracting her attention than using my voice.

Something has caught her eye on the shelf opposite the one we're huddled against. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know I'll be there, Mommy,\" Kirsten says. \"I'm not going to miss my cousin's wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm about to give in and speak up - possibly attracting others! - when I'm yanked from my feet by  Bethany.  I glare at her, but when Kirsten's shoe smashes down where I had been standing I smile apologetically.  Bethany raises her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I don't want her to see me like this!  But did you hear what she's saying?  A wedding!  What better place for you to meet some girls that will help you grow?  Always plenty of desperate bridesmaids!  And hey, I wouldn't mind checking out a few giant hunks in formalwear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, yes, we can go to the wedding with Kirsten,\" I gasp.  \"So let's get her attention, and se can carry us there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Look, she's oblivious to us - we can just grab hold of her fat legs and she can take us there in her car.  We can schmooze around the wedding for a bit until I'm normal size, and this'll all be over!  No need for her to see me like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's probably different when you were already close to the person at normal size and then get to see them enlarged to gigantic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be 200 feet tall,\" Bethany says, barely audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten is still walking toward us, and Bethany hasn't moved.

I back up, trying to put some distance between us. I make the mistake of trying to reason with her. \"I know you're feeling vulnerable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" she says, jumping forward. But whatever attack she had planned, she doesn't follow through. She looks up, and her eyes bulge wide--even wider than when she first got shrunk and saw the giant world. Whatever she sees has filled her with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up, and I see Kirsten's tremendous ass coming down--right toward us. Seems she wants to check out the lowest shelf...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dive at Bethany and shove her away from its path. Kirsten's butt smacks the carpet. We miss it, but if I was a second slower...Certainly would have been an interesting way to go, but I'd rather not go just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stand a safe distance behind her ass, and we both stare.

First, I see some sneakers and jeans.  Casual girl, it seems.  My eyes climb up her pretty nice body until--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my God.  Oh.  My.  God.  It\u2019s her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy.  My biggest crush in high school, and now--no, not going there.  Not a huge fan of puns--And there I went anyway, despite myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway.  Wow.  Amy Young.  Haven\u2019t seen her in a few years, and now she looks like a giant as I stand two inches tall at her feet.  She\u2019s just standing there, flipping through a book she picked off the display, completely unaware that I\u2019m right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she is aware of how I felt about her.  I told her junior year.  It was not my finest moment, but we remained friendly afterward until the inevitable post-graduation drifting apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here she is, a little over five feet taller than myself.  I know I\u2019d close that gap by at least a tiny bit if I talked to her.  Gorgeous as she was--and still is, apparently--it was never just about her looks.  Though the sight of her does still take my breath away, and not just because she\u2019s relatively 200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany shoves me forward and motions for me to hurry the hell up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I understand her hesitation about not wanting her friends to see her like this.  I\u2019m so little next to Amy--Amy, for God\u2019s sake--Amy looks soooo big to me now...This is so much more intimidating than when I first talked to Kirsten.  Maybe I could come back to her later, after I\u2019ve reclaimed some more height?</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s confused that she doesn\u2019t see any Billys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she figures things out, I grow to twice my size, more or less.  Of course, I still don\u2019t think I\u2019m even half a foot tall, maybe four or five inches?  A ruler would be nice...No, actually, I don\u2019t think I want confirmation.  (So this is, let\u2019s see, one, two, three...Just three?  Ugh.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether two inches tall or five, Amy\u2019s still enormous.  Her jaw goes slack as she spots me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly?\u201d  She drops to her knees.  \u201cIs that you?  You\u2019re little, like a doll...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot how I pictured this reunion going, and I\u2019ve pictured this reunion a lot.  This is so embarrassing being this small in front of her...Makes me feel even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost tell her that I was even smaller, but then I realize--Do I really want to get into the explanation of how this all started?  Do I want to tell her that I was roaming around the street looking for girls to hit on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply say, \u201cUm, yeah, it\u2019s me.  Believe it or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers her face to my level, and It\u2019s. Just. So. Big.  Her head alone is still much taller than I am.  Even though I saw plenty of much larger people, I didn\u2019t know any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut oh, how I\u2019ve missed that long, lovely red hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s stunned, doesn\u2019t know what to say, and neither do I.  So I joke.  \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t, uh, happen to know anyone with a growth ray gun, would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s still sinking in.  \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really don\u2019t know what to say, but I know how to buy time.  \u201cThink we can go somewhere more private, so people don\u2019t think you\u2019re talking to an action figure?  I wouldn\u2019t mind a change of scenery myself. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, of course.  Good thinking.  I certainly don\u2019t want to leave--I mean, it must be so dangerous at your--I mean...I just simply couldn\u2019t leave you here by yourself like this,\u201d  Slowly, she reaches her hand toward me, and it\u2019s nice to see that at least I\u2019m taller than a horizontal hand now.  \u201cTell me if I\u2019m squeezing too tightly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wraps her fingers around me, and she\u2019s incredibly delicate about it.  She lifts me up with the one hand, while holding the other below as a safety net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can dwell on how weird it is to be carried single-handedly by Amy, I remember Bethany.  Did she grow along with me?  In any case, she\u2019s still down there...But when am I going to get another shot at being alone with Amy?  And it's not like Bethany's a wonderful person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real question is...How good of a person am I?</span></div></div>",

Being in my company only lost her five feet of height, so really, she\u2019s better off without me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I mull this over, I ride in Amy\u2019s side pocket.

Seriously, look at those...I\u2019m tempted to dive right into them...but not quite as tempted as I would have thought.  I mean, sure, she was always very nice and sweet and personable, and she still seems to be, but back then, I completely overlooked just how dumb she is.  Now, I have to face it:  She truly is a total airhead.  Not much is going on in there.  It\u2019s a buzz kill, frankly.  She looks hot, yeah, but little else is attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve made a huge mistake.</span></div></div>",

Well, she\u2019s not that bright, so it shouldn\u2019t be too challenging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmy,\u201d I say, \u201cI just remembered...The scientists did have a rule for me.

I\u2019m resourceful. So, um, do you mind setting me on the ground?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHop aboard!\u201d she says, extending her hand for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy exits the car and bends down so I can step onto the pavement.  \u201cThanks!\u201d I call up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was great to see you!  When you\u2019re big again, we should definitely get together and catch up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.  That would be great.\u201d  I have no intention of ever contacting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start walking away.  \u201cDon\u2019t get stepped on!\u201d she says, still bent at the knees to see me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my plan. Oh, and please don\u2019t tell anybody about this, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be our secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.

Now, I can either find my way straight back to the bookstore and hope Kirsten\u2019s still there (and Bethany hasn\u2019t been stepped on, or on second thought...) or I can say hello to some nice ladies so I\u2019m a bit taller when I have to apologize for being such a jerk and running off with my (inexplicable) high school crush.</span></div></div>",

Always a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slip inside the moment someone opens the door.  Once there\u2019s a gap in the foot traffic, I dash across the carpet beneath a table display.  I figure no one\u2019s going to look or step under the table, so I can take a moment to scan the area and look for familiar faces. Or ankles, anyway--specifically, khaki-clad ankles.  Or tiny angry brunettes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that\u2019s a question...How big or small is Bethany right now?  Did she grow when I talked to Amy, and did she shrink back down when I did?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t see her anywhere, so I don\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I hear a voice, and my heart quickens.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, Lauren.  I gave Billy to Bethany, and I haven\u2019t seen them since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo beautiful giants stand right beside my table.  Kirsten\u2019s with her friend, the tall one--also a nice one.  I did grow after I met her, unlike with Bethany.  But I seem to have lost ground since then.  Possibly permanently, if that witch is to be believed.  But why would I believe her?  There\u2019s a way out of this.  I\u2019m not yet resigning to life as Bug-Guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Lauren girl really is tall, especially next to Kirsten, like she\u2019s a natural giant.  And she\u2019s got some great, long legs, soooo very long...I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s wearing shorts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere I go again.  Stop ogling and act, damn me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run out from under the table and shout up at the mammoth Kirsten, \u201cKIRSTEN!  I\u2019M DOWN HERE!  I GOT SHRUNK!  AGAIN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten continues her conversation with Lauren, oblivious to my presence.  \u201cDo you think something happened?  And what if she lost him?  He\u2019s so tiny and helpless...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try for louder.  \u201cKIRSTEN!\u201d  And I am indeed louder, but still ineffectual.  \u201cKIRSTEEEEENNNNN!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren says, \u201cSo what do you want to do, Kirst?  Crawl around the store on our hands and knees, and when someone asks why we\u2019re acting crazy, we just say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just looking for a tiny dude, that\u2019s all?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just keep looking for Bethany.  She should be easier to spot.  I\u2019ll try her cell again...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten pulls out her phone and takes a step--a step toward me.  I dive away from her colossal sneaker in the knick of time.  This girl is going to be the death of me.  First she almost sits on me, and now she almost steps on me.  But she\u2019s also my best hope for getting some giant-sized help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she can\u2019t hear me.  Bethany probably could, if she\u2019s still small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I continue trying to get Kirsten\u2019s attention, or should I scour the store for Bethany?</span></div></div>",

This girl, this young woman, Nikki, she's sick,\" I say. \"She could be suffering from bipolar or some serious depressive disorder. But finding us made her happy. Maybe we've given her some hope that there's more to life than she previously thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two little people gave her hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Think about it. We're pretty amazing, aren't we? We're two human beings who are <i>actually</i> the size of bugs. Did you ever think such a thing was possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But I'd rather it happened to someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, but like it or not, it happened to us, and maybe it happened so we can help this person. And when we figure out how to communicate with her, maybe she can help us in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany thinks about it for a long moment, and when she finally speaks, her voice is softer, gentler than before. \"That ... makes sense. And it's surprisingly compassionate.\" Her own words seem to surprise her, too. \"So what do we do while we wait for her shift to end? However long that might be.\"</span></div></div>",

I suppose I could blame the witch for shrinking me in the first place -- hardly justified punishment for the crime of wanting to meet women, even if I wasn't the greatest guy in the world. But here we are. I've stumbled across the path of this troubled young woman and challenged her entire conception of reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I can't make this right, I deserve my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she's all curled up, her pant legs are higher than usual, exposing some ankle above her low socks. With a little climbing, I reach the top of a sock, ignore the stench of a day of retail, and scratch her ankle as vigorously as I can. I scurry down before she reacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reaction is sluggish, as she slowly removes the veil of her hands. She reaches to scratch her itch, but she stops, perhaps wondering if that <i>was </i>a mere itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jump up and down, waving at her. She sees me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rush of motion -- alarming in its swiftness, given her incredible mass -- she's on elbows and knees and leaning her gigantic face all the way down to my level. I'm closer to her eyes than ever. Her great size magnifies her sadness, which remains even as she delights in finding me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't help but care about her. I'm not thinking of her as a potential romantic partner or anything. Rather, I'm seeing what a tragic figure she is, trying desperately to function despite her illness. The fact that she can hold down a job suggests tremendous fortitude (and no doubt excellent medical and psychiatric care). I never would have noticed at regular size -- I might have just smiled politely at the nice young store associate and carried on with my day, oblivious to her pain. But now I see her in a fuller glory, and there's still so much I don't know. Just as she knows so little about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are real,\" she says, as much to herself as to me. \"And you're probably not a Borrower, are you? Maybe it's time I figured out a way to listen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not thinking of her as a potential romantic partner. Really, I'm not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForget that for now.

Am I just easily swayed by whichever woman shows me a little bit of care and attention?  I need to find out.  If I can get these three women together in one room, I can finally lay to rest my conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I definitely don't want to abandon Nikki.  She's utterly blameless in this, and has already suffered so much just because of me.

Yes, that's great!\"  Nikki gushes, and I look away as she begins calling Kirsten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, I cannot hear Kirsten's side of the chat, but Nikki gives her name, confirms my safety and sets up the meet.

You've been around her for what, an hour tops?  Be careful you're not holding her up on the pedestal of your first impression.  People are deeper than that, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe proceed to her home with silence between us after that, me having lots to think over and Nikki calling ahead to talk with Alice.  She gives me a thumbs-up at the conclusion, and soon after we're passing the immense portal into their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would say it's cosy, but given the dimensions it would be impossible for me to do so.  Instead, I have to say that it's utilitarian.  Decoration is at a minimum, and even then what cosmetics there are are kept tiday and distance from the practical features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki drops her keys into a tray on a small table, then allows me to step off her hand next to them.  The giant, jagged metal is terrifying in its own way, so I keep my eyes elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just check on Alice myself, first, okay?

She can be a bit shy sometimes, and I think she's a little self-conscious about appearing so huge to someone, like you'll think she's fat or something. I told her that wouldn't be the case, but I don't want to push her. I'm sure you'll meet her in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've met so many giant women today, I think I can handle not meeting one right away. Besides, I am looking forward to the one-on-one time with Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is getting late, so we're preparing for bed before long. And here I come to some of the practical difficulties of life at one inch high. I have no way to brush my teeth! My mouth feels disgusting, but one fluoride-free night won't kill me. I'm also wearing the only clothes on the planet that are perfectly sized for me. It's a relief to kick my shoes off after such a long day. I leave them on the nightstand beside Nikki's bed, and I hope no stray gust from the bed sheets blows them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for where I get to sleep, Nikki tells me I can lie on the pillow beside her's. And let me tell you, you have never known comfort and softness until you've lain on a gigantic pillow. The pillowcase smells nice and clean, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a little concerned about Nikki tossing and turning in the middle of the night, but she assures me she's a light sleeper--and that's on the nights she's even able to fall asleep for any length of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I lie on the most pillowy pillow there ever was, and Nikki's head is lying close by, close enough that we're able to converse into the wee hours of the early morning. I have to yell, and she has to whisper, but it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enjoys my harrowing tales of avoiding giant footsteps and leaping (relatively) tremendous heights when I was ant-size. I sympathize with her retail stories--having worked such jobs myself, I've encountered more than a few nightmare customers. We swap stories, trying to one-up each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe also have some similar pop-culture tastes, particularly a fondness for <i>Doctor Who</i> and Marvel movies. We simultaneously come to the conclusion that I'm the closest thing to a real-life Ant-Man, just a little taller, a lot less strong, and sorely lacking in any of that Paul Rudd charm. She begs to differ on that last point, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's quite a bit of laughter throughout the night. Nikki keeps needing to hush herself so as not to disturb Alice. We're having a grand time, just enjoying each other's company, without any possibility of anything physical happening between us. The fact that I likely wouldn't survive any such activity certainly takes that off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, Nikki nods off. She seems so peaceful and contented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, she's moving. She's rolling over. Toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she's not such a light sleeper after all.</span></div></div>",

Well, that's just selfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips twitch back, her chest inflates, and a grinding roar of breath churns from within her, echoed a moment later.  Great; she's a snorer.  There's no way I could sleep in this room even were I able to dodge her rolling mass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlodding along with background music courtesy of Nikki's ragged breathing, I swing over the edge, neatly climbing down the covers of the bed to the floor.  It's a short journey of a few minutes to the door, and I can just about wriggle my inch-tall form under and into the greater apartment.  Once that solid slab is between me and the sleeping woman, the sound of her snoring is almost inperceptible.  Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexing my toes on the rough strands of carpet, I look immediately ahead to see a much more impressive pair of bare feet, each big toe capable of smothering me entirely beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wold be Alice, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides her feet, it's difficult to get a grasp on her shape, as she is clothed in oversized, striped male pajamas, so I can neither confirm nor deny her fear of being found fat.  She is certainly taller than her flat-mate though, I'm guessing somewhere on the taller end of the spectrum of female heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks slowly, considerately trying to remain quiet at this time of night, and her feet rise and descend with almost hypnotic precision, soaring slowly through the air before crushing down onto carpet fibres that flatten beneath her.  It's certainly slow enough that I can follow, cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at her pace, she pulls ahead of my tiny strides, and as we enter the kitchen area I stop trying, just watching as she walks up to the sink, creating a waterfall with a gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tall glass of water in her hand, Alice pulls a chair up at the table and sits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, she may be here for a while.  I could get up close to her while she is, and with her bare feet it should be easy to get her attention even if I do lack my voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I didn;t mind another climb, I could always try to scale up to the tabletop for a more subtle approach, if she sits there long enough to let me finish (maybe she'll check her phone?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I'm going to meet her tomorrow anyway, why try and get a sneak peak now?  I need sleep, and could always go back to Nikki's doorway and curl up there like a loyal puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too comfortable, that.  While Alice is here, I could check her room, se if I can at least find some small, comfy corner to call my own.  Or if that's too imposing, I could sneak past her in the kitchen toward the living area and couch.</span></div></div>",

Before long, I'm scaling up the side of the old, fraying couch, which isn't as hard as I expected. I think that has more to do with my lack of weight rather than my having any measurable upper-body strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, I'm atop a well-worn couch cushion. It's not as luxurious as Nikki's pillow, but I don't have to worry about a giant steamrolling me in my sleep, so I'll take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI doze off, wake up, doze off, wake up, rinse and repeat, for I don't know how long. The distant storm of Alice's titanic movements is enough to keep jolting me awake. I'm not sure what time it is, but Alice doesn't seem to be going back to sleep. Once I hear the shower water, I deduce that she must be an early riser, awakening at the crack of dawn to get a jump on the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood for her, but I never truly got to end yesterday, it feels like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pass out once again, only to awaken to the sound of footsteps--and no ordinary footsteps at that. No sign of Nikki, but Hurricane Alice is approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I get my first good view of Alice, dressed and ready for the day, and the un-evolved part of my animal brain goes straight to the objectification, sizing her up, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's not as pretty as Nikki, but not bad-looking by any means, though a slight hunch suggests some insecurity. She's a little thick around the hips, but her waist looks normal for someone of her impressive height. Many guys would prefer her body type over Nikki's skinny frame any day, but I still say Nikki has the most enchanting face I've seen in some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I have to keep reminding myself--this isn't what matters. They're people, with their own problems and their own strengths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glance out across the gulf between the couch and coffee table. On the latter, straight ahead, is a laptop computer. Alice steps into this vast gulf, like it's nothing, and she maneuvers to sit down. Apparently, I've taken her cushion of choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the size of her hips seems very relevant after all. I really hope no one accuses me of trying to cop a feel. I've got just a second before she sits on me...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the way Nikki has scrunched herself up, she's mostly looking at her own feet up on the bed. But occasionally, she glances across the floor, almost hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a wide open patch of bare carpet in the middle of the room -- thank goodness she's not a total slob! I rush to this spot and begin making myself as \"big\" as possible. I jump, I wave, I even shout and scream, for all the good that might do. I keep it up for several seconds, then a full minute, then even longer as Alice continues to console Nikki. I doubt Alice ever believed her -- she was probably just humoring her last night with that excuse about not wanting to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm just about ready to give up when Nikki's eyes land on the carpet, and her eyes grow huge -- the widest, happiest I've yet seen them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second, she's on the floor and gently scooping me up into her hand, and my entire view consists of her gorgeous, relieved face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I lost you!\" she says. \"I thought--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expect her to start crying, but then she moves in closer to me, her lips puckering up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kisses me, her lips covering much of my body. I fall back onto her hand, but then I pull myself right back up and start kissing back. We're making out, despite our extreme size difference, and it's surreal and wonderful, unlike anything I ever expected to experience. Her giant lips are pretty much everything to me as I lose myself in this moment, and I have zero fear of her getting too aggressive or forceful. She's rather perfect at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally pull apart and gaze into each other's eyes, and a shocked Alice leans down to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God.

Bethany is somehow even more terrifying now; having seen her on your scale, having her now as a towering monster reinforces the power she holds over you.  Her face even sports a wicked smirk, her eyes narrowed as she casts her gaze around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy contrast, the backlit Kirsten is like an angel from Heaven.  As perfect in appearance as I can remember, shame strikes me as I can't help but compare Nikki to this effigy of femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can pull my eyes away as she strides past, not knowing my ride by sight.  So, I scramble up from my place, slapping against Nikki's exposed skin until she looks down.  I point, her head turns, and she speaks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirsten?  Bethany?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus is the ice broken, both Kirsten and Bethany looking down at you as they sit.  The former smiles brightly, the latter widens a grin that is unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki gently plucks me up between finger and thumb, and I am placed on the table, overshadowed by cups and condiments, turning in place constantly to keep track of which of three goddesses is talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten lays her palm on the table beside me, but I am hesitant to leap aboard.  Before I met Nikki, this would be my dream come true; but now I am in a situation I could never have dreamed of!  I began trying to hit on women until one would like me, and now I'm torn between two gorgeous examples!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Bethany says, seeing my hesitation.  \"You can't trust this little prick, Kirsten.  For all his cries of being naive and vulnerable, he's just taking advantage of every woman he meets.  No doubt he's tried the same routine on you, Nikki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's not like that!  He was so small and scared, and needed me help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-hm.  Well girls, I tell you all that I need to take the guy for myself; like I already told Kirsten, I need to take him back to the witch otherwise I'm going back to being just his size.  I promise I'll take good care of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin somehow manages to get wider, hungrier, and scarier in the moment after that as she looks down at me.  Did our experience together mean nothing to her?  Or is it merely the witch putting her up to this - it would be useful to find out how she got back to normal size, and going with her would be the only way to accomplish that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs three thunderous voices talk above my head, treating me more like an object than a person, I am reminded once more of how poorly I've treated women in the past.  But still, I must show them a sign, make a decision for myself to drive this argument toward a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, being as pathetic as I am, I could climb down from here, leave them to it.  They're all better off without a man like me around.</span></div></div>",

Lana is in this apartment! She rises from the couch and approaches -- and she's enormous! This is only the second time I've seen someone I already knew from this perspective. But whereas I hadn't seen my old crush Amy in years, I see Lana virtually every day. And I normally have to look down at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, like everyone else, Lana appears to be around four hundred feet tall, which has the odd effect of only amplifying her natural attractiveness.

This wasn't what we talked about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch approaches and places a comforting hand on Lana's shoulder. \"I told you I could get them to bring him back, Lana. Here they are -- the witches who shrank your roommate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it's my skewed perspective, but the way the witch is looking at Lana ... I think she has a crush on my roommate! But Lana's straight! And wait, is that what this whole thing has been about? Am I just a pawn in the witch's attempt to woo Lana?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten marches forward. \"That's a lie!

As his roommate, I think I would know. That proves it, Courtney -- I don't know what these girls are up to, but this has to end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Lana,\" the witch, Courtney apparently, says. \"It will take some time, maybe days or weeks, but I might eventually figure out how to undo their spell.

I'm in much the same situation, but I've had worse today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bethany!\" I shout.  \"Snap out of it!  Don't let this bitch get Kirsten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a magic word, Bethany's brow lowers as she thinks of her friend.

In the dark, I have no idea what's going on out there, and I hardly move as the hand shifts position, held tight and safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's movement, gravity shifting ever so slightly, and then a quaking noise that shudders through the entire world as far as I can tell - I'm yelling in response, sure that the witch has cast some spell or other, that death is coming for me, and I'm being held tight by Bethany rather than Nikki or Kirsten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I live, and I blink as the hand peels open, light falling again upon me.  The palm's not entirely flat, and I lash out to grab the thumb to keep steady, looking down to see Courtney on the floor, a bruise already forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No spell protects from my right hook,\" Bethany laughs from above, and I remember all too well her ferocity in our shrunken fight.  Then I double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You punched her with me in your hand?  What were you thinking?  You could have crushed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRighting her hand and raising it before her triumphant face, Bethany explains it to me patiently, her expression stern and - once again - terrifying.  \"I was thinking that maybe you'd want to give her a punch yourself, and would appreciate me acting as your proxy.

I'll take all three of you, right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could, too.  She's always been proud of her martial arts classes.  So I shout and wave, getting her attention again, and close enough for her to hear me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana!  It's okay!  These three are trying to help me, and Courtney was the witch that did this to me!  I don't know why she's trying to set us against each other, but she must have a way of turning me back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana drops into a chair, sighing heavily.  \"Okay, Billy, this is a lot to take in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she has a spellbook or something?\" Kirsten says.  \"Let's search this place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Nikki agrees.  \"We're so close now!  Come here Billy, we can search together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest not play favourites right now - best to sort the emotional mess out once I'm the tallest person in the room again.  \"No, it's best if we all split up to find it.  Bethany - put me on the floor, I'll be able to find it if she's hidden it somewhere low!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's face falls, and Kirsten looks quickly between the two of us for a moment.  Lana stands again.  \"We got off to a bad start.  I'm Lana, Billy's room-mate.  Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others shake hands and apologise, Bethany lowers me to the ground, and I step off her hand.  As she stands again, I'm intimidated all over again by the four giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll watch where we step, tiny,\" Bethany laughs, stepping deliberately close to me as she walks away.  Her foot's impact topples me to the side, and I hurriedly scurry under a couch, wondering if Courtney hid her spellbook under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the five of us tear the apartment apart between us, but which of us will find the book first?  Whoever it is might have the temptation to make use of it for more than restoring my size...</span></div></div>",

She sits crisscross in front of me as she thumbs through the book. Kirsten and Nikki crouch beside us while Bethany keeps an eye on the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go,\" Lana says. \"This page has spells for shrinking, and...aha! A restoration spell! Looks like I just read these words and this will all be over! Then I want to hear all about your tiny little adventures, Billy. I still can't believe how this day is turning out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana reads the spell out loud, and a light washes over me. I feel a surge of energy flowing through me. Yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, no. The light fades, and I'm still looking at giant Lana. Everyone and everything else are still huge, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I mispronounced something?\" Lana says, squinting at the text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch laughs. \"I told you,\" Courtney says, massaging her bruise. \"When I shrank you the second time, it was permanent. You never had any chance of growing back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I call out. \"You mean I'm stuck like this for the rest of my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's eyes pop wide open. \"Your voice -- it's louder! I heard you perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI test my voice again, and sure enough, everyone can hear me clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That part wasn't permanent,\" Courtney says. \"I can sometimes be merciful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana, Kirsten, and Nikki all object on my behalf, but Courtney speaks over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of you are looking on the bright side. This guy was in a rut when I found him, trying to pick up random women on the street. He was so desperate. Such a loser. But thanks to me, he's had adventure. He's made new friends. He's met a girl he likes and who likes him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney looks at Nikki, who blushes as all other eyes fall on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All thanks to me,\" Courtney says. She, and her spellbook, begin to fade in a surreal glow. \"You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch vanishes. Deep down, I know I'll never see her again. I really am stuck like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana is the first to lower her head down to my level. \"Billy, I am soooo sorry. Don't worry, I'll take care of you, and maybe someday we can find a science-based or medical solution to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Lana. I guess I'm going to have to rely on you quite a bit.\" I turn to Kirsten, who also descends to the carpet. \"And thank you, Kirsten. You were the first friendly giant I met. If not for you, I would have been squished long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly couldn't leave you alone in your condition! But I really do hope we can stay friends. I'd be happy to fill in whenever Lana isn't able to watch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may take you up on that. And, Bethany--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany doesn't advance. She keeps her distance and mutters, half-smiling, \"I guess any friend of Kirsten is a friend of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, I turn to Nikki, who's sitting against the base of the couch and looking away, sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki? I would completely understand if you have no interest in dating a one-inch-tall guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'd understand if you don't want to date some big huge giant woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur eyes connect, and we realize what we both want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just take it slow,\" I say. \"I do have a lot of adjusting to do, and a lot of things to figure out, but I really would like to keep getting to know you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiles brightly. \"Yeah. Yeah! I'd like that, too. I don't care what your size is. You're bigger on the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI definitely wasn't yesterday.

Sorry, sorry, maybe I'm a little behind on my medication today.  But I found it!  Here it is!  Let me just find the page...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all wait as she pages through the comically-large tome in her hands.  Lana slumps onto the couch while Kirsten nervously shifts from foot to foot.  For her part, Bethany sits on the prone Courtney, keeping her from interfering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha!\" Nikki exclaims.  \"Here it is!  The cure for such a curse is...  Oh.

Only one person in the room is more than morose, her witch-like cackle drawing all attention back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think knowing someone for a day is enough to qualify as true love?\" Courtney grins.  \"Had Billy spent the night with Kirsten, who's to say she wouldn't feel like you do now?  You girls, mistaking an instant attraction as a destined romance!  Ha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at Lana there!  How long have you and Billy lived together?  You know each other intimately, as fully as two people can without actually coming together.  Is there no hint of love in that relationship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally, this lovely lady sitting on top of me.  Have you never seen a movie?  The couple that are antagonistic toward each other from the start always end up getting together at the end.  Don't tell me there's no attraction there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if!\" Bethany snorts, catching my eye for a second before blushing and looking aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Billy?\" Courtney taunts, staring across at me almost at my level.  \"Four women here, each of which has at least some claim to being your one, true love.  Yet you'd have to spend a lot more time with them to determine if it truly is a love for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong,\" I tell her, stepping forward as the standing women step back to give me room and safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No tiny, you can't just fixate on someone as your love so quickly.  That's just lust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I agree with that.  I mean that you're wrong about how many women here could be in love with me.  There are five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's her turn to blush, as I pace back and forward before her face, close enough that her breath gusts my hair.  \"You've lived here, above my apartment, for how long?  And I've never noticed you.  But did you notice me?  See me around, but never draw up the courage to talk to me?  And when, not so long ago, I actually spoke to you, you cursed me on instinct.  You regretted it later, came up with this crazy, convoluted plan, and it ended with you being sat on while someone else paws through your spellbook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless,\" Nikki interrupts, \"you're going to have to find your true love if you want to get back to normal, Billy.  We might have to, I don't know, take it in turns to get to know you a little better, develop our feelings.  When you do find your true love, you'll know.  And I know it'll be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, boy.  I started off hitting on random women on the theory that I was bound to find someone compatible eventually, and now I have a choice of five gorgeous giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not choice, really.  It's the same theory: one of these five has to be my true love, the woman I'll spend my life with.  Yet I'll have to work to discover which one, to offer more than a pick-up line.

But not well, either...Hurts to move...ow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m on the carpet, right behind that towering dresser, and I start hearing thunder...No, not thunder: Giant Ass\u2019s footsteps.  She\u2019s home.  And I\u2019m in no shape to escape.  Where would I even escape to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom...Thoom...THOOM...THOOM...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!  Where\u2019s my pet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push past the pain and crawl under the dresser, and through the other side I see her sneakers pointed at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I see her knees lowering onto the floor, and her head follows.  She angles her face sideways to get a good look under the dresser, and of course, she sees me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d she shouts, reaching her hand toward me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she can\u2019t reach.  She\u2019s too damn big.  For once, being tiny works to my advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know she can\u2019t hear me, but I have to gloat.  \u201cHa!  Shame you can\u2019t fit your giant ass down here, huh, Giant Ass?  You can\u2019t get me, nyah, nyah, nyah--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face disappears, and her shoes take its place in my view.  She walks to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I see where this is going...but no...She couldn\u2019t possibly lift this huge thing...even though she herself is humungous...I mean...Isn\u2019t it too heavy for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently not.  The dresser moves, and I\u2019m treated to a worm\u2019s-eye view of my gigantic captor.  She definitely has the height advantage.  And I\u2019m too wounded to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bends down to snatch me up, I have to confess:  She looks really hot in those exercise tights.</span></div></div>",

Bethany convinced Kirsten to shrink and won\u2019t grow her back, which means...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s up to me. I have to save Kirsten and help her get back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I wonder...That pill would probably restore me, too, wouldn\u2019t it? Really, only one of us needs to grow back, and then we can track down that witch to restore the other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing\u2019s first...Bethany\u2019s chair of choice is no place for a person my size to be hanging out on.

And where are they? What have you done with them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Bethany\u2019s turned into some kind of serial shrinker now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab her jeans and begin my descent, carefully grabbing the grooves in the fabric.

She\u2019s coming over in a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy downward climb continues as I learn more about what happened during my time in the hamster cage. I knew Bethany wasn\u2019t pleasant, but to shrink all her best friends...and to teach them what lesson? To stay away from boys? The crazy lady\u2019s actually teaching them to stay away from herself. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s more insane -- Bethany or the witch who started all this in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten pleads for her friend. \u201cNo, Bethany! Don\u2019t shrink Jean! I can\u2019t believe I actually need to say this -- on a number of levels -- but you don\u2019t shrink people against their will. Can\u2019t we just talk? Like normal people? At normal size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost there. My arms are beginning to feel the strain. Climbing\u2019s tough work -- even climbing down.

You think you have to be a giant for me to listen to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, God. My arms are slipping...Just a little more...Dammit, that\u2019s not happening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slip off her ankles and bounce off her socked foot onto the hard floor. Her foot saves me from serious injury, but the final impact is still far from pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh!\u201d I shout, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany slides the chair back and stands.

It's but step one before I attempt the woman's midriff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation above me turns to a series of demands from Bethany, and eventually the far too big-hearted Kirsten accedes to her pet's request for food.  \"Stay there,\" she says, \"and I'll get us a little snack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes!  Should I cling tight to Kirsten as she launches herself and walks off?  I might slip and fall, but I'd be out and about.  The other option is to jump back to the chair again, where I'd be alone with Bethany, but completely out of her sight and hearing.</span></div></div>",

And I\u2019ll prove you\u2019re faking this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoves me right off the table. Whoa! The crazy--! I\u2019m falling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I don\u2019t fall for long. I crash onto the chair below, right in the middle of the cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot believe that crazy Bethany. Why is Kirsten friends with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seat is huge. People must have some really big butts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair jolts. I look up and see Kirsten getting ready to sit down -- right on top of little ol\u2019 me. She\u2019s just going to plop right down now and ask questions later. Considering how much larger she is than me, I can\u2019t let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can yell up and stop her right now, but then I\u2019d have to come clean on why I don\u2019t want to talk to Ashley. But Kirsten\u2019s merely curvy, not fat, and I\u2019m really small, so there\u2019s room for the both of us. I can outrun her, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The whole time we\u2019re jogging across the store, she keeps staring up at the bookshelves like a tourist in New York, and she slows down whenever there\u2019s an opportunity for giant-people-watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fun part for me, however, is having her hand in mine. It\u2019s nice that it fits. Come to think of it, I am probably the only person in the whole world who is the right size for her. It\u2019s like a strange kind of intimacy -- we\u2019re the only people who see the world this way. Maybe this shrinking thing isn\u2019t all that bad. I\u2019m almost thankful the witch shrank us. As long as it\u2019s temporary, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe come across a guy using an embarrassing pick-up line on some pretty girl.

Behind you!\u201d Kirsten says in a silly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy turns around, and the girl seizes the opportunity to get away.

That\u2019s Jean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. My. God. I see the young woman standing in the checkout line carrying a small stack of books, and she is the most physically perfect woman I have ever seen. The face, the long hair, the waist-to-hips ratio, the legs...Perfection.

Down here, lots of really, really big people can easily step on me, but the way this really, really big Kirsten girl is crouched down to clean up that spill, I can probably get myself very far away from all the giant shoes with relatively little work on my part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here goes. I hop onto her khaki pants and from there, I throw myself up onto her horizontal back. I\u2019ve got time for maybe one more hop before she stands up, so I launch myself toward her shoulder, and there I cling as she rises to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging on just below her shoulder, I glance straight down, and I see her rather curvy butt sticking out, blocking some of my view of the hard floor over a thousand feet below me (relatively speaking, of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she starts walking, it\u2019s an infinitely smoother ride than her shoe was. Yeah, I made the right call here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI perch my little ant-sized self on top of her shoulder as she catches up with her friends right outside the coffee shop on their way to the book store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listen to their conversation, and no one notices me. (At this size, they\u2019d have to be actively looking for me to notice me.) I pick up some useful tidbits along the way. The big one is that these are all college girls, ranging from sophomore to senior, so that\u2019s good. (It\u2019s hard enough telling how old some girls are at normal size, but just try figuring it all out from this crazy new perspective.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I pick up on everyone\u2019s name and get a general first impression:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m on Kirsten, of course, a pretty blonde who\u2019s clearly demonstrated some sense of responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there\u2019s Bethany, a petite (you know what I mean) pretty brunette who seems to smile the least out of all them. Don\u2019t know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren is a giant among giants. I\u2019m guessing in real people measurements, she must be six feet tall, easily. And she\u2019s got a quirky sense of humor. She\u2019s also nice looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s just kind of eh. She seems nice enough, I guess, but she\u2019s got just a few extra pounds on her, and she\u2019s just not really my type. Not hideous, no, just not for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there\u2019s...Wow. There\u2019s Jean, an absolutely stunning redhead with a classically beautiful face, and I just love the way she wears those high boots and miniskirt. Always a great combo. I haven\u2019t heard her say as much as the others, though, but in terms of looks, she\u2019s got the rest beat, hands-down, and that\u2019s saying a lot in this group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I\u2019ve completed my assessment, this quintet is in the bookstore, browsing some shelves. They\u2019re browsing in a line, more or less, with Kirsten (and me) checking out one end and Jean all the way down on the other. I think they might be about to break off into smaller groups for a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might be able to leap from girl to girl and eventually latch myself onto gorgeous Jean. But sticking with Kirsten is certainly no bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I want to accept the Door Number One prize or take a shot at Door Number Two?</span></div></div>",

And those fingernails are targeting my shoulder -- well, it\u2019s her shoulder, but it\u2019s my ride.

But it turns out my hop was on a slight angle, so I\u2019m not hopping on her shoulder. I\u2019m hopping over the back of her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, at my size, I\u2019m pretty damn light, and I fall slowly. But I\u2019m starting a couple-thousand feet in the air. Can I survive that fall? I\u2019m not feeling like a betting man today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlan A is to reach for her shirt and grab on, but I\u2019m already too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I look down and see Plan B approaching. That\u2019s B for her butt, which sticks out like a curved airport runway to me. It\u2019s a crude strategy, but my life is legitimately on the line here. My only hope is that I don\u2019t stray too far from it, which my trajectory suggests is a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I intercept, I\u2019ve almost blown it entirely. I have to reach out to grab the very end of her rear end. Just barely, I latch onto the fabric of her khaki pants and pull myself in. I give myself a moment to catch my breath, realizing that I might have died if Kirsten was just a little skinnier. Hooray for love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway. This is interesting, hanging out on a giant young woman\u2019s ass. Not how I thought my day would go, but there you have it. Each direction I look, north, south, east and west, nothing but a vast expanse of curved khaki. Acres and acres of the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I look behind me, and I see the \u201cpetite\u201d girl, Bethany, staring straight at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, is she checking out her friend\u2019s butt? Her female friend\u2019s? Is Bethany a lesbian?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from that look on her face, Bethany is either really surprised by Kirsten\u2019s shape, or she\u2019s seen me.

And as I behold her visage, I am forced to reconsider my previous assertion that a woman stops beimng attractive past the age of thirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman must be past forty, but beyond the wrinkles at the edges of her astonished eyes, one could hardly tell.

Do you have a moment to help my friend here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe business lady looks down at me, and I smile nervously.  \"Thank you for your time.  I know your time is precious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more I'm growing, almost two inches tall?  I stagger against Yolanda's thumb for balance as she turns again: I want to thank my carrier, but she's already on to the next person.  Miriam have moved and it's her turn to be served.  She's finishing giving her order as she raises her hand before the barista's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's young, her jaw going slack as she sees a shrunken man.  \"Do... do you want to order anything?\" she manages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you, but thank you for seeing me as a person and not a curiosity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYolanda is claiming a table halfway between the counter and the door as I grab my third inch of height, and her hand rests unpon the surface, allowing me to clamber off unsteadily.  \"Thanks for all this,\" I say as she sits, a looming mountain even at that reduced capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins and looks over me.  I turn, hoping for the next woman, but see instead the outstretched hand of a young boy, poweful fingers splayed ready to crush me with his unthinking strength.  \"Cool toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Luke!  That's not a toy, it's a person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look beyond the terrifying giant to the tired woman holding his other hand, and nod my appreciation.  \"You're doing a wonderful job with your son, ma'am,\" I manage.  Luke withdraws not just at my deep, manly voice, but also at my spurt of growth doubling me to six inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI totter at the table edge until Yolanda grabs my collar and pulls me toward safety.  The boy and his mother move on, and I watch the epic display that is a cup of coffee being handed between giants before Yolanda turns to the next table.  \"Hey, girls, wanna help my little friend here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, two young girls stoop before me, brushing hair over their ears as they clammer close for a look-see.  At this scale I can see the crudity of the make-up, sense the fakness of the perfume: these two have, in an effort to improve their attractiveness, hidden their true beauty behind these modern fads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, girls!  Thank you, both of you, for taking an interest!  I wish you both the best of luck today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey giggle and stand, and I jump in height in two distinct bursts, sending me dancing back and forth across the tabland nearly knocking over Yolanda's coffee.  When it's over with, I'm two feet in height and Yolanda claps in appreciation.  \"Shall we take this outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her assistance I climb to the ground, holding tight to her trouser leg as she strides through the milling press of customers.  I get many stares from a variety of giants more than twice my height, but what fear I may have known is washed away by the reassuring presence of the giantess guiding me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the air of Seventh Street smells almost pleasant, the thinned numbers of titans easing my mind.  Yolanda picks a direction and we walk off, like a mother and her very precocious child.  More than likely, most of the people we pass see us as just that, not looking closely enough to notice my adult proportions.  Probably for the best.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne figure does stop before me.  Walking with a stick, hunched and gnarled, the old lady peers at me from behind thick glasses, rolling teeth in her mouth before speaking.  \"Well now!  How did you get so small, young man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you've a good eye, young miss!  I assure you, it's temporary, and you needn't worry for my safety!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho'd ever have thought that a grandmother would be one of the ten giving me my height?Yet here I am, growing to three feet in height thanks to her!  I step to one side to allow her to pass, then almost jump as Yolanda's hand intrudes into my vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold tight as we cross the road,\" she says, and I allow her to grasp my miniscule mitt in her great grasp.  Now, tall enough to be guided by her in this way, the illusion of mother and child is complete!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe cross, and the next generous woman almost knocks me over.  Of course she's taller than me, but so much bigger in every way that I almost goggle my eyes.  She's obese, and I know that she'll somehow blame me - me!  the child-sized guy! - for our collision, take offence and get angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry there,\" she says, stepping back and raising her hands.  \"I didn't see you!  Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting there,\" I tell her, as I creep up to over four feet tall.  \"You're so very considerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she's shocked by my growth, she doesn't show it.  Yolanda squeezes my now bigger hand, her strength still considerably greater than my own.\"One more to go!\" she squeals with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a change you're undergoing there,\" says a voice from behind me.  Pulling free from Yolanda, I turn to actually look down at someone for the first time in forever. That's because she's cradled in a wheelchair, her head tilted to one side and what looks like her only working hand tapping at a joystick controlling her pathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels good to see someone else able to push beyond their limits,\" she says, and as I look over her twisted face, no sexual desire at all in me, I feel for this woman.  Trapped as she is, and yet she can still find some care and consideration for other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" I tell her, the simple phrase all that's needed to convey my emotion.  No fancy wordplay, nothing like that.  Just honest, human empathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, I'm my regular height again.  \"Can I help -\" I begin, but wheelchair-lady turns and leaves.  She doesn't want my charity.  But there is someone that I must thank for extending to me theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a more even footing, I can see why I was so quick to look past Yolanda at first glance.  But she's undeniably an attractive woman, and the care she's shown me today is worth even more than that.  I step forward, taking her hand and feeling so, so secure at knowing that mine is greater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I really need to thank you for all your help.  Do you fancy another cup of coffee, maybe?\"  Is this a winning smile, I wonder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles back, but raises her free hand, waggling the fingers to show the ring she wears.  \"Sorry, taken.  No need to thank me - I just thought to help someone in trouble.  Just do the same for me if it happens, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" I laugh, and then she waggles her fingers again in a farewell wave, turning and walking out of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on hips, I breathe in what feels like a new life.  My shrunken adventure seemed like days, but must have been over in an hour or two at most.  I hate to think what may have happened had I not been so bold as to approach Miriam...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriam stands before me as crowds part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was you earlier, wasn't it, Billy?  What was going on?  No, never mind.  I just...  I never stopped thinking about you, you know?  Wondering what it was that I did wrong in our relationship.  To hear you confess...\"</span></div></div>",

The resulting earthquake sends me flying up into the air, as her shoelace whips toward me.  My instincts tell me to grab the lace, so I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really the greatest decision I ever made.  But given that I'm an eighth of an inch tall (if I'm being optimistic) clearly I haven't been making great decisions lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, at my size, the lace has become incredibly textured.  It's easy to find grooves to dig my hands into and hang on.  Doesn't make it any more comfortable, as the lace lashes around in every direction--up, down, right, left, and everything in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!  It's like riding a really old roller coaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not going to last forever.  I'll probably be flung off before she decides to stop running.  Or I'll get some kind of head injury.

I latch onto the knot of the lace and continue to cling for dear life.  Her footfalls still give me headaches, but it's relatively stable.  But now to enact my master plan.  To save myself, I must--<i>untie her shoelace!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not the easiest thing to do at my size, but I can at least tug at the rope and loosen it.  And I better do it quick, because really, her thunderous feet are giving me the worst migraine ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes several moments, but eventually, success!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant jogger notices her loose shoelace flapping around, so she slows to a stop.

I hop up (which, I must admit, is actually kind of fun, as long as I don\u2019t think too much about the fact that my \u201csuper-hop\u201d carries me only about a foot or so) and I drop into the massive chasm between zipper sides, and I do it just in the nick of time.

That is not a pleased expression on that goddess' face, it certainly is not.  And she must know it, as she bends lower, bringing that face a finger's breadth from mine.  \"Good.  Maybe that will encourage you to stay put.  You want my help, you play by my rules.  Stay here - get your pal up here as well - and we'll talk properly once I'm ready.  If you're not standing right in this spot when I get back, you're nothing but bugs to be crushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands lean gently on the table at that last word, their subtle impact still vibrating through the ground beneath me.  When she adds \"Got it?\", I nod.  I've got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rises again, turning quickly enough to spin me in her wake, sliding across the table surface.  I look up in time to see her massive ass exiting through the door to the shower room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" your friend whispers, clearly having learned quickly, \"are we gonna stay here like that psycho bitch wants?\"</span></div></div>",

For that, I think you deserve a reward.  You like pop tarts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, she crosses to the kitchen area, fishing a box from a cabinet and popping a pair of gigantic snacks into the toaster.

I glance across at Clive, but he just shrugs.  Fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A witch shrunk us.  She cursed us because she randomly took a dislike to us, but there is a cure.  We just need to compliment nine more women, each one of them restoring a little of our height.  Uh, also we have voices as loud as a normal person, and can jump super-high for how small we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's expression doesn't change as she watches and listens to the tiny man on her table.  I jump at the sudden noise as the toaster disgorges its cooked goods, and involuntarily step back as the woman paces closer with a plate of pop tarts in hand.  She crashes down onto the sofa, yet still looms over us, her voice almost bored as she tells us to \"look out below.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate, no doubt placed gently by the giant woman, impacts strongly enough to rock both Clive and myself, and with trepidation we bring our half-inch tall selves closer it.  A simple hop brings us up onto the surface, and then there's just the heap of steaming food.  Not only is it hot to the touch, but the shell is too tough for my puny teeth - even a punch or two - to break the surface!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Clive that shows me the way, jumping atop the pop tart and digging into the gooey sugar coating up there.  Soft and sweet, and full of the energy we'll need to get through this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner have I dug into my meal than I'm shaken as the second pop tart, its upper surface area bigger than a house, is lifted into the air by Claire.  She does so with one hand, and a speed that takes my breath away.  Then she tears into it with teeth the size of Clive, wrenching the tart apart and destroying it with noisome chomps of her powerful jaw.  And as she effortlessly destroys a monument that I can only lick at, it's all too real how much easier she would find it to crush my fragile body.  It would take but a moment, at her merest whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she says, mid-mouthful, spraying head-size chunks of toast across the room.  \"You want me to believe that you got shrunk through bad luck?  Yeah...  I know for a fact that you -\" a truck-sized finger points to Clive \"- are a sleazebag who treated me like a piece of meat, and got what you deserved.  I think you're the same, buddy.  In this case, I think you're guilty until you can prove yourself innocent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  But I never touched anyone!  I just said hello to a girl -!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Claire cuts me off, pausing only to crunch through the remains of the pop tart before continuing.  \"I'm going to take your protests with a pinch of salt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step forward to plead again, but Claire's hand moves in, upending a glass silo and pouring a pyramid of white rocks down onto the remaining pop tart.  Clive, who hasn't paused in his feast, recoils from it after a touch.  \"Eugh, she's just poured a whole salt shaker onto it!  Crazy bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear that I'm in the process of reprimanding him when Claire strikes.  Clive and I are mashed uncomfortably together as a huge finger and thumb squeeze us, lifting us into the air with rough, roaring ridges of skin at our backs.  We're at the edge of consciousness as she ever so gently releases us to crash down onto solid glass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she screws the lid on, it's clear where we are: inside the now-empty salt shaker.  Claire shakes it side to side as she lifts it before her humungous eye, smiling gently as we tumble about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she tells us, \"since I can't trust you not to jump away when my back's turned, you're going to stay in there for the time being.  You've got air, but you're going nowhere.  Maybe, if you prove yourselves to be decent people after all, I'll let you out of there, and maybe we'll see about breaking that curse.  For now though, I gotta get dressed, and you're sure as Hell not getting to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaker is placed up on a high kitchen shelf, and Claire winks and blows a kiss before striding away toward her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she's just kidding,\" Clive says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Or did your 'crazy bitch' line really piss her off?\" I shout, turning on the guy whose contribution to my life since meeting him has solely been making it more difficult.  \"When will you learn to keep your mouth shut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just a bitch, man.  Who knows what set her off?  Probably just that time of the month, yeah?  Lighten up!  She'll come around.\"</span></div></div>",

Tipping the salt shaker would bash Clive around badly, and while I know that won't do him any more harm, that's a worry for her.

I can see nothing beyond it, and my arms can do nothing to relieve the indignity, but my legs are able to kick freely out in the air, a small show of protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy legs remaining out from under her thumb turns out not to be accidental; a second colossal force exerts itself on my right leg, and I fear it will snap.  My scream is swallowed by the skin above me, the only reply the thundering beat of Claire's pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments I am released, looking down to see my leg intact, albeit with a weighty metal chain clamped around the ankle.  It's strong-looking, some old-school medieval manacle, yet knowing that I'm only half an inch tall, my heart sinks when I realise that it's probably just some petite jewellery chain re-purposed.  That's all it takes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my right, I can see from outside the whole process: Clive is engulfed beneath Claire's mass, and her free hand crudely snaps the other end of chain around his left ankle with a single, powerful motion.  He's turning the air blue with his language as he's released, and in response the giantess swats him with her pinky finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClive tumbles over, and I am carried along, even our combined weight nothing to a regular-sized person.  I stand up and ready myself to jump to Clive, only to find the heavy chain too much, holding me down.  I may have immense jumping power, but only enough to carry my own body mass; much over that and I'm grounded: Claire's hypothesis confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she says, folding her arms, \"that wasn't so bad, was it?  Now I know that you two aren't going to go jumping off, getting underfoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're your prisoners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA finger is raised in clarification.  \"Pets.  This is really no different to giving a dog a collar and leash.  It may seem strange now, but you'll get used to it, I'm sure.  Now, come to momma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire lays her hand flat on the towel I'm standing on, and since jumping is now out of the question I tug on the chain to get Clive to join me in trudging over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna take this, are you?\" he whispers.  \"What more evidence do you need that this is a bad idea?  Look, if we jump together I'm sure we can carry this fucking chain with us.  We need to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he have a point, I wonder?</span></div></div>",

They can't impress someone with a cutting line - as this girl is demonstrating marvellously!

You share so much, could she be something more than a one-off line?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe utters another line at a rapidly departing male.  On the other hand, she does seem rather desperate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you could leave her alone entirely, seeing too much of yourself in this broad - you need to grow as a person, and you can't do that if you ask for help from yourself...

In fact, she takes a step back, and I hear a great inrush of air from her gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the man of your dreams, baby!\" I announce.  \"You and me, we're not so different!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you're the size of an ant, buddy!\" she tells me, stooping down to give me a better look at her gigantic, plain features.  Lacking make-up, her too-long nose, chapped lips and bushy eyebrows stand out to me, and I can see why she's had no takers on her approaches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're no oil painting!\" I retort, hoping that honesty really is the best policy.  \"But neither of us are getting dates asking randos on the street, so how about we pair up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at that, and then her gigantic hand swoops down at me, cracked and bitten nails sporting traces of chipped polish bigger than I am.  Yes, bigger; I have gotten no growth from talking to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of her forefinger smashes into me, and while winded I grasp onto the ridges of fingerprint tight, to me more like ledges the thickness of my torso.  Effortlessly I am borne aloft by the goddess, and her breath washes over me like scalding fog as she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll pass, thanks.  Tell you what, I won't crush you, and you shut your mouth.  We cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over my shoulder, I see her narrowed eyes, my pathetic form reflected in their sheer surfaces.  \"We can talk about this, baby!\" I say.  \"I'll accept you for who you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, and scrapes her finger against a surface that knocks me from it, and into a new place.</span></div></div>",

The hairdresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyself, I get a quick trim every now and then from the local barber, but women - I generalise greatly here, another of my flaws - can spend hours at a time having appointments to get their hair styled, coloured and sculpted.  The foot traffic the place sees in an average day is immense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as I approach I discover that the feet that are part of that traffic are themselves immense to me now, and I'm hopping continuously to keep from being crushed beneath the virtual stampede of whale-sized shoes coming and going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'm inside, I tell myself, it'll be a lot safer.  There, the women will be sitting down, not stamping every available inch of the ground around me with their weight.  They'll also be talking with the attendants as they have their hair done, and that will be enough for me to detect a 'worthy' target for my compliments!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm so smart sometimes, I surprise myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lean back against the doorframe to catch my breath after the marathon I just ran, and quietly observe the variety of footwear than strides by, impossible behemoths zooming by at incalculable speeds to a man of my size.  But I mustn't let them intimidate me, if I'm to approach and talk with these goddesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where to?  I could approach one of the customers, leaning comfortable back in an elevated chair, listen in on her talk and then strike with a compliment.  But since the staff here are such good listeners, perhaps I should instead sneak up on one of them for my first target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they will be absorbed with each other, and may prove confused if I jump in on their conversations.  I could always go to the waiting area, where women are sitting and flipping through magazines while they count down the time to their own appointment; quieter, more personal...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A young 20-something guy wants to be better with women, so he goes out one day with the intent of flirting with random women he encounters in hopes that one of them will find him attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first target is a beautiful young woman who's not so beautiful on the inside.  This woman is a genuine witch who feels our protagonist sees women as objects rather than people, so she casts a spell that shrinks him down to the size of an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch tells him his challenge is this:  He must flirt with 10 women that he finds attractive both outside and inside.  As each one of these women notices him (even if they don't realize he's a person) he will grow a bit bigger until after the tenth woman, when he will back to full size.  If he flirts with a woman who's merely pretty, no growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a story about learning to appreciate women beyond their physical appearance.  Yes, macrophilia is a part of the story, but it is not the entire story.  The women he encounters should be characters, not cup sizes, please.  Remember, he's learning how not to objectify women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI encourage everyone to add to the story.  Join in on the fun, please.  I'd especially love to see a good mix of male and female writers contributing.  Feel free to add to any thread; I have no grand master plan here.  Challenge your own creativity.  Please be consistent with the preceding chapters.  You can create any sort of characters you like, but nothing sexual with minors.  Also, nothing graphically sexual, please.  It's rated 18+, not X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you to those who have already added!</td>",
