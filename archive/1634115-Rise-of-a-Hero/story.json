Crash!<br>\r\n  \"You have always been a nuisance, interfering with the punishment of others.\" Said Darrel, the operator of the orphanage, as he continues to throw things at a skinny six year old boy that somehow dodges every time.<br>\r\n  \"Only when they were too extreme or unjustly given.  Even I know that pulling down the pants and underwear of one of the adolescent girls, and spanking her in front of everyone just because she was a little late finishing her chores is way out of line.  Not to mention that you get a perverted look on your face as you grab her bum just before smacking it.\" Replied Bryan, who is finally tripped up by one of the objects laying about and lands painfully on the floor.<br>\r\n  \"Not so tough now are you?\" Says Darrel as he thumps Bryan on the head to daze him a bit more, just before he walks out the front door, locks it behind him, and tosses Bryan in the trunk of his car.<br>\r\n  Some time later they are in the middle of a nowhere part of town.  Darrel parks the car by an alley, grabs Bryan from the trunk, and tosses him into the alley.  Seeing that his work is done Darrel speeds off in a cloud of smog.  <br>\r\n  Arriving back home at the orphanage, he becomes scared as he sees a half-dozen constables scouring the premises. Hoping that he hasn't been ratted out for all the dirty things he's done, he calms himself down as he pulls up near the orphanage.</span></div></div>",
