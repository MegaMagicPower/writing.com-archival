            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a rainy night over at the Tipsy Mountain, a tavern located in the middle of nowhere. True to it's name, it was based at the foot of a mountain outside of a lumber town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in walks a patron that makes the heads of mean turn sharply, one of them even spat out his drink into his beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tall, with a pointy wizard's hat on her crown as she sashayed through the crowd. She had a confident smirk about her as she donned a dark purple dress with a white top of sorts, then again, said top couldn't contain the great chest that was bouncing to and fro with each walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the Sorceress, a beautiful vixen and a master of the dark arts. She flicked aside some of her long red hair, and her auburn-brown eyes scanned the crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Typical average men. Going bonkers over me. What else is new?' She mentally said out loud as she shrugged. The sorceress raised a hand, and almost instantly a waiter came over, knees shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes ma'am?\" He asked, face deep pink and smiling like a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4 Steins of the best mead you got.\" She reached into her chest and pulled some several gold coins. \"On the double. Oh,\" she turned around. \"This table is saved so don't think none of you can sit over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA collection of groans rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-On it ma'am!\" And the waiter ran off, leaving the Sorceress to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they? Didn't that man in the letter tell us to meet here?\" She pondered outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" Said a voice which made the vixen jump, turning around and ready to chastise but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her was an average height man dressed in black robes of sort, but not too long to impede movement. He had a dark green undershirt and had dark brown boots of sort. His skin was olive, but exactly dark but more of the line of the exotic peoples of the east yet his facial structure looked more like a westerner. He had shoulder long silver hair and piercing gold orbs that looked like jewels. He was scowling a bit and looked annoyed but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OHMEGODHESAHOTTY!' Thought the Sorceress to herself, being taken back and having hearts in her eyes and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your acting weird. Sit down.\" The man sat at the table with her sitting next to her and looking stoic. Sorceress shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Calm down calm down! Just take it slow...play it cool...' She thought to herself. She then smirked a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you the one who sent the letter?\" She shuffled in her seat a bit, hoping to show some of her cleavage a bit. Now she isn't above above using her body to get what she wants, but she wouldn't sell herself for sex. Sorceress had standards. But this ripe olive hunk...she was gonna play her cards just how she plays them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I am the Thief who sent you the letter. And you're clearly the Sorceress.\" Said Thief as his eyes looked over to her, not at all looking down at her breasts but at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter soon returned with four steins of mead, and hurried along when he saw the glare Thief gave him. \"I see you ordered us drinks. My thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorceress blushed a bit. He was complimenting and thanking her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh! It's no worry at all, I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the door opening cut off Sorceress as she turned her head, while Thief simply took a sip. He had a feeling who was here judging by the footsteps.</span></div></div>",

Loud, heavy footsteps clattered from the outside, the wooden porch creaking under the pressure. As the door opened, a towering figure knelt down slightly to fit themselves through. Inside, everyone got a good look at the new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell over seven feet tall, this was a woman with long flowing blonde hair and not much clothing or armour. She wore long boots, black gauntlets, a bra and matching thong. Aside from the additional accessory in her hair, she didn't wear anything else, which allowed all to get a good look at her excessively muscular body. Everything was toned greatly, from her arms and legs to her torso. With a body like hers, her strength rivalled that of even the strongest men in the town. In her hands, she possessed a grand axe, two handed and just as tall as she was. There was no chance anyone in the tavern could even dream of wielding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking across the tavern, each footstep rattling mugs and items on the tables, her pretty face spied the robed male and the busty female in front of her stride. Noticing, she approached and sat down at the table with a mighty thud. The stares were prolonged, now she sat at the same table as the Sorceress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you made it Amazon.\" Thief mused. \"Glad you could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazon stared at the table disappointed. \"I was expecting some good mutton. Ah, the mead will do me fine either way.\" She gripped the mug and downed the drink in a single gulp. Her gaze turned to the Sorceress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again.\" A simple smile rose to her face. \"Long nights hitting the books as per usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good man once said knowledge is power.\" She replied. \"You Amazon are naturally strong, I need to work from the ground up to learn my magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point.\" Amazon noted. \"Humans must have it rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, the tavern door swung open again, leading to the entrance of another member of the party.</span></div></div>",

What do you mean by that?\" He asked slightly turning his head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You wanna know?\" Asked Amazon. She slammed a fist on the table. \"Oui!\" She called out and once more the jittery knee'd waiter returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your best meat and alchohol?\" She asked, violet eyes piercing into the teen. The waiter was nervous and thinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She asked in an impatient voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have some mutton, s-some pork and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Bring this table one leg of each the biggest meat you got. And a keg of mead. And make it snappy!\" She tossed some gold coins his way, but she added on a glare. \"Or else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter was gone in a flash, leaving behind a dust cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly was that necessary?\" Asked Sorceress resting her head on her palm, cleavage showing more and more. \"You almost gave the poor child a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry and I demand food. Besides I paid him in gold, much more better than copper or silver. He should be thankful.\" Scoffed the Amazon. \"And I work better with a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it weren't for your height I'd mistake you for a dwarf,\" commented Thief sarcastically. Amazon rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you're not far off. I'm actually a quarter dwarf.\" She tallied off using her fingers. \"Quarter giant. Quarter human. And quarter god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorceress and Thief raised their eyes in surprise. Amazon looked around confused. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm just surprised.\" Laughed Sorceress to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThief took a sip of mead. \"I bet you have an interesting family life.\" He commented dryly. The warrior blonde rolled her eyes and leaned back, making the chair sqeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about. Let tell you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...hello.\" Said a voice from the other end of the table, making all the occupants turn their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere at the end of the round table was a young girl with platinum blonde hair done in two braids, her eyes brown and she was donning a brown cloak with a bow and arrow quiver strapped to her back. Her figure was petite and lithe but incredibly athletic, her eyes sharp and poised. What was unique about her was her pointed ears, making her an-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elf.\" Thief mused, smiling a bit. \"You arrived.\" The Elf shrugged and sat down. The Sorceress notice that the handsome olive skinned rogue smiled for the first time when seeing the elf. She paid attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old friends?\" Asked the dark magician. Thief nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense. We worked together back in the past several times. Elf's expertise as a tracker and marksman is without match.\" Elf rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are elves better than me. I'm just no as xenophobic as they are.\" Amazon blew out some hair from her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me. So then rogue,\" she turned towards the Thief. \"I take it this is our party you wonderously gathered? What is the goal exactly, because you promised that I would face some worthy battles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to that,\" said the Thief. He stared out, serious and grim.</span></div></div>",

His face red in strain, he practically dropped the contents of his hands onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"En...Enjoy....\" He spluttered breathlessly before walking away slowly, gasping after the massive order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Amazon's feelings on the matter did not change. \"After all that and THIS is what they consider their best meat?\" Picking up the largest of the meats, a fresh sizzling hot leg of what must have been a very overweight cow, she sunk her teeth into it and savoured it's flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmpgh...better than nothing.\" She decided, quickly tearing the meat from the bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have myself something too....do you want any?\" Sorceress motioned towards Thief. She wanted to make a good first impression for him, which she hoped would lead onto talking with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer, but no thanks.\" He waved his hand to confirm his refusal. Her face dipped to a slight pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a little if that's okay.\" Elf added, taking a spare plate over to the pile of meats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering quickly from the rejection, Sorceress nodded in agreement. \"Okay Elf, I gotcha.\" Tearing away meat with her hands, she placed it onto the plate and passed it back over to Elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget we got plenty of mead.\" Amazon tapped the top of the barrel, which she was currently guzzling with reckless abandon. Spare liquids missed her mouth and ran down her chiselled body, the wet skin turning many more heads in the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sorceress and Elf enjoyed their own shares of the meal. Using her hands to the fullest extent to tear and rip the meat, she enjoyed the flavours and the juices, a sign of good cooking. Elf ate hers slower and more neater, which evened out nicely compared to the pacing of the other girls due to the small size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThief merely recalled the details of the quest in his head, waiting patiently for the girls to finish up.</span></div></div>",

Elf seems to have only had a small amount, cleaning her lips with a napkin with some elegance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy it?\" Asked Thief, eyes turning towards the archer. Elf took noticed and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer more organic and natural, but nothing wrong with a change of pace. I mean, not all elves are vegans,\" she commented. \"It's such a stereotype really. We don't detest eating meat. We just don't eat it as much as the other races do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThief turned his attention towards the boneyard Amazon is making, with several rib, leg, and breast bones the size of a cat all being stacked up. The Amazon leaned back, sighing in relief as a blush appeared on her face as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaaaat hit the spot.\" She grinned, clearly tipsy a bit. \"Nothin's better than some mead and meat eh Sorcie?\" She asked, looking towards Sorceress who looked just as tipsy as she was. Maybe even more so, as Amazon's size allowed her to drink more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Amazon drank a keg and a half. Sorceress only has half a dozen steins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, yeah. You said it. So!\" Sorceress turned towards Thief with a grin and sway, making her chest sway in turn. \"What is our purpose for being here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" murmured Thief to himself. \"The reason why I gathered you all here is because there is a dire threat on the horizon that threatens to ruin the world.\" His tone was grim and serious, his golden orbs sharp. \"You know of the Stone Dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do,\" commented Sorceress nonchalantly and tipsy. \"They were the ones who ruled the world while human kind and all others lived in the labyrinths below, hence why there is great cities underground and in mountains. They were defeated when the races of the world banded together and defeated the Stone Dragons, and trapping them under the earth using some artifact. What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That artifact is the Dragons Crown, a crown made from unique gems that the races of the world found, all with terrifying magic power. There is a group that is attempting to revive the Stone Dragons once more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they need the Crown,\" said Elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. This group is called the Blood of the Star Cross, a cult who is dedicated to researching the ancient world and mythos. I heard the higher ups dug too deep and somehow got all crazy due to awakening...something. It drove them mad and now they are using their resources to hire mercernaries from all races, using spells to conjure elementals or demons to search for the Crown.\" Thief looked towards his party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is we come in. We need to stop the Blood of the Star Cross, and make sure the Crown is never found. Or, get the crown before they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you come across such info?\" Cooed Sorceress, nudging her seat closer to Thief, smiling drunkly. \"Torture a guy? Informant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was on a job to steal from these guys, and overheard a conversation between some higher ups. Now then, how about we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a nice belch from Amazon, garning everyone's attention and ire. Amazon giggled. \"'Scuse me. Just the mead settling down.\" She stood up and stretched. Sorceress did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThief's eyes went to their bloated middles, Amazon's more so than Sorceress'. If he had to compare, Amazon's rock hard abs seem to have disappeared into a large pregnant like belly as if she swallowed a baby lamb. It sloshed and churned with meat and mead. Amazon was smaller, about the size of a kicking ball, and she had a hand on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So~\" Asked Amazon, hands on her hips. \"When do we pop the heads of these Blood guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We leave tomorrow. We'll stay here for the night.\" He reached into his pocket to grab his coin pouch. \"I was only able to get one room, due to that this inn is full. I hope that isn't an issue?\"</span></div></div>",

Sleeping on the floor isn't new to me, I've had worse places to sleep.\" She gave her engorged stomach a few pats. \"Probably shouldn't opt for the sleeping on the front style tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElf couldn't help but stare. \"I know you've got a much larger diet than us but don't you think this goes beyond simply over doing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazon smiled back, ruffling the much smaller girl's hair, knocking her hood off. \"This is nothing, it's mostly a beer belly. This'll shrink down by morning. Think of it as me giving my abs a quilt to sleep under!\" A cheerful laughter filled the air, waking up the dozing denizens of the inn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're all fine with it, let's get ourselves some rest.\" Leading the party up the stairs and into the area where the rooms belonged, he took the key and opened it up. The impressions weren't so positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder it was the only one you could get.\" Sorceress quipped. The room was clearly intended for one person, with very little space and the only contents being a sole bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the plus side that corner looks pretty neat for me.\" Amazon added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the main problem is finding somewhere to put that axe of yours.\" Elf said as she slumped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where you're wrong!\" Placing her trusty weapon against the outer wall of the room, Amazon ducked her head under the small doorway. \"There's no way someone is going to steal my axe. Far too heavy for your average bar room drunk to carry. Plus, they'll know that yours truly is staying here, so they better keep the noise down if they don't want their teeth made into a decorative necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate we'll not need to fight anyone.\" The well endowed magic user giggled. \"We can just get you to threaten everyone into submission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea!\" Amazon dropped onto the floor, leaning her head against the hard rock wall and dropping her massive body against the aged wood floors. Her hands were placed atop her full belly, churning with meat and mead. \"Now you lot get your bed arrangements sorted, I'm getting some winks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems we can just barely share this bed.\" Thief mentioned, after looking at it's dimensions. \"I'll go on the edge of the bed, in case any of us happen to fall off in the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll go on Amazon's side.\" Elf added as she sat by the bed. \"I'm sure she wouldn't even stir if I fell onto her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me in the middle? You're all too kind!\" Sorceress took off her oversized hat as she spoke, her party members not sure if she meant it or if it was the mead talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sorceress stripping down to her mere undergarments, Elf followed suit too. Thief also did so, taking his robes off along with the other girls. There were no complaints, plus they'd be using these clothes a lot in the next days. It;d be best to keep them in prime condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually got the bed situation sorted out. Thief and Elf both lay on the edge of the bed, teetering off the side. Amazon was fast asleep on Elf's side, snoring mildly along with some stomach gurgles. Sorceress was happily resting in the middle, her very ample breasts finding their way to both the other bed members. Elf found her head squished against them, whilst the occasional tussling of her body lead to them smacking into Thief too. Thankfully, she was able to sleep soundly later, leading Elf and Thief to finally earn a good night's sleep, a bit cramped due to the conditions.</span></div></div>",

He was deep in sleep, but it was lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her right she the same thing with Elf. Head using her right boob as a pillow and with a hand AND a leg over hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And I wake up with a hottie to my left, and an elf to my right. This quest is gonna be fun!\u2019 Giggled the Sorceress mentally as she pat the heads of the two sleepy heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise and shine,\u201d she smiled and with some nice petting, the Elf and Thief slowly woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d the bronze skinned male groaned, shuffling up and seeing the smiling vixen\u2026and where he was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaa\u2026?\u201d The Elf yawned, and saw that she too was smooshing her face against the mountain of the spell caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked over at each other\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they both leapt out of bed with a shocked cry, stumbling and falling onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-s-s-sorry!\u201d The normally reserved and collected archer waved her hands. \u201cI must have moved in my sleep! I didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thief didn\u2019t say anything, brushing off his arms, but he had some pink on his cheeks. The auburnette heard him mutter \u201csorry\u201d and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about! Besides, I\u2019m sure the both of you slept nice and easy right~?\u201d The Sorceress stood up, breasts swaying a bit in her white bra-straps. She had her arms positioned to have her breasts press a bit tighter, just to tease the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Elf and Thief were quiet, blushing a bit as the male rubbed the back of his head. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf remained quiet, scratching her cheek. \"It...was nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Score!!!\u2019 Thought the vixen mentally. She had a foot in the door for that bronze skinned stud! Lifting her legs, she got out of bed and felt a big heavier. Putting a hand on her hip she looked down, but couldn\u2019t see past her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d She waved if off, but the Elf and Thief saw her once washboard stomach be a bit softer, along with her hips and thighs a tad thicker. Maybe the reason her breasts felt so good as pillows was because some weight she had gained the night before went to it? Then again, the changes wouldn\u2019t be noticed once she put on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who is up for some breakfast?\u201d Said the Sorceress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t go the day without one. But we should wash up when we can,\u201d replied the Thief, putting on his robes. Elf was in the process of putting on her gear and clothes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a river I know over by the mountain, we can go there and then-gaah!\u201d And the Thief, as he was walking, tripped over the Amazon, who somehow was still dead asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026wha?\u201d the blonde warrior woke up, seeing the leader of the party sprawled on the ground. \u201cAh. Mornin\u2019 all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning to you too\u2026\u201d He grumbled, standing up and brushing his robe off.

However, she was able to move them off her into a pile, working on one wing at a time with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho...we've got Harpy eggs alright!\" The busty magic user returned with a small nest in her hands, inside holding a plentiful amount of Harpy eggs.

Thief finished looking over his book as he closed it up so to take a look at the damage the meal had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls sat around the fading embers all sporting their very own stuffed bellies, filled to the brim with harpy meat and harpy eggs. Surprisingly, both Sorceress and Elf had been able to keep their clothing in one piece, though the fabrics were put to the test as their stomachs pressed outwards. Amazon's abs had been completely engulfed by the huge meal she'd eaten, but was no doubt ready to return once the foods ended up being digested. For now, all the girls held their engorged guts with both hands, mixed reactions from around the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh!

Of all times to provide lip service...\" she groggily moaned. As she neared closer out of the fog in her head, not quite a concussion nor a food coma, she nonchalantly groped herself. Her breasts seem as big as they ever were, but given how long she had them, it's hard to reference size difference. As her hands made south, however, she was noticing more noticeable changes. Her stomach has small indentations where stretchmarks lie, her form was beginning to jiggle all over as she was brushing along, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My goodness, is that a fat roll!?</i> she thought, still amazed from her tirade of introspection. But as she tried to look down upon her form more closely, it turns out her guess was way off the mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's right, we fell from the sky after our buffet, trying to hunt down some more harpies. Must have been a couple hours after we passed out. And this...</i> she thought while bending down, grinning at the sight, <i>...must be the harpies' treasure hoard! Holy holly, those smarmy harpies are going to make ourselves rich!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends to her knees to scoop up the mountains of wealth underneath her, marveling at the hoard she saw upon her. This wasn't as much as a dragon's hoard to buy a kingdom with, but with this she could easily bribe a knight for a fief and open a business while she was at it...or she could trade it for a week at a luxury hotel, and be pampered into oblivion with deluxe restaurants. The filet mignon was palpable enough to lick her lips, savoring the fantasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right, forgot about the rest of the harpies. A dozen more soared over the Sorceress' head and landed straight upon the money pile where the Sorceress stood, pivoting their feet to face the witch. Their grip on the gold is not founded at the slightest. But just a little beyond the mountain of gold sits a reservoir of lava, which could easily incinerate the harpies...and the treasure, if she's not careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, it doesn't seem they have good footing, which makes them susceptible to air magic. Then again, neither am I - don't think I have the willpower to outmaneuver them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whilst both options had their strengths and weaknesses, Sorceress felt it was only right to go with the safer option. She knew her oversized chest wasn't the best for running with, blocking her view as they flopped up and down in unison. Simply relying on her magic was much simpler too, it would only be a wind spell she could do in her sleep. The gold...as regrettable as it was to give it up she was sure not all of it would be gone. She had a tendency to be greedy with gold, but she was at least smart to know what was worth risking her life for and what wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation she began to chant, her hair beginning to flutter as her staff flowed with wind, simply aiming it in any direction would give a gust of wind over there. Not just any wind, this was gale force, enough to knock anyone off their feet, including Harpies. Being situated underground, they weren't exactly kempt, meaning their wings weren't in the best shape; they\u2019d not be able to support themselves under the harsh winds, if they weren\u2019t having their skulls fractured against the rocky walls they\u2019d be falling into the pool of lava below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind spell was starting to pick up, starting to go into gale force. As expected, the harpies tried but failed to fly against the winds, some of them falling to their deaths in the searing pool whilst others smacked against the walls, either killing them instantly or sending them tumbling down to the ground. She\u2019d needed to keep this up until she knew every last harpy was down for the count, which of course meant gold was being lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile of gold dissipated as it was blown off the edge, a bit hard for her to watch but in her mind she remembered that it was better than becoming harpy lunch. However, oddly enough when she saw a rather large chest in the gold pile fall off the side, she didn\u2019t hear a sizzling splash into the lava, but instead a heavy crunch, sounding like broken rocks. It wasn\u2019t long before all the harpies were dead, allowing Sorceress to move down the steps a little to check out what the deal was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her surprise, it seemed that the chest (And some of the gold to her joy) hadn\u2019t fallen into the lava outright, only landing on the edge of the pool, but the chest had actually revealed what appeared to be some kind of room beneath the floor, a darkened hole in the ground from where the chest had fallen through the floor. Now that she had no need to be quick, she began to walk down the steps to the floor, not having to worry about her massive breasts flopping into her face whilst running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the hole, she was able to make out in the darkness what was the faint shimmer of what appeared to be some kind of wall decoration on the side. She judged through the darkness, finding that it wasn\u2019t too far a drop, so she sat herself on the edge of the hole and dropped down fairly easily, nothing that wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Inside, she got a much better look of what it was, and then she knew where she truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was inside a treasure room, long abandoned and forgotten. With the ornate engravings and styles adorned onto the walls, she recognised them anywhere. After all, being a magic user meant going through tomes upon tomes, she knew her stuff. This treasure room was once owned by royalty, one which lived and ruled over a kingdom that was on the verge of war, the insignia was all over the place, even on some of the treasure inside. However, they were unable to negotiate and war broke out, with the kingdom being destroyed in the process. All the royals were slaughtered, with no doubt this treasure room being forgotten. It\u2019s no wonder they stored their valuables and treasures in such an obscure place like an old mine, no one would dream of looking for valuables here in a lava pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she wasn\u2019t too bothered about losing a little gold, she\u2019d pretty much found a lost treasure that would easily get her a pretty penny. Though, her attention was brought to something other than the mass piles of gold in the room, her eyes lay on a single red box on a pillar at the far corner. She could feel something powerful radiating from there, not exactly sure what it meant, all she knew is that there was something enchanted inside there, something no doubt only a royally appointed mage could cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the box, she found nothing too much, just some jewellery. Of course, it was no doubt enchanted, but it seemed so mundane. It was simple, a couple of necklaces, some bracelets and rings, nothing much else. It seemed so weird, why would someone enchant such basic jewellery with such powerful magic? Interested, she took the jewellery and wore it around her, intending to see if she could figure out what exact enchant had been cast on it, however she soon heard voices from outside the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her relief, it was the others. Thief, Elf and Amazon were all making their way down the stairs, seemed they\u2019d been able to stick to a more comfortable landing compared to her own fall. Rubbing her rear slightly as she remembered the harsh fall, she moved back over to the hole in the ceiling of the chamber, casting herself a bright beacon spell, shining a dazzling pure white light through the hole so she could gather the attention of the others.</span></div></div>",

If they get wise to her plans, she's done for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tremble in terror, you are finished! Rocks fall, everyone dies!</b> she recites before pointing at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as expected, the tremor that echoed from her spell bounced the whole room, making the stalactites give way for a long drop. The world stands still in that moment, as Gaia's sweat comes downward toward the harpies, making seconds into minutes, minutes into hours. The harpies begin looking upward in fear, flapping their wings in desperation to generate lift, engaging their flight responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut their plan didn't work. The Sorceress succeeded, by sheer dumb luck. She counted her stars by counting the blood spurts before her: one, two, three, four...five, six...seven, eight, nine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NINE!? Oh Hel, three of them managed to get away!</i> And away did they go, above the Sorceress' head, holding their talons forward, backing their heads like cobras before the final strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the silence of the moment came a sound. There was help in the dim light. The first harpy was pierced with a blinding arrow through its skull, sending it crashing to the ground; the second was brought down on justice's rear, crushing the harpy's ribs from the fall of sturdy blonde upon its back; the third encountered a lone rider, hijacking control and with a singular stab, made a crash landing on the teetering tender below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're alive, Sorceress! Praise the Heavens!\" the Elf shouted from the rafters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe us,\" the Amazon chimed in, \"we thought you were gone from that height.\" She pointed upwards to indicate where the Sorceress fell from, and she was not joking; that was easily the height of a castle keep. On second thought, the Sorceress surmised that she doesn't have enough mana for another spell - maybe the boost of mana saved her from a grisly fate. \"We fell a couple floors up, so we weren't hurt much, but <b>damn</b> we thought you were ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking account for the Amazon and Elf, Sorceress tried to search for the thief. And he was doing what he does best - counting his shills. The shills that <b>she</b> discovered first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ladies and gent,\" the Thief booms smugly, halfway done digging through the treasure through his hollow bag, \"we ready to go?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Thief was dumbfounded by the Sorceress' concern. Not exactly her concern - that seems to be new - but how she's throwing herself into his way for assistance. And it irks the hell out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" the Thief says in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the Sorceress states, \"even though this treasure was plucked from a bunch of harpies, they had to get this from somewhere. What I'm saying is, they may have looted this from the village, or worse, a castle, or even another race. Sure, odds are you might be dealing with shoddy Goblin enchantment, but enchantments by humans and dwarves is getting stronger, almost to the point of...you-know-who,\" as Sorceress slyly points to the Elf descending from up high into view. The Elf is only confused by these semantics<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thief's dwarven sense is tingling - he's heard these lies too many times before. From dwarves offering him a cavern fief, to humans offering their lambs for sale, to dwarves offering better interest rates with \"mythril\" membership, to elves selling premium wine, to dwarves showing \"a barrel full of laughs\" for 5 silver coins...can he just get a little to himself without driving himself further in debt!? But for such a smart vixen - one who can probably morph her milky flesh, no less -  to truly cross the battle of shrewdness into a true battle of wits would be folly. She could easily talk about her ranking in school for a full day and book him against his own street wisdom...oi vey, he was getting tired just thinking about her tirade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what you will, you can poke through the rest while I do one more sweep,\" he barks. \"But you'd better be sure you're done when I get back!\" And with a belch of smoke from the lava below, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I think I overlapped my charm a bit too much,</i> thought the Sorceress. <i>Eh, I think the lad had his share of heartbreaks, he'll get over it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, playtime is now, let me know if you find anything that makes you feel funny. I'll go over there and use some...fortune wire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon and Elf, frankly, could care less. The Elf's lyre of wooden strings needs a tune up, and the Amazon wants to see if she can smelt her share for a golden axe...for \"royal\" customers. Both begin digging with gusto for their golden slice of the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Sorceress was deep in thought. Despite the piss-poor excuses she made about this hoard, in which she was very lucky to not be called upon, she actually did have a good hunch about this particular one. Unfortunately, it would be unscholarly to use a hunch unless testing it with consistent data, which one hoard does not make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer intuition finally paid off: in the crevices of the humongous hill, there was a ring so brimming with energy that it made the Sorceress' staff blush with luminescence. As she began appraising the ring, the words she said to the Thief cursed her back - it was written in dwarvish tongue. And so it recites:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Laugh, and grow fat.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a preposterous \"curse\"!</i> the Sorceress thought. <i>What does being rich have to do with revenge!? For whom could this decoration have been made for!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out it <i>was</i> crafted for someone. The inside of the ring is marked for 'Olivia Herchey'.</span></div></div>",

The furious sounds of battle, accentuated by primal war cries, could be the work of none other than the mighty Amazon, Griselda. Like many other Amazons, Griselda is scantily clad in merely enough scalemail to cover her most delicate areas. She moves with grace and agility equal to her ferocity, deftly cleaving apart any who oppose her path. Despite her impressive musculature, which constantly bulges and flexes during battle, Griselda possesses feminine beauty surpassing even royalty. Her flowing golden locks dance about in an iridescent beauty as she weaves her way between foes, while the gentle curves of her face and stoic countenance belie her cold ferocity in battle. The pale flesh of her modest bosom is barely contained by her chest coverings, while her tremendous ass practically consumes the backside of her lower armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriselda is still an amateur adventurer despite her strength, and is searching for treasures to help fund her expeditions. On this day she finds herself in the Old Capital, easily decimating any enemy that dare to get in her way. She had heard rumors of the Old Capital being replete with treasures, in addition to possibly being the hide out of the so-called Bandit King. As she began to enter deeper and deeper into the ruins, her senses were assaulted by the stench of acrid smoke and a near scorching sensation in the air. Even Griselda felt a fearful consternation deep within her gut, but she pressed on with an iron resolve, determined to claim whatever treasure may lie in wait. Then sensations became more pronounced as Griselda approached a very large set of wooden doors; a bellowing, deep snore could be heard from beyond them. Griselda steeled her resolve, and unflinchingly approached the door, opening it gently and as quietly as she could manage. She was taken aback at what waited for her behind the doors. A legendary Red Dragon, resting upon a massive pile of treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriselda gulped deeply at the sight. Even she knew that she could not slay a dragon as she was now, but she was determined to take something back to town. Her eyes slowly fell upon a small pile of gold, almost as if they were drawn to it. Resting on top of the pile were two distinct pieces of jewellery, a magnificent golden band set with a large amethyst, and a thick golden choker with a sparkling ruby. She simply had to have one of them... Or perhaps take the risk and try to run off with both.</span></div></div>",

She found cover from the roaring dragon, and put on the two artifacts. Suddenly, the dragon let out a loud cry and collapsed. In shock, Griselda approached the fainted creature only to see it slowly losing physical matter and becoming a spirit. As she approached closer, the dragon suddenly disappeared with a flash of light, and a red floating orb was left behind. It floated to Griselda\u2019s heart and then disappeared. For a moment, she was left to wonder what had just happened. But then, all of a sudden, she felt a strain on her heart. In an attempt to cough out, she instead released a stream of fire from her mouth. She hopped backwards in shock and fell down from the sudden realization. \u201cWhat did I... did I breathe fire!? Has the dragon\u2019s power\u2014\u201c just as she was to finish her thought, she caught a glimpse of her right hand, or rather, her new right claw. She shrieked for a moment only to soon realize her situation: her whole body was taking the appearance of a red dragon within in her sturdy amazon figure. Her skin turned to red scales. Her teeth became sharper and spaced out. One tiny fang emerged from the top of The right side of her mouth. Her boots were torn asunder by her new humongous dragon feet. Her cheeks bones became the rigid jaw of the rest of her carnivorous teeth. She tried to speak, but her voice had gotten much deeper, frightening her. The transformation halted after wings sprouted from her back and a tail from just above her rump. Despite all of the transformation, she maintained parts of her human form, including her normal eyes, nose, breasts, and flowing hair. All she could do was quiver and attempt to speak in her new deep voice, but soon her legs caused her to trip over herself. And then the worst of the transformation truly began. <br>\r\nGriselda\u2019s toned stomach shook and grumbled for a moment before adipose starting to form, pushing outwards towards a small potbelly. Fat started to cover the toned warrior as her body jutted out into jiggly form. Her scaly boobs grew and grew and finally popped off her bra strap and were free. Her legs, while defiantly no longer showing tonality, were less affected by the weight gain and could only be considered tender. Her belly had no pushed out further into an obese blob of fat, allowing her drooping tits to have suspension. And her already THICC booty pooled with fat, becoming two globular jiggly cheeks. At any movement they\u2019d move bounce up and down from ther saggy ness and droopy nature. All of her striking feminine features began to weight down towards the floor. And after a whole, the transformation finally stopped.<br>\r\nGriselda was practically stuck to the floor in defeat. She had her beautiful face tucked into her large boobs and had a sad, anguishing expression. She began to cry and her tears hit the floor. But then she started to laugh silently. Then she let it grow louder and louder, until she burst out in a villain like laugh. She thrust her head high into the air, displaying a new shining set of red eyes. <br>\r\nShe then simply listened to the echo of her resounding new commanding deep voice and smirked. Then she got off and the ground and...</span></div></div>",
