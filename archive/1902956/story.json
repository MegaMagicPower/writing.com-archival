Thinking you were going into the after world.\u201d \u201cWell, that does make sense; but I was apparently reborn a Pok\u00e9mon with my memories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you happen to think Arceus did this?\u201d \u201cIs it powerful enough to do that?\u201d \u201cWell\u2026 It cares deeply for its Pok\u00e9mon; I wish I could contact it.\u201d Suddenly there is a flash of light just outside the cave. You both rush out what you see is beyond relief, standing just outside the cave is none other than Arceus itself. \u201cDid I call it somehow?\u201d \u201cYes, you have; I am able to hear everything and anything about my creations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walks up to Arceus and speaks very shyly, \u201cUmm\u2026 Arceus did you transform my trainer into a Pok\u00e9mon to repair my heart?\u201d \u201cYes, even though I had mesprit create all the emotions, she was told you create the bad ones also. Sorrow, Sadness, Loneliness, Depression; none of which she wanted to create; but what would happen if there was no sorrow for lost ones?\u201d \u201cI see your point.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut even though I shouldn\u2019t have done it I saw into his heart he was pure, if he wasn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that.\u201d \u201cI had always been kind and considering of my Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d \u201cI had used a lot of my power to transform you. And teleporting from the Hall of Origins.\u201d \u201cDo you need to rest?\u201d \u201cThat would be nice; and Damon I know what she has asked you, what she is asking for is not something to be taken lightly. For the process of mating it allows female to get a closer connection to their partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I wouldn\u2019t; I just wasn\u2019t comfortable with it right now.\u201d \u201cYou do know that I could take you away though.\u201d *GULP* \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that just make Sarah\u2019s heart have an empty hole and become a hollow shell.\u201d \u201cYes, if you break your promise to her then I might have no choice, but to do it.\u201d \u201cI understand you\u2019re ummm\u2026 Lord?\u201d \u201cNo needs for the formal addressing just call me Arceus.\u201d \u201cThank you for your insight Arceus.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome my new creation.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to stay for dinner?\u201d \u201cThat would be just long enough, for me to regain some of my power to return to the Hall of Origins. Also take this so you may contact me or I may transport to you easier. It takes a lot of my power to locate someone without a flute.\u201d \u201cUmmm\u2026 If I am correct this is called The Heaven\u2019s Flute?\u201d \u201cYes you are very well informed of what this is and does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt not only allows the user to contact Arceus, It also allows them to go to Arceus in The Hall of Origins.\u201d \u201cThat is correct; I have made a good choice then. Most people have looked for the flute for eons, many have failed. Simply because I was looking for a mortal pure of heart and worthy of using my power\u2019s correctly. I had searched far and wide and then I came upon you\u2026 But I saw you got bitten by that wild Pok\u00e9mon. Suffering what was called Neo-Pokerus.\u201d \u201cWhat is that exactly I have never heard of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a rare, but extremely dangerous disease and human bitten by it is doomed to die within 48 hours. I saw this and thought, No my chosen Pure of Heart; I chose then and there is one way to save this human, to turn him into a Pok\u00e9mon. I did have the burial ceremony go like normal, and then transformed him with his memories, feelings, and then I reunited him with his closest Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d \u201cWow, you went through all that trouble?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy I assure you that, it took up almost all of my energy then I had to find you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo explain right?\u201d \u201cCorrect again; you are a smart person; I made a good choice when choosing you. Also if you want me to can change you back into a human and have Dialga and Palkia, to modify some things.\u201d \u201cUmm\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t that use up almost the rest of you powers?\u201d \u201cWell, yeah but you could begin your journey again as if you hadn\u2019t been bitten.\u201d \u201cUmmm\u2026 No thanks I want to stay like this; but I like this form even though I was human before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that it all I would like for you both to come to The Hall of Origins with me for a bit.\u201d \u201cCan you take all of us without using too much power?\u201d \u201cOne second.\u201d He makes a loud roar and the three of you are standing outside the cave. \u201cOne more second.\u201d He then does an even louder roar. Almost instantly a rip of pink appears to his left. And a blue portal his right. You both stand in awe as Dialga and Palkia emerge into their area. \u201cLord Arceus, did these two hurt you?\u201d They charge attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo don\u2019t!\u201d There attacks die down. \u201cThey did not hurt me I just have a lack of energy.\u201d \u201cHow are you having a lack of energy?\u201d \u201cYou see this Pikachu was heartbroken. And you know how I was looking for that Pure of Heart human.\u201d \u201cYeah did you find him?\u201d \u201cWhere is he then?\u201d \u201cYou know that Neo-Pokerus I thought I got rid of.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cApparently I missed one and it bit the human.\u201d \u201cNo! The 48 hours death?\u201d \u201cYes, I had but one choice I changed the human into a Pok\u00e9mon after his burial.\u201d \u201cSo, is it one of the Pikachu\u2019s?\u201d \u201cYes, the male one. Now can you loan me some energy so I can take them to The Hall of Origins?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course our Lord.\u201d The two Pok\u00e9mon then gather a bunch of energy in orbs before sending it into Arceus. Arceus finally stands up in full strength then almost immediately there was a huge flash and then they were in a huge marble building. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d \u201cThis is my domain the Hall of Origins.\u201d \u201cIt is so massive did you make this?\u201d \u201cSort of I used most of my power to create a hidden place for me to rest.\u201d \u201cI bet it took forever to do this.\u201d \u201cYes, but I did allow the other legendaries to help me create it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo after it was created you took to a long rest before looking for a pure of heart to use your powers for good.\u201d \u201cThat is correct Damon.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t paying attention, I never knew you had chosen me. I heard legends of Arceus creator of Pok\u00e9mon looking far and wide for a pure of heart.\u201d \u201cYes, the legends are true I looked far and wide. When I found you I saw you been bitten and I had to intervene or you would be lost and there would be no other pure of heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Didn\u2019t think that I would have been chosen, as your human.\u201d \u201cI can understand people have looked far and wide for me, but I am hidden somewhere no regular person can find.\u201d \u201cBut didn\u2019t team plasma try and find you?\u201d \u201cYes, but as I had said no one, but the purest of heart could find me.\u201d \u201cI do wish that I could have saved you from the fate you had been forced to receive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Sarah I guess I am ready to mate you. Arceus would you send us back to our cave?\u201d \u201cOf course my chosen champion.\u201d And in yet another flash you were both back in the cave. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go get this over with.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We tried our hardest to remove that disease; it all came from an odd glowing stone.\u201d \u201cStone?\u201d \u201cYes, Arceus had looked into it and found that it contained a virus.

I have already talked to Arceus about this; He has approved of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then shoots a beam of light that envelopes you. Suddenly you see stuff rush past your eyes.

We will talk about this later.\u201d \u201cYes, Master.\u201d She soon exits after closing the door; you then let out a sigh. After you get done you soon get dressed; finding it easier that you first expected. You then walk out and see Amy sitting on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, let\u2019s talk.\u201d \u201cYes, Master.\u201d \u201cWhy did you turn into me?\u201d \u201cAs I said I wasn\u2019t trying to.\u201d \u201cReally, explain.\u201d \u201cI was once a human; I was bit by a Pok\u00e9mon and died when Arceus revived me as a Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d \u201cI see\u2026 And any proof?\u201d \u201cHang on then.\u201d You soon pull out the flute that Arceus had given you. \u201cWhoa, the Heaven Flute!\u201d You just put the flute to your lips and play an eerie tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of thunder nearby and then Arceus walked out of his portal again; causing Amy to fall backwards in awe. \u201cWhat is it Damon.\u201d He looks at the scene. \u201cWow, I never would have guessed. Caught by a trainer; but turned into her?\u201d \u201cBy a mistake, I was trying to turn into a male human.\u201d He just laughs at this. \u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do I fix this?\u201d \u201cIt would take several hours for the transformation to wear off as you\u2019re human; I would say maybe 18 hours.\u201d \u201c18 HOURS!\u201d \u201cAfter that you will return your male Pikachu self. As for the trainer, any questions?\u201d \u201cWas Damon really a human?\u201d \u201cYes, bitten by a Pikachu infected with Neo-Pokerus.\u201d \u201cThat I though wasn\u2019t real?\u201d \u201cIt was real; I had removed it; although one Pok\u00e9mon managed to get past my purge of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Damon is now a she for now?\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d Now Amy busts out laughing. Arceus then leaves in it's portal. You just roll your eyes. \u201cOk, are you done now?\u201d She starts to quiet down. \u201cMmmph... heh\u2026 phew; I think I\u2019m done.\u201d \u201cGood, I don\u2019t think that it is quite that funny.\u201d \u201cIf you were me, I bet you would.\u201d \u201cMaybe; I still don\u2019t think that it is that funny.\u201d \u201cOh lighten up; you will be back to normal soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill 18 hours\u2026\u201d\u201d There has to be something we can do to take your mind off the problem.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You then sit down in a sort of slump. \u201cOh, come on; let\u2019s have fun.\u201d She then begins to grab your breast making you moan. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cMaking you feel the things some females feel.\u201d \u201cAnd why should I?\u201d \u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to feel what it\u2019s like to be of the opposite gender?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d \u201cWell, I have a secret.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI can actually change my gender if I want.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cJirachi.\u201d \u201cAnd; your point?\u201d \u201cI am going to become male and fuck you so that you can feel the opposite of the male\u2019s position.\u201d \u201cUmmm\u2026 Do I have any choice in this?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d You just sigh. \u201cFine, don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d \u201cWhy would I?\u201d She then begins to glow as she changes before you; she soon finishes. \u201cHow, do I look?\u201d \u201cAmazingly; hot.\u201d \u201cAwe thanks; now undress.\u201d \u201cOk; since I have no real choice.\u201d You quickly undress and lay exposed on the bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then undresses herself; he then starts to slowly enter you causing you to moan. He slowly starts to speed up and add a little more force. Soon you are experiencing orgasms. He soon rams through your uterine wall painting you insides white. You both are left panting. \u201cWow\u2026 That\u2026 Was\u2026 A rush.\u201d You say. \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d \u201cActually; yes.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see 17 \u00bd hours left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow; it\u2019s been that long?\u201d \u201cYeah, it has anything else you want to do?\u201d \u201cUmmm\u2026 Well\u2026Could you suck on my breast some?\u201d \u201cI feel no problem with that.\u201d She then starts sucking on you breast causing you to moan. After that it\u2019s your turn for another request. \u201cCan I give you a blow job?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d His member is sticking out as he strokes it making it become erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get on your hands and knees and then start to suck on his cock causing him to moan. After that a few minute later he then releases the stuff right into your mouth. You then swallow it to find it taste better than you had expected. He then speaks up \u201c17 hours left.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s been one hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything else you want to do?\u201d \u201cNothing I can think of that we haven\u2019t done; we could have a second round of sex.\u201d \u201cOnly if you want to\u2026\u201d \u201dI\u2019m Fine with that; fill me!\u201d And with that he begins the process again and then a few minutes later you are filled with his essence for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are soon fast asleep. \u201cWow, took a lot to put her down. I\u2019m going to go make us a snack.\u201d You were sleeping peacefully\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For several weeks you have been running home after school to avoid an ass-kicking. You had no pokemon and no way to defend yourself, leaving you with only the option of running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular night you were sprinting down the street hoping someone would help, when two thugs stepped out in front of you halting your progress. You skid to a stop and try to slip past them, but they grab your arms and hold you still, despite your struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job boys, now lets show this punk-ass bitch why you don't cross our territory.\" He stepped up and threw a punch into your gut, lifting you off your feet and driving the air from your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I didn't do anything to them\" you think as the blows pummel your body \"They can do this because they're stronger than you.\" a voice, like your own but more sinister, rang inside your head. \"I can give you the strength to make them stop, would you like that?\" \"Who are you?\" \"Hahaha, Me? I'm nobody important but you, you could be veey important. It all depends on your answer. Do you want the strength? Be warned, it will change you in ways you'll never imagine.

The thugs step back as you finish your change. You lean over a puddle to see your new face. Red eyes, black fur and a long black horn. \"Absol, I'm an Absol\" You whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss he's some kinda freak, what do we do?\" \"I don't care if he's your Mom! Kick its ass!\" The thug cautiously approached you, hands raised as if for boxing. You smile slightly as he pulls back for a punch. You catch his fist as it swings forward, twist it to the side and kick him in the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...heheh...hahah...AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" you throw your head back laughing like a maniac \"You\" you point at the leader with your new hand \"are gonna pay\"</span></div></div>",

It swirled viciously as you coaxed it into  your hands. You clenched a fist creating an eerie black aura around it. You leapt forward throwing a punch at the boulder.

I don\u2019t know how many or where they are but you definitely aren\u2019t the only one, you\u2019re not even the first\u201d he leans back against a rock, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll meet some of them eventually but in the meantime you have to focus on getting stronger and increasing your reserves of dark energy. We don\u2019t know how the others will react to you so it\u2019s best to be prepared\u201d you sit quietly as you digest this new information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think they might attack me?\u201d \u201cI dunno, it\u2019s possible\u201d he shrugs \u201cAlright, how\u2019s your energy level?\u201d you feel for it only to find that it was almost as much as when you started. \u201cIt\u2019s almost fully recharged\u201d \u201cWell, your recovery level is normal\u201d He hops down from his spot and spreads his arms wide. \u201cHit me. Full strength\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI want to see how well you control the energy. You\u2019re not gonna hurt me\u201d \u201cAlright you asked for it\u201d you guide the energy into your fist one more time, pulling out all the stops, forcing every last bit of power into your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly your entire arm was coated with an inky black light. \u201cStill sure it won\u2019t hurt?\u201d Voice merely gestured for you to strike. You lunge forward leaning almost horizontal to the ground, with the charged fist held close to your chest. The claws on your hind paws dig into the ground, and you twist your torso hard. The darkness around your arm surges up towards your fist as it collides with Voices\u2019 stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a deep pulse of sound that rattled your teeth and the darkness exploded, launching Voice airborne. Unconsciously you step forward again and throw another punch. Your second strike never landed. In midair Voice was able to catch your fist and spin, throwing you to the ground. \u201cIf that\u2019s the best you\u2019ve got, you won\u2019t stand a chance against another hybrid\u201d he steps on your back holding you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts his paw only to place it on the back of your head. His weight forces your face into the dirt. \u201cGet off me\u201d you growl through the soil. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna make me? You? You can\u2019t beat me, even with all this power you\u2019re still weak\u201d<br>\r\n Voice rambled on \u201cI bet your family is worried, you traded your life for power. To them you simply vanished, and how do you think they feel right now? They\u2019re probably going through hell, it\u2019s your fault and it was all for nothing, YOU ARE MAKING THEM SUFFER FOR NO REASON!\u201d he pressed your head further into the dirt and leaned forward so he was speaking directly in your ear. \u201cMaybe I should put them out of their misery?\u201d \u201cBastard! Leave them alone\u201d you growl \u201cThis doesn\u2019t involve them\u201d \u201cNo, but it will\u201d Voice laughed maniacally. He lifted his foot for a moment before stomping on your head with a great deal of strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see stars and taste blood, but you still try to get to your feet. A kick to your midsection drives all the air from your lungs, forcing you to collapse once more. Voice rolled you over onto your back. \u201cYou were a mistake\u201d he raises one hand and points at you with an index finger. A sphere of pure darkness begins to coalesce at the tip of his red claw. \u201cThis\u2019ll be enough to kill you. Goodbye\u201d Voices eyes lit up for a moment and he immediately leapt backwards, deftly avoiding a massive Jump Kick from Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking out the leg she landed on Kara called out defiantly \u201cHe\u2019s the most interesting thing to happen in ages, so I can\u2019t just let him die\u201d \u201cI told you to get lost\u201d you lift yourself up onto your knees, clutching your chest. \u201cWhen did I start taking orders from you?\u201d she responded cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou owe me, big time\u201d She leapt into the air and slammed both feet into the ground where Voice had been a moment ago. Following up on her Bounce with a Dizzy Punch, Kara managed to force Voice onto the defense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick Slash made her back off, giving Voice some room to breathe. You watch the battle unfold and consider your situation, you could\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But all of a sudden he became a psycho, it\u2019s almost as if\u201d your eyes widen in realization, \u201cson of a bitch! I\u2019m an Idiot!\u201d you focus on the feelings that had risen up while voice was beating you. The rage, the hate, and the fear for your family. As you did this Voice suddenly stopped fighting and began to stare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the negative emotions filling your heart, you could feel the dark energy surge up and begin to overflow. Your entire body took on an oily black glow, and your injuries disappeared. Rising to your feet you clench your fists. Your eyes formerly a sinister red, were now glowing crimson with power and focused squarely on Voice. Kara couldn\u2019t help but to shiver as she observed your surge of power, \u2018That power feels, wrong\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant you closed the distance between you and Voice. The shock had barely registered in his eyes when your fist collided with his face. Much like last time there was a loud bang, but this time Voice wouldn\u2019t be retaliating so easily, you could feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was launched backwards and slammed into a tree putting a large crack in the trunk. As he slumped to the ground you closed in on him once more. You swing a wide kick with your left leg that connects horizontally across his stomach. The force of your kick slams him into and through the damaged tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lands you can clearly see blood come out of his mouth. \u201cWell? Am I still too weak?\u201d you grab him by his horn and toss him back into the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured it out, you were never going to kill my family. You were pretending to betray me to bring out my rage. This dark power responds to negative emotions like hate and anger, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as dumb as you look\u201d Voice manages to cough out before fainting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d Kara asks, still unsettled by your power. \u201cNot really sure, but it\u2019s really strong\u201d you let the emotions fade away and with them your power returns to almost normal levels. Almost immediately your head throbs and you\u2019re hit by vertigo. You fall to the ground holding your head, and curl up into the fetal position. \u201cHey! Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t respond, or even hear her, you are too enveloped by the pain. Gently, she lifts you up and carries you over her shoulder. \u201cDamn you\u2019re heavy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she take you?</span></div></div>",

I believe in you...\" The next Pokemon he summons is a Makuhita. \"Use Giga Impact!\" \"Use Protect.\" The attack bounces off. \"Mirror Coat.\" You summon a barrier to reflect 1/4 damage of special moves damage. \"Brick Break!\" \"That will undo my Mirror Coat.\" You teleport but before you do the Barrier breaks. \"I was too slow.\" You suddenly decide to use your hidden Power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole body glows as does the opponent's... the body of his start to glitch somewhat like it is fading. \"What move is that?\" \"Mirage Away.\" The pokemon then faints as it become solid again. \"Makuhita is unable to battle that means the winner is Jaden.\" You run over to Jaden and hug him before fainting in his arms from exhaustion. Next thing you know you wake up on a bed which you recognize as the bed at the pokemon center. \"Where am I?\" \"Were back at the pokemon center you fainted from exhaustion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did strain myself pretty hard I guess I wanted to impress you, but instead just drained myself.\" \"Awe, it's ok you didnt have to battle them both.\" \"I know I wanted to though to prove myself worthy of your command.\" \"You are my very special close Gardevoir.\" \"Thank you Jaden.\" Blushing a scarlet hue. \"I got to go take a shower.\" \"Ok, see you in a little bit.\" So you lay back down and fall asleep on the bed. \"Gardevoir... Dinner time.\" \"Oh, ok.\" You both head downstairs for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sit down and eat as you quietly eat your pokemon food which you really had had nothing like before having eaten berries then chased by angry pokemon... you like being safe and close to Jaden. *I am so lucky to have Jaden in my life... I was so lonely and have never had any real friends as I was always on the move.* Jaden looks over to see you lost in thought. \"Everything ok Gardevoir?\" \"Huh? Oh yeah everything is fine...\" Blushing. \"Well, eat up I don't want my pokemon to go hungry during battles.\" \"Yes, Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to eat again as you all finish you head upstairs and lay on the floor not sure as you has always slept on the ground. \"What are you doing?\" \"Sleeping is something wrong?\" \"Yeah, why are you sleeping on the ground?\" \"I have always slept like this while on the move...\" \"Make's sense as you had no real place to stay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here come sleep with me...\" You blush suddenly. \"Um... you mean it?\" \"Yeah I dont want my pokemon to sleep on the floor.\" You get up and walk over and lay down by him saying \"What is this it is comfy i have never experienced something like this?\" \"It's called a bed.\" \"Interesting are they always here?\" \"Yeah they are.\" \"Yeah can I sleep in it with you more often?\" \"Yeah, it is better than sleeping on the floor. We will camp out sometimes.\" \"Camp out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain that later. right now let's sleep.\" \"Ok Jaden.\" You both lay down on the bed where you fall into a peaceful slumber with some dreams. *What is this feeling? It is around Jaden...* *It feels like a fuzzy feeling...* *What is this feeling? It is strange i have never experienced it before.* You feel a slight shaking... \"Gardevoir wake up...\" \"Huh?\" \"Breakfast time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ok then.\" *Yawn* You slowly rise from the bed with out feeling any pain as you have from sleeping on the cold hard ground. \"I haven't slept that well in years.\" \"Did you enjoy it?\" \"Yes very much so...\" You walk up to Jaden and kiss his cheek. \"Thank you for letting me sleep with you.\" You both blush at what you had done. \"I feel fuzzy...\" \"Fuzzy how?\" \"I feel all fuzzy when ever I am around you... I think i have feeling for you...\" Blushing again.</span></div></div>",

I feel like\u2026 like I love you.<br>\r\n\u201cWell the truth is\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIIINNNNNGGGG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat alarm. That dumb alarm. Just when the dream could\u2019ve actually made some sense, that nuisance destroyed it all. Mark was pissed. All he wanted was to know who this Ninetales was, why he had to look up to her, and why it was so disturbing as to suggest love with a Pok\u00e9mon. Knowing names would be nice but Mark wasn\u2019t going to push his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark got up. He was seventeen, still with his parents, built pretty well, and only a month away from getting out of high school. One strange dream wasn\u2019t going to ruin his mood especially because he had no homework and the weekend had just started. He opened his bedroom door and took a step forward, but ended up going backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you too Torch.\u201d The large Arcanine stood over Mark, and rubbed his face along Mark\u2019s. \u201cWell, you\u2019re probably as hungry as I am. So I\u2019ll get us both something nice.\u201d The Arcanine gave Mark enough room to stand and followed him to the kitchen. Mark opened the fridge and pulled out some pizza from the night before. He pulled out two slices: One for himself and the other for Torch. After checking for his parents, Mark threw one slice toward Torch and the other he nibbled on with a savage bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark! Don\u2019t give that food to Torch! It\u2019s not good for him.\u201d \u201cMom, we eat this as a family and since Torch is one of the family, he can eat it.\u201d Mark\u2019s mother sighed. \u201cFine then. What are your plans for the day?\u201d Mark took a break from eating to think. \u201cI was thinking about taking a walk in the park and just taking in the fresh air today.\u201d \u201cAlright then honey. Just be back before 6 so we can find a decent restaurant to eat in, since it is for a special occasion.\u201d \u201cCourse mom. Well, I\u2019m going now. Don\u2019t be too much trouble now Torch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine barked with a sly smile. \u201cI wish I could understand you pal, but I can\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to someday.\u201d Mark stepped outside of the apartment and started to notice how minimal the traffic was today. Normal city conditions by his standards were for a never-ending barrage of cars to be flying by, but not today. No, the city looked almost abandoned with how empty it seemed. Regardless it just made it that much easier for him to get to the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it to the park and noticed all the Pok\u00e9mon scurrying about. But he didn\u2019t mind at all. In fact it was usually all their actions that made city life manageable. He kept walking when a sharp pain hit his head, like someone was crushing his skull. Everything spun and the world slowly fell apart. Mark tottered and tried to keep upright, but eventually fell to this foreign pain and collapsed. <br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\nMark stirred and propped himself up on his hands. The day had shifted into night, the trail remained beneath him, and the mid-darkness had created an eerie atmosphere. Something definitely didn\u2019t feel right and not just with the surroundings, but within himself. Mark\u2019s bones ached, his muscles burned, and he felt heavy, yet free at the same time. He stumbled over to a nearby river that ran through the park. He collapsed by the water and splashed some on his face. He heard screams and shouts that fled from the mouths of terrified woman and children. He didn\u2019t know what was happening, but it had to be bad. His eyes fully opened and he gazed upon the reflective water, but the face that looked back at him didn\u2019t exactly thrill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee in the water looked petrified. How could it be that an Eevee\u2019s face replaced him? It has to  be a dream. Yeah, that was it, because he had hands and Eevees only have paws. But his once bare hands were now consumed by a silver-toned fur. A tail had sprouted and his ears were much larger. His clothes were gone and left him a naked, yet furry being. That\u2019s when any nearby Pok\u00e9mon scattered and Mark realized the true problem at hand. He had hands and feet, but the fur, ears, and tail defeated the chance of being human. He had the appearance of an Eevee, yet his height, bipedal stature, and remaining human features shattered the possibility of being considered a Pok\u00e9mon. He existed as both at the same time and each defeated the possibility of being either one. Indeed he was a three-foot tall, human-Eevee Anthro, unable to be accepted by either species. He fled from the waterfront and sat on a park bench to take everything in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to run home, but knew he wouldn\u2019t make it. No one would let a freak like himself into the city, especially not his parents. His parents, what about them? He had to tell them what happened so they wouldn\u2019t worry, but they would never believe him. They would be afraid and probably send Torch after him. He curled up on the bench and cried. All he had; his family, Torch, his academic status, his things, an approaching birthday, his dreams, everything, now decimated and left to blow in the wind. He wanted to wake up and say this was a dream. He wanted to act like this never happened. He wanted to be normal again. But he knew it wouldn\u2019t happen. \u2018Everything happens for a reason Mark, good or bad. You can\u2019t change it and you can\u2019t always have it your way. So accept it and move on.\" He could still hear his grandpa whisper those words. He could still remember that day when he knew he would never see his grandpa again. Mark curled up closer, as though he had something he was cuddling. He knew his grandpa was right, but what purpose would turn into some freak have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMister, are you okay?\u201d Mark snapped open his tear filled eyes, though he feared he would see the girl who the voice belonged to. But in the space where there should\u2019ve been a human stood a Vulpix, and a fearless one at that. \u201cYeah, yeah I\u2019m fine. Who are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Silvia. What\u2019s your name, mister?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tell me!\u201d Silvia said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019s not my name, but that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to be called.\u201d Silvia looked unsure at first, but then nodded her head. \u201cOkay mister Hybrid. If that\u2019s what you want to be called, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll call you.\u201d Mark managed to find a grin in his sorrow. His body had shifted from something so normal to something so irregular. Now he had a name to match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why are you sleeping on this bench? Shouldn\u2019t you be doing at your home?\u201d Questioned the little Vulpix. \u201cI lost my home, so I\u2019m going to sleep here for the night.\u201d Hybrid said as he adjusted himself to a more comfortable position. Silvia leapt with joy. \u201cThen you can come stay with me until you find your home!\u201d Hybrid suddenly stirred. \u201cStay with you?! I don\u2019t think so. You have your place and I\u2019ll stay here until I find mine.\u201d \u201cPlease mister Hybrid! I want someone to stay with and you need a better place to sleep.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t live your parents?\u201d Hybrid inquired \u201cNo. They wanted me to see the world, so I live alone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid lied there, considering his options. He did need a place to stay and all, but he didn\u2019t want to stray too far from his family. \u201cSo, where do you live?\u201d Silvia\u2019s face lit up. \u201cReally? This way!\u201d Silvia took off and before Hybrid had taken two steps, he stopped and Silvia turned around, getting a good look at Hybrid\u2019s true form. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Aren\u2019t you coming with?\u201d \u201cYeah. But I can\u2019t walk around like this. I\u2019ll be the center of attention.\u201d \u201cYou have four paws, so why don\u2019t you walk on them?\u201d \u201cOh yeah. Must\u2019ve been sleeping too long.\u201d Hybrid said as he bent over. His stance was solid, but his steps weren\u2019t synchronized at all. \u201cYou look like a human trying to walk on all fours.\u201d Silvia said with a giggle. \u201cYeah. A human.\u201d Hybrid said emptily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Hybrid\u2019s steps became smoother and he naturally blended in except for his larger size. Silvia and Hybrid kept walking along the dim streets. The pair moved to the side for a worried-looking couple walking an Arcanine. Silvia gave a friendly hello to the Arcanine, but Hybrid remained. He recognized his parents with Torch. Hybrid just kept walking, trying to kill any desire to reveal himself to his family. Torch however gave him a stern look and a gentle sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou smell of my master. Do you know where he is?\u201d Hybrid was paralyzed. How could he answer that? He remained still, looking Torch in the eyes. The Arcanine looked with a more irritated gaze. \u201cWhere is he? You smell of him.\u201d A few more moments of silence passed. \u201cYou\u2019ve done something to him, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Torch was about to strike when the humans called for him. With bared teeth, Torch walked away, whispering to Hybrid \u201cI will find you, and I will either have my master or revenge.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing moved except the humans and the Arcanine. The humanoid Eevee remained still, knowing with time, Torch would have his way. He could only keep this charade up for so long before Torch found out. \u201cMister Hybrid, are you okay? What was that Arcanine talking about?\u201d A few moments passed before Hybrid spoke. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d \u201cWell then let\u2019s get going!\u201d The Vulpix bounded off again, with the anthro following behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long hike, the duo came to the city limits and the forest that surrounded it. The forest looked so lively, yet Hybrid felt nervous. So many eyes were watching him, from so many directions. A few more paces though and they came upon a fairly large den carved in the face of a rock wall. \u201cHere we are.\u201d Silvia said as she trotted inside, with Hybrid following closely behind. Initially the darkness hindered any ideas of the interior, but Silvia\u2019s flame soon ignited some sticks that were on the ground and the cave was illuminated. The interior was fairly empty and the only real additions were some cubby holes which served as food storage, the torches, and an old blanket on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it. What do you think?\u201d Silvia asked as she went to grab some berries. \u201cIf it suits you, then it\u2019s fine by me. Hybrid said as he inspected the blanket, still walking on all fours. \u201cGood. Can I ask you some questions, mister Hybrid?\u201d \u201cPlease, just call me Hybrid. No mister. And considering we just met and you already took me into your home, I would hope you would.\u201d Hybrid said as he took the berry Silvia offered him. \u201cSo, what are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee had been caught off guard. \u201cI\u2019m an Eevee.\u201d Silvia shook her head. \u201cWell yes, but that\u2019s not it. You\u2019re something else. You can easily walk on two legs like a human and your scent is like two different ones at once. So what are you?\u201d \u201cWell, um, this is going to sound strange, but I\u2019m a human.\u201d The Vulpix stopped for a moment and took a second look. \u201cThat makes some sense, but how did you go from human to yourself now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat, I don\u2019t know. I went outside today for a little bit, passed out, and woke up like this.\u201d \u201cSo you live in that city with all those other people? What\u2019s it like?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Well you see\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it. Just people living in buildings.\u201d Hybrid said taking a bite out of his snack. \u201cSo do you know those humans we passed on the way?\u201d Hybrid paused. \u201cThose were my parents.\u201d Silvia\u2019s jaw dropped and she got even closer. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t even try to communicate with them.\u201d \u201cBecause what good would it have done? They either wouldn\u2019t have understood what I was saying or they wouldn\u2019t have believed me. The only way this could\u2019ve happened is if I was born a Ditto, and I know that\u2019s not true.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one spoke. No one moved. Everything was still. \u201cYou don\u2019t like being this way, do you?\u201d Hybrid sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of emotions. While it\u2019s nice to be able to talk to pokemon and such, I\u2019ll probably never live normally again. I have to adjust to all the changes, I can\u2019t live among humans  like I should, I\u2019m too different to be a pokemon, and all I had, I lost. I don\u2019t know anything about what I can or can\u2019t do as an Eevee or how I\u2019ll adjust from what I had to all this new stuff.\u201d \u201cYou should stay with me. I can teach you anything you\u2019d like to know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid gave her a questioning gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve been unbelievably generous since we met. You\u2019ve given me shelter and food, accepted everything about me without doubt, and now you say you\u2019ll teach me anything. Why? Why are you being so generous? What about me is so valuable?\u201d \u201cThe companionship you offer. I\u2019ve never had a friend or someone to really talk to other than my parents. I moved away from my parents about two months ago and came here about a week ago. I\u2019ve been unbearably lonely.\u201d \u201cAnd I should trust you? You came to me while I was sleeping. You seem young for your parents to have kicked you out.\u201d \u201cEighteen human years isn\u2019t that young. I am telling the truth, whether you believe it or not. If you want to leave, you always can. Besides, you followed me all the way here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just checking. I\u2019m barely a day old. I\u2019d rather not make my first day terrible.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a good idea. May I ask more questions?\u201d \u201cFire away.\u201d Hybrid said as he yawned. \u201cSo since those were your parents, was that also your Arcanine?\u201d \u201cYes and no. Torch could be considered ours I guess, but I don\u2019t like thinking of it like that. He lives with us on his own accord rather than us ordering him around.\u201d \u201cSo how did that come to be?\u201d Silvia asked as she got in a more comfortable position. \u201cYears ago, I was walking home and one day I saw a sick Growlithe laying there. I brought him home and the rest is history.\u201d \u201cHow many years ago?\u201d \u201cUm. Maybe 9 years or so? Can\u2019t quite remember.\u201d \u201cSo do you live with your parents or are you on your own too?\u201d \u201cWell I did live with my parents until I started looking like this.\u201d \u201cSo then how old are you?\u201d \u201cSeventeen. Eighteen in a week.\u201d \u201cReally? You seem older.\u201d \u201cCan I ask some questions now?\u201d \u201cOne more, then you can. What is your real name?\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t use it too much but my name is Mark. I\u2019d prefer to be called by a name fitting of my appearance. Now, why is it that you seem to be so different with personalities? You were really playful earlier and seemed so young and innocent, but now, you seem older and more professional I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI acted professional when I first moved out. Nobody wanted to live with me when I was like that though. So I figured that now that I was somewhere different, I hoped a young look and a young attitude would work. It obviously got you.\u201d \u201cYes it did. So, do you know where your parents live by human definition?\u201d \u201cNear a city called Lemone. What is this city called?\u201d \u201c This is Appel. Lemone is about a day\u2019s walk.  Is that blanket a gift from them?\u201d \u201cYep. The humans they live with gave it to them and in turn, they gave it to me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice of them. At least you had a fair chance at goodbye. Are the humans they live with nice?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted. \u201cDepends on how you define nice. Do they take care of them? Yes. Do they spend time together? Yes. Were they nice to me? No. They didn\u2019t like me there, so that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m not there.\u201d Silvia said as she started narrowing her eyes. \u201cOh. Sorry to hear that. I think I\u2019ll stop asking for now. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m sure you are too.\u201d Silvia yawned. \u201cYes I am. Good night.\u201d Silvia said as she crawled under her blanket. \u201cGood night.\u201d Hybrid whispered as he lied on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been hours, but Hybrid really felt no inclination towards sleeping. He was absolutely restless. He stood up and looked at the Vulpix. She was happily asleep, and he wanted to keep it that way. He crept outside on two paws, into the darkness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night was quiet and at peace. However, two individuals weren\u2019t aware of the outside world because the cave they were in was the only place that mattered. The silver Eevee was groaning in pain as quietly as he could, so as to let his cave-mate keep her state of sleep. The snarling Arcanine showed no such sympathy though, as his paw pinned the Eevee to the ground and the pressure he applied only increased with each passing second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Torch said. \u201cI told you I\u2019m not sure.\u201d \u201cYou still smell like him. How could you possibly not know when you smell as strongly as you do?\u201d The paw only grew heavier and Hybrid\u2019s suffering grew worse. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d \u201cSure it is. Telling me where he is just so difficult. So then what did you do to him?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d Torch growled louder and applied even more pressure on Hybrid. The pain had grown too extreme, and Hybrid let out a shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia snapped awake from under the blanket and looked around in a daze. Her exhaustion was swept away as she looked upon the familiar Arcanine crushing Hybrid. She panicked, as she tried to decide between Torch\u2019s and Hybrid\u2019s desire. A moment she passed and went with the only choice she felt was right. \u201cTorch! Stop it!\u201d She cried out with passion. Torch\u2019s face froze and his paw took some of the force off Hybrid. He turned his head toward the Vulpix, shooting her a confused gaze. \u201cHow did you know my name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid was in a state between hurting physically and mentally. There was no way he could keep the secret anymore, and he knew that once Torch knew, he wouldn\u2019t possibly disappear quietly. \u201cBecause your master told me.\u201d Silvia said, looking the much larger Arcanine in the eyes. \u201cSo where is he? What happened to him? What has this Eevee done to him?\u201d \u201cMaybe if you let him have a chance, he could tell you himself.\u201d \u201cWait, do you mean to tell me\u2026\u201d \u201cYour master is beneath your paw.\u201d Silvia said as she turned her head away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorch removed his paw. Hybrid grasped his chest and breathed irregularly. \u201cSilvia\u2026 I appreciate the help\u2026 but was that really necessary?\u201d Silvia\u2019s looked to the hurting anthro on the floor. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, you would\u2019ve you know\u2026 not been here to be missing.\u201d Hybrid\u2019s grip tightend and he started rolling a little bit. \u201cShit Torch, why did you have to press so hard? I thought you were friendlier than that. Just because I\u2019m missing doesn\u2019t mean destroy everyone without answers.\u201d \u201cHow do I know it is you Mark? What happened today that only we would know?\u201d \u201cOther than you tackling me and me giving you pizza in return, not much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Torch\u2019s face was lost in expression, from joy to confusion. He cuddled up to Hybrid with tears flowing from his eyes. \u201cMaster\u2026\u201d \u201cQuit calling me that. I don\u2019t like being called master. Not to mention that since you just about took me away from this place with one paw, I think that proves how much better you are.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know it was you.\u201d \u201cWho would\u2019ve, Torch? Nobody. But that doesn\u2019t make it right. I don\u2019t like the idea you\u2019re willing to do so much harm because I\u2019m missing, no matter what the case. I\u2019m actually happier that it was me rather than someone completely innocent.\u201d Torch dropped his head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did you get out here? I know you don\u2019t leave after it gets too dark and I highly doubt you were just let free for a while.\u201d \u201cThey had the door open enough and I got out that way.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by open enough?\u201d Silvia asked? \u201cIt means that it wasn\u2019t really closed and he pushed it open the rest of the way. If I get the chance, I\u2019ll show you sometime.\u201d Hybrid responded. \u201cSo mas\u2026 I mean Mark, how did such a strange transformation occur?\u201d \u201cI wish I knew, but I don\u2019t. I was in the park when I blacked out and this was the result. I\u2019d still be in the park, but Silvia showed up and helped me out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorch walked over to Silvia. \u201cThank you very much, Silvia was it, for watching over him. I\u2019m sorry we woke you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m glad I got to meet you.\u201d  Torch turned back to Hybrid. \u201cSo should we be going Mark and let her be alone?\u201d Hybrid sighed. \u201cTorch. I think we need to go outside and have a talk just you and me. So can you come over here and help me up?\u201d The Arcanine walked over to the Eevee and using his fur as grips, the Eevee stood up and walked outside. Silvia laid down uneasily. She knew what he was going to say to Torch and as true as it was, she\u2019d rather his family be happier than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorch and Hybrid were outside the cave, gazing into the night sky. \u201cWhy do we need to talk? It\u2019s just a quick walk and you know that.\u201d \u201cBecause Torch, I can\u2019t go home.\u201d Torch lost all expression. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d  \u201cTorch, do you remember that time when you were a Growlithe and Harry brought his Ditto over? Do you remember how we eventually got Ditto to look like you and a human mixed?\u201d Torch\u2019s curiosity had been destroyed and in its ashes remained an unbelievable, yet sorrowful understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t go home. They overreacted to that and I can\u2019t imagine this would be much different, whether I\u2019m their son or not. And if they don\u2019t, imagine everyone else. People worry about you because of your size, even though you\u2019ve never done any harm to them. Imagine them seeing worry how I look. I need to stay out there, away from people. Silvia is going to stay here with me and she\u2019ll teach me what I need to know to survive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorch looked with a heart-broken gaze. \u201cSo is this farewell?\u201d \u201cI knew you watched too many movies with mom. I\u2019m not disappearing, I\u2019m not dying, and I\u2019m not moving away. I will be right here, in this cave unless there is a good enough reason to leave, in which case I would let you know. So come and see me anytime  you want, because I\u2019ll be here. Just come by yourself so my parents don\u2019t freak out.\u201d \u201cWell um about that. I was thinking that this week, while I have someone to help me, we could go find a Fire Stone to help me evolve, if that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d Silvia asked, stepping out of the cave. Torch stepped away from Hybrid and towards Silvia. \u201cWhat are you going to do to him? Why would you leave here so soon after he just moved in?\u201d \u201cTorch! Give her a chance. I understand your fear, because I have it too. But going on a quest would help me understand this world better than this forest could. I\u2019d ask for you to come along, but you must stay with my parents. And you have got to tone down. First you threaten me, now her. I understand what you\u2019re feeling, but I don\u2019t want you to hurt people.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorch lowered his head again. \u201cYes Mark.\u201d \u201cI have one more request before you go home and that\u2019s to call me Hybrid now.\u201d \u201cBut your name is Mark. Your parents gave it to you. Do you not like them?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that. I\u2019m just not their son looking like this. Mark is human and I\u2019m only half human. So I\u2019d prefer to be called by a fitting name, and Hybrid\u2019s that name.\u201d \u201cOkay then.\u201d \u201cNow get home before mom and dad worry too much about you. They\u2019ve lost one son already. They don\u2019t need to worry about losing their other.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Torch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never connected the dots? You\u2019re like a second son to them, even with all that fur. They\u2019d do anything for you, just like you\u2019d do anything for me. And we\u2019re like brothers, because you have my back and I have yours. So go on home and cuddle up with them for me.\u201d Torch chuckled. \u201cAnd you say I spent too much time with your mother.\u201d \u201cOh get home you oversized furball.\u201d Torch laughed as he faded off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia and Hybrid walked back inside. \u201cIs he going to be alright?\u201d Silvia asked as she got comfortable in her blanket. \u201cI think so. Now that he knows I\u2019m alive and well, he\u2019ll be much better. His biggest problem is going to be trusting you.\u201d Silvia recoiled. \u201cI swear, I have no intention of doing you any wrong.\u201d \u201cYou say that but with how well you acted in the park, believing you is a bit of a challenge.\u201d Silvia looked back over to Hybrid. \u201cWhy do you find it so hard to trust me?\u201d \u201cLook at it this way. I was on bench and you offered me shelter, even after seeing my true form. You also have accepted everything I\u2019ve told you about myself and you\u2019ve already proven you know how to keep up a good disguise. It\u2019s perfectly natural that I am cautious and paranoid.\u201d \u201cI guess so.\u201d Silvia remarked as she relaxed. </span></div></div>",

The first day in this form and it wasn\u2019t going to be easy: Following around Silvia to find a Fire Stone in territory considerably foreign, while trying to keep up a good disguise. Yes, today was going to be just lovely. He looked around to see the Vulpix still lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still questioning whether to trust her or not. As much as he wanted to just disappear and survive on his own, she really was his only good option. If she had any bad plans, she certainly had the trump card. However, she stirred and lifted her head up. \u201cGood morning\u201d She said. \u201cGood Morning.\u201d Hybrid responded. \u201cYou still don\u2019t trust me do you?\u201d \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be going wherever it is you want to go? You aren\u2019t going to gain my trust sitting here all day.\u201d She grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go near Lemone. There\u2019s a hot spring that had a few Fire Stones, or at least it did when I left.\u201d \u201cSo since your parents are nearby there, are we going to see them at any point?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia stood up and stretched a bit. She picked up her blanket and hid it in one of the open cubby holes. After a bit, she walked out of the cave and Hybrid followed behind her on all fours. Silvia went to a bush and grabbed a berry to eat. Hybrid followed suit, but with his mouth rather than his hands. They finished up and kept going along an unmade trail. The trip started out fairly quiet, with not much being said. However they soon started talking about everything from food to lifestyle to family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Your parent\u2019s humans didn\u2019t spoil you because you\u2019re a Vulpix?\u201d \u201cYes. Apparently a Vulpix isn\u2019t as beautiful as a Ninetails, so I never really lived \u2018the good life\u2019. I wish I could stay with a human.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I had it and lost it. I want it as much as you do, maybe more because I did have it.\u201d \u201cI guess you do have it a little worse. What do you miss the most?\u201d Hybrid took a moment to contemplate it. \u201cI really don\u2019t know. I miss Torch a lot, and my parents, and everything. It\u2019s hard to really pick one thing out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and Torch seemed really close. Why is that?\u201d \u201cBecause I saved his life and he never has left my side since then. In fact, I think yesterday was the longest he\u2019s gone without me being there.\u201d \u201cWas he really that sick?\u201d \u201cHe could barely stand. I\u2019m no doctor and I can\u2019t remember clearly, but even the nurse who took care of him was worried.\u201d \u201cWhere were his parents? Shouldn\u2019t they have been at his side if he was so young?\u201d Silvia asked. \u201cDon\u2019t know. I\u2019d ask him, but we\u2019re fairly far away and I don\u2019t know if that would be something he\u2019d want to talk abou-oof!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid collided with a Flareon who had been holding some berries in a bag, but they then scattered on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I wasn\u2019t paying any attention. Here, let me help you.\u201d Hybrid said as he picked up the loose berries and put them back into the bag. \u201cThanks.\u201d The Flareon said as it looked Hybrid in the face. But upon making eye contact, the smile wilted to a sadder expression and the Flareon walked away, head dropped and tail seized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I not do something right? He looked at me like I was dead or something.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong on your part. Maybe he\u2019s just having a rough day.\u201d The two kept walking, taking gentle breaths of the fresh air that enveloped them. It was really beautiful, but Silvia stopped and walked away from the path. Hybrid followed and saw her looking towards the treetops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He asked. \u201cTrying to see what we could eat. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to climb the tree to get them?\u201d \u201cWell actually let\u2019s see how good you are with doing your attacks. I could get them down myself, but you need some practice so go for it.\u201d Hybrid sighed and looked at the trees. He saw the tree with apples and tried to think of a way to get them. He tried jumping straight up, but fell far short. He attempted to jump off the tree, but that failed too. He head-butted and even stood up and shook the tree with his hands, hoping maybe two would be just loose enough. When that failed Hybrid lied down and thought about it some more when Silvia\u2019s face loomed over his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile watching you act like some kind of cartoon character is quite entertaining, I really am hungry. So without further ado, watch me.\u201d Silvia lined up and jumped at the tree just as Hybrid had. However, her jump off was much swifter and she easily had an apple in her mouth. She landed and set it down \u201cYou were close when you did it, but you should\u2019ve used Quick Attack instead of just jumping.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry that as a former human, I have no clue how to do anything other than walk and talk and eat and sleep.\u201d Hybrid growled. \u201cOh don\u2019t be so sore. You still can get your apple. I\u2019ll be sitting here eating mine, watching you.\u201d True to her word she sat there and started to eat, waiting for Hybrid to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and tried to jump again, following Silvia\u2019s example. He tried to follow Silvia\u2019s example, but instead just jumped off again. \u201cTry thinking how you\u2019re going to actually use Quick Attack. That\u2019s how I do it.\u201d Hybrid tried again and succeeded in the attack. However he fell short of the apple and lined up to try again. He jumped, but once again fell short. Hybrid looked around to make sure that the only one watching him was Silvia. After seeing no one, he stood up back on two paws and climbed the tree. He reached for the apple he so desperately wanted and picked it. He then jumped down and landed in front of Silvia, bowing before he returned to his quadruped stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them took a break to eat their apples. \u201cThat was using what you got I guess. But in all seriousness, you do need to work on your attacks in case we get in a fight.\u201d \u201cWhat do I have to learn? I\u2019m a Normal-type. No real special attacks.\u201d \u201cDo as you want, but I really think you should work on it.\u201d \u201cI will. Shall we be going now?\u201d He said as he finished his apple. \u201cYes. We\u2019re going to need a place to stay for the night and it\u2019s best to look before it gets too late.\u201d \u201cWait, we\u2019re not going to make it tonight?\u201d Hybrid asked. \u201cIf we went until we got there, we\u2019d be tired and it\u2019d be tomorrow afternoon. If we sleep tonight, we can be well rested and maybe able stay with my parents\u2019 tomorrow night, considering their humans will be either asleep or gone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo kept walking. Many Pok\u00e9mon saw them on the way and many kept their watch on Hybrid. Some even looked ready for a fight. But Hybrid kept moving, trying to avoid any eye contact. Silvia kept in charge and marched with a sense of pride. However a swarm of Beedrill appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we help you?\u201d Hybrid asked. \u201cYeah\u201d mentioned of the Beedrill. \u201cYou guys can leave.\u201d \u201cWe are. We\u2019re heading towards the hot springs.\u201d Silvia said. \u201cNo, as in leave right now. Everyone in this forest is nervous you\u2019re going to light this whole place on fire and you\u2019re buddy back there, they just don\u2019t like the look of him.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re just going to stay on this path. No wandering or anything.\u201d \u201cSeriously, leave now or someone\u2019s going to hurt you guys.\u201d Silvia looked up with a saddened cute face; large pupils, lower lip sticking out, and the gentlest voice she had. \u201cPlease let us go this way. I just want to go through and see my parents. They live at the hot spring.\u201d The lead Beedrill looked away in weakness. \u201cFine, but don\u2019t come back this way.\u201d They all left and the duo continued. \u201cSee? Being cute has its benefits.\u201d Silvia said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d Hybrid said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey had been put on pause for the night. The two grabbed a spot near a waterfall, far out of anyone\u2019s sight. \u201cSo another day-long trip tomorrow?\u201d Hybrid asked as he washed his fur. \u201cAbout that long. Depends on how cooperative the forest is.\u201d \u201cYou went this way the first time you came through right?\u201d \u201cYep and they even helped me. But apparently we\u2019re just trouble together.\u201d \u201cApparently freaks like me aren\u2019t well liked here. First the heartbroken Flareon, now everyone wants us gone. I really should\u2019ve stayed back home.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t say that. We\u2019re halfway to my parents and besides, when we get to the flatter land we\u2019ll be fine. Let\u2019s get you some practice while there\u2019s a smidgeon of light out.\u201d \u201cFine then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went on, working on agility and overall power. However, they trained long into the night and before they knew it, exhaustion reared its ugly head. Hybrid lied down, and got comfortable. Silvia lied down as well, but started shivering. \u201cAre you okay over there? You look cold.\u201d Hybrid said. \u201cYeah just a bit. This waterfall is blowing cold air on me. Can I sleep with you?\u201d Hybrid sighed. \u201cFine. Come here.\u201d Silvia walked over to Hybrid and lied in his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re so warm. We should do this more often\u201d she said with a giggle. \u201cJust this once, we\u2019re doing this. No other times.\u201d Hybrid said as he wrapped his silver arms around her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hybrid eyes peeled open. He looked over himself again, but no matter how often he checked, fur took the place of his once-human flesh. It was one fact he would always have trouble accepting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped his arm from underneath the sleeping Vulpix. He crept over to the water and washed his face. Even with its chill, it felt comfortable and relieved his weary eyes. Hybrid sat down and reflected on the past few days. They had been bothering him a lot, and he figured this would be a perfect time to think things over. In his state of meditation however, he failed to see Silvia stir. She stood up and walked over by where Hybrid was. She splashed herself and began talking to Hybrid, but he didn\u2019t respond. Then she nudged him and he jumped in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were in quite the daze. What were you thinking about? What I\u2019m going to do to you?\u201d Silvia asked, to which Hybrid gave no response. \u201cWhat\u2019s that phrase the humans said? You\u2019re starting to sound like a broken record, or something like that.\u201d \u201cMaybe I am, but broken records don\u2019t get played.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take for you to trust me?\u201d \u201cTime. I want to trust you because you\u2019ve been so generous, but I don\u2019t want to trust you and get screwed over. If I have time, maybe it\u2019ll have a better effect on me.\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be your enemy when I\u2019m trying to be your friend. Let\u2019s get going.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two set off again, avoiding as much of the forest as they could. They did well and made it out to a vast plain. The two crossed it, until they came upon a Torkoal, which seemed to be heading the opposite direction. \u201cTito!\u201d Silvia cried as she ran up and nuzzled the Torkoal. \u201cAh Silvia. It\u2019s been a few months since I last saw you. How have you been?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been doing fine. How have you been doing?\u201d \u201cTired as always. Who is this traveling with you?\u201d  Silvia turned to look at Hybrid. \u201cThat\u2019s Hybrid. He said he would help me find a Fire Stone so I could evolve. He\u2019s staying with me until he finds a nice place to live.\u201d \u201cVery unique name. However you seem to be getting the worse end of the deal. But that is your business. I wish I had time to chat, but I must be going. Maybe I\u2019ll see you back in the village.\u201d \u201cOkay. Bye Tito.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTito headed towards the forest while the duo headed toward Lemone. \u201cWho was that?\u201d \u201cTito? He takes care of the village I stayed in while heading toward your town. Really nice guy.\u201d \u201cSo you did know someone before you moved?\u201d \u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve never been able to consider him a friend. He acted like more of a father to me than my real father. He would give me food and comfort while my father barely had time because he was getting his ears rubbed.\u201d \u201cSo you don\u2019t like your parents?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like them because I love them, but they just would be so eager when getting attention from the humans that they would ignore me at times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was said then. Rather the two kept walking and eventually the sun faded into the horizon and the full moon rose to take its place. The world had been lit by the moonlight and Hybrid noticed the ground had changed. It suddenly felt rough and arid. \u201cWe\u2019re real close now. It should be just a few minutes until we got to my parent\u2019s house.\u201d Hybrid quietly followed behind, lest he strike that raw nerve again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally came upon a mansion, one that Hybrid recognized as the Wright household. \u201cYou live here?\u201d \u201cYep, and so do my parents and their humans.\u201d Silvia pushed open the gate slightly and Hybrid followed behind. The two walked behind the mansion and went through a door large enough for a Ninetales to go through. Inside the house had been overly decorated. \u201cI still have a hard time to believe you live with the Wrights.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s their last name. Why don\u2019t you think so?\u201d \u201cBecause with all the money they have, it\u2019s hard to believe you had to leave.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re rich? I never saw any form of it. Snobs. Anyway, let\u2019s be quiet. If they\u2019re here, we would regret waking them up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vulpix and Eevee climbed the stairs, letting their feet make barely a sound. Silvia went towards one end of the building and stood at a closed door. \u201cMy parents should be in here, if they\u2019re here at all. Think you can open the door?\u201d \u201cOnly if you make sure no one else can see me.\u201d Silvia turned around and looked both ways. Hybrid gave a quick glance both ways before standing on two paws. He then reached for the doorknob and slowly turned it, pushing it just far enough so that it could be pushed open. He then returned to all fours, while Silvia nudged the door open. Inside the two Ninetales were laying on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother, father, I have returned.\u201d The two jumped off the couch and ran over to their daughter with smiles. Hybrid carefully crept in, checking to see if the Wrights were in here as well. \u201cIt is so good to see you again dear. Have you been keeping well?\u201d \u201cI have been. I bathe regularly and I eat as much as I should. Where are your masters?\u201d \u201cThey left on their business trip and whatnot. You seem to have come at a lucky time. So have you found a human to reside with yet?\u201d \u201cNot quite. I live without one at the moment. I do however stay with this fellow.\u201d Silvia pointed to Hybrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents however, looked less than enthused. \u201cDoes he live with a human?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThen why are staying with you an out-of-species freak-of-nature stray?\u201d Hybrid had been taken back. Never had anyone been so rude as to insult him to his face. \u201cFather, why shouldn\u2019t I? He offers me companionship and if necessary, I believe he could protect me.\u201d \u201cHe is not a human. There is no way he could protect you, nor offer what a human could. The least you could do was return with a pokemon that had a human, but rather you bring HIM back. Now get him out of here and sleep here for the night.\u201d \u201cBut father\u2026\u201d \u201cNo buts, young lady. Now out with the stray.\u201d \u201cFine then.\u201d Silvia and Hybrid went out of the room and down to the foyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about all that. I didn\u2019t realize they were so harsh to the un-owned.\u201d Silvia whispered. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told them the truth. You do live with me, and I am a human.\u201d Hybrid responded in a similar manner. \u201cYeah, right. I have no collar or any human type gifts and you may stand on two legs naturally, but they wouldn\u2019t believe it. Would you like to stay in the cellar since we can\u2019t be near each other? It wouldn\u2019t be outside, but my parents wouldn\u2019t know about it.\u201d \u201cNo. I appreciate the offer, but I can see I\u2019m not welcome anywhere near here. It probably is better I leave. We\u2019ll meet tomorrow to look for your stone, right?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine until then?\u201d Silvia asked. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. You just take care of yourself.\u201d \u201cOkay then. Good night.\u201d \u201cNight\u201d Hybrid replied as he walked toward the door he entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinue the story from\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silvia walked back up the stairs, keeping a slow pace, wishing she would\u2019ve snuck out as well. Rather than staying in the room where her parents were sleeping, she went the opposite way. The Vulpix kept walking until she came on a door marked Thomas and Opal. She snickered to herself. There was plenty of room for the three pokemon that had once stayed in this room, but apparently the door could not possibly hold a third name. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe went in through the door designed, again, for a Ninetales. On stepping though, with the moonlight creeping through the blinds, the room felt alive and as though it were speaking to Silvia. She listened to her parents tell her stories while she slept in her bed. She heard everyone eating what simple and tasty food they had to eat. She recognized the sounds of playtime as she would play with her toys until she did not have the strength to play anymore. She heard it all, as though it were happening now.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut it was not alive, nor were there any sounds. The room was spotless when she felt it still should be cluttered. Her bed was pushed under a table when it should\u2019ve been in the corner where it belonged. Her memories were being corrupted by what her life had become when those same memories should as perfect as they once were. Her life was falling apart. Eighteen years old and all she had to show was how broken she was.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilvia climbed into the small bed and tried to sleep. But her heart was cracking, her tears cascading, her body froze, and her thoughts betraying her. What happened to the parents she knew, who when she was young, would help others and be caring to both humans and pokemon? Why is the only nice human she knew a mix of human and pokemon? Why did her parents stop loving her? That was the single most scarring thought. \u201cWhy don\u2019t my parents love me?\u201d She whispered among the tears. \u201cWhy?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and realized it was morning. The sun gleamed through the windows, only confirming the changes that had taken place in her old base of operations. She assumed the room had been abandoned by the dusty film on everything, but she herself did not have such a film so what could it have been? Silvia got out of the bed and stretched. She marched over to the old cardboard box and recognized the old doll she used to sleep with. It was a Clefairy and much like her blanket, it was old and well-worn out but she loved it just the same. She picked it up and cuddled it once more before returning it to its box.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilvia stood in the hallway, looking either way to see if anyone was awake. After no forms of life, she went downstairs and into the kitchen. There she found her parents eating something together. \u201cMorning mother. Morning father.\u201d \u201cMorning dear.\u201d \u201cMay I eat with you?\u201d \u201cOf course\u201d her dad said as he passed her some of the food. She took bites off and chewed with her mouth open, enjoying every single bite.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cChew with your mouth closed. I thought we raised you better than that.\u201d Her mother remarked. \u201cWe did. I\u2019ll bet its that boy she has staying with her.\u201d Her father said in response. Silvia finished the bite she had and looked at both her parents. \u201cHE has not done anything to effect me. It\u2019s that unnecessary mannerisms don\u2019t help you survive.\u201d \u201cWe were free at one point to you know, young lady. Etiquette was always necessary \u201cI know you were free once. But how many years ago was that?\u201d \u201cWe wait 198 years to have a child so she can have the best life possible and here she is back-talking us. I think you need to go to think about what you have that others don\u2019t.\u201d Silvia walked away from the table. \u201cWhere do you think you are going?\u201d \u201cWell if you will excuse me, Opal and Thomas, I am going to go back to what my oh-so-loving parents gave me: A trip to the outside world away from the nicer side of life so they can have more time with their humans. I am going to go to find my lower class friends, eat my lower class food, sleep in my lower class home, and survive the lower class way, since that is all I really have.\u201d Silvia darted off. \u201cSilvia!\u201d Her mother cried. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. She will come back. She has loves us too much not to apologize or say goodbye.\u201d Her father said, taking another bite of the food.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilvia ran outside, tears streaming from her eyes. She comes back to say hi, but the only things they care about is that she had a human for a friend that she never could talk to and that she acted proper, whether she was healthy or not. She slowed down and sat in the grass. She could feel it deep inside: A part of her cracking, breaking away from herself, never to return. She visualized that it looked like those documentaries she had seen when the little piece of solid ice broke off of the larger piece and floated away into the ocean, never to be a part of that bigger piece again. Indeed it was like a part of her had just died. She kept walking, now searching for that anthro Eevee.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilvia spotted him sitting beneath a tree that was off-property. She ran over to him, drying the tears from her eyes. On closer inspection she saw that he was sleeping. \u201cWake up!\u201d The Vulpix shouted. Hybrid shook himself awake, and looked around until he made eye contact with Silvia. \u201cGood morning?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s almost noon. Why aren\u2019t you looking for that stone?\u201d \u201cSorry got into a fight and have been sleeping it off. But I won. And I don\u2019t know these terrains like you do, so I thought we would go together.\u201d Silvia laid down and took a few deep breaths. \u201cAre you alright? You don\u2019t look so good\u201d Hybrid asked. \u201cYeah. Just tired. Sorry for yelling earlier.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine. But should not we be looking for your stone?\u201d \u201cYeah let\u2019s get started.\u201d Silvia stood up and walked in a direction opposite the mansion, with Hybrid following right behind. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey came on rougher terrain that had a slight warmth to it. \u201cWe\u2019re here. If the stones are still here, you should be able to see them sticking out of the ground.\u201d Silvia said, as the Eevee went off in separate direction than she headed.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHours had passed and the sun fell, with the slightly lesser moon taking its place. Hybrid had come on a stone that glowed in a tranquil orange hue. He was about to reach for it when he remembered if he did, he would more than likely evolve. So rather he called out for Silvia and she came running. \u201cI think I found one.\u201d Hybrid announced. \u201cThat\u2019s it alright. So, why did not you use it?\u201d \u201cBecause you are the one wanting to evolve, not me.\u201d She put her paw over her face in embarrassment. She touched it with her paw and she became swathed in a bright light. Hybrid looked away, and when his eyes returned, a Ninetales stood where a Vulpix once was.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Silvia asked. \u201cLike a pokemon.\u201d Hybrid stated, sarcasm evident. \u201cOh you have such a good sense of humor. Well, it\u2019s late. Let\u2019s go to the village and rest for the night.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you want to stay with your parents? I am fine sleeping outside.\u201d \u201cNo, we are not going back there. We are going to see Tito and stay with him.\u201d She marched along and the Eevee followed.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHybrid slowed down to look at the cave they stood by. Silvia went in and saw Tito eating some food. \u201cTito, we are here.\u201d He stopped to look at them. \u201cAh it\u2019s you two again. I see you found your stone Silvia.\u201d \u201cYes I did. Do you mind if we stay here for the night?\u201d \u201cNot at all. The lower level still is waiting to be used again. But why aren\u2019t you staying with your parents? I am sure they can offer you much more than I can here.\u201d \u201cI have my reasons.\u201d Silvia said, trying to restrain her emotion. \u201cMr. Hybrid, was it? Would you please go downstairs while Silvia and I have a personal talk?\u201d Hybrid complied and as soon he was far out of range, he began to speak. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilvia sat down and Tito stepped closer to her. \u201cSilvia, you stayed with me for nearly a month. I can tell when something\u2019s wrong. And by how you acted when I mentioned your parent, I would be willing to guess something happened there.\u201d \u201cWhy do you have to be so smart?\u201d She stated. \u201cBecause I watch over people here. I have to be. Now I know your parents and what happened after the first time you came here, but something made it worse this time.\u201d Tito said as he laid on his belly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t love me\u201d Said the Ninetales. \u201cNow Silvia-\u201d \u201cTito, please listen first. You know how they kicked me out. But this time I went back and after we gave the basic hello and all, they asked about Hybrid. When I said he was un-owned, they said some pretty harsh things. Then after making me kick him out, this morning they cared more about my manners than me.\u201d \u201cHm, I see. It sounds as though you feel your parents have lost touch with reality and also lost all love for you. Is not that right?\u201d Silvia did not say anything. \u201cSilvia, I could tell you how much your parents love you and how you just don\u2019t see it as that, because those are some facts. But I think you do have a point. They do appear to have lost a sense of life and only see things as needing to be the best. Go get some sleep, child. I\u2019ll have a word with them tomorrow.\u201d \u201cThanks Tito.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Silvia cuddled up to Tito before she joined Hybrid downstairs. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHybrid looked at her in confusion. \u201cYou could not tell me?\u201d \u201cHow many people have you told  when your life fell apart?\u201d Hybrid gestured for her to come over and see did. She laid down and he started scratching her belly. She could not help relax and smile. It went on until Hybrid fell asleep. Silvia smiled and wrapped herself around him. She had made a fair decision in asking for him to be her friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silvia gently awoke and noticed the little Eevee she had sleeping with her. He would move a bit but then be still. But the thing she noticed most was that he was smiling and clung to one of her tails as though it were some kind of comfort item, like her Clefairy doll. Silvia smiled and laid back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTito however walked down the stairs and noticed the two. \u201cI hate to wake the two of you, but I spoke with your parents Silvia.\u201d Silvia slowly stood up and walked over to Tito. Hybrid\u2019s grip slowly failed and woke up after feeling the tail slide passed his nose. \u201cSo what did they say?\u201d \u201cI was surprised at how rude they really were. I made it in there and it went as it did with your friend. They said hello then asked me to leave.\u201d Silvia shook her head. \u201cI thought you were good friends with my parents?\u201d \u201cOh we were amazing friends many moons ago. But now they apparently don\u2019t need me. What a shame that is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you tell them I was here?\u201d Silvia questioned. \u201cYes I did. Why do you ask?\u201d The Torkoal asked with a questioning grin. \u201cThen we should be going. They\u2019ll come here and start lecturing me. Tito, I think it\u2019s best if you tell them I left when you were talking to them.\u201d \u201cYour parents would leave that estate to come here?\u201d Hybrid said as he stood up \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it out of mind. We\u2019ll be off Tito. Again, thanks for everything.\u201d The two headed upstairs and were about to leave when Tito stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh by the way, did you two come through the forest on your way here?\u201d \u201cYes we did.\u201d Silvia said as she stopped moving. \u201cThat explains it all. You were the ones everyone was worried about.\u201d \u201cYou know what that was about?\u201d Hybrid asked. \u201cYes I do. There was a family of Eevee\u2019s who recently lost their youngest one, which you look almost exactly like. They wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t stir up any emotions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be careful going through then.\u201d Silvia and Hybrid then left the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalfway there\u201d Silvia noted as she kept walking. \u201cHey! Hold up!\u201d The Ninetales and Eevee stopped to look behind them, and that is when they saw a familiar face. \u201cYou were that Flareon we ran into before. Is there something we can do for you?\u201d \u201cYeah. Come on home! Mom and Dad want to see you again!\u201d the Flareon took off in a direction and they slowly followed behind him. \u201cWhat on Earth is he talking about? I bet he\u2019s never even met my mom and dad\u201d Hybrid said. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019s part of that family that lost their son.\u201d \u201cGreat\u201d Hybrid started \u201cA kid missing his departed sibling brings me home to his hurting family just because of some coincidence. Gotta love all these bits of terrible luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia and Hybrid came upon the cave where the Flareon disappeared to. \u201cI really don\u2019t know about this.\u201d  Hybrid said giving the cave a look. \u201cI know, but maybe you can offer some comfort or something.\u201d Silvia said as she led Hybrid into the cave. Inside sat a Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon and Espeon, all speaking directly to the Flareon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe understand you loved him a lot, but you can\u2019t keep fooling yourself with these illusions. First, his scent and now you\u2019re seeing him. Honestly Jack, you\u2019re starting to worry me.\u201d Hybrid looked to see the female voice belonged to the Jolteon. \u201cNow dear, do not cast doubt just yet. Those few berries did bear Lee\u2019s scent and they were picked fresh. As strange as it may sound, there could be a possibility.\u201d The relaxed voice was then tracked to the Vaporeon. \u201cMom, I have to agree with them. There has been a strange atmosphere since Jack brought those berries home.\u201d \u201cYou all saw him not wake up that morning, with all of our efforts and you refuse to accept his de-\u201d The Jolteon stopped to take a look at the guests at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid froze up. \u201cNothing can prepare me for this.\u201d He muttered. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Now let\u2019s stop looking so foolish and get this over with.\u201d \u201cAnd who might you two be?\u201d Asked the Jolteon. \u201cI\u2019m Silvia and this is\u2026 Hybrid. Jack asked for us to come here.\u201d Everyone moved closer, especially the Jolteon. \u201cI\u2019m Caroline. You know my son Jack, my daughter Melody, and my husband Charles. You look an awful lot like our late son.\u201d \u201cAnd he has his scent.\u201d \u201cAnd he feels a lot like him\u2026 Spiritually that is.\u201d \u201cSo how did that happen? He\u2019s been buried a few days and nobody has been there to disturb his resting place. So why do you have his scent, his look, and supposedly Lee\u2019s \u2018feeling\u2019. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid just sat there. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just do. I wish I knew, but I don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Caroline, if I may ask a question. When exactly did your son pass away?\u201d \u201cAbout five mornings ago.\u201d Silvia leaned over and whispered to Hybrid. \u201cThat was about the same time you \u2018blacked out\u2019 and you really do have his scent, as well as your own.\u201d \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but how would that happen?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She turned back to the family. \u201cDid Lee have any interests that involved being something other than an Eevee?\u201d \u201cHe did fancy the idea of being a human. Strange, but we respected him for it.\u201d Silvia grinned at the Eevee. \u201cNeed any more evidence?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid gave himself a face full of his own paw. \u201cWhat I need is for everything to actually be a book so I can read ahead.\u201d \u201cThe story is written all around you and continues to be written with each passing breath. What else is there to read?\u201d \u201cThe ending. It\u2019s always about how it ends.\u201d \u201cLooking for spoilers ruins the plot.\u201d \u201cAnd waiting for the ending takes much too long.\u201d \u201cWell, you might as well keep this story moving then. You probably should tell them our little theory.\u201d \u201cProbably should.\u201d Hybrid remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are you two babbling about?\u201d Asked Caroline. \u201cAre you sure you want to know, because we\u2019re thinking over here and the thoughts aren\u2019t exactly normal.\u201d Hybrid responded. All of them nodded. \u201cWell then, listen carefully and be ready to believe anything, because it is going to get strange.\u201d Hybrid swallowed and took a deep breath. Silvia came and wrapped her tails around him, as if to suggest comfort and support. Hybrid stood up on his back paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, truth be told, I\u2019m a human. Five days ago, I woke up one morning and left my home to get some outdoor air. I passed out and didn\u2019t wake up until that night. Now what happened after that doesn\u2019t have any effect on you, but it\u2019s the concept of when I passed out that affects you all directly. I mentioned I passed out five mornings ago, which is when you lost your son. So my theory is that-\u201d \u201cYou and Lee somehow merged into one body. That does explain the scents and appearance, and all that.\u201d Melody mentioned. \u201cYou\u2019re right in the sense of madness. I have a hard time believing such a ridiculous theory. It has no logic whatsoever.\u201d \u201cBut mom. It does explain-\u201d  \u201cJack, I don\u2019t want to hear any of this nonsense. We all watched him die and you want to argue he\u2019s still alive!\u201d Caroline stormed out of the cave as Charles sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that you two. We all believe you ummm\u2026 Hybrid, even my wife does. But like she said, we watched Lee perish. It is hard to believe that you and he are one in the same. But with all these concepts and these strange feelings that I can\u2019t explain, I think we can find a way to believe it. I\u2019m going to, well, find your mother and talk with her about this all. She\u2019s probably taking this harder than anybody realizes. Why don\u2019t you two stay for the night? We\u2019d like to, I guess catch you up on what you don\u2019t know or maybe find out what you live like now.\u201d The Vaporeon left the cave in pursuit of his wife, leaving only the siblings and Silvia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can we meet your human parents?\u201d Jack questioned, causing Hybrid to look off in the distance and remain silent. Silvia took up on the question. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Hybrid never got the chance to tell his parents goodbye, and he doesn\u2019t think he can go back because unlike with your parents, there\u2019s no way his parents could recognize him or maybe even accept him. He\u2019s not really a human or just an Eevee, but rather something in between. So he\u2019s staying with me, until he can either find a way back to being human or a way to prove who he is.\u201d \u201cWell, at least you still have our parents and all of us to keep you company.\u201d \u201cYes I do, but I don\u2019t know anything about them or you. I know I met Jack a few days ago, and I know we\u2019re all related, but that\u2019s all. My memories are only from my human life, not the life of your brother.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid\u2019s head dropped a little. Jack and Melody moved in closer to Hybrid. They nuzzled him, showing a form of affection that he had never experienced: An affection that can only be shared between siblings. Something within him grew curious, for with this new affection came emotions he was not highly familiar with, but he most certainly enjoyed feeling them. \u201cThen let\u2019s make some memories, so if you do ever go back to being human, you\u2019ll always know who and where your family is.\u201d Melody remarked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hybrid collapsed on the ground with Silvia lying down on her blanket. The duo had just made it back from Hybrid\u2019s new family and his jaw now hung low, what with all the chatting and such he had done. Despite it all though, he felt a sense of satisfaction. The theory may be wrong, but at least he now some explanation for the neighbors when they came asking, even if it was hair-brained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now what?\u201d Silvia questioned as she let out a massive yawn. \u201cI was hoping to sleep for the rest of the night, unless you had some other plan.\u201d \u201cSounds fine to me. Just one question for you.\u201d \u201cI swear if it\u2019s about this whole cross body-change-thing, I\u2019m going to flip.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not. I was just wondering if you trust me yet.\u201d Hybrid sighed. \u201cYou left your parents to come with me, you\u2019ve been by my side through all these things, and you\u2019re still offering me shelter, so I guess the answer is yes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia leapt from her blanket to standing over Hybrid. She nuzzled his face and even lied with him. \u201cI love you too.\u201d Silvia said. \u201cNow hold it. I said I trusted you. Love and trust are two completely different words.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re going to try and tell me you have no feelings of affection for me whatsoever? I find that hard to believe.\u201d \u201cWell it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have affection for you, but we\u2019re completely different species. I\u2019m half human and half Eevee and you\u2019re full Ninetales. I think of my affection for you more like a sister or guardian rather than a partner.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s how you want it to be, I\u2019ll be fine with it. But just think about this: If you don\u2019t have feelings of love for me, then who? Who would love you in your current state?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to turn me towards you won\u2019t work, ya know.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you see me as your only option. I\u2019m trying to make sure you\u2019re thinking like you should be. You\u2019re not human enough anymore. You\u2019re more pokemon than human. Your best options for love are with a pokemon now, or at least until you figure out a remedy for your little problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid swallowed that thought hard. Silvia was absolutely right. No more seeing Sally walk down the halls. He couldn\u2019t go try to win Alexandra over with some smooth moves. He couldn\u2019t even go and talk with all his old chums. The thoughts soon dissipated as his exhaustion overtook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia grabbed her blanket and pulled it over the both of them. She really did have feelings for him. It was a hard concept for her to grasp as well, because love between a human and pokemon should never exist. But she couldn\u2019t deny what her heart was telling her. She wanted him, but not for that nice body of his. No, she felt something in him that she hadn\u2019t known for a while: love, and compassion.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night had rolled on, as the sunlight had been stripped away so the starlight may cast their beauty on the world. The sounds and sights of the day slammed to a halt as actions of silence and solitude took over. There were three forms however that kept the night alive, with the largest of them taking the lead. The lead figure dashed off towards a cave in the forest outside the city, with the other two figures following clumsily behind, barely keeping the pace of the lead shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe form that had lead the other two wandered into the cave looked around. \u201cMaster!? Master, are you here?\u201d Silvia awoke, but Hybrid stayed in his state of slumber. Silvia threw her flame to the torches of the cave, thus lighting up the faces of the figures at the cave entrance. The familiar maw of Torch was easily identified, but the other figures were as well. Silvia leaned into the sleeping form of Hybrid and whispered into his ear \u201cI think you should probably get up.\u201d The Eevee woke up but kept himself concealed beneath the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would Torch have brought us here, honey? There\u2019s nothing but a sleeping Ninetales.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know dear. This is Torch we\u2019re talking about dear. If anybody can find Mark, it\u2019s Torch.\u201d Hybrid knew those voices and he knew what that meant: Torch had brought his parents\u2019 home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTorch! What were you thinking?!\u201d Hybrid shouted. Everybody perked up and Silvia recoiled from the intensity of Hybrid\u2019s shout. Torch went rushing over to the lump in the blanket where Hybrid was. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mark or Hybrid or whatever it is you wish to be called, but I felt it was important.\u201d Hybrid\u2019s parents began asking Torch about Mark and whispering to each other \u201cI hope so, because I was enjoying my sleep, even if it wasn\u2019t at home.\u201d \u201cCome on. Don\u2019t be so bitter or nervous. Just go and show them. It\u2019ll be one less burden off everyone\u2019s chest.\u201d Silvia said as she lowered her maw closer to his face. He dreaded the thought of the meeting, but it did need to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi mom. Hi dad. How have you been?\u201d \u201cMark? Is that you? Where have you been, young man?\u201d Asked his father. \u201cWell you see, it\u2019s a long and complicated story, which makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d \u201cDid something happen, because if something did happen we\u2019d still love you.\u201d His mother stated. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of whether you love me or not. The problem is you wouldn\u2019t recognize me, since you didn\u2019t know who I was just a few nights ago. Torch, could you help me up?\u201d Torch lowered his nose and Hybrid propelled himself up. With Torch and Silvia at his side, Hybrid walked up to his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine and Ninetales moved away a bit and sat as Hybrid moved up to his parents. \u201cWell here I am. What\u2019ya think? Pretty different, huh?\u201d His parents didn\u2019t move and just stared. \u201cWhat kind of trick is this? Where are you hiding Mark?\u201d \u201cSee Torch, this is exactly why I\u2019ve been here and not going home. They don\u2019t believe me.\u201d \u201cYes, it would appear so. It seems you were right again.\u201d Torch said humbly. \u201cHave to be once in a while. So mom and dad, what\u2019s it going to take to prove I am who I say I am?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t believe it. My boy was a human, not a Ditto or robot or whatever you are.\u201d Hybrid\u2019s dad said. Hybrid stood on all fours and looked up to his parents. \u201cRecognize me now? You know the Eevee Torch almost mauled the other night? He\u2019s not one to attack random Pokemon and you know that. There has to be a reason he almost attacked me that night and led you to this cave. Just think about it.\u201d His parents looked at each other with deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid went over to the food stuffs and grabbed a berry to eat, to which Silvia barked. \u201cIt\u2019s this late at night! Why are you eating?\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019m hungry.\u201d He replied bluntly. \u201cSo, umm Mark, if you really are who you say you are, why have you been hiding out here?\u201d \u201cBecause look at me mom, I\u2019m obviously not human and I\u2019m not really a pokemon either. Silvia, the Ninetales right there, was kind enough to offer me hospitality and food.\u201d \u201cSo you can talk to pokemon?\u201d \u201cYes I can. Otherwise I\u2019m sure Torch would\u2019ve brought you both here sooner. But he decided to listen to my request and leave you where you were. Well, until now that is. So what\u2019s so important that he brought you out here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, originally since tomorrow was your birthday, we figured we\u2019d let you know that we were planning on moving away from here in the city to a house in the country. Then we would have more room to live. But since you disappeared, we\u2019ve been packing up everything to leave the day after tomorrow.\u201d \u201cOh\u201d Hybrid said as he rubbed the back of his head. \u201cTorch, I apologize for being so rude. This was important news. Here have a berry since it\u2019s all I can offer you.\u201d Hybrid threw a berry at Torch and he happily caught it between his jaws. Silvia wasn\u2019t quite as happy. \u201cStop eating my food! We do need to eat at other times rather than just tonight!\u201d \u201cWell Silvia, I think you won\u2019t need to worry about that for too much longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this matters, but we are going to Lemone. There\u2019s room there and a large yet affordable house. So you are going to come with us right, or is this your home now?\u201d \u201cWell since we\u2019ll be out of city, I\u2019ll come. But it won\u2019t be just us and Torch, but Silvia as well.\u201d Silvia\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cDo you mean I can live with you?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve done me a favor. I need to repay the debt. Besides, it\u2019ll put you over the top with your parents, since they were so foolish as to instantly exclude me.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about Mark?\u201d Asked Hybrid\u2019s father. \u201cBasically either Silvia, again this Ninetales, is coming to live with us or I\u2019m not going.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid\u2019s parents were a bit taken back. \u201cWell then I guess we\u2019ll have to make sure we have room then. We\u2019ll get all your things together and haul them to the house.\u201d \u201cThat sounds great. We\u2019ll meet you there because we\u2019re going to walk.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want dear.\u201d Hybrid moved over to his parents and gave them a hug, as they returned the gesture. \u201cWe missed you Mark.\u201d \u201cI know. I have too, and now I can finally come home.\u201d Torch moved in and gestured to Silvia to do the same. After some hesitation, the Ninetales moved into the hug with her new family.</span></div></div>",

Silvia had barely managed to allow Hybrid\u2019s parents to take her blanket, but she didn\u2019t want to carry it around and have something happen to it. SO She gave it to them and would get it back once she got to her new home. Hybrid however walked with a spring in his step. Now he could go home and be with his family and Torch, and Silvia now was with\u2026 He slowed down a bit. He would be with Silvia from now on. Something inside him felt fuzzy. He knew this sensation as affection, but was he really falling for Silvia? She had beauty and personality, but could he truly find his place with her? He tried not to think about it too much, but some thoughts can\u2019t be avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo kept walking when Silvia asked a question. \u201cSo should we bring your family along with us?\u201d Hybrid stopped completely. \u201cWhat are you talking about? They\u2019re going there on their own, remember?\u201d \u201cNot them. Your pokemon family. They wanted to meet your human family and we are going there anyway.\u201d \u201cI guess it would be a good idea. But will traveling in such a massive pack be a good idea?\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t be that bad. We can manage.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia and Hybrid got back to walking. Silvia wanted to be in a home with love and care and friends, and Hybrid wanted to be with his family again. Now they both were getting what they wanted in one simple swing. But certain family members appeared on the road ahead, and Silvia didn\u2019t look too pleased to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia started mumbling things to herself and Hybrid started to fall back a bit, out of caution. The inevitable finally came and Silvia and her parents were staring eye-to-eye. \u201cWhere have you been? You run off without letting us know and have Tito attempt to cover your escape. Why are being such a disgraceful wench?\u201d \u201cBecause both of you are being arrogant snobs. You have no acceptance of anyone except those with a human. I bet that even then you would look down because they don\u2019t live in extreme wealth.\u201d Silvia snapped. Hybrid said nothing and merely watched as the argument raged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause they don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re missing out on. All they need to do is make a simple gesture and the humans are there to take care of our needs.\u201d \u201cAnd that also makes me sick. You see humans as tools.\u201d \u201cBecause they ask for it dear. They feed you and care for you and all they ask in return is for you to cuddle up to them or do some cute act every now and then. It\u2019s quite simple dear.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoy using them for your pleasure and ignoring all those friends you used to know. I\u2019m going to stay with my human now. I\u2019ll prove why I\u2019m better than you can be.\u201d \u201cOh you have a human now? Where is it at?\u201d \u201cMaybe if you would\u2019ve come to visit me rather than lecture me, you\u2019d know. C\u2019mon Hybrid\u201d Silvia said as her tails enveloped Hybrid\u2019s smaller form. He could not resist her strength and was trapped in his prison as Silvia took off running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid eventually grew irritated and started nibbling on her tails, prompting her to release him. \u201cI can walk, you know.\u201d He remarked. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t walking. We were running and you wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep up.\u201d \u201cDo you ever plan on making up with your parents or do you not care what happens to them.\u201d \u201cI have hundreds of years to make it up. I\u2019ll do it when they lose that pompous attitude of theirs.\u201d \u201cI may have a smaller life span, but you\u2019re plan seems stupid. But it\u2019s your life and your choices. And about this whole human thing. Since when do I have any dominance over you or what you do?\u201d \u201cThe same way you do over Torch. You don\u2019t control him or boss him around much, but he seems to consider you his master. Besides, I like the thought of being yours.\u201d \u201cSilvia, me and Torch are like brothers. We aren\u2019t like siblings.\u201d \u201cOh and why not. Is it that you feel\u2026 affection towards me?\u201d Hybrid turned away. \u201cYes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia started to rub her maw against him. \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed. It\u2019s perfectly fine. Especially when my parents find out.\u201d \u201cNow you\u2019re using me like a tool, against your parents.\u201d \u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cSilvia, yes you are. I\u2019m now proof to your parents that you\u2019re going to better than them.\u201d \u201cSorry. I just want to prove to them-\u201d Hybrid cut her off. \u201cThat what? You can handle yourself? That you can do things they can\u2019t? Silvia, what\u2019s the point of loving if it\u2019s not love for the other, but the ability to puppet them? I\u2019m not yours to control and use as you see fit. I\u2019m not going to be around you much if it\u2019s going to be a matter of outdoing someone else and I\u2019m just your tool.\u201d Silvia hung her head in shame. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid ignored her and kept walking. Silvia trotted behind and let the silence remain. Eventually they came upon the cave where his family lived and his \u2018little brother\u2019 came outside. \u201cLee, what are you doing here? I thought you were going home.\u201d \u201cWe did, but there\u2019s a change of plans. Is\u2026 mom and dad home?\u201d \u201cYeah and so is Melody. Why do you want to know?\u201d Hybrid gave a sign and along with Silvia, they went in the cave. \u201cHey uh family I have an announcement. I went home and my\u2026 human parents caught up with me. Needless to say, I\u2019m going to be living with them now in our new home and figured you all should come and meet them.\u201d Everyone smiled and agreed to the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when would we be there?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re on our way now.\u201d \u201cThen you both should rest here for the night. We can leave early tomorrow and make it there at sunset. Besides, you\u2019re just in time to eat.\u201d Silvia and Hybrid joined everyone and started eating the little bits of food. The cave was alive with chatter and when night came, everyone sat in their own space and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid woke up earlier than his siblings and Silvia the next morning. However his parents were already up and nibbling on some berries. Hybrid tried to stand up, but felt some weight on him. He noticed Melody and Jack were lying on top of him. Caroline and Charles only smiled. Charles walked over to Hybrid. \u201cThey\u2019ve been missing you since you died Lee. They\u2019ve had a hard time coping. And when you showed up and then left the other day, they wanted to follow you home. Now that they\u2019ve got you here, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to let you go. You were the baby of the family, now you\u2019re all grown up. It\u2019s feels so strange saying such things, but what else do we have to go on. You don\u2019t have a problem with them lying with you, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that they\u2019re laying with me, but that I\u2019m a brother to them based on belief and I don\u2019t know a thing about anything here. I feel kind of\u2026 bad.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t think of it that way. Even if you aren\u2019t really our son somehow, we still will consider you family.\u201d \u201cThanks, I guess. So, mom and dad, are you ready to meet my mom and dad?\u201d \u201cYes we are. But how does it feel knowing you have two sets of parents?\u201d \u201cTo be honest, I feel like I\u2019m the child of an affair that went horribly wrong.\u201d They both laughed. However everyone started to stir and so the day had officially started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had finished, they got up and marched to Hybrid\u2019s house. Hybrid and Silvia led, with everyone else following closely behind. However as they entered Lemone, Hybrid and Silvia stopped, causing the pack to stop moving. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Asked Melody. \u201cWe kind of didn\u2019t get directions on where to go from here.\u201d Everyone shook their heads in shame. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan then? Just wander around until we find it? It\u2019ll be pitch black at that point.\u201d The Jolteon said. \u201cTrue. So since that\u2019s one option let\u2019s try a different approach. I used to be able to call Torch with a whistle. Let\u2019s see if I still can.\u201d Hybrid tried to whistle in every way he could. However, the fur on his lips seemed to prevent a decent whistle from coming out. He noticed a blade of grass and quickly changed his method. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put it to his lips and blew on it just right, creating the whistle he desired. They all waited for a few moments, letting its sound carry on the gentle breeze. \u201cSo who is Torch?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine. An Arcanine, but a friend.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s just going to come because there\u2019s a whistle?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. Once more. If this doesn\u2019t work, we wander around.\u201d Hybrid blew on the grass again, letting the whistle chime through the evening air. Everyone sat and waited until the Arcanine came into sight. One second later and Torch was standing directly in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you heard my whistle.\u201d Hybrid said. \u201cI heard more of an \u2018I\u2019m lost and come rescue me\u2019. Who are all these other people?\u201d \u201cWell, they would be my additional family.\u201d Torch sat there a minute. \u201cExplain.\u201d He said. \u201cHow about we get home and I can tell you and my human parents at the same time.\u201d Hybrid said as he looked around. Torch led them off to a house much farther than anyone expected. But it was a fairly large house. Hybrid saw his parents standing on the porch, waiting for him. He could finally say he was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Choose an event for the next chapter)</span></div></div>",

Everyone was enjoying themselves, except for Hybrid, who had to play translator all night. He explained the current theory behind his change, as well as his lifestyle for the past week. Anything either side asked was answered, and Hybrid\u2019s human parents brought out some food for everyone to enjoy. The night had been alive with joyous chatter and satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it ended as the moon stood nearly overhead. Hybrid\u2019s Eevee family went out into the night, even though they had offers to stay for the night. They declined, saying they wanted to visit an old friend in the vicinity. Shortly after they left, Hybrid\u2019s parents took him and Silvia for a tour around the house. It was a very large home, with two floors and a basement. Silvia felt at home, just without all the arrogance. Hybrid knew that while he wasn\u2019t quite ready for this change of setting, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be a terrible thing. But to everyone else it didn\u2019t matter. They found the piece of the family at this home that had been missing back in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here is your room Mark. We\u2019ll see you in the morning hun. Oh, and happy birthday.\u201d His parents walked out of the room and Torch went with them. Hybrid climbed up onto the bed and noticed Silvia\u2019s blanket sitting up there. He threw it down to her and she eagerly caught it. \u201cHybrid I\u2019m noticing some things now. You wanted me to call you Hybrid, but everyone else is still calling you by the names they know you as. Why is that?\u201d Hybrid sighed. \u201cBecause we met and you knew me only as this mixed creature, and I wanted a name to match that. I never assumed we\u2019d meet up with anybody who knew me by any other name, but I guess not everything goes according to plan.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re still okay with Hybrid?\u201d \u201cYep. It gives variety. Something I will hear every day only from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s also something else I wanted to bring up.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Hybrid said as he started placing his things where he wanted them. Silvia carefully crept up behind him, but he hadn\u2019t yet noticed. His mind really was on this room and its perfect organization. Silvia walked in front of him and let her tails rub against his torso. \u201cToday is your birthday and I haven\u2019t gotten you anything.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I stayed with you for a week and all. I think we\u2019re even.\u201d Hybrid said obliviously. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to be staying with you for much longer than a week. I know we just met and all, but I think there\u2019s one gift that will help even things out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid lost his focus on the project and focused in on Silvia. He knew what she was hinting at, and he knew what his brain was telling him, but he couldn\u2019t deny her. He loved her, and she was offering herself up to him. He didn\u2019t want to rush this relationship, but he was confused by his two heads thinking differently. \u201cAre you wanting what I think you are?\u201d \u201cPossibly. Would you be willing to find out?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure being so direct would be a good idea for us.\u201d \u201cThen how about just this once, and we can decide when next time should be. You know you want to go at it as much as I do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia kept walking around him and letting her tails stroke his body. He tried to deny what he was feeling, but he realized denying Silvia any longer would\u2019ve been foolish. His breathing grew a bit more rapid, his mind went to a more primal state, and his shaft arose from its sheath. \u201cLet\u2019s take this somewhere a bit more fitting.\u201d Hybrid said. Silvia noticed he seemed a bit more dominant, but she didn\u2019t mind. It would only make this a bit more fun, and give Hybrid the power she wanted him to use. She was ready to be owned by a human, especially if he was as gorgeous and kind as Hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid marched to the nearest bathroom, staff still erect.  Silvia followed closely behind and went inside with him. He jumped to turn on the lights and closed the door. \u201cGet in the tub\u201d Hybrid said and Silvia complied. As soon as she was inside of it, he shut the lights off and joined her. \u201cPlaying in the dark, are we?\u201d Silvia asked. \u201cIt only enhances the experience. Let\u2019s get started then.\u201d Hybrid got on his knees and put his hands on Silvia\u2019s rear. He lowered his maw and used his thumbs to part her lips. His tongue darted in the gap and Silvia jolted with pleasure. Hybrid licked every wall and everything in reach, from the outside, to the clitoris, to the deepest his tongue could extend. He went for a few minutes of licking her vagina and bringing her the most pleasure his tongue could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia was in a state of bliss through it all. She loved it so much, the feeling of his tongue so deep inside of her, running over every square inch and in a way that seemed almost professional. She noticed her tails moving like wild, but as much as she tried to control them, they remained wild and untamed. The nine tails of the Ninetales were only gauges for her pleasure, and Hybrid certainly used them to perfection. She was moaning with pleasure and her juices slowly started to find their way to Hybrid\u2019s tongue. He gave one last lick, spreading what bit of juice Silvia spent around her lips. Now he had his path smooth and wet, ready for the real show.  He got up off his knees and took his hands off, giving himself a minute to get ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia felt the tongue stop, but she really didn\u2019t care. The first part was so pleasuring and lasting. She felt every muscle inside her vagina convulse and she was shaking with delight. She knew the first time was going to be a rush, but nothing could possibly prepare her for this. She wanted him. Her hormones stopped her from feeling anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid lined himself up and slowly started prodding Silvia. He then moved his shaft up and rubbed it against her clitoris. She moaned and Hybrid was in complete control. Hybrid kept going back for her clit and she continually showed her pleasure, flushing her fluids all over him and shifting her hips. Hybrid had enough teasing though and wanted the real thrill. He drove himself inside of her and Silvia gave a loud moan. Hybrid put in most of his member inside of her, except for his knot. He wouldn\u2019t do that until the end, when he knew he was going to lose his load. So he started out moving back and forth slowly, bringing on little bits of sensational joy. Then, when that effect had started to fade, he sped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia was still feeling massive amounts of pleasure and Sylvia\u2019s convulsions gave Hybrid a wave of satisfaction. Her fluids had created a perfect lubricant and gave for a smooth movement, so he felt nothing but smooth and tight muscles massaging every inch of his cock and her tension drove Hybrid\u2019s pleasure even higher, causing him to lose a little bit more of his control. So he finally forced his knot inside of her. She moaned loudly again. Silvia couldn\u2019t believe how nice this felt. The conclusion was soon to come and she knew it, but she was too consumed by bliss to care. She closed her eyes and let the Eevee do his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid knew his knot was offering him a pleasure no human could comprehend. So he closed his eyes and moved it around, stirring all the greatness he desired. Silvia\u2019s muscles were being spread tight around his knot and still gave a comfortably tense feel. He was loving this, but a certain tingling appeared. Silvia was gushing at this point, and he could feel it was nearly his turn. So he made one last shift, letting what happened happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid felt like he was no longer moving and he opened his eyes. It was as if time had frozen. He was in a vast abyss of yellow space, and all he could see was Silvia. Something inside him drove him to think more about her, and oddly enough, he did. She was a Ninetales, They were having sex and she was his lover, she was a great person since the beginning, and she was\u2026 a friend. Hybrid realized she was a friend, and not just with benefits. She was someone he could trust and count on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid collapsed on his hands and knees as he climaxed on the bathtub floor. He was breathing deeply and quickly as the last bits of his load dripped out. He heard Silvia breathing deeply and moaning, but for some reason, he didn\u2019t feel her. He didn\u2019t remember pulling out of Silvia\u2019s vagina. However he felt something thick dripping on top of him. He wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but there was enough to cover his torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHybrid, where did you go?\u201d Silvia muttered between her exhausted breaths. \u201cI\u2019m here. Where did you go?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still here. What happened?\u201d Hybrid looked around and noticed multiple things. First off, his vision had improved and he now could see impressively well in the darkness. Second, he noticed a massive figure towering over him. And finally, he was in a large basin-like structure with fluids all over the floor. Hybrid looked himself over before he could confirm what happened, and to his dismay, he knew exactly what had happened. He shook some of the fluid off and jumped onto the ridge of what he knew to be the bath tub and carefully hopped onto various things until he got to the light switch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forced it up by jumping and the room was brightened. Indeed, Hybrid\u2019s fears were confirmed as the light revealed his size had gone from three feet to only about one and half feet tall. His form had gone from that of a silver Eevee to a blue-ringed Umbreon. And after much looking around, hoping this wasn\u2019t real, but Hybrid had come to terms with what his first sexy time had left him with. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silvia turned around and looked at the belittled form of Hybrid. What had once been a silver Eevee that could look her in the eyes was now a diminished form of a blue-ringed Umbreon. Hybrid was looking himself over in the mirror by the sink, and his expression was not of anger or glee, but sorrow. It was obvious he was trying to smile, but something in his face left him with a broken image. Silvia felt regret. In her attempt to pleasure both herself and Hybrid, he had been set with the cost for pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia lay down in the tub and waited. Hybrid came hopping back into the tub and walked up to Silvia\u2019s muzzle. He slowly started petting it, but lacked of any strength or desire. Rather his hand just dragged along. He walked to the edge of the curtain and pulled it completely closed. Afterwards, he went back to the faucet and turned on the water to both the shower function and to a fairly hot temperature. Silvia let the water wash over her body and Hybrid climbed on top of her and lied down. Neither one of them said a word. Hybrid obviously was depressed and Silvia felt guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the water had washed away their juices and any sign of pleasure, Hybrid shut the water off. The two shook the water from their fur. Silvia then pulled opened the curtain and stepped outside the bath. Hybrid followed and opened a cabinet under the sink. He pulled a towel from it and dragged it out for Silvia. She rubbed herself on it to dry off and after she was done, Hybrid took his turn. Silvia hung it over the tub\u2019s rim after both of them were completely dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo walked backed to Hybrid\u2019s room and took their places. Hybrid managed to leap onto the bed though he was small and Silvia took to the floor with her blanket. They sat there for a few moments before Silvia spoke up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all this. I thought we could both enjoy it.\u201d Hybrid sat up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know it was going to happen. Besides I guess I\u2019m a bit more powerful now.\u201d Silvia stood up and walked to the side of his bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not really happy about this, are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid sighed. \u201cNo I\u2019m not. I just get adjusted to one form and then it changes again. I also am much smaller and have lost access to things I could do. I thought having sex would help to relieve some stress rather than increase it.\u201d \u201cI guess we got too friendly with each other, and that\u2019s why you evolved.\u201d \u201cYeah, but why did I have to get smaller? Why does everything seem completely fictional until it happens to me? I\u2019ve got two families to take care of and I\u2019m smaller than all of them. I\u2019ve got learn a whole new set of skills, and adjust to in essence, a new world.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia just lied back on her blanket. Hybrid needed some time to himself to figure things out. \u201cSilvia?\u201d He cried out. \u201cYes?\u201d she responded. \u201cCould you come up here and sleep with me. I\u2019m\u2026 a bit cold.\u201d \u201cSilvia grabbed her blanket and jumped onto Hybrid\u2019s bed. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep with you, just this once.\u201d She said with a hint of humor in her voice. She laid down with her blanket over her and Hybrid worked his way into a gap. \u201cI really am sorry things happened this way.\u201d Silvia said. \u201cI know you are. But it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll adjust and things should stay normal after that. I love you.\u201d Hybrid said as he got comfortable. \u201cI love you too.\u201d Silvia said as she gave him a gentle lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid woke up the next morning and noticed Silvia was still deeply asleep. He carefully maneuvered out from her paws and stretched. He wanted to go downstairs, but waited for Silvia to give him a free ride. Soon enough, she awoke and stretched out. She moved her maw to rub it against Hybrid, to which he began petting it. Silvia got off the bed and Hybrid hopped on top of her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cGetting a ride. Why? Is that wrong?\u201d \u201cWhat gives you that right?\u201d She shot back. \u201cWell, I figured you would let me. Besides, I gave you quite the ride last night.\u201d Silvia giggled. \u201cThat you did. One I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvia walked down the stairs and into the kitchen where everyone was gathered. Everyone watched as Silvia came strutting in with Hybrid on her head. His parents were a bit shocked, but Torch was laughing. Silvia jumped onto a chair and Hybrid hopped from her head to the table. \u201cMorning family. Morning\u2026 Torch.\u201d Hybrid said. \u201cMorning pipsqueak\u201d Torch replied. Hybrid growled. \u201cMorning dear. So, you evolved. Good for you.\u201d \u201cYes, now I can\u2019t do anything on my own. Yippee.\u201d \u201cWell don\u2019t let that bother you. Just eat some breakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid ate what he could and passed the rest to Silvia. \u201cWell dear, we\u2019re going to get you a cake to make up for yesterday. Is there anything we can get you for a late birthday present?\u201d \u201cA pair of stilts.\u201d Torch remarked. \u201cYou know what Torch; I don\u2019t care if they can\u2019t hear you. I\u2019m not amused. No more ear scratches for you or leftover pizza for you.\u201d Hybrid snapped back. Torch lowered his head a bit. \u201cNo I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m back here in a house with everyone I care about. That\u2019s all I need, or can actually have at this size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid\u2019s parents left, leaving Torch, Silvia, and Himself home. Hybrid was riding around on Torch\u2019s head, occasionally scratching one of his ears. Everyone was enjoying themselves, with Torch and Hybrid acting like children, and Silvia watching the whole ordeal. \u201cSo Torch, if you do not mind me asking, what ever happened to your parents?\u201d Silvia asked. Torch stopped running. \u201cI really don\u2019t know. I just remember them there one day, and the next thing was Mark bringing me home. I wish I knew where to start looking so I could at least say hi, but I don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell, you may not know where they are, but you\u2019ll always know where your other family is.\u201d Hybrid said as starting rubbing Torch\u2019s ears again. \u201cYes that is true. And now that you can understand me, I thank you for removing me from the streets and offering me a home.\u201d \u201cIt was nothing. Now let\u2019s-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHybrid was cut off by the sound of banging at the front door. Everyone looked at each other.

actualy worn by princesses.she then exaimened the two outfits,the pink and white frilly dress was beautiful and it went down to her knee's,it also had a heart outlined in white in the spot where it would cover her breasts,the gloves went to her elbos and were white just like the boots,the boots were intresting,they were high heeled boots that went to her knee's and were extremely comfortable to walk in,the panties and bra were a matching set and had a flower and heart with rainbows printed on them.the yellow dress however went down to her feet had gorgeous yellow heels had no gloves to go with it,the dress was extremely detailed and pretty,the panties and bra for this one were black with white poka dots,the bra however was strapless.ashley deeply impressed by both dresses stripped her clothes and slipped into the yellow dress and all of its accessories,then may came in and was uterly shocked.\"whoa ashley,where did you get the beautifull dress?\"may asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley then explained to may had happened so far.\"so thats whats making you dress fancy huh,well let me do your hair real quick.\"may said.ashley let may fix her hair and then left looking like a actual princess.she then found herself on the bow of the ship.\"agh there is the lovely ashley.\"a mysterious voice said.\"jeremy?\"she said.\"yes,i am the one who left those dresses on your bed.\"jeremy says.\"but your the host of the battle royale and the host of this cruise.\"ashley asked.\"yes i am the host of this cruise and i was wondering if you would care to dance with me?\"he says seductivly.\"s-sure,why n-not?\"ashley replies.they slowley began to dance until someone grabbed ashley.\"mind if i cut in?\"kurt says while holding ashleys hand.\"kurt what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe askes.\"you obviously wernt comfortable dancing with that pile of crap.\"he says.\"dont tell me your jealous that he got me two beautiful dresses and got me to dance with him.\"ashley says playfully.\"well-i-er-ugh-hey are you going to talk or dance,cau-\"was all he was able to say before ashley leaned closer and kissed him.the kiss lasted 5 minutes.after that they both met up with the others and were about to attend the battle royale until the ship shook violently.\"what was that!?!\"kurt and ashley both asked.suddenly a huge creature came through the wall,it was completly armored was carring a 4 barreled rocket launcher,a mini gun,and tentecals were coming out of every avaliable spot on its body,but on the side team tyrants insignia was visable.\"RUN!!!!!\"jacobs shouted.and run they did,they ran until they were in the cargo hold surrounded by strange tubes and syringes.suddenly the creature backhanded ashley and threw a huge peice of the floor at her,ashley tried to evade it but it was too late,the metal slab cut into her right arm and pinned her into place.ashley passed out due to losing so much blood,the creature then proceded to attack the others launching missles and hosing them with bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley then awoke to see her friends and family geting beatin up by the strange creature,then she saw a syringe on the floor and with painful effort managed to get unstuck and began to crawl towards the syringe,ashley had torn off her right arm in the process of getting herself free from the giant slab of metal and had now finally reached the syringe,grasping it with her left arm she then injected herself with whatever was in the syringe and instantly her right arm grew back,but it was different,it was curvy had a spiral like pattern,the fingers on the end looked like spikes,electricity was being emitted all over her new arm.however her teal eyes turned red and black blood began to ooze out of her wounds.after the pain became managable she got up and stabbed the creature with her blade like hand.ashley then focused her eletricity into her finger tips and killed the strange creature,slowly the ship began to explode,and everyone was trying to make it to a escape pod,ashley looked at her friends and family and finaly decided to speak.\"i-i sorry,i h-had n-no c-ch-choice.\"she began.\"stop,save your energy.\"lucarrio said.\"but-\"was all ashley could say before jacobs stepped in.\"STAND DOWN  SOLDIER!YOU ARE TO SAVE YOUR STRENGTH,ESCAPE WITH US TO THE SURFACE AND GET YOUR SELF CURED,THATS AN ORDER.DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?\"he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sir y-y-yes s-s-sir.\"ashley managed to reply.they began to run down corridors and occassionaly stopped to give ashley a breather but then just as quickly got back on the move,eventually they made it to a escape pod and were in the process of getting it open when ashley charged them.(i,i infected myself with some kind of virus,i know im not getting off this boat alive,but still they wont leave without me,but i can make them leave!)ashley thought to herself.and wih that she smacked them all into the pod,and just as quickly sealed it.\"ASHLEY!NO,DONT DO THIS!ASHLEY IT'S GOING TO BE ALRIGHT,WE CAN CURE YOU!\" kurt <br>\r\n<br>\r\nscreamed.the others shouted at ashley to open the pod and let them help her,but ashley simply walked in pain to the manual ejection button and with her mutated arm broke the console and sent the pod hurling towards the surface,kurt saw ashley punch the console and felt the pod accelerate towards the surface,but he saw ashley smile right before she was replaced by the sight of tubing as the pod sped towards the surface.it wasent for another hour until the final pod hit the surface than kurt had for the one hunderedth time tried to swim down towards the wreck to save ashley,he gave up soon after three more attempts,he did find ashleys luggage,one of which had the pink dress and all the accessories that went with it,he then took them to ash,jacobs,and the others who the had a moment of silecnce for the ones who didnt make it.after they paid thier repects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey put ashleys dress and accessories in ahes backpack and continued on thier journey,unaware of the fact that on a nearby beach a anthro eevee girl with a mutated arm surfaced alive but in extreme pain.kurt then began to think of what would have become of him and ashley,could they have dated?could they have been girlfriend and boyfriend?could they have gotten married?he would never get the awnsers because ashley was dead.ashley awoke in a half stange world,due to some fluke,some random toss of the galactic dice,she had mutated to the point where she was in so much pain that she could ignore it.ashley suddenly heard footsteps and knew that it wasent her friends or family.she then realized that it was team tyrant,she felt rage building up inside her and she decided to attack them.and that is what she did ,ashley rushed them and smashed one mans skull in an used her mutated arm to blow the other one into blood soaked peices when suddenly one of them got lucky and fired a tranqu-dart.</span></div></div>",

Ashley then got up and began to walk to the next town.\"AAGGGHHHHH!!!!!!\" she screamed.as she began to mutate. She looked to her left and saw she had a dart in her arm and it caused her to mutate into some new form of Pok\u00e9mon. Ashley\u2019s left arm grew spikes out of every physically possible spot and her fingers became sharp and slender. Next her already mutated right arm finished its mutation and resembled the thorax of an insect; her legs began to grow spikes on the sides only.\u201dw-w-what\u2019s happening to me...ee...e. Ashley said in fear and in her new voice. Her mutation finished when insect-like wings grew from her back and mandibles grew on her cheeks. Agghhh! What have I become, ugh why c-cant I t-the-think straight? \u201cshe asked herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her diamond body began to rearrange itself into a beetle like form(resembles insecticon sharpshot).\"I-I turns into bug...gg...that mean I be a new evolution...nn...n. \"she said.

I promised violet, my wife that I would save our daughter from death, so when I put Ashley tremors brain cells into my daughter; she developed amnesia and blamed me for holding her prisoner. Then Trent, my top lieutenant used copied voice clip of my conversations with him to gain access to Ashley, lying saying that I ordered him to weaponries my daughter. He sought to use her as a weapon, so I ordered him to bring me dawn and Pikachu knowing ash and his lucario would free my daughter from Trent grasp. I didn\u2019t care if my own daughter hated me, I only wanted her to be safe and now she has once again become a weapon. Please bring Ashley to me, I wish to see my daughter with my own eyes before I draw my last breath.\" Jackson said. \"Oh my god.\" lily said. \u201cWe are so sorry we blamed you, don\u2019t worry we'll get Ashley to come to you, I promise. \u201cLily said.</span></div></div>",

She looked around and gasped in surprise. She was in the Mountains! \"This-This can\u2019t be!\" She said out loud. She then runs around freaking out until she bumps into something. No wait her wing bumped into something. \"I have wings\", Alexis said screaming. She then feels around her whole body in awe. \"I'm a Latias\" she said confused, \"with breasts?\" She looked at her breast before squeezing them a bit. As she squeezes them she moans. She then starts to rub her more Female parts and moans even more. After a good amount of time playing with herself she finally climaxes. She pauses for a moment to decide to do it again or not she decides not to. She gets up knowing she was in heat, and the only way out of heat was to find a mate. With this body she could get any Pok\u00e9mon, but why should any Pok\u00e9mon get her body? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets up and starts to walk down the mountain. Towards the forest. Alexis felt like a queen the way all the Pok\u00e9mon stared at her. Males in lust and females in jealousy. Though none of the Pok\u00e9mon looked like they were worth mating with. They all looked to wimpy or too ugly.  After a good few minutes Alexis sighed \"this is taking too long I need a faster way to travel.\" She then looks at her wings cursing herself for her lack of intelligence before flying into the air and heading towards the forest. She flew faster than she ever could have imagined possible she reached the forest in less than two minutes. When she reached the forest she landed on the ground with grace. She looked around and listens to the wind for a bit. After a while her instincts told her to head north. She obeyed them and flew for a couple more minutes until she reached an opened cave filled with males of all kinds. It had Eevee's to Turtwig's \"and they're all male\", she thought excitedly. The instant she landed in the clearing all they guys , with the exception of a Flareon, looked at her . She smiled with eyes full of lust and said, \u201cwho wants to be my mate?\" All the guys , still with the Flareon's exception, roared with joy and ran at her. She knocked them all back with ease and giggled, \" oh no only I get to choose who my mate is and half of you are already no worthy to even look at me.\" She shooed away the ones she didn't like and then looked at the Flareon who still wasn't basking in her beauty and smiled \"would you like to compete for me as well?\" He only looks at her and sighs, \"I guess I need a mate this year\" he said getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis seemed a little confused as to why this flareon wasn't falling for her. It confused her and only made him that much more interesting. All that was left were six Pok\u00e9mon left. \"Ok you are going to fight over me, whoever is left standing gets me. Anyone wants to back down\" she said smiling. Three of them backed down leaving the flareon, an empoleon, and an electabuzz left. As Alexis shouted \"go\" a flamethrower flew out of the flareon's mouth searing the other two Pok\u00e9mon.The other two not expecting such a blast from a small body fled in terror leaving Alexis with her jaw open. The Flareon looked at her and said , \"You're mine now.\" Alexis nodded she was little disappointed that the implant lost he was cute, but also highly turned on by the Flareon\u2019s strength. She nodded flying over to him and picking him up. \"That\u2019s right you get all of this\", she said giving him a clear look at her vagina. He only blinked and turned around \"alright then let\u2019s go home\" he said as he started walking. Alexis followed little upset about not making him fall over her, but she kept to her choice. After a while of him not talking to her she said, \"how come you\u2019re not like those other guys and fawn over me?\" The Flareon laughed and said, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve had so many mates it doesn't even matter anymore\". Latias stared at him, \"then why be my mate\" she asked. Flareon stopped and looked at her, \"three reasons, I\u2019ve never done it with a legend, I think the girls would like more company, and because you are beautiful. he then turns around and says, \"The Name\u2019s John.\" Alexis nods before saying \u201cmy name is Alexis.\" After that Flareon was happy that he thought she was pretty too, but not so happy that he could control himself around her. \u201cThis is going to be a boring life\u201d, she thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When they finally reached a cave John said,\" This is my den.\" Alexis nodded and said,\" This is a lot of room for one guy\" she said. John looked at Alexis and laughed,\" Who said anything about me being alone?\" as they walked inside Alexis could start to hear giggling. As they reached the inside part Alexis saw five Pok\u00e9mon all giggling and rubbing their breast together, but when John walked in they all stopped and ran over to him. They all liked him excitedly and it took forever for John to calm them down. Though once he did he introduced them to Alexis \u201cgirls this is Alexis. Alexis this is Jade (Glaceon), Sarah (Leafeon), Jessie (Umbreon), Sam (Jolteon), and topaz (espion).\" They all greeted her with Warm smiles and amused faces. \"Good catch Johnny I always knew you catch one eventually\" said Jade. Topaz nodded \u201cI wonder what she feels like.\"Then all the girls jumped on Alexis before she could react and started feeling around her entire body. As one of them felt her breast Alexis moaned. Sam smiled and said \u201clooks like she\u2019s a little horny lets help her with that.\" then all the girls started rubbing against Alexis breast causing her to moan harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls only laughed as she climaxed under the feeling. After she finished the girls got off her still giggling to each other. Alex out of fear and confusion said \"who are you-you guys.\" Jessie looked at her as if nothing happened and said, \"oh we're also John\u2019s mates. He may not look like fun but that's because he's not in the mood.\" Alexis looks at her annoyed, \"I\u2019m not just worried about if he is going to do it with me or not I want to know why all of you did that to me!\" Jessie giggles again, \"we can't help ourselves we need something to do while we wait\" she said before positioning herself to show Alexis that she was Pregnant. Alexis gasped in surprise as she saw they all were. \" You mean he did all of you\" she said surprised. Sarah nodded and blushed,\" all in the same day too\" She said in a quiet voice. Alexis just shook her head, \"Does he not respect you at all. You girls should just leave.\" The girls look at each other confused before topaz says, \"What do you mean?\" \"Doing it with all of you is ridiculous\" she says anger. Topaz only giggles, \"you legends must do it differently because lots of Pok\u00e9mon do this.\" Alexis looks a little taken back from what she said before looking at the girls. They weren\u2019t normal Pok\u00e9mon either because they were also anthros, and John was too. Alexis looks around again at her new life and sighs it was going to be an interesting one. \" So what now?\" Alexis asked. Jessie smiled \"well the food is over there\" she said pointing to a pile of berries before smiling, \"and if you wait till John falls asleep you'll see why we are always wanting to have kids.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen John decided to go to bed the other girls started giggling with glee. Alexis tried to join him but the girls stopped her and told her to wait. After about 30 minutes the girls silently went over to the bed (which was a large pile of leaves) pushing Alexis over to it. When she reached the bed she gasped as quietly as she could when she realized what the \"big surprise was\" laying there was johns\u2019 dick but it seemed way too long for someone not turned on. Jade giggled silently before bending down and licking it as slowly as she could. When she was done Johns dick was actually reaching the bottom of his chest. This made Alexis drool little. Sarah looked at Alexis and in a hushed voice said, \"Be gentle if you wake him up he's going to be cranky tomorrow like he was when he met you. You get to be one of the girls to sleep next to him today and also won't have to share him tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen next morning Alexis was woken up to a laugh. \u201cI didn't think she'd be this eager\" said a voice. <br>\r\nAlexis still woke up tried to turn to see who the voice but was stopped by something in her mouth. She looked down to see she had the jeans thing in her mouth. She blushed as she spat it out and looked up at John\u2019s face. She was little surprised to see that normally blank face was filled with amusement. She looked up and saw all the girls were out of bed leaving her and John in the bed. She looks back at John, who says \"why did you stop I was liking it.\" Alexis blushes before saying \u201cI was asleep!\" John smiles \"and so was I until I woke up this morning almost already coming.\" he said to her. John smiled before saying \u201cnow I\u2019m really horny so you might as well finish.\" Alexis blushes before bending back down to finish the job. Alexis wasn't surprised when she saw how much was left when she started to lick him. It was a bit too big for her mouth, which didn't surprise her, when she looked at it and she wasn't ready for a mouth full so she wasn't surprised when John wasn't saying anything. Though after a while she heard him howl which made Alexis realize she was doing it right so she went faster, and faster until John  as all of his cum rushed into Alexis' mouth. Alexis wasn't expecting all that sperm in her mouth. At first she was grossed out at what he John had done to her, when she tasted it. She said, \"Mmmmm\u201d This summoned the girls who licked all the extra cum off her face. After all that was over John smiled and Said \"it's time to...</span></div></div>",

I know that no normal trainer would use the such delicate words to describe such hardy Pok\u00e9mon, especially one that easily weight 156 lbs., but she fit my description perfectly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile as my Nina run towards me with her chubby looking body, she always give me a good hug and sound very excited every time she see me in the morning. I don't know if her morning happiness is due to the specialized food i gave her, but if it is so, i want a bowl of the thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Nina reach me, she tightly hug my right leg , not enough to injure me of course, but still more than enough to let her point across: You are my trainer, love me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr something like that. I really, really wanted to grab my small Pok\u00e9mon in my arms and hug her properly, but every time i feel the need to express my approval to her happiness, i remind myself that she weight 156 lbs., and her rocky and rough exterior won't exactly make her prime material for an huggable plushie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut i love her all the same, and the little minx knew it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kneel down and pet her as best i could without scratching my skin, i know she wanted more than such light sign of affection, but i am not a fan of seeing my blood so early in the morning. Nor in the afternoon, or during evening or...ever actually. My blood is more than fine and dandy in my veins thank you very much<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up and Nina release my leg, she look at me with affection, something a common trainer has difficulty to imagine from this kind of poke, then she simply return to eat her breakfast, a chow i prepare for her and all my Pok\u00e9mon every night just before going to bed. I uselessly try to locate any sign of my evasive Mienfoo with little success<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana walk yawning in the kitchen, she is the most relaxed of my Pok\u00e9mon and often ask for affection when she is awake, and generally keeping herself busy trying to achieve the very respectable title of 'Queen of the slackers' when she has nothing better to do, which is most of the day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh as i prepare my breakfast; i have little hope that Katy will make an appearance anytime soon after her what she did a few minutes ago. I only hope that what she did was nothing more than a joke; i really, really don't need that right now. As let the milk fill my bowl, my memory remind me of Lana very explicit request when i captured her an year ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a well-known fact that Grass type Pok\u00e9mon are in tune with nature and it's cycles, as a result they see mating as a perfectly natural thing even with different species. Usually Grass type behavior can be summarized in two main groups<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst group are the loner, they journey the land and sometimes even human villages in search of something to do, like becoming stronger or more commonly to replenish nature strength where necessary, they can feel that somehow. Sometimes they sort of bond with a human during their travels and 'ask' it to prove their strength against it. If the human win they usually accept it as their trainer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond and less desirable group i my eyes, but one of the most requested from certain type of characters, are the herd type. Where the individuals prove to the group their skill in something, like battling, and take that role for the whole community. They usually have one alpha male or female that may not even be a Grass type, he/she take all the major decision including what mate(s) have for him/herself. The leader remain in charge until another member of the pack defeat it or he/she is unable to continue its duty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne may think, what's the problem? Simple, all the female, or if the alpha is a female, the male of the pack, want to be the leader bitch. They see the possibility to reproduce with superior individual, be it so physically or mentally, a golden opportunity for themselves and the species as a whole. It's not difficult to understand why individual with this mentality are in higher demand, for grass type anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of my legs being caressed forcefully return me to the present, as most morning in the last few months Lana is exposing to me her, probably i never tasted it, sweet pussy in all her glory. As always she used one of her small tentacle like appendages to caress my leg or arm while using the other to stimulate her reddening lips. As soon as she have my attention she usually do something different every time in her attempt to seduce me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday she remove the second grass tentacle from my leg, and use it to spread her lips apart, giving me and fully and unadulterated view of her pink tunnel clenching the empty air as a small dribble of her arousal slowly slip on her leg to the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to force myself to look away, to calm my nerves by thinking to anything but this. That\u2019s the reason why many so called trainers prefer a Pok\u00e9mon with a herd mentality. That\u2019s why Grass type are one of the most requested Pok\u00e9mon among single human men and woman. They see their trainer as their alpha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana squeal happily as she begin to slowly masturbate with her tentacle, all happening barely a meter from me. I muster my will and say \"Enough Lana, return\u2026slaking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bayyyyyy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whine softly and continue unperturbed, i know what she want, and know that even in victory i still must suffer a small defeat. I use my hand to grab Lana thrusting tentacle and pull it out her, as always she lower her posture and rise her back towards me, inviting me in. I slap her flank<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana, no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look dejected for a moment but quickly recover her happy demeanor, she has always another day, or night or...that. She will try again of course, and both of us know that i can't resist her forever, sooner or later i will end up pressing the little bitch down and fuck her senseless<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need a more permanent solution, but after all she has been trough i don't want to abandon her in the wild or give her to another. I don't feel like thinking about the events that brought her in my care, so i quickly finish my bowl of cereal and mentally prepare myself for work<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As my 'glamorous' work place become finally visible behind the pokecenter, my walking peace slow down and my reminiscence about my past conclude itself. Lana relatively recent behavior made me question my reason for being a trainer, or a i-am-not-yet-ready-but-i-will-be-soon of sort, and force me to answer the same question every trainer at the beginning of his/her career ask themselves:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre jeans fashionable in purple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am serious, they are the more resilient and at the same time, cheaper trainer outfit available on the market. I do not wonder why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second question is of course, am i ready for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost trainer always think themselves ready, but frankly i question certain parents so called sense of responsibility, i mean, i am seventeen and thanks to my charm (someone owed me a favor, a big one), and skill (i literally opened a door that should have been locked by slipping on the wet floor and ended up seeing the only daughter of Trevor being speared by a quite big pokemon in an exit only unmentionable place, from behind by the way), i obtained a very respectable and more importantly, well payed line of work at the Trevor Labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the day i changed my mind on guided tours and understood their significant importance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i was saying..oh yeah, parents. They let their children at the age of 10 travel the land in company of the most powerful, sometimes dangerous, and most of the time horny creature of the whole planet. Alone beside his fluffy Vulpix. Without any (sexual) education at all, beside normal (basic) survival skills and education. What the actual fuck?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd some of them are genuinely surprised when the son finally return home after Years of traveling and they caught him ruthlessly fuck his Ninetales so hard that would make a Kangaskhan jealous, of the vixen of course. My neighbor real story, serious, i still remember the mother screaming something about wee-wee and vagoo i rather forget that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the present i remind myself to ask Amanda (i can now call the above mentioned daughter by first name, and she don't mind, really) why we still use a revolving door, double one are far more stylish, my personal secretary greet me in the lobby and immediately begin to list all my duty for the day. Despite what one may think, justify my position to Amanda's father became a lot easier then she expected once i proven myself quite capable despite my age and inexperience. In fact Trevor was so impressed by my suggestions that he not only confirmed my position, he gave me even more responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was the first one to remain surprised really, i would have never thought, not in a million years that scientist so smart, enough to mention most if not all the genetic code of certain pokemons by memory with all their significance and how it's possible to modify them (I will NEVER ask again to explain me or suggest how to improve by recombine the peptide..something nucle...ahhhhh forget it, given that their answer was, most of the time, \"The subject would have died a painful, atrocious death\". That's a big no-no in my book), are unable to think to use coffee pods instead of making it themselves with that Ancient machinery, is a mystery to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that was probably the lowest but still one of the most practical, ideas i gave to this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my secretary, who's name i don't bother to remember as small revenge for nagging me so much (despite that it's her work), finish her list we have finally reached the door of my morning salvation, my office door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs most morning i thank her and commend her efficiency, she is efficient after all despite my small resent toward her, and ask her to send me a note with all my appointments and duty of the day, as a reminder of course. She happily nod and finally scram from my small hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh in relief and open the door....only to find the very same person i wanted to talk with, Amanda, seated on my chair with a smile so big it's scary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe speak with a sweet, slightly alluring voice \"How is my preferred employee feeling today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again it's not what it may seems to be, we are not together or something and she is mostly sincere with me, mostly because since that day....\"I have a gift for youuuuu\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't like her tone, not a tiny little bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knell under my desk and retrieve a pokeball, then she open it and a Flareon appear near a small pile of stacked documents, today work i presume. The Flareon pant as if tired, her eyes are downcast but not with pain or tiredness, it's...stressed i think<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe get up from my chair and invite me to come closer \"This\" she indicate the Flareon \"Is XR37D2, or as i prefer it, Shany. She just completed a series of test in the labs and after the all clear i personally discharged her, for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first i didn't like her tone, now i am scared shitless of it. That's because i already know what she is planning, in fact since that day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, look. I appreciate your attempt to make me pokephiliac but seriously, try to spend your time a little more constructively. Please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the day i caught her taking it up the ass by her pet, and subsequently become a trusted employee, she tried relentlessly to make me fuck a pokemon. Any pokemon, doesn't matter type or size. Well, at least they was all female, she got that right at least after the first and last time she attempted pairing me with a male one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continue to smile and completely ignore my rebuttal \"Shany here is, yes you guessed it right, in heat, a status greatly amplified by our newest serum XRT554, alias Neural Enhancer Serum\" then she look at me as if i was a pimp \"You dirty minded trainer, oh, and this is her first heat soooo, she is a virgin too\" she end her phrase with even a bigger smile then before. Why? Why can't i find a decent person once, WHY?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head and facepalm for great justice \"Amanda...\" i gesticulate as telling her, 'you are doing it wrong' \"I suggested that serum after our scientists discovery of the side effects certain common used trainer potion have on pokemon, it is a Serious problem, i did not....\" I indicate the Flareon \"That, i solve problem Amanda, it's my work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me with nonchalance, a look that say 'Yeah right' \"But of course, it's all work work work with you uh? So, did you finally screw that sweet, tight, green pussy i sent you yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI calmly reply \"No, i haven't fucked Lana-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupt me \"Yet, i bet she is making it difficult for you uh? Presenting every morning, giving you a good, passionate view of her undertail..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I won't send her back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The you'll end up fucking her silly, making both me and her very happy. Me, because finally you'll admit the truth and join our 'small' club, her because..oh i believe you can guess it yourself, hahaha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\ni hastily try to end our conversation \"Amanda please leave my office, i have work to do, the Trans-dimensional experiment is fluctuating again and our engineers can't still make head or tail of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile disappear \"Again? Oh damn them all to Darkrai pit. I'll go check it out, in the meantime\" her smile return \"Enjoy your bonus Mr i am not a pokephiliac Yet, later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sign at her to stop \"Hey hey hey wait, return her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do, she is cleared and i have already registered her to you. And of course, as the contract dictate, 'You cannot reveal company assets to the public without our explicit consent', so or with you, or the lab where she will be bred mercilessly by our very best studs, for science of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Right<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe open the door, but just before exiting she seductively conclude \"Oh, she should go in heat very second week of the month, have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen \"Wait!-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slam closed, leaving me alone with a Very horny pokemon, and my arousal still not fully passed after Lana show this morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flareon look sniff at me interestingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare..flaaaare\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........Ffffffuck\"</span></div></div>",

Why are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her reaction she doesn't seems to be involved, but i still don't trust the appearances \"I decided to check the progress on our new line of behavior suppressant, the information given to my office are sketchy as best, absolutely unacceptable\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face show surprise for a moment before returning perfectly professional \"But sir, i personally verified-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tone of finality \"I want to see it for myself miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katia, but the labs-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Katia\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calm herself down \"Very well sir, this way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealistically my aggressiveness wasn't necessary, and i have security clearance to the labs and most other facility but, i needed something to vent upon, i know i am an asshole sometimes, i will find something to make it up for her, like a week refresher course in some tropical island maybe, with all the work and the stress i sometimes i am forced to put her through she earn it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso i haven't even have the time to check the reports anyway, wanted to but Amanda Flareon, damn her and her weirds ideas, if she wasn't the daughter of the president of this company...bah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur walk to the chemical labs is short and uneventful, dreadfully silent too, but i certainly don't blame her, she probably spent a few hours giving me a full report of the labs and then i simply tell her that the information are sketchy, she must hate me or worse feel inadequate. Maybe the course can happen in a resort close to the beach or something, to show her my appreciation of her abilities without things getting awkward between us<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't want a relationship with her, only make her feel appreciated for all her hard work, even if i detest her for all the work she daily put in my plate, irrational i know, but since when emotions act rationally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI return to pay attention to my surroundings when the sealed double door of the labs finally open, the guards politely nodding as they let me and my secretary inside one of the biggest research facility on this continent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously the head of this division come and greet us warmly \"Welcome to the chemical division Head Executor, how can i be of help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan how much i hate that title, seriously what kind of name is that? Well at least my authority allow me to meddle in nearly everything this company is doing, and it show the president confidence in my skills, hopefully he is not thinking his daughter and i....by the way sometimes i have been called vice-president-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head scientist wake me up from my reverie \"Sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it focus! \"I would like to examine the progress of the new experimental inhibitors, along with the live test of possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile return \"But of course sir, this way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy secretary follow in silence while the head scientist explain to me the results of their research, obviously he is trying to impress me, but right now i don't care, i only want to know if the inhibitor work<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we approach a corridor with various viewing windows to some live test subjects he explain \"Our preliminary result are encouraging, but unfortunately we haven't yet found the correct mix to affect all kind of pokemon without causing side effects, the subjects here are a good example of this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reach the first window \"In this room we have put three Male Umbreon injected with the experimental inhibitor, we will now introduce a Female Ninetails in heat to verify if this mix affect Dark Type pokemon effectively\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room with the test subject is very simple, a 10x10 room with grass as floor and a few trees here and there, a realistic artificial light that emulate the sun and a ventilation system to keep the ambient clean and fresh, a few vieving screens just under the window connected to various cameras in the room are also present<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hidden door open as a Ninetails with the tails down to cover her genitals is pushed in, the door seal behind her and of course the until now perfectly calm Umbreons immediately go to check out the new arrival<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take more then a few moments for the males to smell the Ninetails heat and approach her more decisively. Differently from how normally it would happen they do not fight among themselves for mating rights, instead all three approach the female and try to coax her to lay down with small pushes and a few licks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe refuses any kind of sexual approach however and the three males calmly charge their attacks with unnatural calm and precision, rapidly and efficiently defeating the Ninetails and force her to lay on her belly. Despite her reluctance one of the Umbreon easily shift her tails aside and mount her as the other two keep the female from retaliating with Psychic, holding her down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the camera clearly show the Umbreon cock sliding inside the Ninetails dripping pussy, as the female try uselessly to free herself from the males grip. The one breeding her evidently enjoy her willing body but still keep an unnatural slow peace for the species instead of mating her roughly like Dark Type usually do, is this the promising result? I expected better<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male eventually knot the Ninetails and release inside her, only now she stop struggling. Curiously the Male behind her remove his knot from her and allow another male to have his way with a now willing Ninetails, i suppose she know it's too late to avoid pregnancy and just decide to let her instinct go, enjoying her time as best she can<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have always found this part of pokemon rationality more then a little disturbing to say the least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head scientist explain \"As you may see, the inhibitor fail to prevent the Umbreon breeding the subject but, it calmed them down and avoided uselessly infighting between them, so far this is the best result we obtained with most types\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, regretting to have come here \"On what type of pokemon the inhibitor as proved to be most effective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lead us to more viewing screens \"So far only Steel, Fighting and Normal type effectiveness prevented the breeding altogether, significant aggressiveness reduction on all others, included dual types\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy secretary ask the next question \"And the enhancer? The National Breeding Association is getting impatient about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly reply \"We fixed the so called <u>problem</u> i assure you, if you want to follow I'll demonstrate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the Behavior Inhibitor meant for civilian application is still ineffective, while and amplifier for the pokemon already more then enough developed instinct to breed is ready? How ironic given my situation, but the part that bother me more about this is..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a stroke of genius if i may say it sir, your Neural Enhancer Serum is proving to be the base for many other possible applications, including this one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my head i imagine me grabbing this cheap fake adulator with his far too long tongue and bashing his cranium on the first hard spiked surface i found, in reality i can't do that however, a thing i found somewhat sad given the situation i am in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo i decide to do the second best thing that came to mind and ignore his comment completely \"When the Inhibitor will be ready for practical application?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe think on it for a few moments while we walk \"At least another three months for field testing i believe, then another six at least to extensively test it's effectives on all pokemon types and work out the right dosage to be universally compatible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, i need an alternative solution<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i think about other possible options the head scientist show us another viewing window, inside this room practically identical to the other various pair of pokemon are having an orgy of sort<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this room female like a Salamence or a Garchomp are laying on their back and allow pokemon they normally consider little more then food or part of the environment to breed them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's note worthy to notice how the Salamence is getting pounded by an Arbok while the Garchomp let a Treecko fucking her silly, and given the quantity of liquid on the ground id say they are in that position for a while now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn away from the spectacle and ask \"It's ready then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proudly answer \"Yes sir, by the end of the week it's all yours to commercialize\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am so fucking happy with that</span></div></div>",

How strange that two different Pok\u00e9mon that hate each other so much are capable to interbreed so easily, I am sure the Zangoose in heat I saw entering the labs would have agreed with my argument, if she could have talked with every office filled that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever fired someone so quickly before, nor we ever used so many sedative gas at once, worked though. Well mostly, nearly all our Zangoose female are pregnant now, some Seviper too, but at least I get to satisfy my curiosity, always wanted to know what would have come out between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring my not so happy reminiscence Katia once again take the lead and efficiently bring me through twisted corridors and security measure towards the Tech Division, the very beating hearth of the company and source of most our income, our improved poke watch completely replaced the old version manufactured by the Pok\u00e9tch company, forcing them out of market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra security measure where put in place after most higher up of our company, me included, received threatening letters from the old Pok\u00e9tch president, he died of natural cause a few months after, but his daughter never believed the doctors and accused us publicly of being responsible for his demise. She vanished immediately after, cursing our names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her disappearance I personally looked her father medical records, thanks to a favor the clinic owned me, to see if her accusation where at least partially founded, only to find that the man suffered from a rare genetic disease that was ultimately responsible for his premature death. Apparently he had given instruction to not mention his medical problem to his daughter, and to screen his spawn for similar diseases, but her medical records seems to has been stolen from the archives and the doctor didn't knew the test results, leaving me empty handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again is the head Scientist greetings that recall me back to the present, his voice strangely meek for such a big man \"Welcome Head Executor, I trust that no more chemical accidents have worsened your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong grammar, or maybe it's just laziness, no matter what chemical and tech division I never saw eye to eye so to speak, both always compete to be the 1st more productive division, and the chemical even won a few times I has been told, but with the so called 'cage accident' I don't think this year\u2019s chemical has any chance of winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither is getting the extra money given in appreciation for the hard work to the head scientists. I always protested against this methods, at least give a lower sum but to the whole division, why the rest of them should care if their boss get even more money, they are paid more than enough already. Still haven't managed to get my way yet, but I will, oh if I will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing particularly interesting I am afraid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sadistic grim appear on his face \"Not surprising Sir, they barely keep up to our company standards\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to ignore his remark \"Perhaps, but I have heard that the portal device is having similar problems during the last test, and that it nearly blow up along with the whole laboratory\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smirk disappears, replaced by a nervous smile \"N-no Sir! It was merely a small drawback due to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift my hand and sign him to stop \"I don't want to hear excuses, I want results\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is an asshole and deserve this tone and more \"How long for the next experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recomposes himself \"Two days Sir, do you wish to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, depending on schedule the president may also be present, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face pale visibly \"Yes Sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I would like to visit the labs if possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome sense of pride return in his voice, a confidence he lacked a few seconds ago \"Absolutely sir, this way please.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A female robotic  voice confirm our authorization to enter, then the ten seconds procedure necessary to unseal the door begin...at least the idea of forced teleporting  as only way to access the lab was previously discarded, the very idea of being disassembled and then reassembled in billion pieces still give me the chill safe procedure as it may be, no matter what our 'esteemed' head scientist said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door finally unseal, a gentle but constant breeze caress all our form, this is normal, in fact as a precaution the pressure inside the actual lab is higher then the rest of the complex, this will naturally 'push' away the air from inside the lab and prevent possible intrusion of unwanted particles in the construction area, will also make easier to detect possible breaches in the integrity of the internal structure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother small corridor greet us in it's milky white cleanliness, the environment of  this lab it's so excessively controlled that even our shoes leave no mark whatsoever on the floor, no matter what kind of filth may be on them. Not sure how they did it, but it's kinda creepy in my opinion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur guide nervously guide me and my secretary to the upper viewing room, where a small meeting room with holographic projectors and all the portal schematic are kept, i would have preferred see the portal up close, but given the security measures necessary to keep all the inner mechanism perfectly free of any possible contaminant such option is not yet available to me, or at least until the external structure mean to seal the more sensitive part of the portal device are built, this thing is treated as even the smallest speck of dust could spell the doom of the whole project, which for what i was able to gather is definitely not true<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless there are various electronic components that are sensitive to electrostatic charges and whatnot, so i understand the necessary restrictions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small set of stairs that lead us to the upper room are, thankfully, not white, managing to make me feel a little more relaxed. Realistically i don't personally consider steel gray a color that go particularly well with white, but given how sterile and unnaturally clean the room look, even beige would have done the trick<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just thinking how better then usually i felt in company of our guide, probably because he kept his mouth shut instead of constantly itemize all his division success as he usually do in the presence of any of the 'higher up', of course i say was because the first thing i notice in the normally serious looking room, is Amanda seated at the head of the table, once again with the same smile i found her about an hour ago in my office, and for some reason the table is covered with an additional bluish tablecloth that cover even the sides of the table, hiding the legs and feet from view<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, i forgot that she came here to supervise the project after the last stability problems. As a reaction the first thing i do after seeing her in the room, is immediately saying \"Seeing that Amanda is already here, i see no reason to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, Amanda interrupt me \"Do not worry Head Executor, a second competent opinion is always welcome, and beside, you are already here, no reason to not look up the lastest project development\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompetent? I know little about quantum physics or the whadda-jadda most of the scientist are talking about here, but if she is referring to the only person with enough common sense to veto a project meant to distort time and space to a point it tear a breach in our reality, then yes i am without a doubt, the only expert they have in the field<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am more then a little tempted to just turn away and leave, but the next phrase pretty much seal my fate \"Come in, come in Head Executor, have a seat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently sigh, the head of the tech division is already preparing, even if fighting against would be more fitting, the presentation with all the progress on the project, so, steeling myself as best i can, i calmly sit on the opposite side of Amanda as my secretary take a seat next to mine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rapidly scan my memory as i wait for the presentation to start, trying to remember everything about the project that could be considered important from my professional point of view, when Amanda unexpectedly call my secretary by name, curious, never heard her call any but her most close collaborators by name in public, then after a quick confabulation, Katia leave the room without another word<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as my secretary exit the room, the door lock with an electronic bip, it's a standard security measure in this part of the labs, one i regard as excessive, but i can understand given the circumstances, but why Amanda wanted Katia out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head scientist clear his throat, signaling us his readiness for the presentation, it's Amanda that give him the cue \"Proceed professor, we will keep the questions for later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile unnaturally wide, he proceed to begin the presentation that i am sure he stolen from one of his subordinate, pressing the button on the holographic projectors controls as the lights intensity lower automatically from bright white to a soft yellow. As expected he begin by emphasizing his name as main responsible for the project, having placed his name practically under every holo-slide, usually not in small characters either<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the real presentation finally begin nearly two minutes later, my senses begin to pick up some strange sounds, similar to when a pokeball get opened, but much, much quieter, a sound so small i barely heard it at all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even the time to relax and finish thinking how now i am even imagining things, that i feel something suddenly grabbing my pants and tear them open..</span></div></div>",
