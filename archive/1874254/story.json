            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Regular panties....If blue panties emblazoned with her logo on the front could be considered regular. She wasn't really worried about people seeing her underwear though, that was why she wore a pair that she imagined was usually the first pick of her fans to wear. She was high above the city and no one could see her, unless they had a telescope maybe. And even then they would catch the briefest sight of her before she would be gone. Sometimes she felt that the power of flight was also a curse. She could get anywhere within seconds, but it also separated her from the city and its citizens who she wanted to protect. How could she be a part of their world if she lived above them? But she was so different from them. She was one of the last of her kind from a planet destroyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was often asked why she fought for the planet, a planet she could just fly away from at any moment. And she had trouble putting it into words, so she tried to explain it with everything she did. But even if her world was gone, this was a world that was still alive. If she left, its death would be on her. She loved this earth, and  she may not be human, but she was still part of a vast diversity that made up humanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. So many people thought she lived to fight, that this was her purpose and goal. She hated fighting. She didn't know a single superhero who enjoyed fighting. She didn't want to get any fighting done. What she wanted, and what she imagined all superheroes wanted, was a world where they were unnecessary. But for now that was simply a dream, a fantasy of a mind that has known a lifetime of loneliness and violence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEEEEEP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer super-hearing picked up the blat of a car-alarm from a few streets over, it would have been something easily ignored, even though she had honed her hearing so that she could push out all ambient noise except for sounds like that, but then she heard another alarm join it, and then another. And this continued it sounded like there was a symphony of cars all playing one note together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew down toward the ground. it might just be nothing, but it might also be a problem. She wouldn't mind if it was a waste of her time. People would still see her, and they would see that she cared, which she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on the sidewalk near a few cars that had alarms going off. A few pedestrians were gawking at her and speaking among themselves. Some took out their phones and started taking pictures and videos of her. She wanted to wave and smile, maybe even take a second to speak, but she was a powered person, not a politician, and her first responsibility was to help and protect people, not talk to them when there was something going on. She looked around. Something had set off the car alarms, but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supergirl!\" A woman yelled, and Cara looked around trying to see who called to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too slow Supergirl,\" the voice taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned as fast as she could but she couldn't be sure who had said that. The car alarms were a persistent sound that blocked out  basically everything else, like a thick blanket covering her head, she found it harder to concentrate with that noise assaulting her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here Supergirl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun around with all of her speed and saw a blur to her side...What was that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not fast enough. And once you're gone, this world will be mine to rule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's twice that the voice has mentioned speed. And then it clicked. She was dealing with a  speedster, and a female one at that, based on the voice. She kept her eyes open and tried to focus her super-hearing. She had heard that if you tried hard enough you could focus on exactly what you wanted to hear. She couldn't see this speedster, but maybe she could manage to hear her coming. Cara closed her eyes for a moment, realizing how useless they were against someone who could run at what she assumed were super-sonic speeds. And she listened for a heartbeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief second she heard everything as if her mind had been the gate holding back an army of sound, and by opening herself up, she made it possible for the legion of troops to overrun her. She covered her ears with both hands but that did nothing but muffle the sound around her in a way that was so slight she did not notice a difference. She took a deep breath, and then another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Focus</i>, she told herself, <i>if you don't focus the sound will overwhelm you</i>. And she could almost feel herself being driven mad, not just by the impossibly massive behemoth which was the sound that came from everywhere and everything, but by what that sound represented. She had no idea that the world was so loud. Almost everything made some sort of noise and that noise told a story of life. She could spend an eternity hearing the sounds of this world and still be surprised by the plethora of experiences this earth offered. The clicking sound of something small scurrying around in a nearby alley. The sound of crying, and she was fascinated to realize that with her eyes closed, she couldn't tell if the person crying was a child or an adult. The wind. The sound of feet. Of breathing. All around her the sound was a giant mob that was venting its rage by attacking her without pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Deep breaths, Cara. I must calm down and focus.</i> She shut it all out, she imagined that she was closing doors in her mind on everything that wasn't heartbeats, she focused on the sounds of beating hearts that were around her. And slowly, all the rest of the sound faded away until all she heard as a rhythm of pulses and beats. She opened her eyes and looked around. She had hoped that by focusing on heartbeats she would know where the speedster was, but all she had now was a dozen heartbeats and no clue where the speedster was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe expanded her reach a bit, and almost squealed when she heard the fast patter of a heart that was beating its own rapid time like a bass drum that had come alive, with a foot pedal that wouldn't stop. She quickly shut out all the other heart beats, and within seconds all she heard was the beating of the speedsters heart. There hearts had to beat faster because everything their body did, it did faster than the average humans. She was proud of herself for figuring that out, and pushing herself, but she had no time for self-congratulation. She had spent close to a minute isolating the speedsters heartbeat, and to speedsters, a minute could be a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCara's only warning was the almost unnoticed fact that the heartbeat suddenly grew louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could react she felt something collide with her face, and she was forced onto her back as her whole body fell backwards. When she hit the ground she realized that the speedster had punched her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl flew a few feet into the air, shaking her head as she tried to clear it after getting hit by what she imagined would be the equivalent of a sniper's bullet smashing into her face at close range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough play!\" Supergirl yelled. \"Come and fight me if you want to fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blur appeared in front of her on the street, and before she could blink it was a person. A young woman with dark hair and a red uniform like the one The Flash had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supergirl,\" the woman said, \"your time as a god among these is over. I will free them from your tyranny. I am Trajectory. A hero. And I will defeat you. But first...catch me if you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she ran away. Not as fast as so she was a blur, but fast enough that Cara could waste no time pursuing her. She flew after her, keeping close to the ground, and travelling through the streets as she pursued this mysterious foe. Supergirl got closer and closer to the woman as they raced through the city, the streets around them, the buildings, and all the people were nothing but blurred shapes of shifting colours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl got beside the speedster, and tried to reach out to grab her. Before she could stop the speedster, she felt a hand on her lower back. Cara looked back to see the speedsters' hand sliding down her skirt and she felt it clamp onto her underwear. She looked back towards the speedster, who smiled at her before speeding up. Cara wasn't prepared for the change of pace so her underwear was lurched up her butt, the fabric shot forward and Cara's entire body struggled to keep up. She tried to speed up her flight for the simple reason that it would make the wedgie hurt less, but the speedster moved even faster. And the underwear dove into her butt. The blue panties moved out of her skirt and covered more and more of her back as it stretched toward the speedster and stung at Cara like a whip being thrust at her. Her face contorted in pain and she tried to stop moving, but the speedster was moving too fast and the underwear responded by rising up her back even more. The thick panties curled into a rope that stuck between the cheeks of Cara's butt, and dragged her faster and faster forward. She was glad no one could see her getting her underwear pulled up, but that didn't mean much since the pain of the wedgie was so severe. The panties creaked, their durability being tested by the competing forces of the speedster moving forward, and my body drifting back. The underwear was caught in between, growing larger, the leg-holes growing more visible and Cara shut her eyes again. She squirmed and on instinct she moved her hands toward her butt to fix the wedgie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrajectory increased her speed and Cara squealed, the underwear had become like a thong, condensing itself into her butt as it was pulled forwards. Cara was looking over her shoulder so she didn't see the portal that was opening up ahead of them. If she had noticed she would have known that they were now moving fast enough for the speedster to access other dimensions and times because they were breaking the space-time continuum. It was genius really. Cara had no option but to fly as fast as she could to lessen the pain of the wedgie, but by doing so, she added her speed to Trajectory's.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kara groaned, her butt feeling like a thick piece of string was slowly being driven deeper into it. And unfortunately, that was exactly what was happening. All the while the portal Trajectory was creating by traveling so fast grew closer. But Kara could only think about the wedgie, and how, despite her Kryptonian strength and resistance, there was nothing she could do to convince herself this pain wasn't that bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sometimes being a super-hero was more trouble than it was worth, </i> she thought. She didn't want to just punch this woman, if she did she might break her in half, or end of throwing her through a building. There has been far too much damage of property because of super-heroes in the past. She didn't want to be responsible for anymore of it. She had to get Trajectory to let go of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Kara's eyes slipped down to the top of Trajectory's ochre spandex pants. Without thinking Kara took her hands away from her own aching butt and reached toward Trajectory. Even though they were moving at super-speed it was like everything was happening in slow motion. She could feel the pain of her wedgie building as she was carried at super speed across the city, and her underwear kept rising further up her back. Her fingers moved toward Trajectory's pants, desperate for some sort of release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her hands slipped down the back of Trajectory's pants, there was the slightest moment of hesitation to her running, as if she had almost been tripped, but she recovered before she lost any speed and ran forward with added vigour, moving ever closer to the portal that Kara still didn't realize was approaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you like it,\" Kara whispered. She felt the soft material of some sort of underwear under the pants, and with her left hand she grabbed hold of the material from the waistband, and without any hesitation, she began to pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold pangs of a sudden and sharp pain spiked Trajectory's posterior. A feeling as if she was being lashed by a whipped made out of her own underwear. Ramming into her, the panties made her grunt, but her absolute monomaniacal focus on getting to the portal, shielded her from the worst of the pain. And the underwear, which Kara realized was a pair of black boy shorts, quickly rose up her back. Growing up on earth, she had to learn how to control her strength and never use too much of at one time, it would be too easy for her to easily break everything around her, so she always had to be as gentle as she could. But now she didn't hold back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still being carried along, having to fly beside Trajectory so she wasn't able to reach both  of her hands to her underwear. But when you had super strength, you often only needed one hand. And she made that one hand count. She forced the panties, and Trajectory groaned in discomfort as the pressure of her underwear being shoved against her was truly felt for the first time. Trajectory's mind was telling her she shouldn't keep running, it would only make the wedgie worse. But the portal was so close. She just had to get Supergirl through the portal and everything would be better. The world wouldn't have any aliens flying around overhead, imposing their will on people and making people dependant on them. A part of knew Supergirl hadn't done anything terrible yet, but after taking the serum that gave her her speed, she had suddenly been struck with the realization that just because Supergirl hadn't done anything bad, didn't mean she never would. What if she turned evil? What if she decided she wanted to be in charge? Who would be able to stop her? The last thing this earth needed was people with superpowers like Supergirl becoming lords of this world.  And Trajectory knew she couldn't kill Supergirl. But she didn't have to. She just had to get her off this earth so she would never have to worry about her becoming evil. So she came up with this plan to send her through the speed-force. Trajectory wasn't sure what would happen to her Supergirl once she was in the portal. Maybe she would be stuck in a sort of limbo between and beyond time. Whatever happened though she wouldn't have to wrorry about her anymore , and that was why she had to endure this wedgie, and had to keep going. Because she didn't matter, but getting Supergirl out of this world did matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara wrenched her arm up and the boy shorts let out sounds of tearing as threads popped. The portal was just ahead now. It was a large circle of blue that swirled and in it Trajectory thought she could see a million other worlds. She was too scared to explore the portal. And had no idea what it might lead to.But she joped wherever it took Supergirl, it was somewhere where she would end up paying for this painful wedgie. Trajectory grit her teeth, and kept running, and then, she gripped tighter on Kara's underwear, stretching them up her back, and toward the portal. Kara squirmed and returned a harder pull back, Trajectory felt as if her butt were being trampled by the leg of a rocking chair that kept going back and forth, rubbing against her and pushing against her, the underwear going to all the places it shouldn't. This sort of pain is why Supergirl had to be exiled from this world. If she could do this to me, Trajectory thought, what's to stop her from doing it to anyone else? Within steps of the portal Trajectory took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She let go of Supergirl's underwear as she launched her forward and stopped running, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a single moment while Kara felt herself flying forward before she was hit by the air around her as if she were a train travelling at high speeds that just wasn't moving anymore. She hung in the air and as she saw that Trajectory was now standing a few feet behind her, smiling at her. Kara went to fly back at her, when she suddenly felt herself being pulled the other way, as if a the strongest gales imaginable were pushing her away. She turned around and saw a giant blue circle that spun like a infinite whirlpool. Kara was suddenly aware that this was all part of Trajectory's plan. It was a trap and she had fallen for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put all her force into flying away from whatever it was that was trying to suck her in. It reminded her a bit of the Phantom Zone, and if what was inside that portal was anything like that, then she knew she wanted nothing to do with it. But she couldn't get away from it. It was like invisible hands had grabbed onto her and were pulling her closer. She struggled, spinning, and trying even harder to fly away, but with every second she got sucked closer to the portal. When her foot entered the portal she felt a sudden cold as if it had been dipped in frigid water. And she looked deep into the hole, trying to see where it was going to take her. She saw all manner of things swirling by. And she felt something she rarely felt for someone who is practically invincible. Fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting pulled further into the portal, and she screamed when it got so that all but her neck was submerged. It reminded her a bit of when her sister Alex had pulled her underwear over her head, the knowledge that the underwear was soon going to be covering her hair, and going over her face, the fact that the pain was distinguished. It hurt all the worst because of the effort Alex had put into making it happen. The same was true of this portal, it scared Kara had badly it wanted to pull her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the portal pushed past her chin, covering her mouth, and then her nose, before eventually her eyes, she screamed. And then everything was black. She thought she could see different things, so many things, millions of billions of lives, flying about her so quickly it was like she was in everyone's dreams at the same time. She felt like she was floating. And she knew nothing but all that she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she landed on hard grass and her entire body jolted back into awareness. She quickly got to her feet, dazed and unsure how long she had been in...whatever it was she had been in. She looked around. She was in a park, and it was nighttime. When she had been in Metropolis it had been sunny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered that Trajectory must still be around somewhere. And she could be doing anything. Kara leapt into the air, and used her super hearing to try to find Trajectory. She heard a lot of noise, people talking, cars going by. She wasn't sure what had happened to her, and why half of the day was now gone, but she was determined to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she heard a sound like sirens nearby, and an authoritative voice demanding that someone surrender.</span></div></div>",

Super-girl took notice of the fact that there were no males and the women seem to enjoy anything painful and humiliating. She could see why after the wedgie she got from that Trajectory girl who seems to have the same powers as Barry. She was getting turned on by her wedgie that she didn't pick mind you. Super-girl decided to go to L-corp and talk to Lena and she hoped this world had a super-girl that way it wouldn't scare Lena. Unbeknownst to Kara this world did have a super-girl who was currently with Lena in civilian form. Super-girl looked through the wall of Lena's office blushing at what she saw. Super-girl saw her counterpart and Lena having a heated make-out session while giving wedgies to each other. \"Okay my counterparts lucky I can't even tell my Lena I like her without stuttering like a fool\",thought Super-girl jealously. Super-girl coughed to get their attention and when she did both ladies were surprised. In this world not only did Kara confess her feelings to Lena but her secret of being Super-girl as well. Super-girl realizing this said,\"I'm from another dimension and I need your help getting back.\" Lena and Kara were expecting something else like a clone or something not another dimension though it did make sense. What happens now?</span></div></div>",
