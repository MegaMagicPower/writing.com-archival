She started to notice some changes to her eye color on the mirror when a jolt of pain came from her back, forcing her into all fours. Sweat started to drip from her brunette hair as she felt her clothes tighten around her petite frame. Suddenly, a ripping noise came from her blouse as it started to tear around the back.<br>\r\nMay could feel all her muscles revoltously changing size, growing out of their normal proportions in a very fast pace. Again May heard the back of her blouse tearing and an excrusiating pain on her back as she felt something bulging and growing.<br>\r\nAnother loud rip, and May's blouse fell in tatters to the ground. May noticed that her skin started to change its tone, from a pale white to a vivid dark green, and her back still pulsating in pain of the growth of a new appendage.<br>\r\nMay felt her tight shorts tear themselves apart, unable to contain her growing legs and torso as they bulged with newly grown muscles.<br>\r\nSoon after, her throbbing shoes started to bother her too much, so she kicked them away in time to watch her socked feet bulge with new size, her entire bone structure crackling with the changes.<br>\r\nThe unbeareble pain on May's back started to fade a little, only to be traded by another pain on the tips of her fingers and toes. In horror, May watched her gloves burst apart as her fingers grew out with newly formed claws in place of nails, and what remained of May's socks was shreded by growing claws on her toes.<br>\r\nThis all happened too fast and as fast as the pain came, it started to fade away, leaving May stunned with a plethora of new sensations to explore.<br>\r\nMay fainted for some minutes and when she woke up, her sight was all blurry and she had to blink to adjust her eyes to the light. With little effort, May got to her feet and immediately drew her attention to the mirror. \"Where am I? Wow...all that I remember is that I was on a cruise on my way to meet Ash-OH MY GOD!\"<br>\r\nMay was overwhelmed by the sight at the mirror before her. In place of her usual self, May saw a very green face, tiny fangs came out of the sides of her mouth and her usual ocean blue eyes were now a shade of red. Her green bandanna remained wrapped around her head but her hair was a mess.<br>\r\nMay looked around her body, newly changed it was still strange to her.  She was definitely taller and her slim teenage frame was now a very curvy and athletic build. She felt an itch on her back and as she made motion to scratch it a new part of her body made itself evident to her. a little below her shoulder length, there was a green bulb with leaves at its sides. May immediately identified this feature as the one from a bulbasaur, but a little bigger to match the size of her back.<br>\r\nAs May took a step, she immediately felt that the soles of her feet were a little more sensitive. \"Oh my, what should I do? If that pain from earlier made me become a bulbasaur-girl what has it done to the others in the cruise?\"<br>\r\nMay, seeing that she had only an overstretched bra and pantyes on, started looking around the room for something to cover herself. She was actually thinking about leaving her cabin and see what had gone outside. Still, she started to think about what manner of fate awaited her if she left the cabin.</span></div></div>",

Then, May slowly grabs the doorknob and opens the door. She could hear some noises from outside already.<br>\r\n   When she opens the door, May is greated by the sound of hundreds of people screaming and comotion in every deck of the ship. As she makes her way into the ship's corridor, the entire ship starts to shake and May hears someone far into the upper decks screaming \"the ship is out of control! We are all doomed!\"<br>\r\n  Desperate, May runs to the upper deck and is greated with a sight she thought only possible on a grotesque dream. Hundreds of the ship's crew and the passagers where all transformed into some hybrid between a human and a pokemon!<br>\r\n   People crying, thinking and even desperate for this terrible dream to end, all there at the main deck while the ship itself seemed to be out of control, maybe the captain and his crew where unable to keep the journey.<br>\r\n  May had to figure out a way to get out of this ship. She looked around and everywhere she looked she saw more and more people, now turned hybrids, having a variety of reactions from the changes. <br>\r\n  Then, May noticed that the ship was close to a port, but at this rate the ship would pass by and keep going into the ocean. If she was to get to civilization any time soon it would have to be now, she could jump the cruise ship and swim to the shores, but May was afraid of what people would think of her in this form, she didn't know if this transformation insident was isolated or more people would know about it, and she was afraid of being captured and taking part some kind of bizarre test.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Beachouses, docks and even a small port, but no one in sight. Then, May notices a large outdoor with \"<i>Welcome to Sandgem Town Beach, have a nice day!</i>\" written in big and legible letters.<br>\r\n  \"Yeah...it seems that I made it to Sandgem...I hope I can find some help...maybe Ash is around.\" With that, May started to look around the beach for signs of anyone .<br>\r\n  After some time walking, may hear someone shouting \"hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She blushed a little, because she didn't really know how she would present herself to him in that state. <br>\r\n  As Ash got near, May tried to cover herself as much as she could with what she had, but she didn't bring enough blankets to cover her entire self, always leaving her face or her legs in view.<br>\r\n   Ash got close to her and raised a hand in means to give May a conforting grip. \"Hey, May its you isn't it? I would recognize that bandanna anywhere...what's wrong? Why are you covering yourself that much?\"<br>\r\n   May juls let the blanket covering her face slip a little and showed Ash what was wrong with her. \"Oh Ash it was horrible! Out of nowhere this epidemic struck the cruise and people started becoming pokemon hybrids all over!\"<br>\r\n  Ash, now warmly holding May's shoulder, tried to sort this situation. \"So, you don't know what turned you into a pokemon Hybrid?\"<br>\r\n  \"Yes, and...\" she started to shake Ash's hand away and started to back away from him \"...and it might be contagious! I don't want you to catch it and become a freak like I did!\"<br>\r\n   Ash looked May in the eyes and said \"come on May, it's not like you are some sort of monster, you are still you...even if you are a hybrid from outside, and this is what matters most now!\"<br>\r\n   May took a deep breath, <i>yeah he is right</i>, May thought, <i>even if I changed I am still myself...mostly</i>. Then, May let her sea soaked blankets fall as she closed in on Ash and gave him a very warm and friendly hug, with tears falling from her eyes. \"Oh Ash it was horrible! I felt so much pain! I'm so glad I could meet you!\"<br>\r\n  \"It's all right now May, calm down, don't worry we have been through worse...\" As they hugged, May felt more confortable and calmed down. After some minutes hugging, they started walking back to Sandgem Town.<br>\r\n  \"So Ash, wasn't Brock with you? And what about that new friend of yours, Dawn?\" May asked. Ash turned his face to answer her \"Well, Dawn wasn't feeling very well so Brock stayed behind at the Pokemon Center to help her get better...strange though, everyone in town seems to be busy taking care of sick relatives...\"<br>\r\n  \"Oh my god Ash! This is exactly what was happening at the cruise!\" May's desperation started to show all over again.<br>\r\n   \"Lets get to the pokemon center then, and hope Nurse Joy has some way of curing this!\".

His fingernails exploded, giving way to very sharp claws. His toes grew elongated as claws grew from his toenails as well. His skin started to acquire a red leathery texture  to acomodate his muscles, which bulged and grew in size. From his back, small arms started to grow and lengthen, and soon after they grew small hands which had long fingers, from between those fingers, a layer of leathery scales started to form, shaping the new appendages into fully working dragon wings.<br>\r\n  May squealed and shrieked with every sound of the change. From bones snapping to the horrible and painful gasps Ash made every time a change took place. <br>\r\n  Tears made way into Ash's eyes as he felt a pain on his mouth as it elongated a little and every single teeth on his mouth reshaped into sharp fangs. Finally, Ash felt a pain over his lower back as his tailbone shreded what was left of his pants and grew into a long red tail.<br>\r\n  As the changes settled, Ash erupted a savage roar as flames came out of his newly formed maw and a considerable sized torch of fire lit itself right at the tip of his new tail.<br>\r\n  With the changes fomplete, ash fell once more to the ground and fainted from exhaustion.

Slowly, he rises to a sitting position and stretches his arms with a loud \"YAAAWN\".<br>\r\n  \"Ash I'm glad you are ok!\" May exclaimed as she moved to hug her huge friend.<br>\r\n  \"Of course I am...May is that me or you are smaller?\" Ash didn't seem to notice, and May knew she didn't notice it either when she first woke up after the change, so she desided just to let him notice it by himself.<br>\r\n  After Ash got up and wiped his eyes with one of his hands, then he started to look around. Noticing that something felt odd, he started to look over himself and the realization hit him after some time.<br>\r\n  \"OH MY I CHANGED AS WELL!\" Ash screamed in exitement. \"Oh well Ash, at least your reaction was better than mine, I almost freaked out when the change first hit me, now I am feeling...well\" May was unsure if she could say it but her new self did feel good, id just didn't feel right.<br>\r\n  \"What do we do now? I mean...we are changed, should we search for a cure or something?\" Ash asked puzzled with his new features and what they could do.<br>\r\n  \"Well Ash, guess we should head to the Pokemon Center first, the others are there and maybe we can figure something out after that\" answered May in motion to keep walking.<br>\r\n  Just when Ash would take a step, he stopped and screamed out loud \"OH MY, AM I NAKED??!!\" In fact, his clothes did not survive the ammount of growth Ash had undergone, now the young teen was around 7ft tall and had quite the phisique. Most of his human features stayed the same, only now more muscular and covered by red smooth scales. His back now supported a nice pair of working charizard wings and he now had a tail.<br>\r\n  Despite the fact that he was naked though, his genitals were not exposed, like an average charizard, although a small bulge indicated that his organ was still there, just secluded inside a thick pouch of leathery skin.<br>\r\n  \"Well Ash, you being naked didn't bother me that much, besides I am wearing just my bra and pantyes if you didn't notice I left that soaked blankets I was wearing back at the beach\"<br>\r\n  Indeed, May was almost naked, exposing her green bulbasaur-girl skin around at Sandgme Town, not that anyone besides Ash was there to see anyways, but the idea of staying that way didn't seem to bother her, and May noticed that she has changed mentaly in a way, her change seemed to have left her less inhibited, more at ease with her natural features, as if she ignored the concepts of perversion and morality all along, and this scared her.<br>\r\n  \"hmm...if you say so May, I hope the people at the Pokemon center don't freak out...wait...Dawn was feeling bad this mourning, OH NO SHE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED AS WELL! LETS HURRY MAY!\" Noth of them resumed their pace to the Pokemon Center with a little more haste. Getting there...</span></div></div>",

This was quite surprising though, Brock would usually have one of his passion attacks whenever he saw a cute girl, maybe having known May before and seeing how she changed made him feel a little uneasy.<br>\r\n    \"Hey Brock, where is Dawn? Is she all right?\" Ash asked. Brock was about to answer when the bathroom door opened and Dawn spoke for herself \"well Ash I'm here and I'm quite all right.\" Ash couldn't help but gasp a little when he saw that Dawn...</span></div></div>",

She still had her white hat covering her dark blue hair, which flowed down her back, but now she had huge bunny ears that rested bent at the sides of her head, coming out of her head all the way down past her shoulder line.<br>\r\n    Her entire body was now covered with a soft layer of brown fur, that got lighter at some places, and her entire figure was noe looking quite older and developped. Dawn had longer legs, that ended in enormous bunny feet, which still had a human feel to them but were more a mix between Dawn's petite feet and those of a Lopunny. <br>\r\n    Dawn's new fur coat made her look fluffyer but a very well defined muscle outling could be seen all over her body, in fact, Dawn's muscles were small but very well defined and not even her fur could hide that, and to complete the scene, Dawn was wearing her usual pink skirt that could barelly reach her knees and her blouse looked definitely tighter, even with her scarf around her neck and covering some of her upper bust.  \"Wow Dawn you look amazing!\" said Ash.<br>\r\n    \"Yeah, I feel very good as well! Way better then I felt earlier! In fact, I changed just some minutes ago.\" Dawn said on her always cheerful tone. \"Guess now all we need is for Brock to change as well!\"<br>\r\n    \"I don't think I will Dawn, I don't feel any of the symptoms everyone else was feeling this mourning\" Brock said, with a little bit of disappointment on his tone.<br>\r\n    \"Well Dawn, this changes always made me forget! This is May, my friend from Hoenn and one of the best pokemon coordinators I've ever known!\" said Ash gesturing towards May.<br>\r\n    The bulbasaur-girl's green cheeks blushed a little at this flattery, as she scratched the back of her head \"well I'm not that good...in fact Ash taught me most that I know about pokemon...well...nice to meet you Dawn!\" With that, May and Dawn shook hands and shared a brief friendly hug.<br>\r\n    \"Hey did you all notice the Pokemon Center seems a little calmer now?\" Said an inquisitive Brock.<br>\r\n    \"Well, now that you mention it, there was quite a noise outside but it all seems to have stopped all of a sudden\" said May. <br>\r\n    \"We better check it out, might have something to do with all this transformation fuss\" said Ash, opening the door to the room.<br>\r\n     Indeed, the once crowded corridors of the Center now were very empty and there was no sign of conflict or anything. Everyone then followed Ash into the corridor and back into the Pokemon Center's main hall. In the main hall though, they had quite a different sight.<br>\r\n     Every single pokemon hybrid that seemed to be around before was now seated in every corner of the room, watching wide-eyed at an announcement on the TV. A news reporter saying \"Well this video footage came in today from a source that claims to be responsible for the recent insident of people transforming into pokemon htbrids\" With that, the screen goes black for a momment and then the footage in question starts to be streamed.<br>\r\n    A figure in a white mask with red details stood right before the camera. For a minute the figure stood silent, but then he started talking with a very deep and rasped voice, \"People throughout the world! This is the hour of change! Wat happened at Sinnoh is just the beginning! We, the Evanescent will bring uppon the world a new era! An era of peace, ruled by one and only being of true power! The humanity shall cast away their old beliefs and join the cause of the new people, the people made perfect, both human and pokemon alike can share the gift we offer! We are the future, we are the Evanescent! For peace and prosperity!\"<br>\r\n    The screen then turned black once again, and the face of the news reporter made itself shown on screen once more, but this time speechless, like everyone else at the Pokemon Center. Ash and friends made their silent way back into their room.<br>\r\n    Back at the room, everyone seemed concerned about this new group Evanescent that came out of nowhere and claimed to have changed almost every human and even pokemon at Sinnoh in hybrids. It was quite sudden and not one of them knew what they should do right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

After the prior events, Ash, Dawn and May were barely dressed in anything.<br>\r\n     For May and Dawn, dressing up in their old clothes wasn't hard, seen that they were almost the same size as before, but for Ash the thing was different. Ash had at least doubled in size and nothing that he had would fit propperly, not that Ash had to bother with it though, but he had to at least wear something. They had to ask Nurse Joy if she had something that could fit a large pokemon so that Ash could dress up propperly. Nurse Joy improvised a pair of pants out of some blankets and hospital gowns but had nothing more that could fit Ash's upper body, and having wings didn't make anything easier.<br>\r\n   In the end, May enved up wearing a sports bra, which didn't cover the plant bulb at her back, her usual tight biker shorts and her bandanna. She tried to wear a pair of gloves and her shoes but they felt really unconfortable so she didn't bother.<br>\r\n  Dawn had her usual pink skirt with black blouse and scarf. She improvised holes in her hat so that her large Lopunny ears could be free and she couldn't fit her large bunny feet into her pink boots so she didn't bother with that as well.<br>\r\n   After Brock had his usual supplies packed,  they headed out into the town outskirts. The Pokemon Center seemed to be very empty save for a few hybrids in some rooms but people seemed to be accomodating with this new change.<br>\r\n    As soon as they stepped out of the paved streets of the town, May gasped in surprise \"oh this is so werid!\"<br>\r\n   \"What's wrong May?\" Ash asked while looking at her for anything unusual.<br>\r\n  \"Oh nothing really, it's just that I can feel the ground beneth my feet, it seems that if I stand still I can use photosynthesis.\"<br>\r\n   \"Well, maybe after the change you three can develop some pokemon moves, it is to be expected\" Brock stated.<br>\r\n   \"Hmm...maybe this is why Team Evanescent seems so eager to try and enstablish a new world order?\" Dawn said. In fact, all of them agreed that joining humans with pokemons seemed convenient for a lot of things, including world domination.<br>\r\n    With that, the group started to look for evidenses on Team Evanescent's actions.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> <div align=\"left\"> Being Sandgem Town so small, if anything was going wrong everyone would know as soon as it happened, however, the movement around town was pretty strange after the transformation catastrophe. The streets were empty and everyone was appearently traveling or at home coping with the consequences of the transformations.<br>\r\n Brock gave the idea to ask for clues of this new team in the police department, one of the policemen was bound to know something about all this.<br>\r\n Not far from Sandgem there was a small police outpost with a few guards that were only there to ensure safety on the route to Jubilife city. There, our heroes had set as their first destination.<br>\r\n  When they arrived however, something seemed strange. Abandoned motorcycles near the small police house showed that someone might still be in there, but the building itself was unlocked and seemed very abandonned from the outside.<br>\r\nInside though, our heroes spotted what could only be described as utter destruction. The furniture was in pretty bad shape and the place was very dirty and suspiciously calm, as if a hurricane thrashed the place and left no trace behind. <br>\r\nIt was then that Dawn's super sensitive bunny ears caught a noise coming from one of the back rooms. \"Hey guys, did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n\"Hear what Dawn?\" Brock answered.<br>\r\n\"It's like a faint noise, like someone is beating onto a door or something.\" Dawn answered still concentrating on the noise.<br>\r\n \"Can you tell us where it is coming from?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n\"From that door at the back\" Dawn said poiting to a door right beside a broken reception counter. The door was wide open so everyone could see a corridor leading to a few back rooms, maybe some cells for keeping criminals until they could be transfered to the larger prisons. <br>\r\n Being the largest, Ash took the lead and went in first to investigate the noise. As silently as he could with his new size, Ash made it to the back corridor of the building and soon started hearing the noise as well. Dawn, May and Brock followed closely behind until all of them could hear the noises as well.<br>\r\n It sounded like someone beating on a wooden chair or table and it apparently came from behind a closed door. Ash checked to see if the door was locked and ended breaking the doorknob due to his new charizard strength, and with a little pull the door was open and they could see what was inside.<br>\r\n The room loked like a restroom, with a hard looking couch and some wooden chairs. What called Ash's attention though was a policeman, tied from hear to toe and with his mouth gagged, beating at a fallen table ad the floor in means to call for attention.<br>\r\n In sight of the charizard-man on the door though, the man panicked and struggled to moove away from Ash. Ash made his way into the room, making room for the others to go in and see what he saw first.<br>\r\n \"Sir, calm down, we won't hurt you!\" Ash said, making motion to reach for the ropes that tied the man down. Surprisingly, the man seemed calmed by Ash's statement and stopped thrashing away from him. Ash, then, grabbed the ropes and started to cut them with his claws releasing the man's arms and legs. The policeman immediately pulled the durc tape that gagged his mouth and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n \"Oh thank the gods for releasing me! I have been like this for an hour or so now!\" <br>\r\n \"Can you tell us what happened to this place officer?\" Brock asked.<br>\r\n The officer took some time to catch his breath and then started in a very worryed tone \"It was horrible! This mourning, Officer Jenny and Officer Trent, my friends and companions here at this police outpost, started transforming into pokemon!\"<br>\r\n \"Yes, it happened with us as well\" stated May.<br>\r\n \"Well that's not the problem though\" the policeman resumed \" they were fine at first, only a little unused to their new forms but mentally, they were fine. Then some hours ago, some pokemon hybrids attacked this post and there where those strange men with them.\" the policemen gasped for air and then continued again.<br>\r\n \"The same people from that video the news cast earlier, Team Evanescent I think, they captured my friends and force-fed them something that looked like pokeblocks, then they started acting wild and destroying the place. It was the men from Team Evanescent the ones who left me tied in here, they said I was immune or something, then they left and my friends left with them like very obedient pokemon!\"<br>\r\n \"So this is what they want, to control the minds of the ones who changed.\" Brock concluded.<br>\r\n \"It's terrible! We've got to stop them somehow!\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n \"Yeah I'm with Dawn! This Team Evanescent can't even wait for what is comming for them!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n \"I have to agree, we can't let them do this to all the world!\" May said.<br>\r\n All of them knew however, that they couldn't act without a plan, they could either...<br>\r\n  </div></span></div></div>",

D.\" the policeman answered still shaken from all that happened.<br>\r\n\"Then contact Jubilife as soon as you can, we will need all the help we can get and this whole thing might turn up pretty badly.\" <br>\r\n\"Hey Brock, what about Professor Rowan?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n\"Good point Dawn! Professor Rowan might know something more about this whole transformation thing!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n\"Dawn has a good point, and Rowan's lab is not far, we could go out of our way to Jubilife to check on the Profesor.\" Brock said.<br>\r\n\"Is it set then? We are going to Professor Rowan's lab and then to Jubilife?\" May asked and everione agreed.<br>\r\nThe videophones in the police station were completely wrecked so the officer had to make his way to Jubilife by motorbike, and seen that he could only carry one person with him the group decided to let him go ahead to Jubilife and then meet him there after they had met Professor Rowan.<br>\r\nAfter some walking the group finally made it to the wooden doors of Professor Rowan's small lab. There, they knocked on the door and for some time they heard nothing, until Dawn's super sensitive ears started hearing Professor Rowan's voice calling for help from inside the lab.<br>\r\nImmediately the group whent in and saw what the concern was all about. A fierce looking Mightyena hybrid was frantically scratching at the wooden door that led to the back rooms, and from behind the door they could hear Professor Rowan's voice desperately calling for help.<br>\r\nAsh quickly took the lead of the team and tackled the Mightyena hybrid away from the door. May thought about immobilizing the hybrid and unconsiously, vines erupted from the plant bulb on her back and wrapped around the hybrid's wrists and ankles.<br>\r\nThe creature was shaking violently so Pikachu jumped off of Ash's shoulder and thundershocked the hybrid until it was unconsious. May kept it tightly wrapped though just to be safe.<br>\r\nSeeing that Brock was the only human, well the only unchanged human, of the group. They all agreed that Brock was to open the door and check on the professor.<br>\r\nNot surprisingly though, the door was locked so Brock gave it a light knock and said \"Professor we are here, we have incapacitated the Mightyena hybrid, it is safe to come out!\"<br>\r\nAfter the audible sound of something very large rasping on the ground as it was being  pushed away, the door openned and Professor Rowan stepped out. Rowan was his usual self though, old with grayed hair and even his usual lab coat.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for saving me...\" the professor paused for a moment to take a good look at every one of his saviors, then he got closer to Dawn and asked \"hmm... aren't you the little Dawn? That cheerful girl that took Piplup as her starter?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep, that is me!\" Dawn answered smiling.<br>\r\n\"Fascinating...oh and this big guy here... he looks familiar somehow\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Ash, the boy with the Pikachu that came here after helping Dawn.\" Ash answered.<br>\r\n\"Ah of course of course! How could I forget? I didn't recognize you without your hat.\" Professor Rowan said jokingly.<br>\r\n\"So, Professor, would you mind telling us what happened here?\" May asked while tightening the curls of her vines over the unconsious hybrid.<br>\r\n\"Well, this hybrid used to be my assistant. He transformed this mourning and was feeling quite all right until shortly after he ate some pokefood from a shipment that arrived just yesterday. Then he lost his mind and started acting like a beast so I hid in the back rooms\"<br>\r\n\"Well professor, we were expecting that you could shed some more light into this whole transformation that happened today.\" Brock asked.<br>\r\n\"Actually I can. Before my assistant went berserk I managed to run some tests and found out that he has been infected with some kind of virus that slowly changed him.\"<br>\r\n\"Slowly like how long Professor?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, my tests could hardly be conclusive but for what I know, this change has been on the making for aproximately a month, but it had a very evident final stage that was triggered by something, my guess is that the water supply has whatever it is that triggers the transformation.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, so you are saying we have been infected for so long and that we transformed because we drank water?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n\"Basically, yes. However, I am more concerned with what my assistant is suffering right now. He was mentally healthy this mourning and after eating this new pokefood he went mad.\"<br>\r\n\"Hm, so the pokefood makes hybrids mad, what do you plan to do Professor?\" Brock asked.<br>\r\n\"Little lady\" Rowan pointed at May who was still holding the Mightyena hibrid tightly with her vines \"if you would be so kind as to get my assistant to one of the back rooms, I would like to run a few more tests.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure! Oh and name is May by the way!\" <br>\r\n\"Of course, how rude of me. Sorry May but those events left me a little shaken\" <br>\r\n\"It's fine, tis guy is kinda heavy, Ash would you mind giving me a hand?\" May said as she tried in vain to lift the fallen hybrid with her vines.<br>\r\n\"Oh sure May, let me hold him!\" Ash grabbed the hybrid's limp body and lifted it with ease, being careful,not to damege May's vines though.<br>\r\nAfter some time, all ofthe group was with the professor into one of the dorm rooms at the back of the lab. While the professor was running his tests, the group was talking about taking some time to train some propper attacks, they were part pokemon now so they thought about trying just that.<br>\r\nWhile May tried to create some propper razor leaves and Ash was attempting to use a Flamethrower, Professor Rowan's assistant started to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was strange though was that none of them looked panicked or even aware of their changes! May walked outside to see various types of morphs going about their cruise line activities. Sunflora and other grass-type Pok\u00e9mon were  photosynthesizing in the sun, with even an Espeon-girl happily curled up on a lounge chair. A Magmar hybrid was flaming kebobs at the open grill while a Lickitung-boy and a Snorlax-girl fought over the last tropical flavored Poffin, unaware of the floating Combee-girl happily replacing the empty tray with another batch. In the pool, there were a group of Squirtle and Wartortle-girls playing pool volleyball without a worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was only a fraction of all the changed passengers May saw on board. She still had no idea how far the changes have gone in different regions. What also troubled the Skitty-girl was that there was clear evidence that they all had changed, like the obviously fresh tear in the back of a Squirtle-girl's one-piece that her tail made. May herself was even questioning whether this was normal or not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to find out if Ash and the others are okay, Skitty!\" she told herself before quickly slapping her hands over her mouth. The changes were affecting her behavior as well!

May's heart skipped at the sight, fearing the weirdness of the situation was about to skyrocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay followed after the tail, her plans of stealth immediately dropped as she already had a sinking feeling as to what she was about to find. She rounded the corner, only to watch the tail turn another up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please, please, please, PLEASE! Let it not be what I think it is!' she frantically thought to herself as she reached the base of the stairs. She stood there for a moment, hesitating whether or not she really wanted to confirm her theory or not. She breathed in deep, bracing herself  as she stepped out into the sunlit deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat May saw caused her tail to shoot up straight through her shorts: everyone on the cruise ship was either an anthro Skitty like herself or still in the process of changing. Skitty people were playing with the Pok\u00e9 beach balls that now bounced around the deck like felines while also playing around with each other, mainly with each other's tails.

Her fingers became rounded, and they fused together to make paws. She held the Poochyena paws up, which were now padded. The fur took over her face now, her body now covered in grey and black fur. Her face stretched, creating a muzzle. She touched it. \"What's happening to me?\" she cried.  She felt her ears, now covered with fur, become longer and perked up. \"OW!!!\" She yelled. She then felt something furry behind her huge butt, and she looked and saw a tear in her shorts, and out of that tear wiggled a grey tail. She fell on her furry legs and saw her feet become paws, like her hands, only bigger. She fell on her legs, and thought, \"I have no choice but to rip off my clothes!\" and she started with her shorts. She tore, and tore, and then, got them off, revealing her vagina, which was furry. She groaned, and started tearing at her blouse. All of a sudden, <b><i>RRRRIIIIIIIIP!</i></b> Her blouse burst off, faling on the ground, exposing her now huge, furry breasts.

She burst through the door, and heard the screams as many people were turning into Pokemorphs. \"Oh no, I have to warn Ash, Brock, and Max! I hope it didn't get them..\" she thought. \"I have to swim!\" she barked. She ran onto the ship's deck, and jumped. She began to doggy-paddle across the ocean, and gasped as she saw many Water-type Pokemon becoming humanoid. \"It's infecting even Pokemon?!?!?\" she gasped.

Pain soon followed.  Her feet began to flatten and enlarge as her toes merged together to create three sharp claws.  Her legs bulked up, enhancing them with more power than they had known before.  As the changes moved upwards, her shorts began to expand with her hips before finally ripping off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this happened, her hands screamed in pain as they turned green, her fingers becoming sharp and pointed.  Her skin began to thicken into an exoskeleton as her arm widened until she had gained the blades of a scyther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarmie had reached her now and pulled her up toward the surface as her skin on her abs hardened with more inhuman strength.  Her shoulders hurt next as the wings pushed out.  As she broke the surface of the water, she let loose a powerful scream bringing Joshua to his knees as he looked at the mysterious thing his opponent's Starmie brought from the bottom of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty clamored onto the platform coughing up water as pain came to her head, reshaping it to make it stronger but still retaining her human eyes and hair.  As she looked to her chest, no longer could she be called a child with this bust.  She moved to stand upright and turned to face Joshua, who took a step back from the creature he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was confused right now.  She was exhausted and confused.  She also had some anger she felt towards this haughty brat, who called her gym pathetic as he had taken out her pokemon, her friends, with just his Absol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to make the bastard pay.  Her wings began to shake.  Then they sped up, faster and faster until she was airborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua was terrified now.  He didn't know what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absol!  Take that freak out!\" he cried, \"Bite her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ab!\" the Absol replied leaping at Misty, who at the last second used Double Team.  The Absol fell into the water as Misty flew down and slicked the Absol with her new blades.  The pokemon cried out in pain before fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return,\" Joshua said, looking at the flying gym leader/pokemon.  He had one other pokemon.  His Graveler would be able to best her if she is weak to what other Scythers are.  Joshua hoped for this as Misty launched an attack on the boy.</span></div></div>",

You alright?\" The young man asks nervously after almost a minute passes and Misty does not resurface. \"Uh, d-does this mean that you forfeit? Because if you did, that means that I win, right-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blood-curdling roar that sends the challenger down to his knees, clutching his ears in pain, the water explodes, and an utterly <b>massive</b> form bursts from the pool, landing heavily back on the platform on all fours. The creature <i>looks</i> like Misty - it has her eyes, it's about the same color as her hair, and the guy can see that it's wearing the shredded remains of her clothing, but the similarities end there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, she's grown taller - even hunched over on all fours she stands at least two feet taller than her challenger. She's also quite a bit brawnier, with toned muscles that wouldn't look out of place on a weight lifter, yet at the same time as lean and trim as a swimmer's frame now packed onto her form. Her muscular legs are bent and twisted, digitigrade almost like the hind legs of an Arcanine or Mightyena, with three clawed toes connected with webbed skin on each foot; meanwhile, her arms are considerably longer than they were before, with three fingers and a thumb on each hand, the digits connected with webbing just like on her feet and tipped with razor-sharp curved talons. A long Gyarados tail lashes through the air behind the transformed Gym Leader, occasionally slapping at the water, and her head now sports a mouthful of razor-sharp fangs, long orangey-red hair flowing down her shoulders, fins in the place of ears, and the trademark three-point head crest of the Atrocious Pokemon, setting her eyes in a permanent glare. Her back and flanks are covered in orangey-red scales as bright and blazing as a roaring campfire; also running down her back are several jagged plates like the ones found on the back of a Gyarados, with the largest pair growing from between her shoulder blades and the smallest on the small of her back. Her underside, on the other hand, is covered in tough hide about the same color as her skin from before her transformation.<br>\r\nAnd speaking of her underside... <br>\r\nThe challenger's face turns beet red as he stares at Misty's new and improved figure. Her previously flat chest has expanded immensely, with each breast now easily a bit bigger than her head, and is counterbalanced by a toned stomach, wide hips, and a sizable ass. The young man can't help but drool a little bit at the sight of the almost totally nude Gym Leader's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lust, however, is quickly replaced by fear once again as the Misty-monster roars again.<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, kid?\" She snarls, revealing row after row of fangs in a feral grin and causing the trainer's face to go pale at the sight. She holds out Starmie's Pokeball in one webbed hand and recalls it, cracking her own knuckles. \"Thought that you were tough.\" She spreads her arms out. \"C'mon; hit me with your best shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insult finally snaps the Lillycove challenger back to reality. \"Y-you bitch!\" He shouts. \"Absol, use Night Slash! That freak's a Pokemon now, it can take damage!\" <br>\r\nThe Absol nods and leaps towards the transformed Gym Leader, bounding across the floating platforms with the skill of a mountain goat, its front glows sheathing themselves in blackish-purple energy as it pounces towards the much larger hybrid with a snarl, ready to strike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be hit in the face with an Aqua Tail and smacked across the battlefield, where it bounces off the water's surface like a skipping stone before finally skidding to a stop at its trainer's feet, barely managing to push itself back up.<br>\r\n\"My turn.\" Misty growls, her maw already glowing with burning orange light as she prepares to charge up another attack. Arceus above, this was <i>amazing!</i> The transformation process had hurt like hell, but now... now she was strong, strong, strong! Nobody could challenge her, nobody could stand up to her might!<br>\r\n\"Absol, get up and use Protect!\" The trainer screams as the Disaster Pokemon struggles back up to its feet. \"We'll beat her if it's the last thing we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty used Hyper Beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast of energy slams into both the Absol and its trainer, sending them flying through the air once again and blasting them through the wall of the gym like it was cardboard. Both human and Pokemon scream loudly as they are flung through the air, rapidly shrinking into a speck on the horizon.<br>\r\nMisty snorts with satisfaction at the sight. \"Showed that punk.\" She growls, noticing for the first time just how gravelly her voice has become. Eh, whatever - the tradeoff was <i>so</i> worth it.<br>\r\n\"Let's see my sisters try and one-up me now.\" She chuckles to herself, hefting her titanic breasts in her webbed hands and giving them a gentle shake. \"I can be my <i>own</i> Pokemon team now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty brought her injured Pokemon back to the tanks where they normally lived and headed for the door of the gym, ignoring the screams of terror as people fled from the monstrous sight and/or covered their children's eyes. The transformed Gym Leader smirked as she noticed more than a few men and women staring open-mouthed at her new figure - she was an absolute knockout now, no doubt about that. But never mind that - she needed to get out of the city for a while. Misty felt like she was going to explode with all this newfound power - she needed to swim free, to get in a good fight, to do <i>something!</i> Maybe she should head towards the Lake of Rage or the ocean - somewhere with a lot of strong Pokemon she could have a good spar with. Heck, maybe she should track down Ash, see how well she stacked up against that Pikachu of his. The redhead chuckled to herself as she imagined Ash's shocked face at her new body, then let out a soft moan as the memory of her friend spurred a familiar warmth in between her legs. Yesss, maybe she <i>should</i> track Ash down - it had been a long time since she and him had last seen one another, and Misty was eager to... <i>reacquaint</i> herself with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where does Misty head out to?</span></div></div>",

She knew from first-hand experience just how strong his Pokemon were, but beyond that, the warmth in between her legs that had started up when she first thought of him had grown into a raging inferno. She had to have him, and she had to have him <i>now!</i> Luckily, Ash was in Kanto at the moment - when he'd heard about the spread of the strange flu, he had returned home to Pallet Town to spend some time with his Pokemon and lay low until the disease had run its course through the world. After all, a pandemic meant that there weren't any Gym Badges to obtain. Lucky for him - if Misty had had to walk across an entire region to get to her lover, she was pretty sure that he'd end up with a shattered pelvis as a result of her pent-up lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough about what-ifs; right now, she had a trainer to seduce! Walking all the way to Pallet Town would take too long - not when she had a far swifter option at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty stalked towards the Cerulean City waterfront and leapt off one of the docks into the water, rocketing down the river with the help of her webbed hands and feet and long lashing tail. Smaller Water-type Pokemon scattered as they saw her coming, and a flock of Farfetch'd took off squawking and flapping as they were tossed about like toys in her wake. The transformed Gym Leader paid the fleeing Pokemon no heed; she had a mission, and damned if she didn't see it through to the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming all the way from Cerulean City to Pallet Town went a lot faster than Misty expected it to - only about an hour and a half as opposed to the day-long trip she was expecting it to be. Regardless, she was here now, bursting up from the waves as they crashed against the beach. The Gyarados hybrid shook herself dry for a few seconds to dislodge most of the water, then looked towards the town proper. Now, where to look for Ash? Knowing him, he'd be either at Professor Oak's lab, talking to Tracey and the Pokemon Professor himself and reconnecting with his Pokemon, or he'd be at his house, eating some of his mother's delicious home cooking. The two locations were equally likely to have the raven-haired Trainer present, but which one should she search?</span></div></div>",

The trainer's mouth hung open, and he took a few steps backwards in shock as the newly transformed Misty broke the surface of the pool and she clambered back up onto the platform, water still dripping from her titanic form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was <i>enormous</i> now, standing at a towering ten feet tall, causing her clothing to tear away like wet tissue paper and leaving her totally naked. She was covered in light blue scales on her back and cream-tan down her front, a dark grey shell studded with short blunt-tipped projections covered her broad back... and her figure had gone from tomboyish to fertility goddess. Her formerly petite A-cup breasts now defied the alphabet system of classification; each one was easily nearly twice the size of a beach ball and sported a nipple the size of a grown man's fist, and nearly totally covered her stomach underneath their smooth, heaving bulk; said stomach now carried a considerable amount of paunch to its broad waist - blubber to protect against colder weather. Her ass was more than a little bit smaller than her immense new breasts, but they were by no means small - her rear end, which sported a short stubby tail above it, looked like a pair of prize-winning pumpkins had been stuffed underneath her skin, and were connected to a set of thighs thicker around than a man's torso that in turn transitioned to long, smooth, thick legs ending in three-toed feet. Similarly, Misty's arms were thick both with pudge and a fair amount of muscle, and each hand now sported two fingers and a thumb, with slight webbing growing in between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty now looked like a goddess of the ocean that stepped out from the pages of myth and legend and into real life... and she did <i>not</i> look happy at the impudent trainer that had entered her domain.<br>\r\n\"Starmie, return.\" The transformed Gym Leader declared, recalling the many-legged Water-type back into its Pokeball. \"I'll handle this from here.\" Misty didn't know how the hell this had happened to her, but she certainly wasn't going to complain about it - she felt strong, stronger than she had ever felt before, and she was eager to put it to the test.<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the-...?\" The trainer stammered out, barely able to believe what was standing before him. \"Oh, fuck it! Absol, use Night Slash on that freak! If she wants to fight against us, let's show her what we've got!\"<br>\r\n\"Sol!\" The Disaster Pokemon barked out, sprinting towards the immense Lapras girl and its horn glowing with Dark-type energy as it prepared to attack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to get hit dead-on with a Confuse Ray and stagger to a stop, flopping down on its face and passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty grinned fiendishly at the stunned trainer, then eased herself into the water, swimming across the pool separating herself from the petrified young man. \"Now...\" She murmured, \"What should I do with you?\"</span></div></div>",

Her spine felt like it was ablaze, as a nub worked its way from her buttocks. Falling to her hands and knees, she winced as a loud rip filled the air, along with cracking bones. The audience was in a total panic, many in pain as well, and a riot seemed imminent. Her chest swelled as well, and ripped up her contest dress even further as her bust tripled in size. Dawn looked back to see the commotion and nearly fainted; it was a Pachirisu's tail, but instead of blue, it was white and pink. People in the crowd also had various pokemon features, and were in varying degrees of transformation. \"What's...\" Dawn muttered, woozy, when her pokemon came out all on their own. As Dawn began to lose consciousness, she heard voices...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be rude!! Now is not the time!! Stop playing with the poor girl's tail, Buneary!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew I was her favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she dead, because if she is, I'm going to eat her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, Dawn woke up backstage on a couch, dressed in her normal attire. \"Was that a...\" In the mirror in front of her, she saw it was no nightmare. She had massive E-cup breasts, and sitting behind her, poking through a crudely made hole in her skirt was the tail she saw herself grow on the stage. Dawn belted out a horrific scream that alerted everyone she was awake. In ran Ash, the pokemon, and then Brock, if Brock had been born a girl, with flowing long black hair and C-cup breasts, then a Nurse Joy, but from her hips down she looked like some kind of Rapidash centaur, and finally Zoey, whose visage was most shocking, as she looked like she was mostly covered from her neck down with brown and white fur, and resembled a mix of human and Buizel features, including the tail, but her head was still all human, but she also shocked Dawn with her six massive F-cup breasts. This elicited more screams from Dawn, before Ash grabbed Dawn and said, \"Calm down and let us explain what happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next few hours, Ash explained that an never before heard of criminal Team had developed a biological weapon and had used it on the Sinnoh region to express their philosophy of \"bringing man and pokemon closer together.\" Everyone that was currently in the region has been infected, and the biological cloud will spread to Hoenn before it goes inert. Dawn asked, \"Then why didn't you change, or why did I only grow a tail, while Nurse Joy became a centaur, or Zoey became so much more pokemon...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh said, \"We're not certain yet, but certain people have shown greater resistances to the virus than others. Zoey isn't the worst case. Some people have fully become pokemon, and some have alterations to their gender, like Brock.. Regardless, everyone can now understand pokemon, and those transformed can use pokemon attacks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

John was from Kanto just like Ash, and they wanted to test their Pokemon against each other.<br>\r\nThe battle was pretty much equal. Ash's Pikachu and John's Togejetic were trying their hardest, but their trainers kept making bad calls. Both Ash and John had an incredibly painful migraine, so neither could concentrate. Dawn too had a very bad migraine, and was resting in her tent. Brock was reffing the match. He decided to end it in a tie since neither trainer was doing well. Brock, was feeling perfectly fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock thought some food might help everyone, so went off to cook. John and Ash wobbled over to each other and sat down; Pikachu and Togejetic worriedly watched over their trainers. Soon after John and Ash were seated, both simultaneously started rolling around in pain. Their entire bodies felt like they were burning, when in fact, they began to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their necks grew out, along with Ash's left leg and John's right leg. Their arms began to shrink into their bodies as fuzzy brown feathers began to grow over their bodies. Their eyes grew bigger as their pupils grew to take up most of the eye's space. Their mouth's grew out, dragging their noses with them. Also, Ash's entire right side and Jon's entire left side began to rush together. As soon as their sides met, they immediately began to merge. After several agonizingly long minutes, the pain that Ash and John felt was gone. The loss of the pain did not make up for the transformation though. Ash and John had been merged together in the form of a humanoid-Doduo.</span></div></div>",

Yellow scales formed on her belly as a white fin burst out from her back. The fin had a blue spine at the top and at the base, and a pair of blue spines pushed out through her hair, one on either side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light faded from Clair\u2019s body, it was clear that her legs had formed into a Kingdra\u2019s tail, a Kingdra\u2019s fin protruded from her back, and a Kingdra\u2019s head spines were poking through her hair. Clair was breathing heavily, and her new scales were covered in the sweat that had covered her skin during the painful transformation. Clair\u2019s Dragonite stood close to his trainer, a worried look on his face as he began to reach out to touch Clair, then thought better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d whispered the trainer Clair had been battling once the light had faded.

And, to add insult to injury, he directly insulted her, then rubbed salt in the wound by asking her out on a date! Her anger overrode her conscience, and as her rage swelled within her, so did something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer was frozen in shock as Clair\u2019s face twisted with pure hatred, and with a roar, she opened her mouth and sent gallons of water flying straight at the trainer as Clair unleashed the full power of a Hydro Pump attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer\u2019s Wigglytuff leapt into the path of the oncoming Hydro Pump, and a blue shield formed around the Wigglytuff as she used Protect to shield herself and her trainer from the attack. Water streamed around the shield as the high pressure blast continued for several seconds, pushing the Wigglytuff back towards her trainer until she was practically in his arms. When the blast finally subsided, The trainer and his Wigglytuff were both damp from the water that had rained down on them over the shield, but they were both unharmed. The trainer looked up at Clair, and seeing her murderous expression, decided that it would probably best to cut his losses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, girl, let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d the trainer yelled as he held out a Moon Ball and recalled his Wigglytuff. Once his Wigglytuff was safely inside her Moon Ball, he turned and ran out of the gym as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair watched him leave, water dripping from her mouth as she panted from exertion. As the trainer fled her gym, Clair\u2019s initial anger began to subside, and rational thought returned to her as she realised that she had just used a Pokemon move. Clair looked down at her arms, and for the first time noticed that her body was now covered in blue scales. She tried to stand up, and that was when she realised her legs had transformed into a Kingdra\u2019s tail when she felt her new tail start to uncurl and push against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha... what\u2019s happened to me...?\u201d Clair asked.

The lobby was full of people who had been transformed into hybrids, much like she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the floor to the left was a naked woman who had been transformed into a Dodrio hybrid. She now had three identical human-like heads, which were covered in brown feathers, and had two black feathers forming a V-shaped crest on each head. The mouths on all three of her heads had been stretched into beaks, and her necks had stretched out, to a similar length to that of a Dodrio\u2019s. Her necks and legs were a light brown, the same colour as her beaks, and her body was covered in brown feathers, identical to the ones covering her heads. Black feathers covered her upper thighs and hips, and three large pink feathers poked out from her back, forming a tail. The three-headed Dodrio woman was sobbing from all three of her heads as a young man wearing the clothes of a Bird Keeper tried to comfort her. That was when Clair realised that the woman was not a human that had developed Dodrio traits, but was actually a female Dodrio that had been mutated with human traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver on the right side of the Pok\u00e9mon Center\u2019s lobby, two people, a young man and a young woman, both wearing the remains of Ace Trainer uniforms, were yelling at each other. The young man had become a Seviper hybrid. His skin was now covered in black scales, except for the purple markings on the left side of his upper lip and face, and gold scales on his lower jaw and forehead. His eyes were red, the same colour as the two fangs extending from his mouth. A black tail had ripped through his pants, and was twitching irritably, waving the red-tipped blade around. The female Ace Trainer had become a Zangoose hybrid. Her body was now covered in white fur, her ears were now pointed, covered in fur and much longer, and a furry tail had burst through her pants. Red fur covered her left ear and both of her hands, which now consisted of a thumb and two fingers that ended in large black claws. The two Ace Trainer\u2019s arguments got louder as the two acted on the instinctual hatred between Zangoose and Seviper, until the female Ace Trainer\u2019s claws glowed white, and she lashed out at the male Ace Trainer. The male Ace Trainer\u2019s tail-blade glowed dark purple, and he spun around to block her Crush Claw attack with his own Poison Tail. The two pushed against each other, with the young man\u2019s tail-blade trapped between the young woman\u2019s claws. However, the feral snarls on their faces quickly faded, and were replaced with looks of horror as they realised what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair also spotted two other hybrids in the lobby. A Beauty had been transformed into a Geodude hybrid. The woman\u2019s skin was now rocky and hard, and her legs had completely vanished, leaving her with only her arms. A naked female Bellossom hybrid was standing next to the Beauty. The Bellossom was covering up her new breasts with her left arm as she staggered around, adjusting to her new human proportions and causing the leaves growing out of her waist to sway with her movements. The Beauty reached up with her right hand towards her Bellossom, and the Bellossom took her trainer\u2019s rocky hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone, please, try to remain calm,\u201d a voice called out, desperately trying to be heard over the noise in the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Standing behind the reception counter was a Pok\u00e9mon Center Nurse. However, this nurse had been transformed into a Kangaskhan hybrid. Her uniform was in tatters, due to the fact that she had grown about a foot and a half in height, as well as due to the new muscles that had formed. Her skin was now the same colour brown as a Kangaskhan\u2019s hide, and she had also developed the cream coloured belly of a Kangaskhan as well. Clair also noticed that a Kangaskhan\u2019s pouch was visible through the remains of the nurse\u2019s uniform, and that the nurse appeared to have put a Substitute doll in her pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe currently do not know what is causing these transformations, or how to prevent them,\u201d the nurse continued. \u201cRest assured, we will do what we can to return you to normal once we understand the problem. Until then, please remain calm, and we will see what can be done for you in the meantime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair looked around the Pok\u00e9mon Center again. A male Ace Trainer had become a Seviper hybrid, a female Ace Trainer had become a Zangoose hybrid, a Beauty had become a Geodude hybrid, and the Pokemon Center\u2019s nurse had become a Kangaskhan hybrid. Not only that, but a Bird Keeper\u2019s female Dodrio and the Beauty\u2019s female Bellossom had both become human hybrids. Whatever was causing these transformations was doing so without regard for species, affecting humans and Pok\u00e9mon alike, causing Clair to shudder. She looked up at her Dragonite, feeling a pang of guilt. She had no idea what was causing these transformations, but it was entirely possible her Dragonite could be affected as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragonite?\u201d Clair asked. Her Dragonite looked down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re feeling alright?\u201d Clair asked. \u201cYou might have been affected by... whatever it is that\u2019s causing this.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Concern had been raised around a particularly bizarre strain of flu that was spreading rapidly throughout the world, and to avoid being infected herself, the elderly Dragon-type trainer had made her way to Sinnoh, the land of her grandparents, and set up a camp on the mountainside to wait until the disease had run its course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, though, the Elite Four member had been feeling ill since this morning, exhibiting the same basic symptoms that the disease shared, and she feared the worst. So she had decided to sit here in the sun, waiting patiently for the rest of the virus' prescribed effects to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, pain rapidly flared up inside of Drasna's body; she bit her lip to hold in her cry of agony, but a groan of pain still slipped free from her as she began to change. Her skin shifted in texture, wrinkles smoothing themselves out; her bones began to warp and twist, and her internal organs rearranged themselves like they were being stirred in a soup. Still, though, the master trainer weathered the pain like a champion - she wasn't known as an expert on raising Dragon-types for nothing, and her years of experience had brought her plenty of pain. And strangely enough, the pain soon began to fade away just as suddenly as it had come, but its effects were still plain as day on Drasna's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the former member of the Kalos Elite Four had been transformed into an anthropomorphic...</span></div></div>",

Drasna's figure was now reminiscent of some sort of ancient fertility goddess: wide hips, thighs as thick around as an Ursaring's torso, and a great meaty ass easily large enough to totally hide a grown man beneath it were she to sit on someone's lap, a large fatty belly large enough to hold two or three adults in the fetal position inside it, and the crown jewel of it all, a pair of utterly <i>massive</i> breasts each larger than beanbag chairs and many times softer, capped with areolae the size of dinner plates and nipples larger than a grown man's clenched fist. Her face had extended into a blunt reptilian muzzle, and a sharp-looking horn jutted forwards from her forehead. Her hair had gotten longer, cascading down her shoulders like a chestnut-brown waterfall, and her ears had grown larger and more rounded, like those of a rodent.<br>\r\nDull purple-grey armored scales covered the Elite Four member's body from head to toe, while her breasts, belly, and groin were a light cream-tan in color; large blunt-tipped spires of bone, colored the same purplish grey as the rest of her body, protruded from Drasna's back, and a long, thick purple tail grew from just above her immense ass, reaching all the way down to the ground where it extended for another three meters or so.<br>\r\nHer arms and legs had become considerably thicker and sturdier as well, thick with equal parts armored scales, thick fat, and thicker muscle; Drasna's legs were now rather stout and solid, with just two sturdy clawed toes on each foot, and her powerful arms only sported four digits now - three fingers and a thumb, each tipped with a large, curved claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrasna had become a Nidoqueen, and an utterly titanic one at that; as she flexed one massive arm, she grinned widely to herself, revealing several dozen sturdy and fairly sharp teeth.<br>\r\n\"I feel... I feel incredible!\" The older trainer laughed, giving her massive mammaries a light squeeze and cooing at their warm softness. She could see none of the wrinkles or creases that had adorned her human face, and her body felt more spry and limber than it had in decades. Drasna had been returned to the prime of her youth, and she was absolutely loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what to do now, I wonder?\" She mused to herself. Perhaps she should release her pokemon and introduce them to the new her... but there was a warmth growing in between her legs that she hadn't felt in a long, long time. Perhaps she should go out and find someone to 'satisfy' her first....</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d You all sit down as you each grab some slices for your selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all soon finish eating and then get ready for bed you decide to take a shower to calm your nerves of any extra stress. *Who would have thought I would have met someone as nice and Sam...\" \"You done in there babe?\" \"Almost just getting dressed.\" You hurry up and get back into the bed with him. \"Now then where were we...\" \"We were going to have a little fun if I am correct?\" \"Oh yeah that's right ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and pull off your robe exposing you hot body with your G-Cup breasts and skinny waist line. \"Never noticed how beautiful you are until now.\" You blush a bright crimson. \"Awe... That's both charming and sweet.\" \"So shall we have some fun?\" \"Be careful with me won't you?\" \"Of course sweetie I care to much to hurt you.\" You smile at that and lay back relaxed saying \"Whenever your ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiles as he slowly slides into you before you let out a moan... \"OH THIS FEALING... MORE PLEASE!\" Sam hears you and is soon going faster and faster. With more force everytime... \"SAM I THINK I AM CLOSE!\" \"Me too Amber.\" Soon he shoots his load into you... You both lay on the bed exhausted. \"That... Was... Fun...\" *puff*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can agree that was... Oh I think your pregnant.\" You look Down to see your stomache had grown in size a bit... \"I can barely walk now...\" \"It's OK Amber I will be with you through this whole 9 month thing.\" \"9 MONTHS!\" \"Calm down you alert the others that something is wrong.\" \"But 9 months I thought it was 6.\" \"6 for legnedaries, 9 for normals.\" You sit back and lay there thinking.\" \"How might I act during this?\" \"Tired, Cranky, hungry, and other various Moods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it this was not quite what I had expected to happen...\" \"Well I wonder how they would respond to this news...\" \"Well... Better tell them sooner than later they gonna find out sooner or later...\" \"I guess so help me walk.\" \"Of course.\" So he holds your hand as you two walk down the hall in the morning to go to the kitchen. \"What's up with her?\" \"We had fun last night and wel...
