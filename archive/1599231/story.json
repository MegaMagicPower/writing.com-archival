He kept hopping some one would come to find him but when no one did he knew he was on his own. Even though he didn't know where to go he got up knowing that he couldn't just sit there all night.  He looked around trying to see some way back home but when it failed he just headed in a random direction. <br>\r\n     Taylor thought about he got into this situation. He had told his dad that he didn't want to go but his father told him to do so, and as a 9 year old child he did as he was told. He walked off into the forest angry at his father for making him go into the mysterious woods. Now all that he felt was fear for the unknown. <br>\r\n     He didn't know how far he walked nor for how long, but his legs were beginning to ache and eyes were beginning to grow heavy. Taylor found a small stone able to seat him and a sat on it. He took his shoes off to empty them of dirt and pebbles that might of ventured his way in them. A pile was formed after he had finished.<br>\r\n     When he was done emptying his shoes he continued to sit in the dark scary forest. Owls cried in the night and a full moon gave broken light to the forest. The forest seemed empty but he instinct told him otherwise. When he thought he heard a faint voice he screamed and yelled as loud as he could. When their was no response he buried his head in his hands and began to cry.<br>\r\n     \"I want to go home.\" He cried to himself over and over again. Tears ran down his rosy red cheeks. He had never felt more helpless in his life. He was alone and scared. Taylor had often had to fend for himself at school but this time it was different. <br>\r\n     As the night grew darker Taylor continued to sit there not knowing what he would do now. His eyes grew even more heavy and even closed but Taylor forced them open only to close again...</span></div></div>",

When he did fall asleep it was much needed. When asleep he forgot all problems. The world of dreams calmed him and allowed him to escape away from his troubles. When asleep he was with his family, he didn't go get firewood, he had never even left the saftey of his home; being asleep thought was only a small get way from what he would have to eventually go back to when he woke up.<br>\r\n    Taylor woke up cold and wet. It had gently rained while he was asleep. He sat up and cleaned his arms of dirt and leaves. Grogginess had caused confusion he forgot where he was and what had happened. Then when became more aware of his surroundings he recalled all that had taken place since the night before. He sat there until he was fully awake and able to make clear decisions. His first one was to cry. He didn't stop till his stomach growled.<br>\r\n    Taylor was faced wiith another problem. The fire wood was going to be used to cook with; he hadn't eaten last night. Thirst played a factor to as well. The miserable boy stood up slowly and carried on with small hope of finding his way back to his camp site.<br>\r\n    The 9 year old boy walked onward and onward ingnoring his aching body and his empty stomach. He tried to think about what way he came from and which way he should go, but was unable to concentrate. Several times he stoped beside a tree to cry. \"I want to go home.\" was all he said. It was all he wanted. Each time he would stop he walk another 100 ft before stopping to do so again. Each time would be longer than the other. It wouldn't be till the 12th time his crying would be inturupted by a second partty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Taylor looks back, watching the figure turn smaller, but bigger. Suddenly, Taylor trips over a log, and falls on his knee. Before starting to cry, he says: \"Ouch!!!\" and then, begins to cry. But, how did the log get there? Taylor wonders. He gets up, and brushes the dirt off himself. And starts to run again. By now, the dark figure is HUGE, but tiny aswell, what could it be...

Taylor was shocked at what a toucan would be doing in the forest. Then it scared him that it talked. He sat there with his mouth hung open and hands behind him. He dared not to speak and if he did he didn't know what he would say. \"Can you only scream?\" The toucan said to Taylor. He jumped and flapped his wings as he spoke letting loose of red, orange feathers that were beautiful to all. Taylor didn't answer he only flinched. The toucan only looked at Taylor with his large shiny eyes. It tilted its head and danced around Taylor as it spoke. \"Can you hear me?\" The toucan said again as it jumped on Taylor's legs.<br>\r\n\"     What?\" Taylor asked. He stuttered and it was mistaking for the end of the sentence.<br>\r\n      The toucan moved up Taylor's body to reach his ears. \"I said are can you hear me!\" The toucan yelled into Taylor's ear. <br>\r\n      \"Get off!\" Taylor yelled back. He moved his arms which sent the bird flying off. He landed not too far from Taylor again. \"What are you?\" Taylor asked with a broken voice.  Never had he thought he would ever speak to a toucan.  The colorful bird danced around the small scared boy. It didn\u2019t stop it continued to dance around the boy even when it spoke. <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat do I look like?\u201d The toucan said. <br>\r\n     \u201cA bird\u201d Taylor responded.  The bird finally stopped in front of Taylor to stick its tongue out in a mocking manor. The animated nature of the toucan had brought down Taylor\u2019s fear and turned it into confusion. \u201cBut you talk.\u201d <br>\r\n     \u201cWell I guess that makes me a toucan that can talk.\u201d The toucan said to Taylor as it did a back flip.  Taylor sat there not knowing what to do next.  Silence had taken place between the two. The only actions were that of the toucan whose eyes blinked constantly. It wasn\u2019t till the growl of Taylor\u2019s stomach let a loud growl and roared.  They both stood there waiting for the other to make a comment; no comment would be made until the toucan said something that someone would address Taylor\u2019s hunger, but the mood would not change.<br>\r\nWith no emotion and movement the toucan said \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Taylor\u2019s response would start his adventure.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      Taylor nodded yes seeing no reason why to lie to the so far harmless toucan. Taylor sat there as the toucan flew into a green tree where he landed on a branch that could be seen from Taylor\u2019s view. It made loud calling sound to Taylor before speaking out.<br>\r\n     \u201cWell then come on,\u201d The toucan began \u201cI know a place where you can eat.\u201d Taylor continued to sit there as the toucan made a loud calling sound again. He didn\u2019t move.  Taylor was lost in thought; He had no idea where he was and how he got there.  Know a stranger was telling him to follow him. He had learned that he should never talk to strangers from school, TV. shows, and his parents, but they never prepared him to talk to a strange toucan. He continued to sit there not knowing what to do next. \u201cWell are you coming? If you\u2019re hungry you have to eat.\u201d <br>\r\n     \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Taylor said. He was hungry but hunger couldn\u2019t get rid of his cautious nature. The toucan turned in circle on the tree as Taylor thought. He didn\u2019t know what to do. He was tired and hungry and would really enjoy something to eat, but he was talking to a toucan that had shouldn\u2019t be talking in the first place. \u201cIf I go home I could eat. Could you take me there instead?\u201d <br>\r\n     \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d The toucan asked. The toucan was in no way a harmful creature. It only wanted to help the small boy who needed it.<br>\r\n     \u201cI live in Pinkerton but I\u2019m on a camping trip with my family.\u201d Taylor explained to the bird who flew from tree to tree. <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat\u2019s Pinkerton, what\u2019s a family, and what\u2019s camping.\u201d The toucan asked Taylor. These words were not known to the bird who had spent his life flying his world since he was a baby. To Taylor this meant another obstacle that had to be overcome; hopefully by thou rough explanation Taylor hoped to somehow find his way home.<br>\r\n     \u201cYou know Pinkerton, its my home in the mountains, and camping is when you sleep outside in a tent, and a family\u2026\u201d Taylor said to the toucan that had landed on the ground in the middle of Taylor\u2019s explanation. Taylor was standing and looking to the down to the ground. The toucan stood waiting for Taylor to continue his murky explanation. He had not never ever stood so still nor had he ever been so confused. Taylor stood there thinking of how he would explain a family based on experiences. \u201cA family is the people you live with. They hardly are home, and always make you do things even when you\u2019re scared and you tell them. You do it anyway because\u2026 because they tell you to, and you want them to love you.\u201d Taylor explained. It was silent yet again and again it would be interrupted by the lively toucan.<br>\r\n     \u201cI have no idea what you are talking about.\u201d The toucan said. Taylor let out a sigh and sat by a tree to cry. He thought that he was going to be able to go home. He had often wished that he could get away from home; now he wished that he could go back. He couldn\u2019t stop crying. He was upset, angry, scared, and frustrated. He was upset because of the situation he was in, scared because he was alone in a forest, frustrated because he was unable to communicate with the toucan, and angry because he felt his family was to blame. The toucan may not know much, but emotions were one of the few things he did know.<br>\r\n     \u201cWhy are you crying little one?\u201d The toucan said as he jumped to Taylor\u2019s legs. Taylor\u2019s sobs almost muted the toucan\u2019s words. It tried to touch Taylor with his wing but Taylor threw his hands down to respond.<br>\r\n     \u201cI want to go home. That\u2019s it\u2026 I\u2019m tired, hungry, and dirty. I want to go home but you can\u2019t take me!\u201d Taylor cried. The toucan felt somewhat responsible for Taylor\u2019s current condition. Taylor was to emotional to find one reason why he was crying and months of bottled up emotions had burst out. The toucan was determined though to find a way to help the small boy. He had helped other\u2019s before and never failed.<br>\r\n     \u201cCome with me I know someone who can help.\u201d The toucan said. Taylor stopped his cries to listen. The toucan made eye contact to show how series he was. \u201cCome on little one I know some one who can help you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ignoring the pounding noise rising up in your head, you quickly force yourself up to see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Shadow the Hedgehog! You feel so shocked, its like your whole body is being electrocuted. He stops a short distance away, leaning over slightly as he holds something against a bloody bruise on his chest. He force yourself up as quick as you can, tripping over yourself slightly, and walk closer to him to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get a bit closer, you notice Shadow is looking down with his eyes clenched shut and breathing deeply due to his wound.

You lay him down, his head propped against a small log that you tripped over before, and look at the wound on his chest. You get some water on your two fingers and tap it on the wound a couple of times. The blood stops, but some is still on your fingers from touching it.

After laying Shadow down, covering him with your jacket, you find some leaves and make yourself a bed, not too far away, not too close to the Hedgehog. He might need you, you might need him. Settling down into bed, finally falling asleep, you hear a faint whisper. \"Psst... Psst!\"...You open your eyes quickly to see a dark figure with red eyes staring down at you. \"AAH!\" you scream, deafening the creature. \"Shush!\" the figure shouts. \"It's me! Shadow\" After hearing those words, you are relieved to hear it's a familiar voice. \"Can you dig a hole for me?\" Shadow asks, and you look slightly confused. \"A hole? What do you need one of them for?\" you reply to Shadow. \"Well, I need to...\"</span></div></div>",

He said that she died. Ages ago. But, you tell a lie and respond: \"No, sorry... Maria. I haven't.\"........................\"Oh... Well, that's ok. Hey, what's your name?\" she asks you calmly.
