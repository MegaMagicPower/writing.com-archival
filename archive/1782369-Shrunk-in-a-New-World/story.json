Why would you feel any different now?  You rubbed the sleep out of your eyes, and looked around.  You jumped up in shock.  You were in some kind of jungle!  You then took a second look, and realized that all the trees were huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're not huge...\"  You said, looking down at the ground.  All the grass was about as long as you, and some of it was twice as tall.  You figured that you were only about an inch tall!  You began to panic, and was about to start running around, when your left foot bumped into something.  You looked down to see a book that was the size of books you'd remembered.  You opened it up and began to read from a random page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After all my research, I have found that all of the inhabitants of this strange world are female.  I haven't had much time here anyway, but that seems the only possible way.  And yet, they still multiply.  I can only wonder why.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed the book, even more startled now.  And then, a new thought occurred to you, and you opened it again, reading through it quickly.  Only about a few pages in, it ended, the person writing about being chased by...  Something.  But you had learned one very important detail, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything here was much larger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the book back where you found it, having no way to carry it easily and still travel.  It was then that you finally fully took in your surroundings.  In one direction, you saw a lake of some sort, and off to the left of that looked like some kind of open field, probably a plain of some sort.  You could always go deeper into the jungle, or head out to a more sandy area that you saw to the farther left of the plains.  Probably a desert.  Or you could just stay here for now,and try to figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, you decided what you would do.</span></div></div>",

The other person had apparently been heading that way, so maybe you could find something helpful there.  You began your trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of walking, you'd noticed that the brush had gotten thicker, even though you hadn't been able to go as far as you'd like, because of your new size.  Things would be more dangerous now, because the thick plants would block your view, but not of anything else that might otherwise harm you.  You tried to be more aware of what might be happening around you and hurried your pace along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of walking fast, you finally had to take a rest, or else you'd collapse and have no chance of survival.  You sat down on the ground, in a sort of clearing in the brush.  Then you lay back and looked up into the sky, trying to relax and think things out.  It looked just like it did back home.  Sure, you were far from home, and it was pretty dangerous, but things could have been a lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, I could have ended up in the stomach of some large animal or other creature!  Thank goodness for that, at least.\"  You said out loud, to no one in particular, just enjoying the moment.  But then that ended when you heard a sweet feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's too bad, because it looks like that's going to happen anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up and turned around to see...</span></div></div>",

He had brunette hair and ears, with big blue eyes and breath that smelt as though it hadn't ever been washed. The dumpsters of fish markets smelt better, and he was so sweaty and gross. \"Ahhh...\" He said and lowered you down towards the moist, smelly cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, no! Please let me live!

It was greasier than the fry traps at a fast food restaurant, and smelt worse than a locker room full of unwashed teenage boys. You felt yourself go green as the smell violated your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could do another thing?\" You suggested, choking back vomit. \"You could always be my snack!\" The neko smirked as he held your tiny figure between his finger and thumb. \"No! No!\" You exclaimed, the neko smirked as he brought you to his armpit. The smell only Got worse as you looked at the hair that dripped sweaty sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neko made sure to make your life hell, smearing you all over the bad smelling hair and getting your body all greasy and smelly before sticking you in the bra strap and closing you into a tomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath would be a great alternative at the moment but with no way go do such a thing you were trapped as the neko ran through the humid jungle, making the environment much worse. There was no smell in the world that could compare to that you were joking on, no taste to that of the greasy hair that snaked its way into your mouth, and you could barely move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the neko stopped, but didn't remove you. He seemed to be enjoying torturing your tiny body in his horrid smelling armpit, you felt like crying but opening your mouth was the worst thing you could do so you chose against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, light flooded in and blinded you as the neko removed you. You went uncomfortably close to his mouth as he sniffed you. \"Jeez! You stink, and you still have another armpit to do!\" He said and held up his other arm. You shook your head no, knowing the hell you would Endure if you went in there. \"No? Well you can always be my snack! Or my ass needs cleaned..\"</span></div></div>",

You can talk?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost see a grin on her face.  \"Why yes.  Everything can.  We all speak the Common Tongue.  Of course, most predators as myself wouldn't let their prey know of their presence by speaking to them before hand, but you're so small anyway, it's not like you'll be able to get away.\"  You could hear her purring, knowing that her meal was secured.  You didn't like it, but you really didn't have a choice in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now you're just going to eat me?\"  You asked.  For a reply, you were smacked gently with one of her paws, only knocking you over.  You'd thought it would have hurt more, but you hadn't felt a thing.  You tried to stand up, but her other paw then knocked you backwards.  And every time you tried to stand up, the same thing repeated, knocking you in different directions, until finally you figured that you weren't going to get anywhere with that, and just lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  Giving up already?  But I was having fun.\"  She said mockingly, pretending to be a little disappointed.  She had just been playing with you, and soon everything would be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I offered you a deal?  You show your worth and complete a challenge for me, and maybe I'll let you go free.  Sound good?\"  You could see the hint of a renewed grin.  It was a tempting deal, and there was always a chance that you'd actually survive...  <i>No, since she's just been playing with me up until now, she'd just give me some impossible task, or say that she'd decided not to let me go.  Better just to get things over and done, I guess.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer, but no thanks.  I'd rather just get the inevitable over with.\"  You said, not in the politest tone.  She didn't seemed phased at all, and you heard what almost sounded like a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, have it your way.  I don't usually eat my prey alive, since I'm sure it's worse that way, but since you're depriving me of my fun, I'll take what I can get.\"  She then used her claw to hook onto your shirt and lift you a little ways into the air.  And then, with a swift upward motion, you were flung high into the air, flailing.  You noticed that your shirt had ripped, but it didn't really seem to matter to you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you started coming back down, you looked to see that she had sat down on her haunches, her mouth wide open and head tilted up to catch you, tongue lolling out just a little.  You took a nose dive, and landed right onto the rough, wet surface of the tongue.  It pulled you into the mouth, dripping with lots of saliva, and then darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled you around, across her rough cat tongue, savoring you flavor.  She'd never tasted anything like it.  And you moving increased her pleasure.  She wasn't cruel, and didn't usually eat live prey, as she'd said.  But him depriving her of fun...  Well, he'd asked for it.  So she swallowed, enjoying your struggles as you slid down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know why you struggled against a hopeless situation, but you did, and as you slid through her throat, you felt her purring in satisfaction, obviously enjoying the feeling of live prey squirming as it went down.  You then hit a wall of flesh, and was pushed through it as it opened to accept you, and then plopped into the stomach.  You had thought it would smell really bad, but you didn't smell anything.  Your nose probably wasn't working for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you realized that you were sitting in a pool of acid.  And it wasn't burning you or anything.  Well, your clothes had started to fall apart, but you didn't feel a thing.  And that's when you put 2 and 2 together.  You hadn't felt anything when you'd been smacked around earlier, and now you weren't being burned by the acid.  So your body was invincible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that you should get some rest while you had the chance, you crawled up out of the pool of acid and lay against a stomach wall, falling asleep soon after.  When you woke, obviously several hours later, you were being flushed out of the stomach and down a tube, where you met a large waste build up.  You hadn't been there long when it too was deposited onto the ground.  You sat up and watched the Tigress walk away, not knowing that her prey had gotten out of her alive.  You then climbed out of the pile of crap, and cleaned yourself off in a nearby river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then walked back into the jungle, hoping to find something helpful.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you continued on through the jungle, the plants and brush grew thicker, and closer together.  And it only grew more so until you almost couldn't get through without scraping yourself on some of the surprisingly sharp plant leaves.  However, after a while, you finally made it through one clump, and found yourself in an extremely large clearing.  And in the middle of the clearing, straight ahead, was what looked like a large gathering of houses.  Maybe a village of some sort!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer, you saw that there were some houses built up into the trees as well, and all the ones on the ground were thatch roof, and made of hard baked clay bricks.  When you finally made it to the edge of the closest house, you saw that it was actually larger than you had thought before.  You could see much larger buildings, and stalls, creating alleys.  This village was more like a very old city!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you'd finally gotten close enough to look at a larger area, which seemed to be a marketplace, you were amazed.  There were tons of naked women walking around!  But that wasn't even the most surprising part.  You could see that some of them had snake tails instead of legs.  Others had wings and antenna, and others had tails, cat ears, and even some whiskers, and all of their ears, tails, and hair seemed to match that of a type of cat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until then that you noticed your danger.  One of the cat girls, what looked like an Orange Tabby cat, was walking this way and didn't seem to notice you at all!  She would step on you if you didn't run away.  So you did, right down the nearest alley.  You figured that if you just stayed out of sight and watched them for now, you would be able to decide if they were dangerous to you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was a sound plan, there was one thing you didn't consider.  Whether or not any of the creatures would be in alleyways or not.  And that mistake was going to cost you your entire plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally came to a halt in a darker part of the alley, you stood there catching your breath.  You could go back later, but for now you needed to rest.  Then you felt something cold and scaly wrap itself around you, and yank you in the air.  It held you before a woman's face.  She had pitch black hair, and a fairly attractive face.  When you glanced down, you saw that her breasts weren't very large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.  It would ssseem that Morgana hasss found herssself a tasssty treat.  I don't know what kind of creature you are, but it was sssstupid of you to come to thisss city.  Unless that iss, you intended to be sssomeone'sss sssnack.  In which cassse, you'll be Morgana'ssss.\"  She said to you.  She then opened her mouth to put you in with her tail, as you saw she was one of the snake girls like in the marketplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped that you could figure a way out of this while you delayed for time.  \"Wait!\"  You shouted.  Morgana, looking a little bit surprised, closed her mouth and looked at you.  \"You can't just eat me!\"  You said.  And if she did, you didn't know if you'd get out.  Especially if her intestines worked like a snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?\"  She almost demanded of you.  She seemed intrigued by your argument and would at least hear you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I could offer you so much more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssuch asss...?  Morgana isss poor.  Ssshe cannot afford the luxuriesss of the rich, and never passsessss up a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that was your ticket out of here.  \"W-well, I could please you!  Let me pleasure you, and then...\"  An idea suddenly came to you.  \"And then you could sell me to someone rich!  Charge a lot of money for some kind of rare pet or something, and get enough money to buy something that will fill you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana seemed to actually consider this.  \"And you will pleassssure me?\"  She inquired, glancing at you, a grin on her face.  She seemed to at least like that part of the idea.  You shook your head yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she dropped you into her hand, bringing it down to a small slit in her scales that must have been her vagina.  And then you were plunged in, her hand still on your feet.  She then pulled you out, and then pushed you back in, repeating the process as her speed also increased.  And then she orgasmed, spraying the ground with her vaginal fluids.  She held you back up to her face, your naked body drenched in her love juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana then opened her mouth, and before you could object, you were tossed inside and swirled around in a large amount of saliva.  Just when you'd thought it was all over, you were pressed through her lips, and came out mostly clean and dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not going to eat me?\"  You asked, amazed you'd come back out of her mouth instead of down to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed a fairly hearty laugh.  \"No.  Morgana likess the idea of trading you for money.  And ssssshe knows just who will pay big for sssssomething like you.\"  She then slithered out of the alley and past the market place.  During the trip, you decided to try and get some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you?  And what are all of these other women?  And where exactly is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced down at you for a second.  Then she answered, \"Morgana isss a Naga.  We are sssimilar to sssnakessss in the jungle.  The other creaturesss are Faeriessss and Nekosss.  Nekosss are the cat-like women.  They all have a distinct furr and hair pattern linked to either a jungle cat, or some other feline.  If you'd been found by one of them insssstead of Morgana, if you weren't eaten, you'd have been a play-toy, as like most cats, they love fun.  The Faeriessss are the winged ones with antenna.  Unlike the Nekossss, they have a passsssion for sssswallowing living thingssss, or making them sssssquirm in other ways.  Though that might sssseem cruel, if you are their prey...  Well that isssss the law of the jungle, now isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she stopped, you knew she wouldn't tell you any more.  Even though you hadn't learned much about the Naga, you had learned a good amount about the other 2.  And any information now made you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed at the house Morgana stopped at.  It looked the richest, and was obviously the best in the area, if not th entire city.  \"Now be quiet for Morgana.\"  She whispered, almost a hiss.  She then went up and knocked on the door.  When it opened, a Faerie with blue hair and wings was standing there.  She was very tall, at least a head taller than Morgana, and had fairly large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.  \"Morgana, you know I don't give out freebies.  Either bring something to trade, or leave me alone.\"  She started to close the door when Morgana interjected, \"But Morgana doessss have ssssomething to trade!  Look!\"  She held you out in both hands, showing off her wears to this obviously very rich faerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was wide open again, and the blue faerie was ogling you, quite amazed and intrigued.  \"Doessss Leeria like it?  It issss a rare creature.  And knowing of your passssionssss, I knew that you would be very pleassssed with ssssomething of this ssssort.\"  Morgana seemed very pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\"  Leeria quickly refined herself.  \"You were right to bring him to me.  I would indeed like him for me 'passions'.  I'll give you 50 Gold Eros for him, but no more.\"  It was obvious to you that she would have haggled higher if Morgana had tried, but Morgana didn't seem like the buisiness type, and quickly agreed to the deal.  You were given to the blue faerie, and Morgana slithered away, clutching a fairly hefty bag filled with gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeria closed the door and walked into what seemed like a kitchen, as it had a table and some counters, though you doubt she did much cooking from what you'd heard of the faeries.  She set you down on the table, and then sat down on a chair herself.  She looked at you some more, seemingly fascinated.  You knew that breaking the silence could mean any number of things might happen, but her examination was very awkward, as you tried to fight down the boner that was growing from being close to her naked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to do with me?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Morgana didn't tell you about the faeries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she did.  Does that mean that you're going to-\"  You were cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am going to eat you.  And feel you squirm as you slide down to my gut.\"  Before you could reply to this, she had leaned down and used her tongue to scoop you off of the table and into her mouth.  She swished you around in her saliva, enjoying your flavor.  And then her tongue gave extra special treatment to the member between your legs, and you couldn't hold yourself any longer, releasing your load in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to enjoy this enhanced flavor, and continued to swish you around, rubbing you against her cheeks, adding your own cum to your coating.  And then with no warning, her head tilted back, and you slid down her throat, squirming and trying to climb back up.  And your decent slowed, though not thanks to your efforts.  Leeria had pushed her middle finger up against the lump in her throat that was you, and so you moved even slower, until you passed her collar bone and breasts, and then finally was squeezed out into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved over to the side of her stomach and fell asleep, like you had done before.  When you woke up, you were again being flushed out of a stomach, and into a tube of crap.  And then deposited out of her ass.  You saw that it was quite shapely as she walked away, and then tried to climb out of the pile. However, you tripped and shouted as you fell.  You looked up.  Had she heard you?</span></div></div>",

and brought you to what you thought was her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the book said I'm really smart,I like that part.What other types of girls does it have?\"Feeria asked.Then she placed the book down on the bed next to you and you started to open it up and look at the monsters.You saw so meny different kinds.There were Faeries,Nekos,Slime girls,Nagas,Dridders.Even a Squid girl and Jellyfish girl.It looked like a few hundred.to meny to count right now.But at the start of the book was a story of the man that wrote it.It was about how this man lived in the jungle for about three years.You

Help yourselves to whatever you'd like.\"  Leeria said, then left the room.  All 3 women sat down on a couch right by the coffee table you were on.  You were awed at them, as well as a little scared.  And rightly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm getting a little hungry...\"  Said the pink girl, whose body was slightly transparent, and seemed to be like gelatin.  She must have been Heather, the slime girl.  Morgana, who you recognized, and the woman with her lower half a spider's glanced at each other nervously.  Heather was a slime girl, and slime girl's would, and could, eat anything, since they were made of slime, and thus could shape over their prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgana and Ssssam will go help Leeria with the preparationsss...\"  Morgana hissed nervously, and the dridder nodded in agreement.  They both got off the couch and left the room, no one having taken notice of you, for which you were glad.  But then, as the other two left the room, Heather happened to look down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello, there.\"  She cooed.  You gulped.  This wouldn't end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips.  \"I don't know what you are, but you shouldn't have snuck into Leeria's house.  I mean, she's a Faerie, and they're dangerous predators to any and all creatures small enough to fit in their mouths.  But don't worry.\"  She said, her words enticing you to trust her a little.  \"Heather won't let her eat you.  In fact, I'll help you so that she never even knew you were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pink hand reached down, and you hopped on.  Your feet sunk in a little ways, and you couldn't lift them up.  \"What the-!\"  You exclaimed.  \"But I thought you were going to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant pink slime girl grinned down at you hungrily.  \"I am.  She won't know you were here if I eat you myself.\"  She then brought her hand up to her lips and her tongue stretched out and wrapped around you, pulling you into the cavern of goo as her palm released it's hold on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her mouth wasn't filled with saliva.  Instead, it was just more of the slime that made up her body.  And even when she closed her mouth, you could still see inside because of the low light that came through the translucent goo.  Heather's tongue then unwrapped from you, and began tossing you around.  She enjoyed your taste, and when she eventually swallowed, you were pulled into her slimy esophagus.  When you continued to squirm, your arms got caught in the sides, and it continued to pull you down.  You eventually hit a small crossing, and continued to slide the same tube as before.  The other one probably led to her lungs, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then your feet hit a wall of slime.  You were pushed as it accepted you in, probably right into her stomach.  However, there was no opening in which you fell.  It pushed you into a large area of loosely packed slime, allowing you to float around in the center of the chamber.  Upon investigation, you found you could breath inside it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You see Leeria continue walking away, so she must not have heard you.  You pick yourself up, and find that you're back in the jungle, and a little ways off from the village.  You'd go back later, but first you wanted to get cleaned off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so of walking through the jungle, you come upon a fairly fast moving stream.  You get in and start trying to rub yourself clean, when all of the sudden, the water pulls your feet out from under you, and then you float down the swiftly moving stream.  After only a few minutes, you are at least another hours walk from the village, and still moving.  But because of the strength of the water's floe, you are unable to stop yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stream eventually leads into a cave, before finally stopping in a large, almost lake like, pool farther into the cave.  You swim to the edge and climb out, trying to balance yourself after the ride.  When you can finally stand straight, you sigh.  \"Well, this will be one long walk back to the village...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to walk back to the cave mouth, when you hear a sickeningly sweet female voice.  \"What's the hurry?  Why not stick around for a while.\"  You couldn't resist the temptation, and turned around.  When you saw what had spoken, your mouth dropped agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a giant woman, she was giant to you at least, with silver hair that fell past her shoulders.  You would have mostly been distracted at how larger her breasts looked, but then you saw that she had horns on her head, and a pointed tail swishing around by her legs.  You hadn't realized that she had gotten so close to you, and you tried to take a step back, but the tail lashed out and wrapped around your leg.  It tossed you up into the air, and the woman grabbed you, opening her palm to examine you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange... What exactly are you?  You are similar to a Succubus, or Neko, but with none of our other traits...\"  She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.  \"I'm a human.  I don't know how I got here, but it sounds like there are no other-\"  You were stopped as she placed a finger over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sshh, that's enough.  I don't need to know anything else for what I want to do with you.\"  She grinned down at you seductively, and you shivered.  But not from fear, like you would have thought, but from pleasure.  For some reason the thought of pleasing her was invading it's way into your mind, and pushing everything else out.  You didn't know why, and couldn't really think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, she lowered you to her buxom bottom as she bent over.  She used her other hand to part her cheeks, revealing the puckered brown ass hole.  And then she said, \"Please me as you go in.\"  And then she pushed you forward, your head hitting the opening, as it widened to accept you.  And as you went through, you did as she had said, and wiggled around, trying to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed you in slowly, enjoying your movement in her bowels.  When you were all the way in up to your feet, which she still held into, she started pulling you back out, and you continued to squirm.  You heard her moan in pleasure.  And then you were back to fresh air.  Then she dipped you into the pool of water, and rubbed you a little before you pulling you back out, any traces of her shit gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I want you to please me in another place before we get to the main attraction.\"  She brought you over to her crotch as she sat down, spreading her legs.  And then you were pushed in, her pre-cum and the water on your body making the perfect lubricant.  She pushed you in and let go, making you slide all the way in, and then some.  You wiggled around, your squirms giving her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moved around more, the pink fleshy walls began to become tighter, and covered in even more of her love juice.  You heard her moaning and panting, enjoying this time of pleasure.  And then, a large wave of her cum washed over you, and you were carried with it out of her opening, and onto the cave's stone floor.  You just lay there, exhausted from all of the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could just barely see your giant captor look down at you.  \"What, exhausted already?  Well, I guess that's well enough anyway.  Now we can get on to the best part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... What's that?\"  You asked, still quite tired.  The only thought in your mind was still that of pleasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get to be fed to the succubus that found you, and used you.\"  She said, picking you up.  You only looked on into her hungry maw as her tongue licked her cherry red lips on her near perfect face.  And then you were tossed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swished you around, exalting in your flavor, combined with that of her own juices.   And then her tongue came at your crotch.  It needed to only touch it, and you exploaded, shouting in pleasure of your own.  You were swished around in renewed vigor, the 3rd taste making her orgasm a little again.  And she leaned her head back, and you slid down her throat, and plopped out into her stomach, were you finally fell into a deep sleep...</span></div></div>",

Your only conclusion was that this was where the voice had come from.  And if it had, you most definitely had need for worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-umm, what did you just say?\"  You posed this question, hoping upon anything you could that the creature had meant something other than what you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't hear me?\"  It said, in the same female voice.  \"Then let me spell it out for you.\"  She stuck her head a little closer.  \"I, Rosira, Queen of the Lizards, am going to swallow you whole, and enjoy every minute of you squirming inside of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't obvious enough for you, then you would have to be an idiot.  You now knew that your only chance of not ending up deep in the bowels of this lizardess was to stall, and hope for a chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen of the Lizards? How do the lizards decide who their queen is?  Is there a vote, or are you born into it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  Well, I happen to be the largest of us around, and so the title should obviously go to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA self-proclaimed title, huh?  \"Oh, of course.  And the most beautiful too.  I don't think any other lizard would deserve that title more so than you.  And probably none after ever will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could make out a smug grin on Rosira's lizard face.  \"Smart and knows true beauty when he sees it.  I should hope that you taste as good as you are polite.\"  Her tongue slips out and licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a step closer and you start crawling backwards, trying to get away.  But she matches your pace every bit of the way, only needing to take a few steps.  And before long, you're backed up against a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make another plea.  \"S-surely a queen such as yourself wouldn't settle for something as measly and pathetic like me?  You deserve only the best, the most exotic to dine on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratched the bottom of her jaw, seeming to consider what you said, then taking another glance at you, she shakes her head.  \"Yes, I do deserve the most exotic.  And I've never quite seen a bug like you.  And of course, you're not pathetic.  You're larger than most bugs I eat.  And besides, I just woke up from a nap, and don't really care what, but I want something in my stomach, and you're nice and big, and exotic to boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought you were a bug?  \"A bug?  But I'm not a bug, I'm a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human?  Sounds like some kind of exotic tasting bug to me.  Now, would you stop delaying me, and let me enjoy my snack in peace?  A queen should have her wishes respected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to argue more, but she sticks out her tongue, pressing it against your face, effectively silencing you.  You can no longer see because of the appendage, but you feel her warm sticky breath wash over your body as she puts her mouth over you.  Rosira's lips clamp down on you, and the tongue pulls away, the faint light allowing you to see the inside of her maw in full.  You try to squirm out, hoping that her grip would be lose enough for her to drop you, and maybe you'd be able to out run her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosira then brought her head up, raising it into the sky so that you were now looking down into her throat.  Her grip loosened, and you continued to squirm, forgetting about gravity until it was too late.  Your squirms dislodged you.  Right down into her hungry, gaping throat.  Your head barely brushed the uvula as you tried to push yourself out to stop your decent, but to no avail.  As soon as you hit the esophagus, it pulled you down, carrying you into her awaiting gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you reached your destination, your squirmed for a while, before finally succumbing to exhaustion, and fell asleep.  When you woke up, you were out side again, covered in lizard dung.</span></div></div>",

Her entire body was covered in a layer of <span class=\"clgreen\">light green</span> scales, and she had piercing <span class=\"cbyellow\">yellow</span> eyes that seemed to stare right into your very soul. She also had a long tail and a row of <span class=\"cgreen\">green</span> spikes along her spine. Her appearance was like that of an anthro iguana, but you couldn't help finding her body incredibly sexy. Her large breasts were very alluring, and her figure in general was absolutely flawless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered what she just said to you; this sexy lizard girl was going to eat you! You immediately turn to try and run, but the lizard girl simply lashed out her tail and wrapped it around your minuscule body. She then lifted you off the ground with her tail and dropped you into the palm of her scaly hand. Staring at you with a predatory gaze, the lizard girl hungrily ran her tongue around her lips. You were absolutely terrified by her now. You couldn't believe that this figure of beauty was about to eat you alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Miss, I'm begging you! Please don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but you look like such a cute and delectable little morsel... Don't worry though, I'll try to make this quick and painless for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Anything but that! Please, I don't want to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were utterly horrified. At this point you had begun to burst into tears. Your life was about to be cut tragically short by this lizard girl, and there was absolutely nothing that you could do about it. As she held you over her mouth, however, the lizard girl began to have second thoughts. Was it truly okay to end the life of such a defenseless creature? Sure she had eaten many other prey just like him in the past, but this was the first time that her prey was actually a sentient being. After carefully thinking it over, she decided that it really wouldn't be fair. If this small creature was capable of rational thought, then his life shouldn't be hers to take. Placing her trembling and teary-eyed prey back onto the ground below her, she decided to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little guy, I guess that I'll let you go... I'm sorry for scaring you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her in shock, you wonder what it was that brought about this change of heart. As scared as you were of her, the fact that she decided not to eat you might mean that she wasn't all that bad after all. Nervously, you decide to approach her and speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Miss... But why are you just letting me go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought about how you must have felt. You're the first prey I've ever caught that was able to think like I can. If you're capable of the same thoughts and emotions as me, then it really wouldn't be fair for me to just eat you like a common mouse. Your life is yours to live, little guy. I don't have any right to steal that from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really mean that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Just because I'm cold blooded doesn't mean that I have a cold heart! I'm willing to be merciful to you, so you should probably be on your way now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Miss. I really appreciate this, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, I'm not actually from around here... I don't know anything about this place, and I could probably use some help to stay safe. Would it be okay if I stayed with you for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to come with me? After I just tried to eat you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you<i> didn't</i> eat me! I can tell that you're a kind person deep down. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess... But are you sure about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think that we can become great friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really would be my friend? Alright little guy, it's a deal! My name is Elizabeth, but everyone just calls me Lizzy. And who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Steven, and it's really nice to meet you Lizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\nHaving managed to befriend the lizard girl, Lizzy, you happily climb up into the palm of her hand.

That terrible fact was reality too in that tiny island where the house of the powerful Athessa, the sorcerer, lives and command over all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day she was hunting for her prey, how usual nothing what she see could escape of her lethal talons, and the insignificant creature that she capture though small was sufficient for be a small snack. For some reason that creature was capable of talk, possibly some traveler of other world, but she definitively don\u2019t care for that, after all she is one of the biggest magic users in the world of Urihwazji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith regal authority she have decided make her pet of this diminutive mortal, no why she like him but how a manner for make her exile here a few more tolerable, centuries of loneliness has male her seriously miss have person to command and control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Well insignificant thing, I have decided that you will be my pet - She exclaims al the human in the floor with great decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after that for make her point more clear, she use her powers for invoke a small birdcage from thin air. This cage what was floating in middle of the air and before the human could say something flash of light take him from the floor and transport him in a blinking to the interior of his golden prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t tell me, little pet what this is so much better than be my lunch, from now you will owe me how your goddess, obey me how your queen and please without end.- she says with deep vanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little creature dares to talk her for say his name but she ignores his pathetic words <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2013 Doing something what you say- She respond with sarcasm, and before the human talk again she continues: - If you don\u2019t understand I am now your owner, I have the power for call you in the way what I prefers and I say that your new name is Uzisha that mean \u201cLittle slave\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little human clearly understand and don\u2019t argues with the massive bird, what immediately make notice to the sorcerer that she has don\u2019t analyze his new pet. In a instant take the small cage in her hand and look with analytical eye to the small animal in the inside.<br>\r\nFor some reason that thing have some type of second skin over his body what immediately make her order to the human some explanations. For the next hour she make hundreds of questions of what the majority of the answers don\u2019 interest much to her but when she hears about something called masculinity she order him to sayy everething he knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little human try of explain her in the better way home things works in his world, apparently in his world the species of animals are divided in the half for two opposite types of beings, one the female can create new life form her own flesh, like here in Urihwazji but for that was necessary the intervention of a second type of being what after a ritual called sex make possibly the generation of descendents.<br>\r\nAthessa at beginning was seriously skeptics of all that but to remember what the human say what that second skin only cloth, what make her have a small idea.<br>\r\nIn a blink with her magic crack of her fingers the clothes of the human disappear for discover if truth in the words of this diminutive \u201cmale\u201d.  For her surprise what he describes with weird words like \u201cpenis\u201d and \u201ctesticles\u201d was completely exact.<br>\r\nFor some reason in her cold mind com e some thoughts what she have never have in her life, with a big smile in farc face she says for herself.<br>\r\n-Apparently keep this little human how my pet will be better that I suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day has be so strange for you, the first you know what you are in a other dimension only populated for females for subsequently be captured for a crazy sorcerer what apparently will make you her pet for the rest of your natural life. <br>\r\nBut talk with that witch only have make you felt more and more desperate but the fact that you now are naked make you see the situation even more dark and haplessly.<br>\r\nIn your gloomy thought you don\u2019t give much attention to your owner but after a long silence you hear a series of words what for reason put you in a state of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Apparently keep this little human how my pet will be better that I suspected. \u2013says the bird in a sweet tone what is clear was saying for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any delay you raise your eyes to her face at the same time that her was looking to you.

You couldn't quite figure out what it was, so you decided you wanted a closer look, and soon.  Anything to relieve your boredom.  So you started running as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes of running, you had to slow down to catch your breath.  You could now see that it was a large animal on fairly tall legs.  And after a little bit more time walking, you finally identified it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large brown horse.  You figured it was as safe as anything else to try and get a closer, much closer, look, so you plowed ahead.  And after another 10 minutes, you had finally made it to the large beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a few glances at the towering mammal to identify it was female, like that journal had said everything here was.  Though you weren't sure why.  And you also admired how, despite the fact this animal was quite obviously a wild horse, it's coat seemed to gleam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a beautiful creature...\" You trailed off, not knowing what else to say, or even if you should say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you.\"  You heard as the horse turned and looked down at you.  If she hadn't noticed you before, it was fairly obvious she did now.  And then the realization, and the shock that came with it, hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk?!  How-\"  You started but were cut off as the horse looked down at  you dubiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can talk.  Everything here talks the same.  And I can talk for the same reasons you can.\"  You just stared, dumb-founded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it would seem that in your stupor, you forgot to introduce yourself.  So tell me, what <i>is</i> your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question jumped you back to reality.  If this could be called that.  \"Oh, well, my name is [your name here].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't say it's been a pleasure meeting you.  Yet.  But my name is Serene.\"  She said.  Then she took a step toward you, which you didn't really take notice of.  But then as she got closer, you started to be afraid.  This Serene was a whole lot larger than you, and could easily do anything she wanted to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then bent down her head and whispered something, but despite how close her head was to you,  you weren't able to make out what you said.  You looked up at her, questioningly, and could make out a sheepish grin, filled heavily with mischief, on her long face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to under stand that you hadn't heard her, so she repeated herself, slightly louder.  \"I said earlier that it wasn't yet a pleasure to meet you.  But as I'm sure you know is a rule of this world, the large have their way with the small.  And since I'm so much larger than you, I think I'd like to give both of us a new experience.\"  Her tongue came out and licked around her large, thick lips, allowing you to see the also large, square teeth in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it dawned on you what she had planned.  And you didn't like it one little bit.  \"W-w-wait!  Isn't there something else I could do for you?  Something that would be just as satisfying?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe seemed to think it over.  \"Well, there is something...\"  You were overjoyed that she wasn't going to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything, just name it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'd like you to come open a Water Gourd for me.  They're supposed to have the most delicious drink inside of them, but whenever I try to crack open the soft outside, it just busts and all the water goes into the ground before I can get any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head in agreement, and started climbing her leg to get to her back.  When you were half way up her leg, she started into a gallop, and you had to hold onto thick fur coat to not fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a short while, covering a very large distance, you came to a small cluster of trees, and Serene stopped.  You slid down her leg, and looked around.  There, only a few paces from you, was a very, very large gourd, with what looked like a very tough exterior.  However, upon further inspection, it was quite soft, which gave you an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and quickly found a twig that seemed sturdy enough to work as some kind of knife.  You then climbed up to where the gourd walls started to grow closer together.  You then stuck your twig knife in, and the shell cut like butter.  It took you a little while, but you eventually made it all the way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then tossed away the twig and pushed, removing the lid you had created.  And then you put one final shove with all your effort, and it was onto the ground.  But you had accidentally leaned to far in, and you tumbled over the edge of the now bowl of water, making a small splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resurfaced to see Serene looking down thirstily, and hungrily, at the bowl you had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, I helped open your gourd.  Would you mind helping me out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Serene lick her lips, and grin.  \"Yes.  Yes, of course I'll get you out of that gourd bowl.  And into my stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock was obvious on your face.  \"But you said that if I helped you get this open you'd not eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I never said anything of the like.  I just asked if you'd do this, and you agreed.  Besides, I had intended to do this from the start.  I've eaten small creatures about your size before, so if we're both going to have a new experience, it has to be a little different.  And I've never drank a Water Gourd with my prey in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she was upon you.  Her snout was in the water, sucking it in.  And then the undercurrent pulled you under.  You were able to open your eyes to watch what was happening.  You saw yourself pass her large teeth, and then darkness.  You were carried along with the current of water down her rather large, long throat.</span></div></div>",

But despite your efforts, you are still pulled along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although you didn't know it, your course wouldn't be what you, or even Serene, thought.  Because of the strong pull of the rushing sweet water in her throat, you would end up in Serene's bladder, instead of in her stomach, and thus avoid digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the water finally entered a large chamber, which you thought was the stomach, you fell a little ways into the deep pool forming inside.  When you resurfaced, you were covered in not only the sweet water, but now a foul smelling liquid as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to cover your nose.  <i>Ugh, this smells like horse pee...</i>  You thought.  And then reality set in.  By some miracle, you had been saved from digestion.  Now all you had to do was wait until she peed, and you'd be able to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for several hours, treading the foul stuff in order to stay afloat.  But then finally, you felt a new current being formed from below.  You knew it was time, and dived down, hoping to get out with the current as well.  And soon enough, you had been pulled into the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a few minutes to reach the waterfall of urine that she was releasing, and then you splashed through it, landing in a puddle of urine, but glad to be out of her body.  Serene finishes her buisiness, splashing you with some more yellow liquid, and then walks away, never knowing that you had escaped feeding her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around a little bit and find a stream to wash off in.  When you finally think that you've washed the stench away, you see that it's getting dark now, and you'd need a good place to spend the night.  However, you realize there are no trees to climb into, or anything like that, so you just walk on for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it's finally too dark for you to see, you decide to just sleep out here in the grass.  So you lay down, the grass providing some protection from being seen, and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know, that something else would be making you it's midnight snack.</span></div></div>",

From the strange sounds of what might be animals of some kind, there might be some creatures that you do not want to find you. After all, you had no idea what this strange world was. For all you knew, the inhabitants could be hostile. But according to the book, all the inhabitants were female. That made you interested and then you flipped the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise however, the book depicted all manner of animalistic creatures that walked upright. The images looked primitively draw but from the shape of the figures, they were definitely female, of some sort. But from the looks of it, they weren't human. You flip through the drawings and see over 52 images of the female inhabitants but none of them look remotely human. Each one seems to resemble a different animal of some sort. Felines, canines, heavy mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and even some creatures that resembled mythological and extinct animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see a book to see what looked like a hierarchy with red, green, white and blue figures at the top, but you couldn't see clearly what type of creatures they were because the page was blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear strange sounds almost like that of a bell and look around. At your current height, the trees were the size of skyscrapers and there were moon sized fruit that looked like the fruit on Earth but were colored differently than usual and had strange markings on them. Even the grass was as tall as trees and there were strange crystalline rocks everywhere. Before you can say a word, you hear a rumbling and freeze in fear. The rumbling gets louder and closer and then you look up to see one of these giant anthro amazons looking down at you and from the looks of it, she was at least ten feet tall and obese. Since you were shrunk to one inch tall, she was absolutely massive compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers her head to get a better look at your tiny form and you see she is a ginormous...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The giantess lowering herself down to get a closer look was a 15ft tall anthropomorphic hippopotamus. She was absolutely massive to an inch high shrunken human like you. Fitting a hippopotamus, she was massively fat with a 20ft belly, H-cup breasts and a 25ft wide butt. She had gold-colored skin with long blonde hair and rainbow-colored tribal tattoos on her arms and the sides of her face. She wore a tiara that looked like it was made out a jawbone of another hippopotamus along with a pair of amber earrings, a green tank top and a green thong with white stars on it that looked like it was tattooed to her massive behind. She also had a large knife tied to her thigh, which meant she was clearly a warrior woman. You definitely don\u2019t think letting her see you would be a good idea, so you run underneath her large belly as she\u2019s looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gold hippopotamus giantess puts her knee to the ground, sure that she saw something and then rubs her chins. You managed to sneak out from right behind her and then you stare at how colossal her butt was. Sure, it was natural for a hippopotamus to have such an enormous rear, but hers was totally enormous. It looked like it could knock down trees. You then decide to take a look into the book and there depicts a page with a hippopotamus woman wearing armor like a tribal warrior. You decide to read the book to yourself to get a good idea of what you\u2019re up again. \u201cDo not venture into the territory of the hippozons. They are a race of warrior women ruled by an indomitable queen larger and heavier than the others. No man who ventures into the territory of these giantesses has ever returned. As such, it is unknown if the hippozons are hostile or not. What is known is that they are a tribe of hunters.\u201d That large gold hippo woman must be a hunter, or even the hippo queen. You remember that hippopotami were territorial, temperamental and could bite people in half when enraged. Perhaps sticking around the giant golden hippo was not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ground begins to shake again and then you look up and see another giantess walking up to the queen. She was a copper-skinned hippo who looked like she was as big as the gold one. She had long black hair and wore a a red-orange vest worn with no shirt or bra and what looked like a turquoise loincloth. From what you saw, the copper hippopotamus worn nothing underneath her loincloth, leaving her lower half exposed from below. She was also carrying a quiver with a bow and arrows inside and there was a red-orange tattoo of a hippo\u2019s foot over her left eye. The gold hippo lifted her head and then spoke with the copper hippo. However, you had no idea what they were saying because they were speaking in a language that you couldn\u2019t identify. They did not appear to be hostile towards one another. They were clearly from the same tribe because from what you could see on their right butt cheeks, they had tattoos that depicted a pair of disembodied hippo jaws that carried the sun in their mouth. You then look back in the book. \u201cThere are three types of hippozon that are regularly seen patrolling the outskirts of their village, the queen is depicted as any of the three types but it varies from queen to queen. The three types of hippozon are brawlers, archers and... sorceresses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard more stomping and then you look up to see another massive hippo woman stepping over you. She had silver skin and blue and red vein tattoos on certain parts of her body with blood red hair worn in a ponytail bun. She wore gold bracelets on her right wrist and ankle and what looked like a bikini made out of dinosaur bones. She spoke with the gold and copper hippos and as she was speaking, you saw she had the same butt tattoo that they did. You suspect that this silver hippo giantess was a sorceress. After the hippozons are done with their conversation, they walk off in different directions. Their combined vibrations shaking the ground and causing you to fall. You see a shadow over you and realize it is a hippo giantess's foot. You scream and roll out of the way, alerting the hippo giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything else, you feel a pair of tree-sized fingers plucking you and pulling you into the air screaming. You look and see the hippo giantess who picked you up. She was...</span></div></div>",
