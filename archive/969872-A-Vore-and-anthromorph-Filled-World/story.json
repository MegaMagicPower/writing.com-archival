He enjoyed all the  games that the children played.  Especially hide-and-go-eat.  Zyas himself had invented that game.  He would look for the children and eat them when we found them. Some furries, like Zyas, had two stomachs.  The two stomachs were a mutation in some furries and scalies. One stomach was meant for storage and the other stomach was for digestion.  The stomach for storage was quite useful in hiding Christmas gifts, which those furries and scallies did every Christmas.  Some furries got into the habit of putting people in the storage stomach, which a select few humans actually liked. The storage stomach wasn't much bigger than a human stomach.  However, the storage stomach can hold up to 4 fully grown humans (depending on the species..dragons usually can hold much more than 4 humans in its storage stomach).  <br>\r\n      \"Let's play hide-and-go-eat\" said Zyas.<br>\r\n      \"Ohh!  Do let's!\" yelled Alexander.<br>\r\n      \"I'm counting to 10\" said Zyas. <br>\r\n       \"Give us a little more time this time!\" said Peter.<br>\r\n         \"Okay\" chuckled Zyas.  \"I'm gonna count to....</span></div></div>",

I'll give you a little more time.\"  Julie said \"Ok, but you have to do a head stand and close your eyes while I get down.\"  As soon as Zyas was standing on his head, Julie started to move from her hiding place, but she slipped!  She fell head first into Zyas' butt!

By sitting while Julie is in his butt, he was pushing her further in.  When Zyas' butt started to touch the ground, he had to push her feet in because they wouldn't go deeper.

All the wolf had to do was follow his nose, sure enough a few feet away, in a bush the boy snickered as the wolf passed by, acting as if he had not seen or heard the boy. He quickly turned around, and grabbed Peter by the scruff of the neck of the t-shirt he was wearing. \u201cGot\u2019cha.\u201d The predatory grin on Zyas\u2019s face, told the boy his captor would enjoy this. <br>\r\n    \u201cJust do it already.\u201d The boy shouted in anticipation, Zyas completely agreed, lifting the boy up, placing his feet in his mouth, but stopped short when he noticed a peculiar bulge in the boy\u2019s pants. Zyas smiled even more and pulled the boy\u2019s feet out of his mouth.<br>\r\n    \u201cI notice how much you enjoy this, and I\u2019d like to know are you sure you want to go down my mouth, I mean I have other places to put you.\u201d<br>\r\n    \u201cLike where?\u201d Peter asked, puzzled.

Zyas winked befor gulping the feet down. Peter felt the strong throat grab his ankles and pull. The wolf swallowed again, Peters knees just outside the throat. Another gulp and the legs were just a large bulge in the wolfs thick neck. Peter looked at the soft, red interior of the wolfs jaws. Zyas swallowed again and more of the boy dissapleaded. By now the feet were just outside the entrance to the wolfs belly, and with another powerfull gulp and they were shoved inside. The girl that had been pulled in through the other end was also being pushed into the stomach from the other side. Zyas titled his head back and let gravity finish the job. Peters head slipped into the wolfs throat and all he could feel was the warm, wet massage of being swallowed. At last he plopped into the wolfs gut, just as the girl was shoved up from bellow. He let out a load belch and rubbed his greatly bloated gut, licking the last of Peters flavor from his muzzle.

Whether Human or Anthro, the early teenage years are hormone crazy, and neither of you are an exception. When Peter points at your cock, the thought of him wriggling down it causes an involuntary spasm of pleasure. His eyes follow it, mouth slightly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not visible beneath your fur, you blush heavily at the entire situation. Hide-and-Eat was fun for you because your predatory nature could be satisfied without anyone dying. The idea of Peter, his friend who you have spent many days playing with, someone who is just a couple of years younger than you, sliding down your member and into your ballsac, is fun in a completely different way. But still, slightly predatory nonetheless. You decide to take a hold of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" you start, swaying in what you hope is a non-chalant way (which only causes your rod to sway back and forth infront of the horny teenager) \"I caught you...\" Peter nods, \"so I get to eat you.\" Peter nods harder. You calmly reach down and fondle your balls in front of him. \"Do you want to go in here, Peter?\" Peter's head seems to almost fly off with the speed he is nodding. He also moans slightly, his hand reaching into his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin at the sight. The boy is completely smitten with you, and his arousal is blindingly strong.

After licking Roger enough, he pulled Roger's head towards his mouth. \"Don't struggle and I won't cut you with my teeth.\" Karu then opened his mouth wide and pushed Roger's head inside it. Roger's eyes opened and he looked sleepy. He saw strands of saliva coming down from the roof and a large pink area around him. He also saw a hole at the back of teh room. He then felt Karu's breath and realized where he was. He struggled and Karu bit lightly on him, drawing a little blood. Roger stopped. Karu's mouth closed on his head and shoulders gently. Karu sucked on Roger a while before swallowing, taking in the chest and some of Roger's upper stomach. Roger worried but knew that Karu didn't seem to want to chop him up, so he relaxed and let the throat massage him. He felt a strong movement and his waist and stomach felt wet. They were in Karu's mouth. Karu was having a great time. He never knew humans tasted so well. He swallowed again, bringing in Roger's knees. With only the lower legs outside Karu's mouth, Roger had surrendered. He was actually beginning to like the small sounds of a heartbeat, the warmth and the massage. Karu noticed this and decided his belly needed filling. He swallowed again, leaving only the feet outside. Roger's head began to poke into his stomach. He licked the feet and swallowed, sending them to join the trail to his stomach. A bulge traveled down his throat and vanished. His stomach bulged slightly. It was heard to notice it because since most dragons' stomachs were naturally round, no one noticed if they bulged slightly. He rubbed his stomach triumphantly. <br>\r\n    \"No one will ever know!\" Karu said. Unknown to him, </span></div></div>",

Karu thought quick and grabbed Bill, pinning his arms to his side. Bill started crying and screaming. \"let me go! let me go! You--\" (a series of expletives have been deleted for taste) \"--DRAGON! You killed him! You killed him, you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Bill, I didn't kill him.\" Karu said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked up confused, confused and angry, into the slitted eyes of his captor.

Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill's face said he understood, but his mortified lack-of-an-answer let Karu continue. \"What? Do you not? Here, listen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaru held Bill's ear to his stomach, at the midriff, just as he had done for his last meal. In his ears Karu heard Roger yell something from his gut. The dragon laughed at the great timing Roger proved himself to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was as white as moonlight when Karu reprieved him from listening to his friend. \"You see, Bill, you have released in me a side that used to be hidden. Dormant, I guess you could say. Am I an animal? Are you justified in hating me, fearing me now? No. It only works that way because of you're twisted mind. It's called self-fulfilling prophecy-we just learned about his in psych class. Of course, it's only full-filling MY self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill didn't thing it was funny. But Karu did. He loved his now quite captive audience. He cocked his dragon-ear to his stomach. \"What's that, Roger? You're lonely? Well, we can fix that, now, can't we, Bill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaru reacted very quickly when Bill inhaled sharply. He immediatly stuffed Bill's head in his mouth and let Bill scream his lungs out, the sound muffled inside his gullet. Karu shoved Bill down forcefull, clothes and all, tilting his head back and letting the entire length of his body enter quickly. Karu pressed on the heels of Bill's shoes so as to force Bill down his throat. Karu closed his mouth and gulped loudly, feeling a nice pressure in his stomach, which now shoved his shirt upwards and strained the fly button on his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaru pat his stomach satisfied and realeased a nice belch when he vacantly stared at the restroom Bill emerged from - there was his girlfriend, the one he was making out with in the stall. Clearly horrified, and clearly stuck as a six-and-a-half foot tall dragon with a now satisfied and pudgy gut blocked her only exit. Tears stained her makeup and her revealing clothes weren't straightened from Bill's groping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaru stared at her, and realized he had a choice to make.</span></span></div></div>",

Her head is at about chest level, at line with the last bit of your shirt on the top of your rounded belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand moves up to her throat, and you let one claw graze her neck, gently.

In all of her actions, every limb and every breath, she is willing; there is no struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move a palm up to her rouge-stained cheek, but then you move your thumb and cover her mouth, your fingers gripping on her face.

You even consider releasing her when the second taste invades your mouth--bitter. A chemical taste. Her makeup, thick on her eyes. You remember these tinted eyes, always just behind Bill. Always laughing with him, stroking him, supporting him. And your determination returns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face covers your tongue except for the tip, which you hook around and tickles the bottom of her chin. Your hands encompass her middle, and you use leverage to shove her deeper into your throat. The top of her head is in your gullet now, and her shoulders are at your lips. Your mouth expands, and the feeling is familiar - your body has become accustomed to the feeling. Her flesh slides over your teeth, her body enveloped in the warmth of your maw. Her knees gather together, and rest on the top curve of your stomach. You rub your tongue over her midriff in a swishing fashion. You feel air being shifted where her head is, just behind your heart. She\u2019s ticklish. You\u2019d laugh if you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou imagine her head in your esophagus, and wonder what your heartbeat sounds like to her. You shove her down further, and then you encounter a problem\u2026 She doesn\u2019t seem to fit. She seems to have just entered your stomach, to join in with Bill and Roger.

You instantly clap you handclaws over the end of your muzzle and freeze up, hoping with all your hope that no one heard that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second your sure that no one's coming, and you turn around and get your pants. It occurs to you that after a court ruling two years ago, herps like you--without pronounced external sex organs--weren't required to wear clothes at all, after a judge threw out an indecency charge on a gecko.

This makes you check the beltloops, and you find--and remember--that you had always kept a belt with these jeans, you'd just forgotten about them! What luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(By the end of the day, however, you'd prove to be much luckier than that.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sinch the belt underneath your stomach, and try and pull the shirt down over it, but it doesn't go, no matter how you struggle. You still look ridiculous, with you giant, round, disproportionately-large stomach before you, making you look like your two years pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't cover up your belly, you'll just have to pretend it's not there, churning away at three other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door proved the first problem; in fact, all doors would prove problematic, but that's cutting ahead. You finally shove your way out the door and into the hall--you move out and away from the locker room,so that when the bell rings in about thirty seconds it won't look like your coming from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander the halls 'till your in another wing; a straight shot of classrooms both before you and behind you.

He panicked, he knew that Roger was trying to call for help. Karu was thinking of what to do. Then he saw a sink on wall right by him. His plan was clear as day, he was going to have to drown Roger. Karu put his head under the sink, opened his mouth wide and turn on the handle. Water was pouring into his mouth and down his throat. After a couple of minuets Karu turned it off. He could hear the water in his stomach swishing around and Roger gasping for air. The bulge in his stomach was just a little bigger but still no one would notice.

Sayla reached over to the small tin box that she kept on a small shelf in the cave she lived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cave, but it was not the typical dark and dank version most people were familiar with. Instead, the flooring and the walls were covered with a magically cultivated moss that acted like carpet, and there were large orbs that functioned as lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Sayla was disappointed to see that her box was empty,\"oh that's right; I ate the last one for dinner last night.\" Another growl of protest from her abdomin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayal stood up and moved to the mouth of the cave, \"Well,\" she said licking her lips,\" there IS a city near here within an brief walk. I'll just go restock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearby city had been her supply of food for the last couple of months; Sayla was very good at finding ways to discreetly make a few residents vanish here and there without causing suspicion; and contrary to what one might think of her size, a kitsune only needed a little bit of food to be satiated, though many still enjoyed a hearty feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Sayla longed to just go for a rampage within the city limits, tear houses apart and snatch her prey from within. There were many other cities, she thought, no one would miss one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she reminded herself that other kitsunes might be staking them out, and wouldn't appreciate her hunting in their territory. </span></div></div>",

Once the furries came into the world and made peace with the humans and started to live amongst them, Ryan changed his name to human name so he would fit into society better. He is one of the most friendliest fur you would ever meet, that's why sometimes he goes down to the park and plays with the children their and the children love him, but some parents try to keep their kids away from him because their afraid that he might eat them whole. Sometimes he thinks their right to be afraid because before he changed his name and started to live like a human he would attack and eat humans, he trys to forget of his past at his best and pretend like it never happened. Now lets start the story. Ryan's alarm clock had just went off(8:00)he open his eye's just a little and turn the alarm off, he pushed the covers off him and sat on the edge the bed and let out a loud yawn and stretched his arms. Then he got out bed and walked down the hallway to his bathroom. Ryan lived in a pretty nice apartment close to the top floor. Once he got into the bathroom he stepped into the shower, he had to to stand sideways a little because of his wings. Once he was done taking he stepped out of it, he got dressed, he put a white t-shirt and black cargo pants on. Then he went to his sink and brushed his teeth. After he was done he went into his kitchen and ate a beagle for breakfast. Suddenly his phone rang, he picked it up and answered it like this. \" Hello, Ryan speaking,\" he answered \"Ryan it's Janet, I'm the mother of Katie,\" Katie was one of kids that he would play with at the park. \"Me and my husband are going out to dinner and we need you to watch the her for us. Oh, and Katie has some of her friends with her so you don't you don't mind if theres a few extra kids right?\" she asked \"No not at all,\" he responds \"Great so can you?\" she asked.</span></div></div>",

Ryan hung up the phone and grabbed a bag of chips, he then went and sat on the couch in his living room and turned on the tv, waiting for them to come. After a hour the doorbell rang, Ryan got up and and walked to the door. Once he opened the door he saw Janet and all the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE KIDS<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nKatie, age 9<br>\r\nJake, age 8<br>\r\nAlex, age 9(girl)<br>\r\nPeter, age 10<br>\r\nJessica, age 8<br>\r\nEmily, age 10<br>\r\nTimmy, age 9<br>\r\nNoah, age 9<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryley!\" They all yell in joy and rush up to hug him. For fun the kids liked calling him Ryley. \"Okay kids, now be good to Mr. Ryan,\" Janet tells them. \"Don't worry mommy we'll be good,\" Katie says as she hugs her mom. \"I'll be back soon,\" Janet says as she walks out the door. Ryan then walked over to the couch and kids follow him onto the couch, some of them had a little trouble climbing onto the couch because it was a little bigger than a normal human couch. Once all the kids were on they all leaned against Ryan like if he were some sort of giant teddy bear. \"So what do you guys want to do?\" he asks. \"I want to go to the park that we always play at,\" Jessica says as she placed her head on Ryan's stomach and looking up at him with a smile. \"Yeah, the park,\" Timmy agreed. \"No lets stay here,\" Peter suggests. \"That sounds good,\" Jake agreed. \"Come on everyone let Ryley decide what we are going to do,\" Alex said. Ryan thinks about it for a while.</span></div></div>",

As they walked up to the building, Rich looked around and didnt see any1 walking around, no other buildings, the only thing he could see was some sort of runway running along side the building in front of them.  When they got to the side, they wlked beside the building until they came up to a hatch in the side of the building with a keypad next to it.  Rei quickly typed the code in, there was a hiss from the hatch as the pressure equalised.  She opened the hatch and stepped inside.  just as she said \"mind the step\" rick nearly tripped and fell over the bottom of the hatch.  Rei shut it and and made sure it was pressurized.  \"Okay, just follow me\"  Rei lead him towards a ladder and they moved up to the second floor, they walked down the corridor to the next ladder.  this place looks whole lot bigger on the inside thought Rich, but he felt nervous and watched, of course, he was, everyone here seemed to be a fur or a scales, no humans.  After going through another 3 hatches they reached the second ladder and climed up it, at the top was another hatch, Rei opened it and Rich was amazed to see a huge room, there was tree levels, he was standing at the top, it was like something out of battlestar galactica, there was numerous consoles, one officer (a fur or a scale) at each one, at the center was a table, with a holographic map of Khan's palace, there was one dragon about as tall as Rei on one side talking to 2 furs and one scale on the other side, pointing now and again at a certain point.  Richard guessed this was the guy in charge.  Rei walked Rich down to the center and saluted the dragon \"welocome back Lietenant Rei\" repied the dragon, his voice was soft, but there was something about the way he talks which resonates that he's been to hell and back.  \"So this is our new recuit\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\"  \"Wait new recuit\" interupted Rich<br>\r\n\"Well if you haven't noticed, there are no humans in the resistance so far, so we send out some people to ask around a bit, that's how we got known really\" replied the Dragon<br>\r\n\"So I'm gonna be the first human in the resistance?\"<br>\r\nBoth Rei and the dragon nod<br>\r\n\"where acn i start!\" repies Richard</span></div></div>",

Listening intently, Rick dont recognise any of the names of things you're going to use but you decide to go along with it anyway.  \"He'll be transferred to the Dragus as soon as we can, so make sure you train him fast.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" Lupus anknowleged, and lead you to a room which must be the living quarters.<br>\r\n\"You'll be living here throughout your time on the Bretonia, I also live here and so does Rei, we'll all be in the same squad\"<br>\r\n\"OK, but I've noticed there is some other bunks,\" seeing there are five other beds there must be more than just the three of them<br>\r\n\"Yes there others, you'll meet them later\"<br>\r\nRick follow Lupus out of the room and he realise that he went down more ladders than you went up, upon this he realises that most of this base must be underground.

His uncle was rather pale and old looking, but he was a tall man, standing at 6'4\", with a slightly chubby stomach. <br>\r\n    \"Excellent job my nephew, I'm quite proud of your efforts to capture the murderers of Zeshix...he was our best commander in the Khanate Guard, the only one better then you, if I recall correctly...I guess this means you inherit his place as the Supreme Khanate Commander...\" Rubik said.<br>\r\n    \"Yes, uncle Rubik, my Khan, I accept this position with honor and will due to my best to use it responsibly.\" Kagen said.<br>\r\n    \"Very good, you are dismissed.\" Rubik said. Kagen nodded, walking out of the throne room.<br>\r\n    Kagen threw a cloak over himself as he walked through the streets after he left the palace of Khanate City, the capital of the world. He entered an alley, and knocked on a brick wall. A brick pulled back and two eyes peered out at him.<br>\r\n    \"Password?\" a dark voice said.<br>\r\n    \"12312315.\" Kagen said.<br>\r\n    \"Correct.\" the voice said, closing the eyehole, and the brick wall pulled back, revealing a thin passage with a staircase at the other end. Kagen walked in and descended, walking into a subterranean room.<br>\r\n    \"Greetings, my Khan.\" a man with a cybernetic arm who was bald said bowing to Kagen, who removed his cloak.<br>\r\n    \"Hello General Garshin, how goes the retirement?\" Kagen said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n    \"In the words of the commoner, it sucks ass!\" Garshin said. \"But once you succeed, I can enjoy another 20 years of command in the army!\"<br>\r\n    Kagen nodded. \"Yes, of course, you've picked the right side, Garshin.\" Kagen walked over and sat down at a table. At the table was a large black dragon, 11 feet tall, a man eater. His forked tongue slid out.<br>\r\n    \"Greetings Commander Draco.\" Kagen said. Draco nodded, quickly replying.<br>\r\n    \"We are gathered here today...\" Kagen said removing his cloak, his pale face being revealed, \"to discuss the plans of the transfer of authority that will occur in about 9 months. The first stage, eliminating our top rival, Zeshix, is complete. I have framed a few of his guards with his murder.\" <br>\r\n    Several applauds were heard.<br>\r\n    \"Now...who is here? Anthro Commander Draco...Infantry Commander Mazumo?\" Kagen glanced at the \"Desert Tiger\" Commander Mazumo, an anthro tiger who had served Rubik greatly in the Desert Rebellion. \"Armor Division Commander Erwik?\" He glanced at a commander who wore metal armor on much of his body, the head of the tank divisions.<br>\r\n    \"And last but not least, General Garshin. Now, our only main opposition is the head of the Khan's Guard, Commander Javil, and the Airforce Commander, Commander Heliek.\"<br>\r\n    After some conversation, Kagen shared his plans.<br>\r\n    \"Now my noble allies, our plan is simple. Much of the Khanate Guard supports us. They want me to take power from my uncle and bring the Western Continents(North and South America in the current day) under the full control from the East once more! Rubik is a fool, he gave them almost full independence and only held a few major cities over there. All they had to do to agree was swear allegiance to the Khanate!\" Kagen said.<br>\r\n    \"On New Year's Eve, 2315, we will attack my uncle Rubik while he is outside during the ceremony. We will ambush his private guards before the ceremony and replace them with our own. As Rubik is about to proclaim a new year of his rule, we ambush him, and assume power. Then the other details can be made clear, as the world will be ours...as well as the colonies on Mars, the Moon and Phobos, but that's not important.\"<br>\r\n    After the meeting was concluded, Kagen smiled evilly as he began his trek towards the Palace.</span></div></div>",

So in she goes, being careful to not to think how much the door slamming behind her sounds like the cutoff of any escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The man has some questions ...  \"You just came over here on the spur of the moment? ... Just to be neighborly? ...  Nobody sent you? ...  They don't know you are here?...\"  All of which Julie answers with yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You really shouldn't have done that, Julie.  Haven't you heard all the stories about furries eating people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh, I never pay any attention to slander like that.  You couldn't do a thing like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Of course I could.  See how large my mouth can stretch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, you would have to stretch lots of other things too.  It just can't happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It seems there is only one way to convince you...\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, the bearish furry picks her up and starts to remove her sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hey, stop that!  I'm just here to be neighborly, not to make love with you.\"  Julie vigorously protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No worry there.  Your clothes just interfere with the taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You're lying.  You're just trying to get in my pants.

His tongue on her face muffles even more what she tries to say.  As he starts to swallow, her head reaches his throat and she can speak, but he is clearly not listening.  Instead her shoulders and breasts [quite nicely sized for her age.  She had become a cheerleader in part to show them off.] enter his mouth.  Julies attempts at objecting increase greatly as her boobs are caressed by his tongue.  Making her even more indignant is that she is not finding this contact entirely displeasing.  Nor is it entirely a relief for her when her chest enters the throat and she is free of that contact.<br>\r\n   But for good or ill her hips are now entering his mouth, and more sensitive parts of her body are exposed to that tongue.  Her protests redouble, with no effect, other than to let her refuse to notice any enjoyment she might be having.  And to let her insist as she is swallowed deeper that her hands are not really playing with her pussy, just pushed here and there by the tongue and other flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now she is starting into the stomach.  Her 1st thought is that she is getting a little room to move around.  The tube had been skin tight, and by comparison, the stomach looks huge.  She soon realizes that is just by comparison.  It must stretch to accomodate her and she finds herself forced into a ball shape by the stomach walls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A massive \"earthquake\" hits her as her captor moves around, apparently getting comfortable on the sofa.  \"Convinced now?\" she hears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Julie would like to deny it, but the evidence that a furry can eat people is all around her.  Still, that doesn't mean she is completely wrong.  Just because they can doesn't mean they actually hurt people.  That wouldn't be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Y..yes.

Isn't there another way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The somewhat puzzled pop answers \"Yes, several, but this is easiest.  What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"He can look up my dre...er, my towel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I guess he would, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But I don't like it.  I don't want to be a cheap thrill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, it won't be that much harder, I suppose...  Alright, lean forward and stick your hand out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now Andrew, open way wide...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As she sticks her hand in Andrew's mouth, Julie is surprised to not be worried about this.  At least not as much as she would have thought reasonable.  But here she is, more worried about the hand keeping the towel in place than the hand that is out of sight.  She gets more worried as her arm vanishes and Andrew's mouth gets close to her face, but it still has more to do with her approaching loss of towel than possible loss of life.  Having been eaten before seems to have calmed her down a lot.<br>\r\n   Now she can't see anything but Andrew's throat, and is thankful Andrew seems to have recently used a breath mint.<br>\r\n   \"OK, stick your other arm in, and then down his throat.\"  She does, and is thankful the towel stays up for the moment.  Andrew resumes swallowing, but as her face hits his tonsils, the way seems blocked.  \"Now stretch your arms to the side as best you can.\" <br>\r\n   It seems impossible given how tightly she is stuck here, but she tries, and is surprised to manage some success.  Somehow she has managed to stretch Andrew's throat enough that her head now passes into his throat and starts down towards the stomach.<br>\r\n  She feels the towel loosen, and then fall off.  But this time, neither this, nor Andrew grabbing her to position her better for swallowing seems to really bother.  Instead she continues to push her hands down the tube and then push them apart in a vaguely swimming motion.  <br>\r\n   Surprisingly, Andrew licking her breasts is more ticklish than sexist.  And his doing the same to her pussy also seems pleasant.  Enough so that she begins to worry that she is enjoying herself entirely too much.  <br>\r\n    But now she is entering the stomach.  Again, she does what pushing she can, but seems to be coming to a stop.  Faintly, she hears a command to fold into a ball, which she tries, and finds she can manage.  She pushes in several directions and makes several twists, and she ends up hugging her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As she hears his dad congratulate Andrew, she calls out.  \"Sir, you were going to tell me how to avoid being digested by a furry..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh right...\"   </span></div></div>",

It's has to be with someone I love!\"  Certainly she doesn't want to do it to avoid being digested.  However practical that might be, that makes her a whore and a slut.  It just would not do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Julie hears a disappointed \"Aw...\" from Andrew, but Andrew's dad seems accepting of this.  \"No reason it has to be now, tho the sooner the better.  Why just date Andrew a bit?  I'm sure you'll find him a fine lad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But...\"  Julie is finding it hard to put her objections into words.  She may be a virgin, but she has no real attachment to that state.  She is not interested in being holding out for the perfect lad.  But that definitely does not mean hopping into bed with just anybody.  And a \"date\" or two with Andrew just seems like a way to disguise that she would be selling herself.<br>\r\n   Still...

Her bouncing around in Andrew's belly produces a gentle massage.  But what follows is not so great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Tell me about yourself, Andrew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What are your classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The subjects make Julie's head hurt just to listen to the course titles.  She is hardly a dumb blond, but she has a t-shirt at home that asks \"Why use my head when I can use these?\"  It seems a good philosophy.  Her classes are pretty much the gut courses everybody passes by showing up for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A bit worried, she switches to hobbies.  The chess club?  D&amp;D?  What is that?  A roleplaying game?  She is still lost.  Clearly dorkdom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   If this were a normal situation, she would dump him on the spot, gently of course.  Not his fault he is a hopeless nerd.  And he is a little cute.  But why waste her and his time on such a hopeless prospect?  But this is hardly a normal case, and even if she didn't want to give him every chance, she is not going to dump him until she is out of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But what chance is there for a relationship when the only thing they have in common is that it's comfortable in his belly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Does he go to movies?  clubs?  Well, how about sports?  Doesn't play any?  Why not?  He'd do great on the football team for starters.  Fuzzies are too good or too bad for any given sport?  So they are not allowed to play?  That doesn't sound fair.  <br>\r\n   Andrew insists it is.  You want a close contest in a sport, and that's not the case when it is fuzzy vs human, or fuzzy vs a different type of fuzzy for that matter.  Lots of fuzzies way bigger than he is and so he would still not get to play if fuzzies were allowed to play.  He might be able to play in a special league for fuzzies of his type, but there aren't many fuzzies of a given type, and less interested in a given game. So he is stuck on the sidelines.  It still sounds unfair to Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    However, it seems Andrew is into sports statistics, and has some definite opinions about some of your favorite players, opinions Julie sharply disagrees with.  An argument may not be her favorite means of communication, but it does beat having nothing to say, and she is a bit surprised when his dad comes in to say time is up.  A moment later she is sitting on the floor of a rather dull room.  But getting to a shower, and out of male sight, makes looking around not an option.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She takes longer to shower this time.  When she is done, her clothes are waiting.  As she dresses, she considers what she is going to tell her parents about her \"date\" this evening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He's kinda cute and she had enjoyed their conversation, but that's hardly enough to jump into bed with him, even if she knew him a lot better.  Should she even be in a situation where sex was a thinkable result?<br>\r\n   And that is even before considering the fuzzy element.  It is just so wrong to say \"I won't sleep with you because you are a fuzzy\", but he eats people.  Well, so far only her, but does that make it better? or worse?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But it is too late to cut and run now as the door opens and Julie is confronted by a 3rd bearish fuzzy, this one clearly female.  [Odd how female fuzzies are so much more human than males, but Julie has no idea why this happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm ...Julie.  I came by to ... study with Andrew.\"  Looking at the lady's smile, Julie can't help recalling her husband's [?] mouth opening wide to engulf her.  Could she even get out a scream if this fuzzy attacked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Of course.  We are glad to see you.  Come right in.  You know where Andrew is?\" the woman asks someone over her shoulder.  \"I'm Cheryl by the way.  You look like a nice girl.  I hope you come by at dinner time next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now how to take that?  Under the circumstances, any reference dinner has to cause worry.  Of course, the reference to next time does imply she will survive this time, which is not certain.  Rather likely.  If Andrew wanted to digest her, he had missed his best chance already.  He still could, but she should be safe ... should be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hi Andrew.  I'm here to study.\" [Never too early to tell a man he is not getting something for nothing.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A normal journey, but distinctly different.  This is going to be her 1st evening alone with a male where something might happen.  A very small might, but still a might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I can have your assignments done in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Leaving an hour for \"other things\", and if he does her homework for her, she is going to be in a weak position to object to those other things.  Boring as homework is, she is not about to sell out, at least not that cheaply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That would be cheating.  Why don't we just check each other's work and you can help me with the hard parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In other words, nothing doing, but of course males are always hopeful she doesn't mean that and so he agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   An hour later, Julie is a bit worried her plan has backfired.  It seems Andrew is unexpectedly talented at explaining things.  She has to stop him at times for being too technical, but he is able to explain things well enough for her to get the point.  Technically she may have done the homework, but Andrew has made her understand it.  In some ways, she owes him more than if he had just done the homework.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But he is still someone she barely knows, much less loves.  She just is not going to put out so fast, no matter how sensible it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Fortunately there is a reasonable, if rather weird,<br>\r\n alternative...  \"OK Andrew, time for your throat stretching exercises.\"  And she starts to take off her clothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew is pleased to watch, until he sees that Julie is wearing a bikini under her outer clothes.  She overrides his objections with \"I'm sorry, but I am just not comfortable in the nude yet.  Maybe next time.  Surely it won't hurt my flavor that much, and you are mostly trying to stretch your throat anyway.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Good.

Then he places them in his mouth, and starts swallowing.  Her trim young legs are soon in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Julie soon learns why Andrew's dad suggested she be eaten feet first last time.  When it comes time to stretch Andrew's throat again, her legs are much more powerful than her arms and she is able to do her duty much easier.<br>\r\n   This allows her to feel Andrew licking her legs, an rather enjoyable process, until he runs out of leg, and Julie finds that the bikini is not much protection after all...   Not that it isn't enjoyable then too.  In fact it is more so, but just the same...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Stop that!\"  An order Andrew ignores, as well as the repetitions.  Julie resorts to \"I am telling you Stop! for the last time!\", a moment before she recalls the joke response \"I knew you would weaken.\".  However, Andrew does stop, a response that Julie finds herself a bit disappointed about.  True, she doesn't want him being too free with her body, but it was enjoyable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   However, now Andrew swallows her trim hips and works his way up her flat belly and onto her mounds.  A single \"Andrew\" keeps him from lingering overlong on them.  Her shoulders are quickly consumed, and then Julie is looking out of a circle of flesh that rapidly closes around her extended arms.  A moment later, she feels them pulled into Andrew's mouth too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Then she is in the stomach and again being curled into a ball.  So now there is little to do but talk until Andrew lets her out, or digests her...</span></div></div>",

Maybe she has not got a really hot figure yet, but she is well worth the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But as she showers, she considers her basic problem.  She has got to become immune to digestion.  She has been spending all too much time in stomachs for there to be an alternative.  But the only means she knows of to do that is to have sex with Andrew, and she is not about to do him at all that casually.

Trouble is, she might well really die...  <br>\r\n   It wouldn't be near so bad, might even be great, if she knew Andrew better and liked him more.  But how to manage that?<br>\r\n   Maybe if they had more interests in common...<br>\r\n   Hmm... Andrew mentioned chess and a game called Dungeons and Dragons.  Chess seems out.  Julie knows the rules and has played a bit, but it doesn't thrill her.  But this other game, she has no real idea what it is.  It might be worth a try...<br>\r\n    Or maybe get Andrew involved in her activities.

She had been alone with a boy and had stripped right in front of him.  Then she had laid down on his bed and let him eat her. And she was thinking of balling him.  Yeah, like that was going to fly...<br>\r\n   So she sticks to the innocent facts, and insists nothing happened.  Homework just took a little longer than expected.  It wasn't that much of a lie when one came down to it.  For all the fact she had been in his belly, the contact wasn't really that much different than if she had just been sitting in the room with him.  She hadn't so much as given him a friendly kiss yet.  And if she intended a lot more than a kiss, that was still some time off, and a lot had to change before that became reality.  And it wasn't like they had not been doing the same thing when they were her age... Well, she didn't know that.  But they didn't spout any nonsense about being virgins when they got married.<br>\r\n   Of course Andrew could just keep her in his stomach and digest her some night, but that is probably no worse a danger than some auto accident.  She is a friend and surely Andrew would not digest a friend any more than she would hurt Fluffy, even if she is fairly indifferent to the fate of other cats.  She should be safe enough.  But try to convince her parents of that.  Much better they stay ignorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Eventually the \"discussion\" dies down.  Her parents have no real idea of her actual sins and so promises to pay more attention to the clock in the future are enough to soothe things over, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So off to her room, where she can rest for classes tomorrow, or maybe get online to find out more about fuzzy-human relations...</span></div></div>",

And if the stories they have heard are true, failing at keeping the fuzzy off the squad would be very dangerous.  So it is best to put up with it, especially if it can actually be useful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, another lifter would be useful...\"  Indeed so.  A good half the stunts they would do require someone to lift or carry another, and to accept that the one lifted got all the cheers.  Hmm... maybe this fuzzy could be quite useful with the grunt work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Good.\"  Julie agrees as she turns to the fuzzy.  \"Andrew, can you lift Payton, Amber, and me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Huh, oh sure.\"  Collectively the girls are quite a load for a human, but for all the muscles of a bear, Andrew expects to have little problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, get down so we can climb on...Now get back up and .... abort!\"  Carrying the weight of the girls is, as expected, no serious problem, but there is the problem of balance.  Get the center of gravity a little off center and ... gravity takes over and Andrew comes crashing down.  The girls, all used to stunts going wrong, jump off with no problems, but Andrew lands rather heavily, to some unkind remarks from the rest of the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hmm, ...  We had best work up to 3 girls.  This time, try it with just me...\"  Andrew is quickly able to handle this, and Payton is added to the program, successfully on the 2nd try.  <br>\r\n   But the addition of Amber takes quite a bit more work.  Surprisingly, Julie quickly identifies the problem.  Andrew and Amber are focusing on each other rather than the job.  Amber deems him cute and Andrew is thinking that she smells delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Less than a week ago, Julie would have been trying to insist there was nothing wrong with the relationship.  After she was so bluntly shown the nature of the fuzzy, she would have been horrified that her best friend was so innocently putting herself in danger of becoming a warm spot in Andrew's belly.  But now she finds herself jealous.  Andrew is her's, and no hussy should be trying to steal him.<br>\r\n   If she were a little more alert, she might be pleased.  In some way Andrew had passed a test that made him allowable boyfriend material, a test neither had realized he was taking and that Julie has only a vague idea of what standards she used.  But she doesn't need to know the standards, only the result.  And that is that she likes Andrew, and in ways her parents would not approve of.<br>\r\n   For now tho, she must forget the emotions, and tell the 2 of them to pay attention to the job at hand.  And that is enough to get them working on the same wavelength, and the stunt comes together.  The result is not spectacular, but definitely a good addition to their program.  And now that Andrew is accepted, she should be able to create some really great stunts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But as practice breaks up, Julie doesn't like the way Andrew is eying Amber.  He is just looking too hungry.  He had better get something in his belly before he starts thinking of misbehaving...  Not that Andrew would actually eat Amber, but just the same it is best to eliminate the urge...<br>\r\n   \"Andrew, you could use a snack.  Go thru that door over there and I'll be with you in a minute...\"<br>\r\n   It of course takes more like 5 minutes to deal with this and that, but eventually she is alone with Andrew and stripping so he can eat her.  Again she considers how quickly being eaten has changed from unthinkable horror to a routine chore.  Nor does she worry about removing clothing in front of Andrew.  Instead she gets undressed quickly and lifts a leg to put it into Andrew's waiting maw.  All entirely calm as she is gulped down.<br>\r\n  Well not entirely.  Andrew's licking of her hips draws protests of course, but not the sort that will quickly stop him.  <br>\r\n   It is the opening and closing of the door that does.<br>\r\n   Looking up, Julie has time to wonder how she would react if she were the one coming in and seeing clothes scattered around and her best friend naked with a boy, one that is eating her whole and alive to boot.  <br>\r\n    Amber standing there open mouthed in shock doesn't seem too bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But Julie needs to decide what to do herself.</span></div></div>",

She really wishes she could have sounded real cool, but maybe she should be proud she got out anything that made sense.  And she did get to show Amber she isn't naked.  Not really anyway.  Of course her prude of a mother would never let her wear this bikini, but it did cover some of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amber tho is starting to recover \"But he is eating you.\"  Indeed, he had not stopped and and is now close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Right.  Stay cool.  He'll spit me out in a few minutes..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amber is less than fully convinced, but just watches in horrified fascination as the rest of Julie vanishes into Andrew.  Then she asks the obvious, if perhaps silly, question of Andrew  \"Is she....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Julie answers \"I'm fine.  No problem a quick bath won't cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Julie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Sure.  I'm just here in his belly.

But right now, Amber must be assured everything is safe, and if a lie is necessary...  So when Andrew starts to make a comment that sound suspiciously like he is going to claim he can eat Amber too, Julie gives him a kick in the stomach wall.  Given the muscle she hits, she really doubts she hurts him at all, but it seems to work well enough in stopping Andrew from talking long enough for her to jump in with a change of subject.  \"I'm only going to be in here a few minutes before I have to get out for a shower, so better hurry up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amber is still horrified, but can't stop herself from moving forward, very hesitantly, and then putting a hand on Andrew's huge belly.  Julie is able to grasp it from her side.  Not exactly a strong grip, indeed just barely enough for Amber to even realize something was trying to hold onto her.  But with her state of nerves, quite enough to cause her to jerk back and take several scared steps away from Andrew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now, now.  No need to be nervous.  I was just trying to shake hands.  Give it another try.\"  But Amber has had quite enough, and stays back.  \"Well, we got to get to the D&amp;D game, so time to spit me out Andrew.\"<br>\r\n  Andrew quickly deposits her on the floor, where Julie announces \"Got to take a shower for sure.

She should stay alone in a room with a carnivore able to eat her alive?  leaving, at a high rate of speed, seems the only sensible idea.  <br>\r\n   But somehow she can't.  There is something terribly fascinating about Andrew and this terrible vore ability.  She recalls stories about how snakes can fascinate their prey, even causing them to feed themselves to the snake.  She had always felt this was just a myth, but now she is no longer so sure of that.  No matter how hard she reminds herself of the danger, she can't get herself to move away from Andrew.  Maybe she can excuse herself as simply rigid with fright, but why is there this feeling that if he ordered her to approach, she would stuff herself in his mouth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   To break this spell, she tries asking Andrew about his vore ability.  He responds with information, which Amber barely hears.  Her mind continues to fill with terrifying pictures of Andrew grabbing her and shoving her into his maw.  Terrifying, but somehow fascinating.  <br>\r\n   She greets Julie's return with relief [and disappointment?] And quickly promises to get together with Julie and Andrew in the future as she leaves.  As she makes the promise, she realizes she means it.  Her hope that she is escaping vanishes. That is terrifying, and attractive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As the other girl vanishes, Julie lets out a sigh of relief.  \"That didn't go so bad.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"True\", Andrew responds \"But it is not over yet.  She is too interested.  I may end up eating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You had better not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It will make things a lot easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You are just thinking with your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"maybe, but she is going to want to learn more, and why not show her everything by eating her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Julie can hardly say that she is starting to think of Andrew as boyfriend and vore as a distinctly personal act, one bordering on betrayal if he were to eat another girl,  but it takes time to think of alternate reasons.  \"Well, we have time to consider the matter.

One of the cliches of the game is that we always get attacked by bandits, and our DM is not the most original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I don't always have it first thing ... But yes, I did this time.  Everybody roll their spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Spot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew explains \"You roll a d20, higher the better, and then add your bonus to spot.  That's this line here..   Hey DM, can she roll her listen instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Nope.  By the time she gets close enough to hear, she will be too close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, roll\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"A 7.  What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That you are cheerfully walking along thinking about your boyfriend instead of the risk of the trail.  You have no idea what is about to happen.  What did the rest of you roll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Several apparently have rolled well, and the DM places several figures on the board and announces they are attacking.  He calls for initiative rolls [This time, Julie rolls much higher].<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, surprise round.  Heloise, you are surprised and don't act.  Nor does ...  1st up is..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The process is rather bewildering to Julie. The player or the DM announces what the character is doing, some dice are mysteriously rolled, and results are announced.  Julie is confused as to what these results are, but from the atmosphere at the table, things are going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, round 1.  Thoral is up, and then Heloise.\"  Another lad goes thru the ritual, and then it is her turn.  \"Andrew, what do I do?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, you can move 40', so you can move to here, and then attack that figure.  Since you are a barbarian, you should rage 1st of course.  That makes you more powerful, but easier to hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Then roll that d20, and roll high\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"A 3?  I suppose that is not good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Correct.  You move up to the bandit and swing and miss badly.  The bandit is up next and swings back, not being a gentleman.  12 and your AC is  ??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ah... 16.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No, it's 14 because you raged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Which means he hits and you can kick Andrew for giving you bad advice. You take ..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Comparing her hp figure with the damage, Julie can see Heloise is hurt bad.  \"Ouch\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The battle continues.  Presently a player moves his figure to the figure of Heloise and her foe.  He rolls and announces \"15+2 for flank, thanks Heloise, and ..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yup, that hits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And I do\" pausing to roll several dice \"14\" damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hurts him, but he is still there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The round continues.  Julie notes that several figures get removed from the table.  Apparently her side is doing well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Heloise, you are up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh, I attack again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Right, roll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"9?  Will that hit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Let's see.  +1 BAB, +6 str, +2 for the flank.  No, just misses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You forgot the +1 for bard song.\" Andrew puts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Then you hit.  Roll Damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"How do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Roll the d12 and add ... 10\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"8..+10 = 18\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And he drops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I didn't kill him, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This produces considerable laughter, and suggestions of better classes for Julie in the future.  But the DM assures her her victim is still alive, tho badly hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The round continues, and the rest of the bandit figures are one by one pronounced defeated and removed.  Victory is declared and someone asks \"Who is hurt?  And how much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I am, and so is this man I hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"He attacked us, and he can take his chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But we can't just let him die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"We can, but if you want, I'll do a heal check...Made it.  Ok, he is stable.  Now I heal you and you can stand guard over the prisoner while we loot the bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"OK, make a search roll, everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Soon the DM is reading a document he says the party has found.  Apparently it has meaning to the others, who regard it as reason to forget the dungeon and go somewhere else, after some enemy of their's she thinks.  Anyway, the party is off in a new direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But then she is asked by the DM.  \"So what do you want to do with your prisoner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   There are several suggestions, some deadly.  Julie objects \"But we can't just kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Several assure her they certainly can.  He attacked, and there is no convenient law to turn him in to.  But they are willing to indulge her.  They will leave him just tied up, or they can take him along if she wants to guard him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

They quickly reduce the odds, dropping 2 of her foes, and Julie's next roll removes the one she had wounded.  \"Told you it wasn't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Not so fast.

I'll pass out gold and experience.  Julie, you will be 2nd level next time, so you need to select another character level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What should I select?\" she asks Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Probably another level of barbarian, but there are alternatives.  We will have to do some shopping too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, thanks for letting me play.  I had a good time.\"</span></div></div>",

At least she tries to tell herself she is quickly stripping.  To Andrew, it seems that the garments are removed at a speed more related to how much he enjoys their removal than to any difficulty in removing them.  He enjoys the process quite a bit and is distinctly excited as Julie finishes and extends her legs for dining.  As usual, she is quite tasty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Julie, however, gets quite testy once she feels his tongue exploring forbidden territory.  At first she isn't sure she should tell him to stop, but it quickly becomes clear he is not going to stop otherwise and however likely she will be ready for this soon, she is not yet, and Andrew gets a rap on the nose [learning, if not how to please a lady, at least that there are advantages to eating her head first.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Surprisingly, the study goes rather well despite being in a dark belly.  Much of her work can be recited from her memory and Andrew can correct her by checking the written text.  Soon it is time to be spit out, take a shower and head home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As she does, she starts to give Andrew a kiss, and then realizes what that will imply.  For a moment, she draws back, fearful of that future, but it is the future she has chosen for herself, and she is not going to let simple fright get in her way.  If she is ready, she should be Ready!  And so Andrew gets a Kiss! [including a hug that would have strangled a mere human male] instead of a kiss.  It leaves the lad too bewildered to do anything before she is out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Julie in the meantime is worrying about how many questions her family will ask.  And about what to do about Amber.</span></div></div>",

What is going on?  What is he like? What? ...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fortunately they are merely bothersome questions rather than suspicious ones.  More worried parents might wonder just why she keeps mentioning that she and he are always under escorted conditions when nobody is really asking that sort of question that often.  Nor do they pick up that Andrew's description has a number of rather large gaps in it.  Saying he is an honor student, plays chess and D&amp;D, and uses his computer doesn't mention the physical side.  Saying that he is bigger than her, but needs to grow a lot to match his father is correct, but a bit odd to say, unless you are trying not to say he is already bigger than most adult human males.  Eventually, the meal, and the questions, comes to an end and she can escape to her room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The next day is more cheerleader practice, and Julie is quite pleased at how well their routine is falling into place.  They should make quite a show at the game.  Less pleasing is the interaction between Andrew and Amber.  She just can't seem to leave him alone.  At times, she seems scared of him, but she seems drawn to him as well.  Not a situation she at all approves of.  He is her property.  However, for the moment, she can only concentrate on the act, and has to wait until afterwards to deal with the situation.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Which turns out to be too late.  \"Amber wants to study with us tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But...\"  But what can she really say that is a valid excuse?  Saying she wants to be alone with her boy means admitting he is her boy, which is altogether the wrong thing to tell any lad at this sort of point.  So she is not alone as she enters Andrew's home this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As she says hi to Andrew's father, she hears a frantic gasping from Amber.  Turning, she sees the lass has the wide, engrossed eyes of a horror show victim about to die messily.  She can't take her eyes off the huge bear-man.  Julie realizes she has almost forgotten what a sight he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, well, you got your first meal here Andrew.  And she looks to be fine dining too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Amber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes, see how she looks, classic food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But you can't eat Amber!\"  Julie protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Somebody's going to.  She just can't stay away from furries that will eat her.  Might as well be Andrew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There is at least something to his claim.  Amber is making no effort to flee out the still open door behind her, terrified as she looks.  It will be up to Julie to save her, a task that might result in her being eaten too. </span></div></div>",

That she will call the cops?  She is not even sure it is illegal.  It ought to be, but... That she will scream?  That will likely result in a double meal.  Suddenly she realizes how vulnerable she is too.  In a few minutes, she could be nothing but calories if she makes them mad. <br>\r\n   Besides, Amber is a slut after her boy.  Removing that bimbo from competition has got to be a good thing, doesn't it?  [The back of her mind tells her she is being a bit unfair describing Amber this way, but the basic definition of slut is any girl who would go after your boy if you don't stop her and a bimbo is any girl your boy looks like he might go after if you didn't stop him. Seems a fairly solid case.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But Amber is a friend, and she looks so vulnerable...  No, she can't let Amber get digested without doing something.  \"look, her folks know she is here [Keep quiet Amber.  Don't mention your folks have no idea where you are.]  They could raise a fuss.  So could mine.  Wouldn't it be better to wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hmm...  Maybe.  I wouldn't like Andrew to miss out on a delicious meal like her, and some furry is going to spot her soon...  What would you suggest?  I don't want her wandering around loose for even a week when she is as ripe as she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"How about after the game Friday?  There will be lots of partying then, and nobody will notice if she and Andrew go off somewhere, or that only Andrew comes back.\"  Julie notes to herself how weird it sounds to be discussing Amber's being eaten alive, even making an appointment for her to be consumed, right in front of her.  But Friday is not today.  And right now Amber is just not able to do anything to save herself.  By Friday, maybe she will have woken up.  Even just enough to stay away from Andrew Friday night would be enough.  OK, it's not a dramatic, principled defense, but it might work.  Surely that counts for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    For a moment, she can only wonder.  Then Andrew's father announces.  \"That's a little far in the future, but there are all these people so prejudiced against our lifestyle.  I suppose keeping it a little quiet is best.  Andrew.  You will have to wait until Friday for your meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Julie can only make a sigh of relief.  Then she tows Amber up to Andrew's room.  <br>\r\n   As an evening of study, it is a disaster.  Amber is constantly distracted by Andrew's mere presence.  If she would just cower in the corner like one would expect, at least Julie and Andrew could study, but Amber is a moth attracted to a flame, and must constantly approach Andrew even as she tries to go away.  She is constantly interrupting things to bring Andrew's attention to her.  By the end of the session, Julie is feeling guilty about wishing that she had not interfered with Amber's being eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In any case, she is in no mood to spend some time in Andrew's belly, and says so before she recalls that there is an alternative meal present.  When Andrew asks \"Amber, why don't I eat you?\", Julie is unable to come up with a reason she can voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amber can't come up with the willing to even start to remove.  Instead, having seen that Julie had striped when eaten, she starts removing her clothing, her scared face centered on Andrew's [who was looking somewhat lower].  Her stripping reveals a fine figure [Julie tells herself her's is better, but...], which Andrew admires for a moment.  Then he tells her to approach, which she does, in a high state of panic. <br>\r\n   But when she gets a foot from him, Andrew almost jokingly says \"Climb in\" and opens his huge mouth.  To the surprise of all three, she does, shoving her head into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amber is the first to recover, to the extent of being able to act at all.  Still horrified, she continues to do as ordered and thrusts herself deeper until she forces Andrew to swallow.  The boy is bemused, but willing to just see how things go.  <br>\r\n    Julie, however, is more conflicted.  She can't stand what she is seeing, and since she can't stop it..  \"Amber, here.  Shove your arm in.  You'll make room for yourself to slide in.\"  Amber takes the advice and soon her magnificent twin orbs are in Andrew's mouth, where they are eagerly welcomed...<br>\r\n   \"Andrew!  That's out of line!\" is Julie's objection, but Amber does not second it.  Instead she is feeling her panic vanish as she is being so completely tasted.  With increase confidence she inserts her other arm into Andrew's throat and wiggles on down, to Andrew's disappointment, but to her own growing pleasure.  As she works her way down, it is like a all-over massage.  <br>\r\n   As her hips enter, Andrew again behaves in a ungentlemanly fashion, setting off a set of giggles from Amber, and more objections from Julie.  More to keep the peace than from any distress, Amber wiggles until her hips squeeze into the throat.  But Andrew has clearly started something.  As she pulls herself on down and feels her legs slide in, she is feeling something else, something growing.  As she feels her feet enter, and Andrew closing his mouth, she climaxes, and gives a happy sigh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Amber?\"  A worried Julie asks.  \"Are you alright in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Fine.  You know.  This is the first time I haven't been scared to death since I saw you and Andrew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That's nonsense!  If he doesn't let you out, you will be nothing but meat within an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I guess, but somehow that doesn't seem so important.  It's so comfortable here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Dad was right.  She is really ripe.\" is Andrew's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ripe?  What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You humans are ripe when you are eager to be eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ridiculous!  Nobody can want to be food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, you saw her.  I suppose you could say she just loses her will to resist, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Amber.  You don't want to be food, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well... no...\"  It is not exactly the ringing denial one would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Will she recover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I suppose it is possible.  Not that it is going to happen often.  We furries are on the lookout for easy meals like her, and even if ripeness is temporary, she isn't likely to last until it is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Saving Amber is going to be even harder than Julie thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has found scads of information about furries, much of it contradictory, and often enough asserted as absolute fact anyway, but the idea that a furrie could eat someone, spit her out and have sex with her and then she would be immune to being digested is just absent.  It is not even listed as a myth [and some of the myths she finds are things she knows to be fact.]  One problem is that whenever she includes sex in the search, most of the sites that are suggested are porn.  After achieving an extremely red face a time or two, Julie manages to leave most of them before things get too explicit.  <br>\r\n   Not all of them.  Some just didn't want to let her leave.

She is not so sure she can actually look at it enough to understand without suffering a fatal blush, but she marks a couple of sites to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But she finds nothing dealing with her immediate problem.  She will try again, but she will have to try elsewhere.  But where will that be?</span></div></div>",

But it will be embarrassing asking him.  It would be so much better to talk with somebody she will never meet again.  But she just can't think of anyone who might qualify.  So it will have to be his old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As in all previous study sessions with Andres, there are breaks, and on one of these, Julie sees Andrew's dad along and more or less idle.  Gathering up her courage, Julie approaches  \"Ah... Sir .... I'd like to ask you a question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The huge bear-man puts down a beer stein that probably contains a full six-pack and agreeably asks \"Sure, what question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"..Well... If I and Amber ... ah ... I mean if Andrew ... well, ...\"  Drat, it sure is hard to ask about doing a three-some without saying that.  But she has to find out how to rescue Amber, and that means getting the humiliating words out of her mouth.<br>\r\n  It takes several attempts, and then they all come out in a rush.  \"IfAmberandIhavesexwithAndrew,canwesaveAmberfro-mbingdigested?\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   The old bear may have figured out what she was trying to say before she did, but he is in a good mood.  \"It will work.  If, purely for speculation [a limit accompanied by a smile], you and Amber were to be eaten and stay in his stomach for 5 minutes, and then you just happened to have sex with him and he climaxed in you, then he could eat you and you could stay in his stomach as long as you wanted in safety.  You would have to stay several hours to make it permanent, but you could just sleep the night away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You are sure about that?  I couldn't find anything about it on the net.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh yes.  I did it myself one time by accident.  I was rather surprised when she didn't digest.  I checked later with some other furries who told me it's rare because nearly always, what goes into your belly stays there.  But every so often the right combination is hit upon. But it's mostly by accident and almost never happens.  So not surprising you didn't find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"OK, thanks for the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But as she heads back upstairs to resume her studies, she is trying to make up her mind on whether to go thru with this.  Maybe having sex with Andrew is on the table, but it's so early.  Even if she were to do it at all, she would rather wait.<br>\r\n   But if she waits, Amber is food.  That just is not acceptable.  Amber may not be her real best friend or anything, but refusing to rescue her when it is so easy to do...  That's not a good choice either...</span></div></div>",

She can't let her best friend be digested, and the only way she can see to avoid it is Andrew having sex with both of them.  She will just have to make the sacrifice, and suppress those feelings that she shouldn't be making such a sacrifice and that she is too eager to make the \"sacrifice\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But things do not go as planned when she describes the plan to Amber and Andrew the next night.  Amber was supposed to be the reluctant one, unwilling to give herself to a boy she barely knows.  Instead she greets the plan with joy, jumping up and hugging and kissing Julie.<br>\r\n   It is Andrew, the one getting a free ride he should be willing to kill for, that makes the objections, and he can't seem to really explain his objections either.  Could he just be scared?  This is something he has never done before either after all.  And it presumably is something he wants a lot, and knows he might lose very easily.  Yeah, he may be scared.  Of course, he is not going to admit that.  Silly boy.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   So Julie and Amber must convince him that they are not going to bite, that they are just harmless little girls that will welcome his attentions, that they want this.  [Julie is irritated to note that Amber is being too convincing an actress about wanting Andrew.  Andrew is her property, not something to be shared except under dire emergency, and not something she is going to let Amber steal from her.  But she can't let any jealousy show now.  Right now, the goal is to get Andrew comfortable with the plan.]<br>\r\n   It takes a surprisingly long time, but eventually Andrew weakens and caves.  The program can go forth.<br>\r\n   But now the next step:  Practice the program?  Or just wait for Friday?  Andrew of course likes the idea of practice.  He will get to play with their bodies.  The girls prefer to stay with less physical contact for now.</span></div></div>",

Like any lad, Andrew argues that if it was going to be good Friday, it would be good today, but gets nowhere with the girls who can't really articulate their objections [which center on thinking, with a good deal of wisdom, that what Andrew gets cheaply, he would value the same way.  The more he had to suffer to get them, the better he would treat them.]  Julie continues to merely insist she is not ready.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But finally Andrew comes up with a solid argument.  The plan was based on his being able to eat both girls at once.  But they didn't know that was possible.  So they had best find out right away, while alternate plans are still possible.  Julie and Amber consider, and find no counter argument.  Rather miffed, Julie starts to strip.  A moment later, she is standing nude in front of Andrew.  \"Alright, let's find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew's huge maw opens, and closes around Julie's head.  Then he starts to swallow.  A moment later her shoulders are stretching his throat and her breasts are in his mouth.  Now Andrew varies the program, licking the beauties with his big tongue.  Julie starts to protest as she has done several times during earlier swallowing, but now she recalls that he will be doing a great deal more than lick in a few days.  She might as well get used to it.  Besides, it is rather enjoyable, tho she is not sure if that is a plus or a minus.  <br>\r\n   A few moments, and a few swallows, later, when Andrew is now licking the nest of hair between her thighs, she decides it is a minus, but she can't summons the will power to order Andrew to stop.  She does manage a weak \"Andrew, please..\", but even to her it sounds inadequate to slow down an overly eager male. And her mounting excitement is making even that too much for her.  Finally she reached completion, a release that frees her enough to order Andrew to behave himself, an order he obeys, for now.  But they both know their relationship has changed, in a way that Andrew definitely approves of, but Julie can only worry whether she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   More immediately she has to deal with her legs being swallowed, and with trying to expand Andrew's belly as she once expanded his throat.  If he is to get Amber in here too, the extra room will be needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She can hear Andrew ordering Amber to strip and needs little imagination to know a terrified and fascinated Amber is doing just that, and presenting herself as food.  His movements tell her when he starts eating her.  <br>\r\n    Andrew is following the same program with Amber as with Julie, a procedure that Julie views with a variety of negative emotions, deeming Amber a slut and a victim of Andrew's depraved behavior at the same time.  She has to admit there is more than a touch of jealousy in the mixture.  Andrew should not be treating another girl like that.<br>\r\n   Amber might agree.  At least she is not climaxing nearly as quickly as Julie did. But finally come the  rhythmic convulsions that reveal Amber has made it over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Andrew resumes swallowing, Amber is starting to enter his stomach, and Julie gets to work helping her in and making room.  This is going to be a tight squeeze... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She can feel it give some, but will it be enough?<br>\r\n  The immediate answer is yes, but there is a lot of Amber still to come.  So there is no time to stop trying to make more room.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   As Amber's slick body slides into the belly, and into contact with Julie, Julie once again has a fleeting sorrow she has no lesbian tendencies.  A lass with the proper desire could really get the hots from this full body caress.  Instead, she is having to grunt and shove, and get squeezed.  All too much a bother.  <br>\r\n   Still, she can give thanks for small favors.  This stomach is of course completely dark.  If it were lit, she can imagine Andrew taking pictures that would give people entirely the wrong impression, and posting them on the net.  For a second, she is mad enough at the prospect to consider ordering Andrew not to try anything of the sort, only to realize this is the way most likely to give Andrew an idea he may not have.<br>\r\n   In any case, there are more immediate problems to take care of, the prime one being to get Amber in here.  And that is not an easy one to solve.<br>\r\n   Head, shoulders, chest, belly, hips, all inside ok, but now comes the task of bending her so the legs can come in.  That is not too much problem with just the one girl, but now Julie is in the way.  So twist and push and..  There, she is bending.  Now just tuck into a ball and... There!  Now it's all down hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, it still has its problems, and the final result is 2 girls mashed together in a somewhat uncomfortable way, but it is done!  Andrew can hold two maidens.  The plan can go forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, you can let us out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Aw, why not stay in awhile.  You make me feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Andrew!  You are not to digest Amber before Friday.  You know that.  So you let us out, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh it doesn't have to be right away.  It is quite nice in here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Really, it is hard enough saving Amber without Amber making it harder.  But it seems Julie will have to compromise.  \"We do have quite a bit of homework to do still, so you are going to have to let us out soon.\"<br>\r\n   Sadly, much of the homework can be done by Andrew just reading the text out loud and then recording the girls' answers.  So he and Amber find the rest of the evening much more pleasant than Julie does.<br>\r\n   But eventually, it is time to get out of Andrew, take a shower, and head home.  And to get the thanks of Amber, who is almost hysterical with relief that she is not facing a death sentence on Friday, if she even lived that long.  It is not easy to get her to pull herself together and go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Julie also goes home, to consider another problem.  She and Amber are virgins, a state she is not going to keep much longer.  She had best review how best to handle that upcoming event.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several of the girls she knows are much more boy crazy.  She doesn't love Andrew.  She has hardly known him long enough for anything of the sort.  So why is she the one who is about to play the harlot? <br>\r\n   But she realizes she is painting the picture a little too black. Maybe she doesn't love Andrew, but she does like him, and the idea of being his first, and vice-versa sounds superior to the alternatives, and would even more so if she had a little more time. <br>\r\n   But time is just not available.  To save Amber, she must act now, not when she is ready.  No, there is no use pouting over how much nicer it would be in six months or a year.  It has to be now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So how to make it as tolerable as she can?  The internet might help...<br>\r\n   The first sites she tries cause a major blush, and a hasty retreat.  That is not what she is wanting.  She doesn't know how true their claims of making sex a joyful time are, but she is feeling too guilty about doing it at all to want it to be fun.  To be tolerable, it must be a sacrifice to save Amber, and enjoying herself makes that sound like a lie.<br>\r\n   Still, a sacrifice doesn't have to be painful, and she has heard first sex can be.  Maybe there are ways to reduce that pain...  Back to the net with a revised search...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hmm...advises a condom, lubrication, and relaxing..  It's going to be hard to relax under the circumstances, but she can at least try.  [She should take the active role?  Well, maybe that will be less scary, given the size and power of Andrew, but it still seems the more slutty... She will have to think about that.]  Condoms?  Well, everybody involved is a virgin.  They shouldn't be needed, and she can't think where she can get some without dying of embarrassment.  But she should be able to get some lubricant without explaining what she intended to lubricate.  It seems like a reasonable plan to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But how is she to relax?  Well, maybe if she tries some other lewd stuff with Andrew, the sex won't seem so different.  Might work, but...<br>\r\n    Or maybe she can just sorta hypnotize herself into believing it is nothing she need worry about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She doesn't have much time to choose...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not surprisingly Andrew is on board right away, but Amber is objecting.  \"But hasn't he seen and touched enough already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"He is going to be touching us a lot deeper Friday.  And I don't my first time to be him treating me like a hunk of meat... OK, he is going to do that too, but I want something a little more personal as well.  And we need to be comfortable with our decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It takes some more arguing, but this whole thing has made Amber a distinctly passive lass.  It is not long until she caves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, everybody strip and get in hugging formation.\"  It takes Amber a little while to start, but soon she too is naked, and holding onto Andrew's hairy hide.  \"Now just cuddle, stroke, and keep close.\"<br>\r\n   Amber is once again the slowest to comply, but she soon finds herself caressing, and being caressed by, Andrew, a situation that rapidly changes from scary to pleasant.  She is shocked to find she does not need to be ordered to caress with her whole body, particularly with her most secret place.  And that she is enjoying it, enjoying it quite a bit. And even more, until she experiences a dizzying explosion of feeling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Julie, in the meantime, has been enjoying herself too.  Her climax may not have been as major as Amber's but it was satisfying.  So far, the experiment is going well.  She is going to be nervous in any case, but she shouldn't be so tense that she will really hurt.  <br>\r\n    But now it is time to make sure Andrew has a good time.  Reaching down, she takes his staff in hand.  \"Ooo, that is so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amber starts to protest \"But Julie..\", but Julie waves her silent.  From all she had read, boys like to think they have huge equipment, and so even if she does think Andrew's is distinctly below average in size, she has to call it extra-large.  Besides, that thing is going to be plunged into her all too soon, and even if it is not a longsword, a dagger will still reach the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But now that she has this thing, what is she to do with it?  One idea is to use it as a dildo, but she is a little afraid it will end up inside her if she does, and she still wants to remain a virgin a little longer.  But the alternative is to try oral sex, and that sounds a bit yucky too.<br>\r\n    But she had best do something...<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

It can't be as bad as she is worrying.  And she does want to get familiar with Andrew's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, maybe start by just taking a taste.  Just lick it a bit...  The results are quite pleasant for Andrew of course, and Julie finds the taste reasonable.  She continues, licking slowly Andrew's tool until she had tasted the whole thing.  Now she opens her mouth and allows the head to enter.  Finding this no real problem, she lowers her head, consuming the rigid member until the tip is in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Alas, this is the precise moment Andrew shoots off.  Julie is suddenly gagging and choking, which at least causes her to jerk her head back, and off of Andrew.  Back as she continues to choke, Andrew tries to help, unfortunately forgetting she is just a girl, not a massive furrie, and his slaps on the back would send her to the floor if Andrew wasn't in the way.  Instead she is bounced off his belly several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A battered Julie is finally able to stop coughing, and stop Andrew from \"helping\".  Taking a moment to recover her senses, she is surprised to note that Andrew's juices didn't taste bad. Odd.  Maybe the claims of bad taste were just due to the yuk factor and not to any actual taste.  Oh well, in any case, it is one bright point in the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As she recovers, Andrew is concerned enough about her to suggest she sit out for awhile.  But while Julie isn't sure she wants to be here at all, and knows she would prefer waiting, maybe for years, she is definitely sure she wants to be Andrew's first, and that means she must smile, say she is fine now, and climb back onto bed, and onto Andrew.  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    This time she recalls some of her research and puts her fist around the base of Andrew's organ.  When she now puts her head to work, her lips hit her fingers, and penetration is stopped before chocking is a danger.  Encouraged, she starts moving her head up and down.<br>\r\n   As Andrew starts to groan in pleasure, Julie is shocked, and rather worried, to discover she is enjoying herself.  This is supposed to be a disgusting sacrifice she does for her boy, not fun.  Is she some sort of weirdo or slut?  But it seems to give her such a feeling of power.  She is manipulating Andrew, big powerful Andrew, like he was a toy.  And any time she wants, she can just clamp down with her teeth, and give him screaming pain.  He is at her mercy...  Why shouldn't that give her a rush?  <br>\r\n   Well, she can worry later about whether it also says something terrible about her too, but right now, it at least is making her job a lot easier.  So for now, go with the flow.  Carefully every inch of Andrew's man[bear?]hood receives the attention of her tongue and lips, driving him to distraction.<br>\r\n   This time, she is aware of his coming explosion, and catches his output in her mouth without trouble.  Recalling that boys seem to think it important, she carefully makes sure he sees her swallow.  All in all, quite satisfactory to both parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK Amber, you want to try that too?  Or shall we work on his stomach some?\"  </span></div></div>",

Andrew, how do you want me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   At Andrew's instruction, she gets on the bed face down.  Then he got to her feet, and started eating.  This isn't so bad, even pleasant...until he reaches her most sensitive spot.  Her protest is met by a couple of grunts, which, after some consideration she translates as \"You ate me, so I eat you.\"  She has to admit it sounds like a reasonable idea.<br>\r\n   It is, if nothing else, a very pleasant idea.  Quickly Julie builds up and nears the top.  As she does, she recalls stories of women screaming in pleasure.  The idea of Andrew's parents rushing up to find what was the matter, and finding her...no, that must not happen.  Desperately, she grabs a corner of the blanket and stuffs it in her mouth, rather needlessly it turns out.  Her climax is a gentle little thing.  But now Andrew resumes eating and shortly, it is her mounds that are under attack.  Again she builds, and again her spasm of pleasure is a sweet and sedate release.  And very nice in her opinion.  She smiles all the way into Andrew's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now it is Amber's turn, and she approaches Andrew's waiting maw in her normal state of confused eager terror.  How can she be attracted to something so scary and dangerous?  But she is, and Andrew hardly has to start to order her into position to be eaten.  A moment later his teeth are around her neck and her face is in his tongue, and there is no going back now.  <br>\r\n   There is, however, coming.  Several times in fact.  And if Julie's were gentle, Amber's are wild, dizzying explosions of feeling that would be heard all thru the house, and likely beyond, if her face was not deep in Andrew. [Julie, unfortunately, is also deep in Andrew and has to suffer some of the screams.] Finally a blood-rushing climax knocks her out and by the time she wakes, she is wrapped in Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Over all, Julie is deeming the evening a success.  They are becoming more comfortable with Andrew and his body, and they are managing to stretch his belly and make it more comfortable for them.  Now they just need to give Andrew a little time with a full belly, and they can get dressed and go home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And the evening conforms to schedule.  A couple of hours later a satisfied Julie is climbing into bed.  She is still far from convince this is the right idea, but at least it is working.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   The day of the big games finds a lot of excitement in the school, excitement Julie can't really share.  She keeps on thinking about what happens after the game.  Her life is about to take a big change, and somehow the game, which a week or two was the center of her life, is now just an incidental, on the road to the big event.  <br>\r\n  Of course, maybe she is just being prejudiced by her personal bias.  The game result will be all over the paper tomorrow, and her evening... ah, activities will not even be noticed.  <br>\r\n   At least she hopes they will pass without notice...<br>\r\nShe would just die if it got equal coverage, much less coverage appropriate to how important she deems it.  <br>\r\n   There are times when being unimportant is best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But for now, she has to concentrate on the school day, and the game.  The first isn't too hard as even those who are not concentrating on the game think she is, and her behavior, correct or not, goes unremarked.<br>\r\n   But when it is game time, she has to settle herself down.  She will be on display in front of thousands.  It just won't do to let them down by doing badly. <br>\r\n   However, it is quickly apparent that her behavior will not be the problem.  Amber and Andrew are far worse.  She is once again in that mouse hypnotized by the snake state and she is barely aware of the rest of the world.  Andrew is at least active, but he is so hyped up about the orgy he is going to be the star of that he can't walk straight either.  They have got to have some sense talked into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She sighs.  Just when did she become the adult?  What was it?  A week?  Two? ago, she was just an empty-headed cheerleader, a happy one too.  Now, all of a sudden, she is having to save the life of a friend, while managing her own love affair, and of course being worried to distraction.  Just what did happen? and when?<br>\r\n   Well, there is no going back, at least for the moment.  Today, she must be the level-headed one.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n   Andrew is the easier to sober up.  You have not said \"yes\" yet, and so the threat to say \"no\" is enough to bring him somewhat down to earth.  It requires some strong words too, but he buckles down, at least enough to get by.<br>\r\n  Amber, however, is almost a zombie as far as Julie is concerned.  Her eyes can't stay away from Andrew, with an expression that might fit a horror film victim.  It takes harsh words, shaking, and even a slap to bring her around, and even then she looks likely to slip back at the first excuse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    All in all, Julie is feeling happy that they can even do the stunts on the program.  Doing them well is just too much to ask for.  Happily the action on the field is tense enough to keep most eyes off the cheerleaders.  It won't rank as one of the epic battles of the series, but it won't rank much below them.  The score seesaws, and neither side establishes a firm lead.  With time running out, Julie's team has a lead, but the opposition is on the march, with Julie leading the calls to stiffen the defense.  [She is please to note Amber and Andrew have managed to get into the game too, so the stunts now go off well.]<br>\r\n   Then the offense stalls, and is stopped.  There is only a few seconds left and so the game is effectively over, then officially over, and Julie can join in the celebration of the victory.  The three of them can party for an hour or so and then slip off for the \"main event\".<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   The victory celebration is a fine one.  Everyone is in a great mood.  You won against the hated rival and all is right with the world [at least until Monday when you have to go back to class].  Everything is loose and going well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Even Julie is enjoying herself, tho she can't help thinking how much has changed in a couple of weeks.  If she had taken her mother's orders seriously, she would not have gone near the furries and now would likely be jumping all over the room with excitement.  Who knows?  By the end of the evening she might have been so out of control as to let a boy or two kiss her.<br>\r\n   Instead, she is going to be eaten alive, spit out, made love to and then stay in Andrew's belly for the entire night, deliberately.  Such a little whim has made such a difference.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With Amber to look after, she can't really plunge into the party the way she would like, but there are still a lot of fun things she can do...until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She had forgotten Andrew is not the only furry in the school.  Of course there are not many, probably less that 1% of the student body.  But there are others, and now she sees two of them, wolfish types, and they are circling Amber, who is once again in a state of frozen panic.  <br>\r\n   As you rush over, you realize Andrew's father was right.  Amber is just not going to survive long in a world of furries, not unless this trick tonight works as planned.  Well, at the least you want her eaten by a friend, not by some predatory strangers.  And you should be able to make her safe.  So you get between Amber and the wolves.  \"There you are.  Your boyfriend is looking all over for you.  Now come along.\"<br>\r\n   The wolves are not willing to let their meal get away that easily.  \"If he's neglecting her like this, we can take good care of her.  Why don't you just run alone, unless you want to make it a four-some?\"  The display of teeth is probably meant to scare her off, tho he might be thinking Julie would make a delicious dish too.<br>\r\n   But Julie is not going to quit that easily.  \"Andrew is that big bear over there, and he won't take kindly to anyone bothering us.  Now out of the way, before I start screaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   There are too many people around.  The wolves must yield and Julie drags Amber over to Andrew.  \"Andrew, it's time we go.\"  Andrew was thing of staying a little longer, but quickly agrees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But as they leave, they discover that the wolves are not giving up just yet.  They are confronted by the lobos once they are far enough from the celebration that help is not going to arrive. \"You just need one.  Let us have the other and nobody gets hurt.\"  [Julie bristles at the implication the girls are nothing.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Andrew is big enough to handle either of the louts, no question.  But two?  That is rather iffy.  The wolves seem to think they can win anyway.  Maybe just a bluff, but maybe they can take him.  Best that Andrew gets some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You scram or we will mash you.\"  This cry from Julie gets a laugh.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   \"Just what makes you think you can stop us, little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I don't need to.  I just need to hold you off until Andrew finishes turning your friend into road kill.  Then he can womp you too.<br>\r\n   \"Of course, that assume either of you are dumb enough to attack him and not just go away in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That does bring up a serious weakness in their plan.  If one takes on Andrew while the other takes on the girl...  That is just not likely to end well for the one with Andrew.  But there is that very ripe Amber standing there and just waiting to be eaten.  If they work their tactics just right...And wolves are pretty good at tactics.  Still, if they make a mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But if they use tactics and attack from both sides and use hit and run tactics?  It looks all too possible the wolves would win.  Such seems to be the opinion of these furries.  The two wolves advance, splitting to both sides of Andrew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Andrew slowly backs up to avoid being flanked, Julie pulls the terrified Amber back too.  But she is pretty much just dead weight.  As much as she wants to get away, there is something crazy in her that wants to be eaten and she just can't do what it takes to escape.  If Julie is to save her, she has to do more than just try to pull her in the right direction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Andrew, to the right.  I'll hold the left.\"  Her chance vs the wolf is about zero, especially since she has to keep hold of Amber, but if she can hold him off for a moment, Andrew can come to her rescue..  It's dangerous, and not that promising, but she has to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It works for the moment.  When Andrew starts towards the one on the right, he quickly jumps away, and the one on the left is caught by surprise.  Before he can take advantage of Andrew's back, Julie tells Andrew to turn, and the other wolf can't advance.   \"OK, let's retreat.\" and the three of them take a few steps towards safety.<br>\r\n   But only a few steps.  The wolves are quickly back in position, and edging in again.  This time Julie tells Andrew to go left and she guards the right.  And again, they drive them off far enough to gain a few steps.  <br>\r\n   But only a few steps, and there must be hundreds to go.  And it could go very badly if they miss even once...<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   The next time at least goes fine.  The wolves think the three are going to vary sides again, but Julie calls for Andrew to go right again and the startled wolf has to scramble to avoid Andrew's massive fist.  The defenders get at least a half dozen steps this time.  And calling right again works even better.  The wolf is sent sprawling by a blow by Andrew.  <br>\r\n   But Andrew can't spend the time to finish off his foe.  The other wolf comes in and Julie must call Andrew back to your defense.  He arrives quickly and the wolf veers away and they can resume fleeing, as fast [not very] as Amber will let them.<br>\r\n   The other wolf is quickly back on his feet and the deadly dance resumes.  So far, so good, but there is still that long distance to go.  Can they keep it up?  Or should they take a risk?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   So far, you have been winning by out-guessing the wolves and keeping an iron grip on Amber, pulling her where she needs to go.  But how much longer can you keep this up?  You've played paper-siccors, rock a few times, and you almost always lose, especially the more you play with someone.  It sounds all too likely you will be outguessed in the future, and then a wolf will grab you or Amber and drag her off.  Maybe Andrew will be able to rescue you a time or two, but eventually the two of you will be so far apart that he just can't save both.  No, trying to outguess them is almost sure to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But then what?  Well, if Andrew really whomps one, and if, a real big if, you can hold off the other until Andrew gets back..., he can bash it and the fight is over.<br>\r\n   Well, the fight will be over either way, just a question of whether you survive or not.  But it might work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So when the wolves start edging in again, you yell for Andrew to sic the one on the right and Andrew starts out after him.  But this time, you do not call him back when the other wolf starts to attack.  Instead you swing your purse at him.  It's a nice heavy object that might even knock him down.<br>\r\n   Well maybe if you hit with it...<br>\r\n   Almost casually the wolf dodges your wild blow, and then resumes his charge at you.  The only good(?) point is that he is attacking you.  Amber would just stand there, waiting to be captured.  You at least can try to resist, and maybe slow him down until Andrew can get back.  And you really hope he is on his way..<br>\r\n   For a moment, you do manage to hold him off, but furries are stronger than humans, and boys are stronger than girls, and usually better trained as well.  All too soon, he has hold of you, and then he has you over his shoulder, ready to haul his meal off to some place where he can dine in comfort.  This is not working as well as you had hopped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Then you find yourself falling to the ground.  Once you are able to focus on what is happening, you see Andrew is really flattening your attacker.  He did manage to get back just in time.  <br>\r\n   Or maybe not quite in time.  Looking, you see the other wolf is still healthy enough to be menacing Amber.  Quickly you yell at Andrew to let his battered foe go, and save Amber.  It takes far longer than you like for your advice to penetrate.  When Andrew finally does turn, the wolf is dragging Amber away.<br>\r\n   But dragging is slow, even by bear standards.  Andrew rapidly closes the gap between him and the wolf, who reluctantly realizes he is not going to get away with his prize.  At the last second, he lets go of Amber and flees.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    But for how long?  It is pretty dark out here and he could come back for a sneak attack...  No, there he is.  He's administering some 1st aid to his beat-up companion.  That will keep him busy long enough to the three of you to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But as you flee, you wonder if your idea of an evening in the park is really such a good one.  It is rather romantic, and private, but suppose there is another furry lurking around?  It is sounding a little scary now.<br>\r\n    But the alternative is going to Andrew's place, and right under his mother's eye marching up to his room for ... well, behavior you don't want to be under her eye when you do it.  Still, it would be safe, even if horribly embarrassing...</span></div></div>",

For all her hesitations over what is about to happen, Julie does find this comforting and pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With the added motive of safety, along with privacy, the proper atmosphere, and being scared of the whole idea, Julie is picky about where to stop, enough to annoy the unsurprisingly eager Andrew.  But being eager means being the beggar who can't be the chooser, so he can only grumble, and sigh with relief when Julie finally finds a location she approves of.  As far as he can tell, it is hardly different than several others she has rejected.  Julie would have to admit he is not that far wrong, but it is the best spot, and worth all the delay.  [Granted, she would just as soon delay a year if it was possible, but..]  It has a lovely view of a romantic sky, nice and comfortable, and they are not going to be disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The program for the evening is not going to give them much time.  There is a lot to do.  Still, there is a little time for getting comfortable.  And for hugging and kissing... This is not the first time Julie has kissed him, but it is the first time it has been a minor event.  That at least is rather pleasant.  Not so pleasant for Amber of course.  The poor girl is retreating into a world of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  However, \"It's time\" is Julie's decision.  She stands, and starts removing her clothing, with Andrew's eager help.  Then they take off the clothing of the nearly catonic Amber.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   \"OK, I go first.  Open wide.\"  This part of the program is routine, or at least mostly so.  Julie finds she has lost count of the number of times she has been in Andrew's belly.  [Of course, math is not her best subject...]  Shoving her head in his mouth is routine...<br>\r\n   Well, mostly routine...<br>\r\n   Andrew has tried to add a sexual nature to eating her several times, but this is the first time she has not tried to stop him.  The feeling of his tongue caressing her globes is distinctly pleasant.  She is almost disappointed when he stops to swallow more of her.  Nor does she feel any outrage when he pauses on her muff.  She does feel some hesitation, which vanishes as his tongue licks her lips.  Instead, she feels an eagerness, a pressure building, and then a wonderful release that leaves her quite happy.  Andrew resumes eating and soon she is a ball in Andrew's belly.<br>\r\n    She can hear Andrew saying \"Your turn\", but not Amber's response.  Not that it matters.  She can feel the movement of Andrew's body as he consumes Amber, and then feel her head as it bumps her's when Amber starts to enter the stomach.  [She also gets the dubious pleasure of hearing Amber's bellow when Andrew brings her to fruition.]  A moment later the two lasses are in a tangle of limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Wow, that was quite a meal.  I feel like a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Don't you dare!  We are not even half done yet.  We have to soak in here for half an hour and then ...get on to other things.  You will just have to stay awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Alright, alright.  Women...\"</span></div></div>",

It's hard enough to rescue people in any case, but when they don't want to be rescued...  \"We can rest in an hour.  There is much we must do in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n   Now where had she gotten this attitude?  She certainly had not had it before getting involved in this nonsense.  Or maybe she had, but it had not been necessary before.  But.., oh bother, it really doesn't matter.  As she had said, there is much to do right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, technically not really.  The two of them  just has to soak in Andrew's juices for a half hour or so.  But she does have to keep them awake, and it's been a busy enough day that she wouldn't mind a nap herself.  That means she has to keep busy even if she is idle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, a little talking maybe... \"How do you think we could improve the stunts?  We still have two games to go.\"<br>\r\n   It proves an excellent choice of subject.  Amber and Andrew have some ideas, ideas that need work.  The two pitch into the subject with a will and the time flies by.  Julie is almost surprised when Andrew announces.  \"Say, time's up.  You girls come out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A moment later the two unclad girls are at the feet<br>\r\nof the equally nude Andrew.  Time for the main event.  Nervously, Julie checks Andrew's watch.  Yes, they had been in there long enough.  There is no excuse for delay there.<br>\r\n   Nor is there any choice but for her to scramble up and embrace Andrew.  She'd love for Amber to go first, but that would mean Amber would go first.  And she is not going to have her boyfriend's first lover be anybody but herself.  Maybe in a year would be better, but that is not an option.  No, the options are whether she is going to actively embrace her fate or just let it happen.

This is her decision and it will go her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK Andrew, just lean back...\"  As he does, Julie gets atop him, facing in the opposite direction.  She finds herself facing Andrew's organ, which is big enough to daunt even a seasoned lass, much less a virgin whose claim to have never seen one before wasn't all that incorrect.  But she is not going to stop now.  \"Now, Andrew, lick me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A moment later, a huge tongue caresses her most intimate part.  That is her signal and Julie opens her mouth and swallows Andrew's piece.<br>\r\n   Well, as much as she can...  Like many a woman before her, she finds it is much bigger than her mouth.  Desperately, she grabs hold with her hands, leaving a lesser length to occupy her mouth.  Now she at least is not in danger of choking to death.  And as Andrew continues licking her, she moves her head up and down, giving Andrew a wonderful time.<br>\r\n   Perhaps too wonderful.  Suddenly her mouth is full of sticky liquid.  Recalling what she has read, she swallows, an act she finds easier than she had feared.  Then she resumes her efforts on Andrew, licking his tool from end to end.  <br>\r\n   Andrew is enjoying himself hugely, but the idea is to get Julie wet and relaxed.  All she has read said that would make things go better for her.  But working at relaxing is rather self-defeating and Julie is not surprised when Andrew shoots off again.  <br>\r\n   But as she feels Andrew coming yet again, she finally feels her own excitement building, and a moment later she finally climaxes.<br>\r\n   Damp and at least a little more relaxed, Julie now moves down Andrew, and then turns to face him.  \"Hold still.  I'll take care of it.\"  Not that she wants to.  The idea of her plunging that massive member into her scares her silly.  But the alternative is Andrew plunging it into her, and that is even more frightening.  Better to retain some control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Positioning herself atop Andrew's tool, she hesitates for a moment, but there is no going back, so a moment to work it into the outer folds to where it touched her hymen, a process she finds scary, and pleasant, and then the cannonball method of getting used to the \"water\".<br>\r\n   A second later she is screaming, both in pain and joy.  She had not realized she was so close to completion.  Andrew bends down with concern on his face.  To show everything was, if not fine, at least according to plan, Julie kisses his nose, and then starts pumping.  A moment later Andrew explodes in her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   There.  That's done with, for now.  Now on to the next step.  But is that Andrew eating her?  Or his opening Amber?</span></div></div>",

But you have to do it or die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Bad tactic.  Amber Curls into a ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Sigh... You will enjoy it.  Andrew will be gentle with you..  And I've worked hard to get you here and still alive.  Just say the word and you will be safe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Y... yes...\"  Finally she uncurls and Andrew can get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Again that huge tongue is tasting female vitals, and Amber starts to relax, a little.  She is still scared so Julie tries to assist, caressing her friend's breasts as she baby-talks encouragement to the terrified lass.  Whether it does any good is hard to say, but it at least allows Julie to feel she is trying to help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It seems to take forever, but Julie feels Amber's breasts become hot and her nipples hard.  Then she gently sighs as she climaxes, something she does again a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, Andrew, it's time.  Be gentle with her.\"  Whether the bear boy can be is a worry to Julie, but about all she can do is hope as Andrew strattles Amber, who vanishes completely from sight under Andrew's massive body.  There is a moment of his getting into position and then he moves forward, which produces a drawn out \"Ooooo\" from Amber.   Apparently he was gentle enough.  <br>\r\n   Now Andrew begins the age old motion, which to Julie's view looks like he is having sex with the ground.  Amber is completely out of sight.  Only her cries of passion show that she is present.<br>\r\n    It is Alexander who climaxes first, but he pauses only for a moment and Julie listens to Amber's gasping for breath as her passion mounts.  Suddenly she is screaming loud enough to wake the dead, if she was not muffled by Alexander's massive chest.  Alexander does not let this stop and continues his thrusts as Amber moans out a series of happy \"Yes, yes, yes...\"  This comes to an end with a sigh from her and a grunt from Alexander as they both go over the top at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Alexander now gets to his feet, exposing a happy, and still impaled, Amber.  \"Good girl, Amber.  We're almost done.  Now just relax, we've been in Alexander's stomach before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But which way to go in this time?  Heads or tails?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Shifting her weight to the vanished foot, she now hops up with her other leg and then carefully inserts her other foot into Andrew mouth.  For a moment she is balanced so high above the ground, she starts wondering about joking that she can see Andrew\u2019s house from up here.  But then Andrew starts to swallow, and she starts to sink towards the ground.  Her calves, and then those trim thighs follow her feet into Andrew\u2019s gullet.<br>\r\n    As usual, this is rather pleasant, but this is the big one, and her excitement remains under control until Andrew reaches the apex of her thighs, and sets his tongue to work on her most sensitive spot<br>\r\nA wave of pleasure passes thru her and a moment later she cries out with unabashed abandon.<br>\r\n   Satisfied, Andrew resumes eating, but Julie is not satisfied.  She shoves her hands into his mouth and begins to stroke the dampness between her legs.  A moment later as her chest enters his mouth, her fiery furnace explodes and  she is replete for the moment, long enough for her head to slip inside.  <br>\r\n   It takes very little time before she is bundled up in his belly.  \u201cNow, it\u2019s Amber\u2019s turn, Andrew.\u201d  It is hard to hear from in here what Amber\u2019s response is, quite possibly none at all, but it really doesn\u2019t matter.  Julie can feel Andrew grab her and pull her over his big belly to his mouth.  <br>\r\n   Rather a strange sensation, feeling Amber being eaten.  But Julie feels Amber\u2019s legs being drawn over Andrew\u2019s stomach, and thus over Julie.  She also feels Amber start kicking vigorously, quite possibly because she has just climaxed.  Andrew of course is merely interested in chowing her down, and Julie feels Amber\u2019s feet lose contact with Andrew\u2019s belly, a second before her head pops into the stomach with Julie.<br>\r\n    Andrew would pick this time to apply his tongue to Amber\u2019s loins, with very good effect, except that Julie\u2019s ear is almost in Amber\u2019s mouth.  Goodness, she not only has to sacrifice her virtue, and risk her life to save Amber, but she has to lose her hearing too?<br>\r\n    Well, it wasn\u2019t quite that bad actually, and Andrew resumes swallowing Amber.  Julie gently guides her into a comfortable position, wrapped up with her.  A moment later, it is finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWe did it.  Now we just have to wait for morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYou all right, Julie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cFine.  And how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWonderful.  I\u2019m not scared a bit of being digested now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cBut you can\u2019t be digested now.  We did everything according to the book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, even if I do digest, I am so very relieved now.  I want to thank you for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, what are friends for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But as Amber drifts off to sleep, Julie realizes she has never really considered the idea this whole escapade would fail.  If so, she is going to be meat by morning.  For a second, she panics and wants to demand Andrew let her out.  But she hears Andrew starting to snore.  He may not be able to let her out now.  And she did want to take the risk, didn't she?  Besides, could she wake Andrew, get him to let her out, and then leave Amber to her doom?  She tries pointing out the differences in the two cases, but she ends up realizing she just can't.  It may be silly, but her fate will be the same as Amber's.<br>\r\n    But she is likely worrying about nothing.  Andrew's father surely knew what he was talking about, and he wouldn't have told her a big lie, would he?  With this comforting thought, Julie drifts off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

A gurgle tells him his meal, his first real meal, is digesting nicely.  Now he is truly a furrie.  This is one of the happiest moments of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Even so, he is a little regretful that his dad had been blowing smoke to Julie.  Kinda too bad about her.  Now Amber, she had been just food.  Just a matter of who ate her.  And she certainly had been tasty.  She is right where she belongs, and making Andrew quite contented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But Julie had made a pretty good girlfriend.  It had been nice to have her to pal around with.  It would have been better if Pa had been telling the truth and she could crawl out of his belly now.  <br>\r\n  Still, she was just a human and nobody gets everything they need, much less what they want, in life.   And she was a delicious meal, and is very satisfactory as she digests.  Andrew supposes he still would like her around, but eventually she would have been food anyway, and this is a fine time in any case.  He can't say he is terribly sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With a happy sigh, Andrew rolls over and resumes his happy nap.  Later he will have to deal with a celebration with his family and with paperwork with the school, but right now he doesn't even have to think about which to do first.</span></div></div>",

She is resistant to digestion!  It worked!  \"Amber!  Wake up!  You survived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Wha...  No Ma, this isn't a school day.  Just let me sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"This is Julie, not your mother, and you are in Andrew's stomach, not your bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"..Oh yeah...  Well, it's nice in here.

How about a slug and a shout?.  <br>\r\n   It takes a full scream and all the kicking and fighting she can do, but finally Andrew wakes.  With a loud yawn, he asks \"Yeah?
