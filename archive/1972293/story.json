The sleeping boy jostled about in reaction to the unexpected weight but he didn't stir. Serelle shook his head in amazement. \"Why are we leaving so late? The train leaves in two hours, it'll take at least 30 minutes to get to the station and that's if there's no traffic-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traffic?!\" Cinder asked incredulously. \"Have you forgotten where you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have <i>you </i>forgotten about The Great Duck Disaster of 2010? I still have nightmares of being trapped on that school-bus that reeked of month old salami. Never could get that smell out my shirt. All because some over fertilized ducks had way too many chicks and took over the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder shook his head in amusement. \"That was over three years ago. You really need to let go of the past. Besides, that was in the spring, it's fall now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if that matters,\" Serelle muttered, \"there's always something weird going on here.

Cinder looks to Holly Foster as she turns to open the door.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"My how you've grown since last I saw you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Denny, one of the orphans who had been fortunate enough to be adopted a few years back.  <br>\r\nCinder's eyes got wide as he saw his old chum walking through the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well be, I didn't think I'd ever set eyes on you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was in town on some personal business and I wanted to come by and see you guys. How's Fin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask him yourself, he's sleeping in the next room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you'd be gone from here by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to tell you the truth, I was leaving today, I've got somethings I want to check on myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get in here the both of you, I want to feed you a good home cooked meal before the two of you go off gallivanting across the country in search for a pipe dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ma, some things never change I see,\"<br>\r\n Denny said as he pulled off his jacket and sit at the kitchen table. Cinder also joined him at the table for the two of them to talk and carry on about old times.<br>\r\nThey were laughing and joking and even had Holly cracking up.  They were loud with their laughing and it awakened Fin, who had been fast asleep in the next room.  The laughter attracted him to the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's going on in here?  He looked at the table and saw his old friend Denny.  Denny and Fin had been like two peas in a pod when Denny lived at the home.  Fin was crushed when Denny had gotten adopted a few years back.  Holly left the room to let the three boys discuss the direction their lives had been and were going.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Denny, you still able to see the future like you used to be able to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than ever, that's why I'm here to be honest with you.  A bout a month ago I started having visions of the future and you guys were in it.  We were all on a mission to find our birth parents. I know where I can find mine but I am afraid to go by myself for fear my father will reject me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know who your father is already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,he's a tubby little cubby named Winnie the Pooh.  He's located in Canada at the hundred acre woods. I'm going there but I wanted to take you with me<br>\r\nFin, you have the skills of guidance you will never get us lost. and Cinder you have the ability to read minds so you can tell me if my birth father, Pooh, is going to reject me.  for some reason I saw a vision of him clearly but I'm not able to determine whether or not we'll get along yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFin jumped up from the table and ran to Denny, hugging his neck.  \"I would be so glad to go with you and show you the way I can guide you I have a great internal guidance system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll go to, and then after, you accompany me to the North Pole to see my old man Chris Kringle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, the three of us will make it a trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Diamond?\" Finn gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she'll want to see Cupid, after all she's wanted to meet him for a long time. We all need to go together to find all of our parents.  Besides we can sure use her fire starting ability in case we run in to some kind of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder began yelling for Diamond to come down stairs from the two story home in which they all lived.  In no time she came down the stairs complaining...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the\", she stopped when she saw Denny was there.  \"What are you doing back here boy, or should I say man, you've really shaped up dude.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Diamond\", Denny went and hugged her neck and kissed her on the lips in a sisterly type of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Diamond we're going to go on a voyage to find our birth parents, I'm going to meet my ole man Winnine the Pooh, They're going to go see the old Chris Kringle, what if you come with us and we seek out your own ole man, Cupid.\" said Denny<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we can use your protection along the way, you know, if any one messes with us you do your little magic with the fire starting.\"<br>\r\nAt that moment Holly came in to the kitchen from the next room.<br>\r\n\"What are you kids doing? are you plotting to go off and leave me, all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenny hugged Holly and thanked her for the nice meal she provided and then...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You in hear beating on the upstairs door and Denny down stairs beating on the Kitchen door, I'll be if you people aren't the noisiest of all people in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenny began swaying back and forth from one foot to the other.  <br>\r\n\"Well we'd better get this show on the road if we're going to go, so we need an answer Diamond, what's it going to be---are you going are not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go but we'll play hell trying to find cupid, my dad. Just let me get some things together, what should I bring, I mean where are we going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring both winter and summer clothes and pack light, we have a lot of traveling to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orphans had each been working since age sixteen in order to be able to afford to take a trip looking for their parents, so they had much money saved towards the travel.  They would first go to visit Denny's father in Canada at the Hundred Acre Woods, where they were certain Winnie the Pooh lived. Next their travels would take the two brothers, Finn and Cinder to meet their father Chris Kringle, or the worlds most loved elf old St.Nick or Santa Clause, as he was known by so many different names around the world.  The group was not positive about the where-a-bouts of Cupid, Diamond's father.  From their research they believed he could be found in the Country of Greece. <br>\r\nThey would be taken to the four corners of the Earth to find their birth parents. Diamond was not so sure she even wanted to know her dad.  After all she had gone her whole life without knowing him and she had done just fine.  But she was along for the trip to be with her adopted siblings.  They were all dear friends and had been for many, many years. Finn and Cinder were ready to go when Denny arrived, but they waited for Diamond to retrieve her belongings, which just took her a brief moment, as she just took a few out-fits from her closet and shoved down in a bag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're off!\" she said with a hug and a kiss for  Holly.  \"We're sure gonna miss ya, ma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You babies be careful,  you're going around the world, it's not like you going down the block or something, lots of dangerous things could befall you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on ma, don't worry, we're not babies or children any longer, were we are seventeen and eighteen years old, and we'll be ok, you raised us right as I was telling you earlier.  We'll keep our heads low, besides we know where we are going.\" Cinder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes but do you know what you'll find when you get there, I just worry about you, you're too young to be traveling across the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all filed out the door to a waiting taxi cab they had called earlier. They were destined to the train station to ride the rails into Canada.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we notify your dad that we are coming?\" asked Finn innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding, and give him the chance to flee!\" said Denny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Cinder saw a group setting toward the back of the train, they all walked towards the back where they found enough seats for them all. The all set down and began talking about how excited they were, to go and meet their birth parents.<br>\r\nThey were laughing and joking having a really nice time, when a young man, about their own age, came up to Denny and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in my seat now you can get the hell up!  If you don't I'm going to kick your teeth in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Uh, this is my seat, no one was setting here when I arrived, you were nowhere around.  I'm not moving!\"<br>\r\nDenny said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was scared but he was determined to hold his own.  He and his friends would sit together if he had anything to say about it.  The boy grabbed Denny by the front of his shirt, pulling him up to his feet.  Denny stood up and grabbed the boy's hands and started pushing them away from him.  The boy cursed him and Denny got away from the boy and then sat back down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not moving me from my seat!  You were nowhere around when we arrived. This is not your seat,\" Denny told the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment two other boys showed up, they knew the one who had been trying to take Denny's seat.<br>\r\nThe three of them got together and singled us out one by one telling us we would now have to leave or they would rearrange our bones. One of the, the largest one, picked at Denny, telling him to remove himself of he would get a fat lip. Denny stood up,afraid, but he would face the young men, he would protect the girls.<br>\r\nFinn stood up and walked over to the three guys who were about to hurt Denny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him the hell alone, he may be frightened, but I'm sure as hell not; I can't abide by a bully,\" Finn said with a firm voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've just made a mistake dude, you gonna take on all three of us?\" The big boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys looked at each other and kind of laughed, They knew the one boy was no match for the three of them.  They started over to Finn When suddenly, Denny jumped up and ran to Finn's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there are two of us you must face,\" Denny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, like I'm really afraid of the two of you, you're nothing but scrawny little peeps, we'll tear you apart,\" said one of the young men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once Cinder, Diamond, and Holly stood up and went to the side of their friends, Denny, and Finn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take on me!\" said Diamond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah and you can't take on all five of us, you may think you can but we will fight till you can't move,\" Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young men looked at themselves and knew that they were licked.  The three of them could not take on five people; biting, scratching, punching, etc.  The boys looked at one another ant the original boy walked over to Denny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another place and Time man, you will be mine, I'll have your ass I whip it good!\" said the first boy they encountered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n,The three young men left, they went into another car on the train.  The kids sit down and were oohing and ahing over what had just happened.  They were thrilled that they were all together and they worked as one.
