            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep in the darkest ruins in a cave on the top of Mount Seclier three intrepid adventurers were navigating where very few dared to tread. It had been a perilous journey exploring the ruins and if not for the fact each of them had mastered their craft they would have perished many rooms prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of them was a thief in class by the name of Jet. A master of stealth and a true professional of acquiring things that other claimed to be untouchable. Unlike many others in her profession however she had a strong moral code, refusing to harm anyone unless in danger herself and always using her talents to help those in need of them. Currently she was using her skills to return an artefact that was lost for a dear old woman down on her luck she had met at the local inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSheesh, these doors just keep getting tougher.\u201d Taking on arm free from picking the lock she wiped the sweat from her brow and tucking her hair behind her ears. With another exhausted sigh she reached down her leather armour and pulled out a much sturdier looking lock pick. \u201cTime to bring out old faithful, ain\u2019t nothing been able to stump her yet\u201d She grinned. Within mere seconds the party heard the clunk of gears as the doors separated, releasing a plume of dust from the ancient mechanism. \u201cBingo!\u201d The thief beamed, turning to face the other members of her party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face she met with was not one of joy however. The second of the party was a magic user named Holly. She was a master of healing spells and has rescued the party from certain death more times than any of them would like to admit, she was also a dab hand at battling undead creatures thanks to her holy magic. Unfortunately for her however she was standing a bit too close to the door when it opened and was currently brushing of the flurry of dust that covered her entire body. \u201cAwww jeeeezzzzzeee\u201d she cutely pouted. \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have followed you here these ruins are so icky\u201d She huffed, stamping her foot on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t be like that Holly. You know for a fact I wouldn\u2019t want to go anywhere in the world without my best friend.\u201d Jet said, stifling a laugh at the site of her normally meticulously dressed friend. \u201cAnd besides we would have had a real tough time without your magic back there\u201d Her pout began to slightly lift hearing Jet\u2019s words. As much as she hated gross things being praised by Jet always made her lighten up. She was convinced Jet was also aware of this fact but as long as she was praised she didn\u2019t really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you two love birds are finished chirping, this should be the last room\u201d The third party member huffed, barging past Holly and knocking the crouched Jet onto the floor with a thud. \u201cWe are not love birds, Clara!\u201d Holly squealed, her face turning redder than the ripest tomato. \u201cYeah, yeah let\u2019s just get a move on\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third party member Clara was as tough as they come, hired rouge by trade and a master of all things bladed. Very few creatures could stand up to her dual daggers and for the right amount of coin very few people could either. Unlike the Jet and Holly she was not on this quest out of the goodness in her heart, nope she had already taken all of the old woman\u2019s valuables (Though not that many to begin with) as a deposit and was just intrigued to see this fabled artefact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of them entered the main chamber, torches held on the wall began to flicker into life. Bathed in this new light they could see the spectacle of it all. A huge dome of intricate mosaic lined the ceiling, depicting some form of deity. Only Holly seemed interested in examining this however, as the other two raced to the main altar in the middle. Jet had made it first and picked up the small locked chest, another firm shove from Clara however was more than enough to send her tumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing herself off, she stood up once more \u201cHey! What\u2019s the big ide\u2026\u201d Blinding pain flashed through Jet\u2019s nose as Clara had casually tossed the chest at her face. \u201cDumb things locked, open it would yah?\u201d Jet held her tongue knowing full well from their earlier battles that she would stand no chance against Clara in a one on one fight. \u201cFine, but can you at least try and be a tiny bit friendlier to your fellow adventurers?\u201d Jet sighed, reaching in once more to her leather pouch to pull out another lock pick. Clara just snorted in response her eyes transfixed on the item in Jet\u2019s nimble fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another satisfying clunk the chest flung open and Jet plucked the artefact out. Inside was an overly ornate mirror, made of pure silver and holding a variety of different gem stones on the back in the same mosaic style as the ceiling. The front however seemed to have a very large crack through it, Jet\u2019s reflection split in two almost straight down the middle. \u201cArggh dammit the mirror broke\u201d Jet yelled \u201cit\u2019s still got a lot of value thanks to the frame but it would have been so much more if you hadn\u2019t broke it\u201d With that Clara strolled forward getting right up in the face of Jet and with a smug grin said \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my face that bashed the mirror in the trinket box now was it? If anyone broke it, it was you master thief girl\u201d Then in a swift motion Clara snatched the mirror. \u201cAnyway I\u2019ll be taking this, this quest has been far too much for the pay the old hag was offering so I\u2019ll just sell it on some place.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet couldn\u2019t believe her ears, she knew Clara wasn\u2019t the nicest person in the world but to steal such a treasure from an old woman was incomprehensible. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, she needs this to get her life back together\u201d Jet reasoned. \u201cShe\u2019s on her last legs as it is probably already croaked it since we\u2019ve been here. So I don\u2019t see the harm in making sure I get enough coin to keep me happy\u201d Clara grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do that\u201d Jet warned, taking a single step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Click* Jet\u2019s face turned pale hearing that noise, she knew from experience that was the noise a pressure switch made when stepped on by an unaware adventurer. The chamber was suddenly filled with an ominous rumbling before a large stone boulder slammed between jet and Clara. The platform that held the altar began to rise on Clara\u2019s side sending the boulder rolling off towards Jet. \u201cLooks like I get to keep it after all thief girl\u201d Clara laughed as Jet began to frantically sprint away from the accelerating mass of dense rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly how was busy studying the ruins turned her attention to the others as the room shook and was able to see the pure peril that was about to befall her best friend Jet. Thinking fast she deduced that she would not be unable to stop that boulders movement nor would she be able to get Jet free from its path. So she cast the only spell she could think of to help her friend. \u201cRubberfy\u201d She screamed, casting directly onto her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was panicked she could feel the boulder gaining and her life began to flash before her eyes, it was then she spotted Holly in the corner casting a spell and felt a tingle flow through her body. Then she felt it, the boulder slammed into her back and then continued its momentum and rolled completely over the poor thief girl. Much to her dismay though she wasn\u2019t dead, instead she was lifted up off the ground by the rolling stone and flattened once more as it ploughed through the corridor they had entered in.<br>\r\nAfter many different rooms spun by and she was painfully crushed over a disproportionate amount of stalagmites that seemed intent on puncturing every section of her flattened form. She realised what had happened, Holly must have cast rubberfy to give her squishable properties and save her from a messy end. This was a mixed blessing however as the boulder had made its way through the entire ruins and was now teetering on the edge of a mountain they had climbed to gain access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was squashed spread eagle and facing forwards and was able to survey the land from her precarious perch. Down below her was the village she had got the quest from in the first place as well as a forest a rocky outcrop of smaller cliffs. Jet sighed glad she was spared the rough ride down on the boulder and praying Holly would be by soon to peel her free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA passing bird however was much too exhausted from its flight over the mountain and decided to perch itself on the rock. This simply action was all it took for the boulder to lean forward slightly and once again begin it\u2019s terrifying decent. Jet screamed as loud as her crushed lungs would allow as she was bulldozed into the jagged rocky earth below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boulders decent was not as smooth as in the ruins. The rocky cliffs acting as ramps and flinging the rock high into the air before slamming down and rolling to the next one. Every now and then Jet would be unfortunate enough to be on the bottom as the boulder crashed heavily into the earth, her crushed form spread out even thinner from the immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the forest,  Jet would be slammed straight through the first few trees as splinters flew everywhere and dug into her already sore body. Soon the boulder slowed however and instead Jet and the boulder became like a pinball, bouncing roughly between each of the many tree trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they had reached the outskirts of the village the boulder had slowed to a snail\u2019s pace. One final rotation and Jet could see the sky, then the village with many of the villagers popping their heads out to see the commotion. The boulder didn\u2019t fully stop however as Jet could see the ground approaching one more. This ground however was coated with a thick batch razor bark thorns, known around the world for their incredibly sharp thorns. \u201cNONONONNONONO\u201d was all she could whimper, tears littering her eyes as she was painfully pressed into the bush and the boulder came to a complete stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later the boulder was rolled over once more. Jet horrified that she would be sent on another hellish ride, much to her joy though she was met with Holly\u2019s worried face. \u201cOh thank God you\u2019re alive\u201d Holly bawled. \u201cI thought I had lost you and then I had to try and round up some people to help me and just the thought of you trapped there\u201d Holly rambled like this for a good twenty minutes as she cast every healing spell under the sun to get Jet back to her old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finally free however Jet had only one thing on her mind. \u201cWhere is Clara?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Descriptions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorth: The realm of monster girls and a very dangerous place with few and far between settlements. The terrain is very rugged with many caves, lakes and forests untouched by man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEast: The mountainous region and realm of the giantess, small people are heavily scrutinised at borders to the country and not many are allowed entry. Those that are must stick to the high walkways built for them as small people travelling on the ground will be crushed unaware by the giant women going about their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouth: The alchemists of the swamplands live here and are constantly concocting various potions and machines in the aim of changing the world. Some of these potions can have very unpleasant side effects and the machines can be quite dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest: Mages of the desert live here and are famed for their magic. There have been a few disappearances of late but the constant trade of rare items and fancy furniture\u2019s keep tourism booming in this hot place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet will never forget Clara\u2019s betrayal, so the moment she caught wind she had fled north to seek a buyer in the wildlands, she was off in hot pursuit dragging behind her a very nervous if not terrified looking Holly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was always terrified of monster stories growing up so the prospect of venturing to where these stories came from shook her to the core. In truth she had every right to be scared of their destination, countless monsters, beasts and natural dangers have seen off almost everyone who dared to step foot in this God forsaken place. In fact only the most fearsome and skilled explorers could even reach the small settlements where the heroic pioneers of the time made their dwellings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t we just wait till she comes back?\u201d Holly trembled, her feet dragging across the mud as Jet pulled her along. \u201cThe artefact could be lost amongst merchants never to be seen again by the time she gets back. Plus I\u2019ve told you a thousand times Holly, we\u2019ll be fine! We just have to sneak through find the settlement, beat up that backstabber get the mirror back and then sneak home, simple!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was always bewildered by Jet\u2019s unwavering optimism in fact it was one of the main reasons she became friends with her in the first place. \u201cHow can you say simple? We could be caught by all manner of monster before even seeing the settlement. There\u2019s Trolls, Lamia\u2019s, Dragons, Slimes\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next forty five minutes Holly continued listing off the dangers as Jet continued to drag her along the unsteady ground.<br>\r\n  \u201cOk I get it it\u2019s a dangerous place but don\u2019t forget you\u2019re a top class mage and I am a master thief\u201d Jet beamed. \u201cPlus you can always go back if you\u2019re that scared\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly swivelled in place to check the route home. The way was dark nobbled branches, poked into the barely noticeable path. The light from the midday sun was poking in just enough light to illuminate the shifting bushes that lay around her. Unfamiliar noises echoed around from seemingly all directions. Holly\u2019s face grew paler with each passing second as she stared into that uneasy pathway. She swivels back to see Jet had strolled on ahead to scout out the land ahead. \u201cWhat the hell! Wait for me, don\u2019t leave me here\u201d Holly cried, her steps ragged as she raced to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intrepid duo continued pressing forward for another hour or so before their luck to a turn for the worse. With a couple gentle patters the heavens roared and a deluge of water fell from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thoroughly soaked Holly seethed at her best friend as she fumbled about in her travellers pack for a map. \u201cPlease tell me we are close to shelter? I don\u2019t want to be the first explorers here to be defeated by rain drops\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her cloak as a makeshift awning Jet unfurled the map. \u201cHmm let\u2019s see, oh there is a cave about five minutes away over this ridge\u201d Jet smiled pointing off into the distance. \u201cThat should keep us out of the rain for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes, this cave have a name?\u201d Holly puzzled. \u201cProbably, but I kind of spilt our rations over the map awhile back and some of the names are hard to make out\u201d Jet then shot off her patented don\u2019t hate for this smile and gave the smudge on the caves name a quick wipe with her finger before licking it off with a satisfied slurp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s just great so let\u2019s head off to the mystery cave shall we? The cave of blood suckers I bet! Or maybe even the cave of cave ins. No no I bet it\u2019s the cave of only stupid people enter here\u201d Holly ranted stomping her feet like a tantruming toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet put the map snuggly away into her sticky travellers pack and gave her friend the biggest hug of her life. \u201cLook I know this isn\u2019t ideal but don\u2019t worry you and me have always managed to get out even the tightest of binds, so this cave isn\u2019t going to be able to stop us.\u201d Jet\u2019s warm words and even warmer embrace thawed Holly\u2019s tired and cold bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on let\u2019s go catch some sleep and we\u2019ll continue the hunt for Clara in the morning first thing\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a deluge of water pouring from the heavens the two friends scrambled to the maw of the cave. Looking it over it seemed quite safe, no obvious signs of monster infestation littered the entrance. There weren\u2019t any tracks either, though the rains made looking for them a task in itself. As they pressed on the ground outside the cave was now nothing more than a thick gloopy soup of viscous mud. \u201cDon\u2019t worry we\u2019ll get through this and be drying are gear in no time \u201cJet beamed, stretching out her limbs before blasting off in an explosive sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was sprinting full power with her usual vigour almost skipping effortlessly over the quagmire before her. That was until she came to the centre of the bog of course. Thanks to the heavy rain the centre of this patch had become like quicksand, Jets nimble feet effortlessly pulled into its sticky embrace. Jet began to panic as she sunk down to her waist and attempted to dig her legs free with her bare hands but no matter how much earth she shifted the rains just washed more mud to take its place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to let Holly realise her plan was unravelling almost as fast as she came up with it she yelled across. \u201cUmmm Holly, I\u2019m going to help you across ok? I know you\u2019re not as adept at travelling rough terrain like me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly simply stood there puzzled at how Jet standing in the centre of this bog was ever going to help her cross it. \u201cHow exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, you jump over to me and I\u2019ll spring you with my arms over to the other side. Think of me as a bouncy stepping stone. Then once you\u2019re across I\u2019ll toss you my pack and then you use it to pull me to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was truly sceptical now, sure Jet had done similar things in the past but with her current track record of bad luck things were bound to go wrong. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Holly questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t over think it just jump\u201d Jet encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly paced a bit clearly worried about the best course of action before giving her cheeks a quick slap for focus and deciding to make the leap. With all her might she leapt across to where Jet was she felt as though she was flying briefly before her boots made contact with Jet. With even more force she then rocketed forward sailing past the muck and landing roughly on the cold hard rock of the cave floor. \u201cOh my God I did it! I did it!\u201d she squealed hopping up and down in a cute display of accomplishment. \u201cJet did you see that!\u201d her smug face dropping into one of confusion as she looked back towards Jet who was now flat on her back in the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out Holly did execute Jets plan to use her as a springboard but not in the way Jet was expecting. As soon as Holly had begun her sprint towards her, her boot had kicked a large wad of dirt straight into Jets face. Jet had then attempted to yell out for Holly to abort the plan but found she could only spit out mouthfuls of mud. Then as Jet had looked up to see if Holly had heard her she was met by the horrifying site of Holly\u2019s filthy boots falling straight towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sickening squelch the two filthy soles squeezed a build-up of days of hiking as Holly\u2019s full weight pressed into her. Jet\u2019s neck bent backwards and her body sunk another foot into the goop as Jet felt Holly bend her knees and perch atop the poor woman\u2019s face. Then with explosive force Holly kicked off to make her leap. The treads of her boots scraping painfully across Jets face, some of the mud on her soles was even scooped up into Jets nose and mouth as she bounded forward. When she was finally across Jet was left dazed and confused facing up into the rainy skies above, two perfect boot prints were left imprinted on the poor girls eyes and cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cJet what the hell are you doing lazing about? You\u2019ll catch your death in that rain. Throw me you pack and let\u2019s get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet\u2019s world was still spinning as she tried to massage her divots out of her face and remove the last of the mud that she was forced to eat from Holly using her face as the caves welcome mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once recovered however Jet threw her pack at Holly and the two began the arduous task of pulling Jet free from her sticky bind. After a good ten minutes of pulling Jet had only her ankles still trapped and she was now laying out on the surface. A few more tugs from Holly and she would be home and dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then a horrific noise filled the air, hearing this Holly dropped the pack and peered into the eerie dank cave. Deep within the sound of something truly huge began to stir from within the cave. The walls shook as its booming steps began to come closer. There was definitely something living in this cave and knowing the area it was unlikely to be friendly. \u201cHolly quick pull me in! PULL ME IN!\u201d Jet screamed. Holly however just stood in terror as the footsteps bounced her an inch in the air with each heavy footfall. \u201cHOLLY FOR FUCK SAKE. PULL ME IN! \u201cJet pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Holly did snap out of it as she grabbed pack once more and began to pull. The booming steps were drawing nearer with each passing second and Holly couldn\u2019t stand having the entrance and this creature behind her. Every few seconds she would glance over her shoulder to ensure they still had time. By now the footfalls were deafening Holly and Jet both terrified of what was going to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly however couldn\u2019t take the pressure anymore her flight instinct had kicked in. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Jet, sorry, sorry, sorry\u201d She sobbed as she dropped the pack and ran to a small crack in the cave wall to hide. \u201cHOLLY COME BACK HERE! DON\u2019T LEAVE ME!\u201d Jet screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet flailed desperately to get out of the sticky bog but without help she knew the odds were slim. It was then she saw a huge shadow form on the cave wall. What came into view scared her more than anything she had ever seen before. A gigantic Troll girl stumbled out from her lair brandishing a fallen tree as a makeshift torch. The creature\u2019s size was truly colossal even by troll standards. Each of its feet could easily crush both Jet and Holly and with room to spare. It thick dumpy legs leading up to a loincloth that just covered its nethers before leading to a rotund belly that jutted out in front of it and supported its large breast covered by a similar cloth as it\u2019s loins. Its arms were muscular and clearly strong with the ease it swung its torch. Its face was fairly plain looking the only noticeable features were two large bottom teeth that jutted up and rested either side of its large nose. The troll had even stuck its hair back into a greasy and debris ridden ponytail clearly taking some pride in its physical appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet lay perfectly still trying desperately not to draw the creature\u2019s attention. It lumbered about towards her, each hefty foot step closing the gap between them. Soon it was directly in front of her its gigantic knobbled toes jiggling in the mud in front of her face. The smell wafting from between its toes was enough to make Jet gag and she had to summon all of her strength not to retch and make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jet\u2019s earthen soaked body must be blending in just enough to disguise the adventurer.

As far as she was concerned all she saw in front of her was a thick gloopy slop that was perfect for bathing in and that was exactly what it planned to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hefty slam it smashed its torch into the rock face of the cave entrance, ensuring it would have ample lighting while it bathed as well as allowing her to keep an eye peeled for some of the other monsters that may try and take this opportunity to steal or attack the troll. As even at its size there were other creatures here that make the troll seem more like a fairy than a giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis slam on the caves entrance also made Holly almost shriek as she was adamant the beast had spotted her and she had shuffled back as far as she was able just in time to avoid a tumbling of rocks that partially blocked her hiding place. After waiting a while to ensure no pudgy digits were trying to pry her from her hole Holly crept forward. With the entrance blocked all she could do now was peek outside to see where the beast had gone to and hopefully get Jet to help her free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw however made her wince in shock as its large foot was being lifted from its position and coming down squarely on top of a clearly terrified Jet, who at this point didn\u2019t even seem to care about being spotted and was franticly clawing away at the mud as the hefty limb flattened her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature then began to disrobe first removing its bra giving it a casual fling into the caves entrance and then peeling off its loin cloth. With a bend of its hips it attempted to pry it\u2019s clothing from its body but due to the fact the cloth was countless sizes to small and the countless months that tortured piece of fabric had spent in that dank crevasse it seemed stuck firmly to its cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a disgruntled grunt the troll began to jump in place and jiggle it\u2019s hips in an attempt to get the fabric free. Holly may have even found the site of this semi naked creature\u2019s display humorous if she wasn\u2019t reminded by Jets unfortunate predicament. With each leap in the air she was able to catch glimpses of the poor girl her face itched with even more pained expressions as she was slammed face first into the thick slop. Eventually however Jet was covered up with so much muck Holly couldn\u2019t even distinguish where on the beast foot she was adhered to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a large amount of effort the Troll did eventually free its loincloth and with a balance on one foot then the other it completed its removal and tossed it into the caves entrance, right in front of where Holly was hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly almost vomited on the spot as she saw the soiled garment splayed before her, countless stains littered on literally every surface and the smell alone was enough to make one contemplate suicide. Luckily for her she was able to retreat further in and take breaths of untainted air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jet however this was not the case. Her lungs have been screaming for air ever since this gigantic beast has splattered her across its foot and dumped her into the seemingly endless pool of mud. Fortunately as the troll settled into its bath and had sunk itself deep into the pool with only the top of its rotund belly poking free, she was given a brief respite. The troll had place its feet on the outskirts of the pool and the heavy rain began the task of washing the filth free.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith flattened lungs Jet tried to take in as much air as she could unsure how long she would be above ground and not under it. With every fibre of her being she willed her body to reform, desperate to free herself from the unwitting clutches of her captor but as if in response to this the troll lifted her other foot and absent mindedly scratched Jets spot with her thick yellow toenail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was trying to turn her face away as the disgusting digit painfully clawed its way up her crushed body, chunks of her gear even getting torn up and cast into the bog bellow. No matter the struggle however she could do nothing as it finally made contact with her face. The smell of a warehouse of overripe cheese began to assault her senses as the crusty nail scraped up and down the poor girls face. The toe nail deciding this spot was in need of more thorough treatment began scratching more fervently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was in agony, with each scrape her flesh felt like it was going to be torn off but thanks to Holly\u2019s spell it just spread her face out thinner over the ball of the trolls foot. The nail even found its way into Jets mouth dragging and spreading her tongue out to ensure she got a nice taste of this trolls brand of foot stink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully after a good while the toe receded back to resting as the troll began to shift to ensure its front got an adequate soak in the mud. Jets world was turned upside down as the feet were facing the other way. She was now facing towards the cave entrance and the cleansing rains were now effectively waterboarding her as they cascaded down, bringing with them a distinctly tainted taste of troll sweat with them. They were also acting as Jets means of salvation though. Dues to the battering her body took thanks to the large toenail parts of her body had shifted, this then allowed water to pass underneath her and slowly but surely she was peeling free albeit still incredibly disfigured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In fact to look at Jet now you wouldn\u2019t even be able to tell she was even human. Her already long limbs were now cartoonishly so. Her torso and head flattened out to almost the same length and width of the trolls foot. Her once defined features of her face blurred through and her tongue stretched out almost two thirds of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later Jets miserable form finally slid free from the confines of the filthy Trolls foot <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet slid into the mud as the Troll rested on her stomach. Jet's cartoonishly stretched out form twitched as she attempted to move, glancing over towards where Holly was. The healers eyes lit up, ushering Jet over-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed that her friend wasn't coming out to help- the stretched out thief slowly wormed her way out of the mud, not having too much strength. She heard movement behind her as the Troll shifted positions, buy Jet just ignored it- desperate to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a startled sound came out of the Troll- it's gargled rawr echoed out as it suddenly got up. Jet squirmed it terror as the familer shadow of the trolls foot hovered over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calloused heel slammed down on poor jet- before lifting and slamming down again with harsh grinding. Holly could only watch as the troll stomped, a look of rage and fear in the disgusting creatures face as it tried to obliterate what it possibly thought was a pile of snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct forced Jet to panic as her senses were overloaded. She continuously tried to escape, recieving more and more dirty stomps from the startled troll girl. Eventually- Jet was back stuck to the trolls foot as the now aware creature triumphantly ground it's disgusting foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah- stay still-\" Holly begged on the side lines, watching the troll peel the tattered Jet from her foot for examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of breath and desperate to avoid more conflict, Jet did exactly as Holly wished without even hearing her. The unlucky thief stayed still as the ogre examined her. The face almost looked human, albiet dirty and sweaty with an impossible underbite for two jagged tusks. The horrible stenche wafted over poor Jet as the Orc snorted around her- smelling the air a bit before grinning triumphantly before opening her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet wasn't prepared as the Troll took a bite.<br>\r\n\"AHH- YOU STUPID-\" She tried to yell, but nothing was audable as the giant tugged and yanked, much to everyones horror. After being treated as a chewtoy for a bit, the troll spat Jet out with annoyance. Examining her weakened body again for a moment, this time stretching her new toy out a few times with a bored look. Both Holly and Jet hoped the troll would get bored, but the troll instead just dragged Jet uncaringly as it walked back into the mud bath- trailing Jet behind her across the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet tried wiggling again, but the troll just slammed her into the mud with it's fist. It was obviously less scared and was trying to find a way to use its prize. With it's ass submerged, the giant grunted as putred bubbled emerged from the swamp. Jet gagged from the smell before feeing the trolls fingers threading around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll looked with curiousity as it threaded each limb between its fingers- a fleeting curiousity as it watched for a moment before looking up as the rain started to pick up again. It opened its disgusting maw upwards, catching water into its drooling mouth as the hand with Jet flopped down, scooping up mud with jet- slamming it into her slimy armpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one smiling was the troll as it massaged Jet into the disgusting pit, making happy deep throated gargling sounds as it relaxed. By the time it was finished, Jet was practically dripping from the trolls finger tips with sweat and other disgusting gunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet weakly looked up at the troll, who looked like she just remembered the thing she caught. Dropping her toy into the bath, the Troll watched- waiting for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in Jet was telling her to run as the Troll watched, poking her occasionally.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet and Holly raced up the ridge as fast as they could, until they could finally see the entrance to the cave in the distance. Carefully sliding down the muddy slope, the two wet and tired explorers ran headlong into the cave. Jet, being the faster girl, entered the cave first. She smiled as the rain stopped pounding onto her back, but quickly spotted that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pile of conspicuously placed leaves and sticks was lying out right in the middle of the cave floor. Jet was a master thief, and she could easily tell that those sticks and leaves were serving as a poorly disguised cover-up for a pitfall trap. She smirked at the poorly designed trap, but her smile faded as she heard the sound of pounding footsteps behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet barely had time to turn around before Holly smacked right into her. Holly, who had closed her eyes for a minute after some rain splashed down into them, didn\u2019t notice that Jet had halted so abruptly in the cave. As such, she roughly collided with her best friend, knocking them both over. The two girls shrieked as they landed on the pile of leaves and sticks, which predictably gave way immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor dropping away, the two friends spiraled down a long and windy tunnel, screaming in terror. Jet had fallen first, and so Holly\u2019s body was pressed down on top of hers. It didn\u2019t take long for Jet\u2019s body to begin to be squished under Holly\u2019s heavier frame. As the slide progressed, Jet\u2019s face was flattened and quickly sucked under Holly, pinned beneath the blonde\u2019s sizable rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet could hardly comprehend the amount of pain she felt as Holly raced down the slide, her ass grinding Jet\u2019s face against the bumpy rock. Soon, Jet\u2019s whole body was pulled under Holly, crushed by her thighs. By the time the slide ended, and Holly was roughly dumped out into a small room lit by a torch, Jet was smeared onto the backside of her mage friend\u2019s dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly groaned, standing up and brushing herself off. As she ripped and pulled dirt, leaves, and sticks from her dress, she absentmindedly peeled Jet\u2019s flat body free as well. Holly, unaware of what she was doing, carelessly tossed Jet\u2019s squishy body over her shoulder and into a pile of bones. Jet landed in a crumpled heap, and tried furiously to reform as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJet? Where did you go?\u201d Holly cried out, her voice echoing down the tunnel in front of her. She had closed her eyes in fear during the slide, and had no idea where Jet had disappeared to. Not wanting to be left alone in the spooky room, Holly sprinted down the tunnel, vanishing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet took another five minutes to fully inflate to her normal size, as the rock slide had done quite a number on her. Exhausted and sore, Jet limped down the tunnel after Holly, desperate to find Holly before something terrible happened to her. Or before something terrible happened to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the small room, sporadic, lit torches led the way for a while, until the tunnel led out into a wide-open room. The room was constructed of pavement and stone, so Jet could tell that it wasn\u2019t any ordinary cave. She and Holly had stumbled into a dungeon! Checking for posterity\u2019s sake, Jet pulled out her map, and noted the tiny dungeon symbol behind the drawing of the cave. She hadn\u2019t even noticed it earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Jet noticed three different pathways, each branching off into a different direction. Each tunnel looked the same as the last, with no clear indicators to let her know where each path would lead. Swearing under her breath, Jet examined her options. Holly could be down any of the three paths. She could be suffering at this very moment, and Jet couldn\u2019t do a thing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing her own anxiety away, Jet grimaced and clenched her fists, determined to reunite with Holly and escape this crazy dungeon. With reckless abandon, she picked a tunnel at random and charged down it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet ran down the tunnel, heedless of any danger that might lie in wait. She merely wanted to get out of this creepy dungeon, and to do that she\u2019d first need to catch up with Holly and keep her safe. Heavens knew that Holly was incapable of defending herself, as the blonde mage wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. Of course, Jet thought wryly, Holly had certainly hurt her quite a bit since this whole \u201csquishy\u201d business had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the passageway was lit by multiple torches, presumably magic-ignited so that the flames never died out. However, Jet\u2019s attention was focused firmly in front of her, and not down near her feet, which is why she let out a startled cry when her feet slipped on a gooey puddle and flew out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet tumbled to the floor, landed hard on her side, and partly coated in the same viscous substance she\u2019d slipped on. Groaning, Jet looked at the puddle of pink goo in confusion, tracing her finger along the surface to try and determine exactly what the mysterious liquid was. Her concentration was only broken when a thick drop of the goo landed on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlucky thief girl shot her head up, her heart skipping a beat as she spotted a large pink shape hanging from the ceiling, partly hidden in shadow. She jumped to her feet in a desperate attempt to run, losing her balance once more on the wet, sloppy ground. Her eyes widened in terror as the pink shape dropped from the ceiling, landing right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet\u2019s fear turned to disbelief as the pink blob materialized into a significantly more recognizable shape. Though the creature\u2019s entire body consisted of pink goop, it was clear Jet was face-to-face with a slime girl, a monster girl she had heard about once or twice. The slime girl\u2019s human features and limbs took form, while Jet watched in abject fascination crossed with intimidation, not realizing she was wasting her one chance to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink slime girl\u2019s face had an expression of innocent curiosity and an air of childlike naivety. Her hair, which was really just more slime, was long and pretty, framing her cute face. Jet noted dryly that her young demeanor contrasted sharply with the rest of her considerably curvaceous and shapely body, almost unbelievably so. The slime girl had a lot of goopy mass, being easily over six feet tall, and thus her body reflected that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Jet stammered out a greeting. \u201cUh\u2026hi there\u2026slime girl.\u201d She fidgeted under the slime\u2019s intensely focused gaze. \u201cI was just\u2026passing by! Looking for my friend Holly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime tilted her head to the side, eyes twinkling. She crawled forward slowly, reaching her hand out towards Jet. Jet cried out and backed up, wincing as she felt her back touch the wall of the passage. The slime girl kept moving closer, viscous goo dripping from her body and pooling around Jet, effectively trapping her from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026wh-what are y-you\u2026doing? I need to get back to my friend Holly\u2026\u201d Jet inquired, trying to mask how frightened she really was. Her question was answered as the slime girl smiled and pulled her body onto Jet\u2019s lower legs. Much heavier than Jet\u2019s squishy body, the slime girl smushed the thief girl\u2019s legs flat in an instant beneath her gooey form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet abandoned all pretense of friendliness, and began to thrash about, frantically trying to escape the slime girl. Her attempts at escape were rendering useless almost immediately, as the slime girl oozed further up her body, burying her torso beneath her viscous, giant ass. The slime girl\u2019s outrageously massive breasts pressed down onto Jet\u2019s shoulders, flattening them, and the slime\u2019s hands held down Jet\u2019s own. The friendly sparkle still played across the slime\u2019s innocent face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOLLY! HOLLY!\u201d Jet began to scream, unable to move out from underneath the slime girl. All around, the slime\u2019s copious amounts of goop were adhering to her crushed body, gluing her to the monster girl who was so easily dominating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl emitted a bubbling noise from her mouth that sounded almost like laughter. She pressed her face so close to Jet\u2019s own that Jet\u2019s distraught cries to her blonde best friend died off. A powerful and intoxicating scent wafted from the slime girl\u2019s entire body. Then, taking the unlucky thief girl by complete surprise, opened her mouth to speak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026lee! Huhlee! Fer\u2026end! Ferend!\u201d The slime gurgled, her speech warbled by bubbling noises deep within her throat. It took Jet a second to realize that the slime girl was saying the words \u201cHolly\u201d and \u201cFriend\u201d. Jet didn\u2019t even know slimes were capable of speaking English, though it seemed more like the impressionable goo girl was copying Jet rather than learning from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking maybe she could communicate with the pink slime girl, Jet opened her mouth to speak, only to find her face pressed flat by the slime girl\u2019s left hand. Caught off guard, Jet renewed her futile struggles to wriggle free, even as the slime girl slowly and purposefully crumpled her head in her hands. She proceeded to do the same to Jet\u2019s entire body, until Jet was just a bunched-up ball, coated in disgusting pink slop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl let out another gargling giggle, standing up and holding Jet gently in her hands. Jet felt fear like she had never experienced before as the slime pressed her basketball sized body against her prodigious chest. As the slime applied more force, Jet\u2019s body was quickly shoved inside of the slime\u2019s gooey body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless and helpless, Jet found herself floating inside of the slime\u2019s girl liquidy body, her crumpled up form contained partly in the slime\u2019s breasts, and partly in her chest area. It felt like she was submerged in a swimming pool filled with jelly. She struggled for breath, but was unable to move while crushed flat, and found the thick, viscous goop too pressuring to reform while inside of the slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl smiled happily, looking down at her little captive floating inside of her own body. \u201cHuhlee! Ferend!\u201d She warbled, pure innocence radiating from her face. Jet knew she would dissolve inside of the slime\u2019s body if kept prisoner for too long, but as the slime girl began slowly walking down the passage, it seemed as if she had a destination in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth of her situation dawned on Jet like a meteor slamming down on her from space. Jet realized that the slime girl had mistakenly come to the thought that Jet\u2019s name was Holly, and that she wanted to be her friend. Unable to say otherwise, Jet feared the pink slime girl now planned to take her back to where she lived (probably deep in the dungeon) and keep her there as a \u201cfriend\u201d for her to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet wanted desperately to escape this slime girl, or at least set the truth straight with her, but she found her will to fight waning. The intoxicating aroma the slime girl emitted was overwhelming, and a lazy smile crossed Jet\u2019s squashed face. Her last thoughts were of Holly, before she finally passed into unconsciousness, carried off inside the body of the voluptuous, playful slime girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet grabbed Holly\u2019s hand, and began leading her towards the cave. Though they had no idea what sorts of horrors would lurk inside of the cave, it was the only way they were going to get out of the pouring rain and avoid contracting hypothermia. The two weary travelers clomped through the mud, heading up and over the ridge and down towards the safety of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the ridge, Jet paused to catch her breath and wipe rain out of her eyes. However, Holly didn\u2019t realize that she had stopped moving, and bumped straight into her. Jet let out a short gasp as she pinwheeled her arms, losing her balance. The unlucky thief slipped on the muddy ground and tumbled painfully down the slope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJet!\u201d Holly cried out, reaching for Jet, but it was too late. Jet flopped head over heels all the way down the slope, her body bouncing and sliding down the slippery ridge. By the time she slid to a stop at the bottom, various parts of her body were flattened and crushed, and she was coated head-to-toe in mud and grime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly carefully slid down the slope, maintaining her balance as she descended to where Jet had landed. Jet mentally sighed angrily, and began willing her body to reform to normal so she could reform and stand up. She stared up straight into the sky, rain endlessly splashing down onto her face. A few moments later, the dark sky was replaced by the sight of two black boots, and Jet mentally screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly slid to a stop at the bottom of the slope, digging her feet into the ground to halt her momentum and keep her balance. Unfortunately, the careless mage didn\u2019t realize she was standing on her best friend, and had just violently pressed Jet\u2019s face into her black boots. Holly eventually took a few steps to the side, allowing Jet to begin reforming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJet! Where are you?\u201d Holly spun around, looking for best friend. Jet finally finished reforming and sat up, wiping the mud off of her face. Holly whipped around and spotted her. \u201cOh. There you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026*cough*\u2026you stepped on me!\u201d Jet hacked, trying to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Holly earnestly apologized. She walked over to grab Jet\u2019s hand and help her to her feet. As she bent down and stretched out her hand, the soggy ground beneath her shifted, and she topple forward with a cute yelp. Jet shrieked as her mage companion collapsed onto her, squashing her flat again and forcing her under a thick layer of mud. Jet\u2019s face was squished beneath Holly\u2019s fairly sizable chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly groaned and picked herself back up, then noticed what had happened to Jet. She dug her out of the mud, and gently coaxed her body into reforming. As Jet\u2019s flat body began inflating back to normal shape, a soft laughing noise rose up from behind Holly. Holly screamed, dropping Jet\u2019s still reforming body back into the mud, and whirled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer screams died in her throat as she looked up at the imposing form of a monster girl that had snuck up behind her and Jet. More specifically, it was a lamia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamia, as per usual, was a normal human from the waist up. She had smooth, tan skin, sparkling red eyes, and long black hair. Her abundantly sized chest was bare for all the world to see. However, from the waist down, she had the long and twisting body of a snake. Her snake half was extremely long and mesmerizing, a hypnotic mix of red and black coloring. The lamia was also slightly bigger than a normal human being, making her even more terrifying. The lamia giggled at Holly\u2019s terrified expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026aren\u2019t you just the cutest thing.\u201d The lamia cooed, slithering slightly closer to Holly. Holly backed up, until her feet were squashing Jet\u2019s body into the mud. Holly slipped on Jet\u2019s wet, muddy body, and toppled onto her rear end. The lamia laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit rainy to be playing outside in the mud?\u201d She smiled. Her tail moved over to Holly, and hovered above her head. \u201cGo ahead. Grab it. Gently though.\u201d Tentatively, Holly grabbed the lamia\u2019s tail. The lamia lifted Holly to her feet, discreetly biting her lip and blushing. The tail is the most sensitive area on a lamia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2026are you?\u201d Holly stuttered, a mix of cold rain and pure horror causing her to stammer. The lamia smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Veria. Veria the lamia, as you probably guessed by now.\u201d Veria laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me\u2026um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHolly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHolly. Come with me. I have a warm little abode that you can stay at. Much cozier than this horrid rain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Holly glanced around nervously. Veria placed her tail comfortingly around Holly\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can trust me Holly. I\u2019m much nicer than many other monster girls you\u2019d meet hanging out in this rain. Follow me.\u201d Veria started to slither towards the tree line. Holly followed, taking a stop forward. Her black boot splashed down into the mud, stomping on poor Jet\u2019s face. Thankfully, Holly looked down and spotted her mud caked companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh! I forgot about all about you! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Holly cried, ripping Jet out of the mud. She pressed Jet\u2019s flat body gently against her chest. Veria looked at her in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat squishy thing is a human? Like you?\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. She\u2019s just\u2026under the effect of a spell. She\u2019ll reform at your house.\u201d Holly explained. Veria smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026curious.\u201d Lamia and Holly ventured for a few minutes through the nearby woods, finally reaching a small hut. The hut was sturdy and surprisingly roomy, made of stone and brick. Inside, the hut contained a small fireplace and a massive bed that Holly assumed belonged to Veria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you build all of this?\u201d Holly asked. Veria thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was\u2026uh\u2026abandoned.\u201d She concluded, switching the subject. \u201cHave a seat Holly and Jet.\u201d Veria slithered over to the fire, relishing in the warmth. Holly joined her, setting Jet down on the floor beside her. Jet\u2019s body began to slowly, slowly reform back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Holly moved to enjoy the warmth of the fire, she set her unfortunate friend down between herself and the larger body of the lamia. While she still had some reservations about trusting the snake-girl it was hard to resist the comforts of this cosy little shack, and this had to be better for Jet\u2019s safety than the muddy ground outside. At least she wouldn\u2019t accidentally step on her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings weren\u2019t entirely safe here though, and while Jet was still struggling to pop back to normal she suddenly felt strong arms wrapping around her form and pulling her to her feet. With a strangled squawk the thief was turned around and found herself far too close for comfort with the lounging lamia, a curious smile crossing Veria\u2019s lips as she watched this strange human reinflate. \u201cOhhh, you\u2019re just the cutest thing aren\u2019t you? So squishy.\u201d Without any care for Jet\u2019s attempts at protest, she started to pinch and stretch her cheeks like one would a child, except that with the lamia\u2019s larger size and the brunette\u2019s rubbery nature, the action ended up contorting her entire face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching with a small grimace, Holly laughed nervously in response to Veria\u2019s words, easily able to tell that Jet didn\u2019t appreciate the attention, but not wanting to say anything that might anger the much larger girl. \u201cYes, umm\u2026 that\u2019s Jet. She\u2019s usually not like this. Normally she\u2019s actually quite strong and charming but, well, it\u2019s been a tough couple of days for her I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria frowned at that, finally letting go of Jet\u2019s face and letting the cheeks snap back into shape, but immediately followed-up the action by wrapping her powerful arms around the thief\u2019s body and hugging her to her chest, burying the smaller woman\u2019s face between her bountiful bare breasts. \u201cAww, you poor little thing. Well don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re safe here with me now.\u201d While not as big as some monsters, the lamia was still easily bigger than Jet, and each of her breasts was half again the size of the brunette\u2019s head, wrapping around her entire torso and squishing her between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off guard by this sudden full-frontal assault, Jet took a moment to figure out how she was supposed to react, before settling on spluttering and raising her arms in a futile attempt to free herself from Veria\u2019s strong hold. She did at least manage to get her hands free enough to try and push back, but the appendages just sank into the creamy flesh of the lamia\u2019s chest, and didn\u2019t even seem to register to the much larger girl. Worse, it was apparent that the raven-haired monster had now folded her arms across her chest, since the massive mounds were pressing in from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, err, I\u2026\u201d Wringing her hands fretfully, Holly tried to find the words to free her friend, but was unable to do anything but gesture vaguely at her new companion\u2019s chest. Whether she understood, or was just tired of that particular game, the healer was eventually able to heave a sigh of relief when Veria finally released Jet, pulling the unlucky thief\u2019s squished head from her chest and allowing her to slide down to lean against her stomach and the highest points of her scaled underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Jet was able to reform pretty quickly this time she soon found herself held like a teddy bear, as the lamia\u2019s strong arms wrapped around her chest and held her flush against her body. Veria\u2019s chest formed a shelf above her, and every time the snake-girl inhaled the expanding breasts bumped against the top of Jet\u2019s head. It was one of the most embarrassing situations the young brunette had ever experienced, making her feel like something between a child and a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to the thoughts of her living hug pillow, Veria flashed her fanged teeth in a broad smile as she turned back to Holly. \u201cWhy are the two of you in monster territory? It\u2019s a dangerous place for humans. Especially for a squishy little cutie like this.\u201d She emphasised her point with a tight squeeze to Jet\u2019s chest, producing a high-pitched exhale not unlike the sound of a squeaky toy. \u201cHehe.\u201d Clearly amused, Veria repeated the action, producing the sound again while she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully twice was apparently enough, and Jet was able to regain her breath in time to offer a response. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a traitor. And we can take care of ourselves.\u201d If anything, those words only made the lamia more amused, and she responded by giving the thief another longer squeeze, before turning her attention back to Holly. \u201cHmm\u2026 and what kind of traitor would that be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Jet was both confused and annoyed as to why that question wasn\u2019t directed towards her, but quickly got an answer to at least one of those questions when Veria\u2019s snake-like lower half began to wrap itself around her body, squeezing tightly enough to prevent her from speaking. She would have been forgiven for interpreting this as an attack, but in truth it was simply a means by which the lamia showed her affection, slowly constricting herself around her cute new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly bit her lip, again torn between objecting to Jet\u2019s treatment and appeasing their companion. In the end, concern over ending up in the same situation herself won out, and she smiled nervously. \u201cWell, we were recovering a lost mirror for a kindly old lady. The two of us had teamed up with another treasure hunter named Clara. We found the mirror, but unfortunately Clara betrayed us and took the mirror to sell for her own. Jet got cursed with some really bad luck at the same time, so it was pretty unfortunate.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWe heard she went this way, so now we\u2019re seeking revenge.\u201d The blonde still wasn\u2019t particularly happy with that decision, but she wasn\u2019t going to abandon Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmile still on her face, Veria peered down between the mounds of her breasts at Jet, still wrapped up in the coils of her lower body. \u201cYou have bad luck?\u201d If anything her smile only got broader, and her tail tightened even further in an overly affectionate embrace. \u201cWell then you found the right girl to be rescued by. I have excellent luck. If you stick with me your bad luck will be a thing of the past. Take today for instance, you got stomped into the mud, whereas I met two super cute girls, and now you\u2019re safe and warm and all lovingly wrapped up in my body. Just perfect right?\u201d She wasn\u2019t really expecting a response to that, and certainly wasn\u2019t going to get one from the constricted girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jet struggled for air, Holly blushed furiously at the compliment thrown her way. Generally lacking confidence, she was easily persuaded by praise and kind words, and usually relied on her best friend to help her keep an objective mindset, but with Jet incapacitated she was free to act on her own. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice of you Veria, thank you. I think, umm\u2026 I think you\u2019re very pretty, so\u2026 ah!\u201d The healer was taken off guard as the happy lamia reached out to pull her into a hug with a joyous yell, nuzzling their faces together while she cooed and her tail constricted even more in excitement, crushing Jet to paste within its coils while the other girls were too distracted with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her cheek against Holly\u2019s, Veria could barely contain her delight at the human\u2019s words, so so happy to have made such a cute new friend, something that was extremely hard to come by in these lands. \u201cOh thank you, thank you! The three of us are going to the best friends ever, I can tell.\u201d She smiled broadly as she finally pulled back, giving the smaller a girl a chance to compose herself. \u201cAnd as your friend, it\u2019s my duty to help you in your quest. The two of you can sleep here tonight, and then tomorrow I\u2019ll come with you to help to track down this Clara girl. I\u2019ll be really useful I promise. I\u2019ve been here for a while, so I know my way around these parts.\u201d Oddly, even though she knew well enough she had two new friends, she didn\u2019t think to check on the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing, Holly smiled back as she was allowed to put a bit of space between herself and the playful lamia. \u201cReally? That would be really useful, thank you so much Veria. I look forward to travelling with you.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a better idea than travelling with Clara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with that response, Veria finally released Jet with one last squeeze, allowing the now thoroughly squished girl to fall listlessly to the ground. In the next moment however she was slithering the entire length of her body over the unfortunate thief, flattening her between her warm scales and the floor as she moved towards her bed, seemingly unaware of what she was doing. She flicked Holly in the face with the tip of her tail as she did so, blushing bashfully at the action. \u201cGlad to hear it. Now I don\u2019t know about you but I for one need my beauty sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly returned Veria\u2019s blush twofold at the sensual sensation of the tail running across her skin, someone knowing that the action was a lot more intimate than a mere touch of a hand would be. \u201cAh, right, yes. Umm\u2026 and, and where will I be sleeping exactly?\u201d Distracted by the actions of the naked lamia, the blonde\u2019s mind didn\u2019t even turn to her unfortunate friend as she shifted nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face the other girl, Veria considered for a moment, her eyes flicking between the fire and her bed before finally settling on her answer and smiling back at her new friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou know\u2026the wooden floor is hardly a comfortable place to sleep.\u201d Veria smiled mischievously. \u201cI\u2019d hate for my precious, cute guests to sleep on the floor. Why don\u2019t you sleep in my bed?\u201d Veria gestured to her bed. Holly, flustered at receiving another compliment, shuffled over to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria slithered back a few feet to allow Holly room to cross over to the bed, revealing Jet to the world once more. Veria glanced down and spotted the squished, crumpled thief girl. She gasped, and scooped Jet up off of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost forgot about you gorgeous.\u201d Veria giggled, planting a quick kiss on Jet\u2019s lips before tossing her flat body onto the bed. Veria slithered around to the other side of the bed, stretching her arms and yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Holly had just finished slipping out of her dirty mage dress. Though staying in the same house as a lamia still creeped her out, she wasn\u2019t going to resist Veria\u2019s hospitality. She also didn\u2019t feel comfortable sleeping in her dress, so she had decided to strip down into just a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad in only her underwear, Holly flopped backwards onto the massive, spacious bed. Of course, she hadn\u2019t seen Veria toss Jet onto the bed a moment prior, and so she ended up squashing her best friend as she sat, burying Jet\u2019s head beneath her ass. Veria noticed all of this, and laughed, slithering up into the bed. Holly looked over at her, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026are you doing Veria?\u201d Holly asked, feeling a little uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever do you mean? I\u2019m getting into bed.\u201d Veria explained, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. She pulled the rest of her body onto the bed and smiled. Despite how huge the bed was, Veria\u2019s incredibly lengthy body took up almost all of the space. Holly tensed up a little, so Veria gently used her tail to ease Holly back into a reclining position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t bite Holly. You\u2019re far too cute to eat.\u201d Veria cooed, causing Holly to blush. As the playful lamia flirted with Holly, Jet screamed and wiggled as much as she could, just barely managing to cause a slight vibration sensation against Holly\u2019s butt. Perplexed, Holly reached under her butt, felt Jet, and yanked her squashed body free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gosh, I\u2019m so sorry Jet.\u201d Holly apologized, setting Jet down on the bed between her and Veria. Jet slowly began to reform, her limbs popping back into 3D shapes. Veria watched with rapt attention, her eyes gleaming. After a few minutes, Jet was almost fully back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA playful grin on her face, Veria moved her lower snaked half over just a bit, enough to keep half of Jet\u2019s body pinned beneath her warm, scaly flesh. Lying against the bed, she wrapped her arms around Holly, taking the mage by surprising. In a soothing manner, Veria rubbed her sensitive tail up and down Holly\u2019s exposed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly relented, allowing herself to be pulled into a warm, inviting embrace in Veria\u2019s arms. As the two hugged, Jet\u2019s head finally reformed, only to be squashed between the two females\u2019 massive breasts. Her head instantly flattened into a paper-thin shape again as two round mounds of flesh compressed her head from both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the back, Holly\u2019s bra-covered breasts squished into her, while Veria\u2019s humongous, naked boobs crushed her from the front. Jet\u2019s face was pressed firmly into the nipple of Veria\u2019s left breast, and sweat from both women dripped onto her. Jet screamed in frustration, to no avail. Her soft vibrations were muffled by Holly\u2019s bra, and they only succeeded in tickling Veria\u2019s breasts, much to the lamia\u2019s excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly remained oblivious to the embarrassing torment she was subjecting Jet to, and swiftly fell into a deep, relaxing slumber. Veria\u2019s bed was the most comfortable thing she had ever slept on, and Veria herself presented the most warm, inviting, and soft pillow Holly had ever laid her head on. She was fast asleep after only a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was asleep, Veria smoothly moved a few feet away from her, finally allowing Jet time to breath and reform. However, before Jet could even think about enjoying a chance to rest, Veria grabbed her squishy body from the bed, latching onto her head with her hands, and her feet with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria pulled, stretching Jet\u2019s battered body out further than anything had stretched it before. Jet mentally cried out in surprise, unused to the feeling of her rubbery body being pulled out so far. Smiling with an almost childlike glee, Veria pulled and stretched Jet until she was nearly ten feet long. She then manipulated her squishy body until she was several feet wide as well, expertly maneuvering her hands and tail. Soon, Jet had been turned into a large rectangular shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her work, Veria draped Jet over her body, letting the flat, unlucky thief girl rest atop her naked, half snake half woman self. She had turned Jet into the world\u2019s first human blanket, a fact Jet realized with a mix of disbelief and horror. Laughing softly, Veria curled Jet around her body, pinning a little of her under her heavy snake half, ensuring Jet wouldn\u2019t reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tightly squeezed Jet\u2019s upper body around her chest, relishing in how soft, smooth, and warm Jet was against her bare skin. Veria could hardly believe that the blanket she was now wrapping around herself was actually a human girl. Holly and Jet were the first two humans Veria had ever become friends with, and she was ecstatic about meeting them. They were both irresistibly cute in their own ways, and Veria couldn\u2019t wait to accompany them on their quest, playing with them all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Veria smiled happily at these thoughts, she too drifted into a peaceful sleep. Only Jet remained awake, reeling at the awkward sensation of having her body be in so many different places at once, and at such a big size. Her face was buried in Veria\u2019s ample bosom, but the rest of her was wrapped and contorted at weird angles, curving around Veria\u2019s monster girl body. Eventually though, Jet drifted off into a fitful and uncomfortable unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, sunlight poured in through an open window, and the fire in the fireplace had gone out. Veria was stirred awake by a rather ravenous hunger craving, and she sat up, rubbing her eyes. Glancing around her room, she was almost startled to see Holly lying in bed beside her. Then, the memories of the previous night returned to her, and her surprise turned to soft laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was sprawled out across the bed, a limb pointing in each direction. Her mouth was open, and drooling. To make matters even funnier, Jet\u2019s blanket shaped body had somehow been peeled away from Veria and onto Holly during the middle of the night. Most of Jet was buried under Holly, pinned against the bed by the blonde mage\u2019s bodacious body. However, Jet\u2019s neck was squeezed between Holly\u2019s quite thick thighs, and her face was mashed firmly into Holly\u2019s squishy rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria\u2019s cute laughter soon roused Holly from her slumber, and the mage propped herself up on one arm and rubbed her eyes with the other. She looked around the room sleepily, until her eyes widened upon seeing Veria. She was about to scream, before Veria rubbed her head affectionately with her tail, and planted a quick kiss on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning sleepy head.\u201d Veria smiled, slithering out of bed. \u201cWe have a back-stabbing thief to catch, don\u2019t we?\u201d She moved to the door of her house, and swung it open. \u201cI\u2019m going to go outside and grab breakfast. Get yourself and Jet ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Jet?\u201d Holly inquired, turning her body over onto a sitting position. Jet\u2019s mangled body was twisted and pulled by Holly\u2019s sweaty skin. Her face was yanked under the blonde mage as she sat, crushed by her best friend\u2019s huge butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, cutie.\u201d Veria grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s under you.\u201d Veria left the house and headed outside, giggling. Holly glanced down at the soft, comfortable blanket wrapped and tangled around her body. She was confused at what Veria\u2019s statement meant, but simply shrugged and stood up. She slipped back into her dress, as Jet looked up at the ceiling, crushed beyond belief. She willed her body to reform quickly, but she was too worn out. She also had an ass shaped crater in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly turned back to the bed, and grabbed the blanket, deciding to do Veria a favor and make the bed for her. Humming a little song to herself, she began bunching Jet\u2019s body up into a big ball, not even taking notice of what little human features remained on Jet\u2019s tortured, tired body. Jet tried to mentally scream at Holly, and urge her to stop, but her futile ploy was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Veria returned with a dead pig in hand, Holly had spread Jet out across the bed, neatly and precisely. She had then sat back down, this time crushing one of Jet\u2019s hands under her butt. Veria burst out laughing, overcome with hysterics. Holly tiled her head innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is so funny Veria?\u201d She said. Veria wiped a tear from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant what I said, Holly. Jet WAS under you. She\u2019s the blanket!\u201d Veria pointed at the bed. Holly looked over her shoulder, finally noticing Jet\u2019s stretched and almost comedic looking fact. Holly leapt to her feet with a startled yell, and Veria collapsed into howling laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Jet was reformed back to normal. She and Holly had just finished eating a nice bacon breakfast (after Holly had cooked the pig with a small fire spell). Veria had eaten her own full pig, and had finished digesting it at the same time Jet and Holly finished their meal and packed their belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlikely trio left the house, heading out into the woods in search of the traitorous Clara. Jet was silently seething at how flirty and playful Veria was being, while Holly was finding herself to be quite enraptured by the beautiful snake girl. All-in-all, Jet decided that she could survive Veria\u2019s unabashed playfulness if it meant finally catching Clara. At least, Jet hoped she could survive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the trio headed deeper into the woods, Veria moved out in front, since she was the one who knew her way in these lands. In doing so she made sure to run the tip of her tail along the chins of both of her new friends, something which made Holly blush and Jet scowl as she was nearly knocked off her feet by the action. The thief was still reluctant to trust the lamia after everything that had happened, but she figured she didn\u2019t have much of a choice in the circumstances, especially now that her blonde companion had become so attached. If she didn\u2019t know any better she would have said that Holly was falling for the snake-girl\u2019s charms, but that would be ridiculous\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jet, any misgivings she might have regarding Veria were the least of her troubles right now. The storm from the night before had cleared but it had left the ground lose and muddy, and the cursed girl was losing her footing every second step. Already she\u2019d stumbled into her companions a dozen times or more, and while Holly expressed some concern on these occasions, the lamia never missed an opportunity to give Jet a squeeze whenever she stumbled into reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particular slide saw the brunette crashing right into Veria\u2019s powerful tail, which responded by wrapping around her head and giving it a good squeeze. By the time she was released, the thief could do little but stumble blindly as her face struggled to reform, and would undoubtedly have fallen again if her new \u2018friend\u2019 hadn\u2019t kept a portion of her tail at her back for support. She supposed that at least showed that the lamia had some concern for her safety, though not nearly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst was yet to come though, as less than a minute later, as Veria fell back for a moment and Holly strode out ahead, Jet\u2019s foot caught on a raised tree root. Her rubbery body responded by bending at the ankle, and what should have been an ordinary trip was turned into a face-first plunge directly into her best friend\u2019s butt. Startled by the sudden impact, Holly fell back, her legs going out from under her as her rear plummeted down, compacting the entire length of Jet\u2019s body as it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, the healer was left sitting in the mud with a bewildered expression, a giggling Veria circling around her with a smile\u2026 and with no sign left at all of their third companion. Jet had disappeared entirely beneath Holly\u2019s booty, flattened so completely that her presence was indistinguishable from the muddy ground beneath her. The force of the impact had driven the crushed remains of her head between her companion\u2019s buttocks, and she now found herself squeezed from all sides by the powerful muscles of the blonde\u2019s posterior. All she could think of through the pain was that surely there was a limit to how many times this stuff could happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to her friend\u2019s situation, Holly squirmed in embarrassment as she looked up at the laughing Veria. \u201cOh, um, I\u2026 I\u2019m not usually this clumsy I swear. I just, umm\u2026\u201d Damn it. She\u2019d wanted to make a good impression, and yet here she was making a fool of herself. With a sense of deja-vu, the healer fell silent and accepted the tail offered and pulled herself to her feet, unaware of the squished remains of her friend that came with her. With her head still crammed between her best friend\u2019s buttocks, the rest of Jet\u2019s body had been reduced to little more than a weird looking design on the back of the blonde\u2019s dress, no longer remotely recognisable as human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the site of what the squishy girl had been reduced to, Veria couldn\u2019t help but redouble her laughter, unable to even force out words as she clutched at her stomach and tried fruitlessly to contain her mirth. \u201cYou, you, hehe, haha, you, Je-ahahahaha.\u201d Unfortunately, Holly interpreted the laughter as being at her expense and blushed furiously before hurrying off, trying to put some distance between herself and her embarrassment as her powerful cheeks began to chew relentlessly on their captured prey. If she were less concerned with appearances, and had a single thought for her friend, the healer may have paid some attention to the lump of clay knocking at her back door, but as it was, it was the furthest thing from her mind as she tried to get away. Even if she didn\u2019t consciously notice it, however, the movement was still enough to stimulate her rear entrance into a response, and a warm blast of wind burst forth with a muffled belch as it squeezed around Jet\u2019s form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving easily kept pace with the smaller human despite her best efforts, the lamia\u2019s laughter only became stronger as she witnessed the next humiliation to befall her unfortunate friend. A combination of shock and embarrassment as Veria\u2019s laughter rang out just caused Holly to release more gas, a cavalcade of flatulence striking Jet in the face as she silently groaned in protest. The pain had been bad enough, but now her senses were being overwhelmed with the stench of the blonde\u2019s emissions, filling ever pocket of air and forcing her to draw the foul miasma deep into her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torment may well have continued indefinitely if Veria hadn\u2019t finally chosen to intervene, laying a gentle hand on Holly\u2019s shoulder as her tail moved towards the blonde\u2019s butt. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be so embarrassed cutie. It\u2019s a perfectly natural biological function. I wouldn\u2019t fault you for that.\u201d She gently stroked at the healer\u2019s cheek while slowly digging the tip of her tail in under Jet\u2019s form. \u201cNow, it looked like you managed to give yourself a bit of a wedgie when you fell. Let me take care of that for you.\u201d Carefully, the lamia wrapped the end of her tail around the squished remains of Jet\u2019s shoulder and pulled, peeling the girl from her prison with a wet slurp as her head came free. Holly shuddered at the sensation of it, but still didn\u2019t seem to realise what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile ecstatic to be free, the thief continued to groan and struggle as she found her squished form quickly wrapped up in Veria\u2019s tail, the snake-girl\u2019s hands coming down to assist in dragging her head away from the rest of her body while still keeping her in a mostly flat state. For her part, the lamia looked down at her squishy friend with loving eyes as she gently stroked her cheek and then brought her up towards her face, quickly plugging Jet\u2019s lips with her own and sticking her long tongue halfway down her throat before blowing into her, inflating her rubbery body in much the same way as one would a balloon. It was painful, humiliating, and admittedly a little bit stimulating, but it got the job done and the thief almost breathed a sigh of relief as she felt her body return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Holly finally turned around to see what was keeping her companions, Jet had already been returned to her feet, and although she was dizzy and disoriented she looked well enough to keep the healer happy. A blush still painted the blonde\u2019s cheeks at what had happened, but she forced a smile onto her face. \u201cWhat are you two just standing around for, let\u2019s get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her tail from where it had been laying around Jet\u2019s shoulder, Veria was all smiles as she slithered up to join Holly, running her tail over the other girl\u2019s back as she once again took the lead. \u201cOf course dear. Now remember to stay close you two, we wouldn\u2019t either of you to have any\u2026 unfortunate accidents now, would we.\u201d She said the last part with a smirk, looking back at the unlucky thief, but the smirk slipped as she saw the shadow falling over her companion. \u201cWatch out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Still disoriented, Jet barely had time to register Veria\u2019s words before a sudden weight fell on her shoulders. The next thing she knew her torso was being gripped and squished by powerful taloned feet and she was lifted into the air by some unknown force. \u201cWhat! No! Help!\u201d She tried to fight, tried to struggle, but there was nothing she could do but reach out desperately for the lamia who had so casually watched her torment not a moment before, begging for rescue. Regrettably, however, there was nothing either of them could do as Jet was carried away by this new threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who has taken hold of our unlucky thief, and what are her intentions?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet continued to scream and flail helplessly, desperate to pull herself from the grasp of the mysterious creature who had swooped down from the sky and snatched Jet away from her best friend and lamia companion. It was useless though, as the creature\u2019s powerful talons were far too strong for her to break free from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, Jet saw the ground rushing past her extremely quickly, and nearly one hundred feet below her. Her screams renewed in strength, until a thick tail clamped against her mouth, silencing her. Red scales pressed against his lips, slightly squishing them. Jet quivered in fear, terrified at how powerless she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes, the creature swooped back down near the ground, coming in for a landing on a rocky outcropping near a cave. The creature gently dropped Jet onto the ground, and she rolled to a stop. Jet didn\u2019t waste a second bouncing to her feet and attempting to run, but the creature had anticipated this movement. The monster girl grabbed Jet, carried her inside the cave (kicking and screaming), and set her down against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Jet was backed against the cave wall, with her only escape being blocked by the monster girl who had kidnapped her, she was finally able to get a good look at just what, or who, had snatched her away from her friends. Her mouth fell open almost instantly, and she began to blush in embarrassment and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer captor was a dragon girl, and a rather imposing one at that. The girl stood at about eight feet tall, with hair as red as fire that billowed down to her shoulders, and eyes just as intensely red. Her skin was tanned and smooth. Her legs were long and strong, with thick thighs. Her stomach was leaner, while her hips were supple, and her ass large. Her breasts were also shockingly big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms, from the elbow down, were covered in scales, and she had claws instead of hands. From the knees down, her legs were similarly adorned with scales, ending in the two powerful, talon-sharp feet that had carried Jet through the sky. Between her shoulder blades, two magnificent, blood red wings jutted out. Her ears were also pointed and lizard-like, with two long horns protruding from her head above them. Lastly, a thick, curling red tail slithered along the ground behind her, shooting out from her back right above her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon girl gazed at Jet with a look of amusement that caused the unlucky thief girl to shiver. She glanced nervously around the cave, looking for some way to escape the clutches of this monster girl. Meanwhile, she tried her hardest to not be overwhelmed by the dragon girl\u2019s most glaring feature. In a manner similar to Veria, she was utterly and completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there.\u201d The dragon girl finally spoke, causing Jet\u2019s heart to skip a beat. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. Far from it.\u201d She took another step closer. Her voice was softer than Jet had expected, but it still had a mature quality to it. Judging by the dragon girl\u2019s face, Jet assumed she was comparable in age to a twenty-eight-old human woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026um\u2026\u201d Jet stammered, trying to think of something to say to stall the dragon girl\u2019s advances. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026why did you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKidnap you?\u201d The dragon girl finished Jet\u2019s question, and laughed. \u201cI was flying by the area, and spotted you. Something about you\u2026struck my fancy. And, I have to say, you might be the most beautiful human girl I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The dragon girl laughed softly, and Jet felt her head spin. How many ridiculous, unlucky things we\u2019re going to keep happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful? Me? Uh\u2026um\u2026\u201d Jet happened to look behind the dragon girl, and spotted a path leading down the rocky cliffside cave they were in. If she could just get past the dragon girl, she would have a chance to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...before she could finish her thought, the dragon girl flapped her wings in one powerful strike, propelling her forward. She landed against Jet, thrusting her into the cave wall. The dragon girl\u2019s powerful legs kept Jet pinned to the wall, while her claws held Jet\u2019s head in place. Her tail gently caressed Jet\u2019s thigh, causing her to squirm, while her massive, bare breasts squished into Jet\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Dravline, and as of this moment, you are my mate.\u201d Dravline proclaimed with a sultry smile. Jet opened her mouth to protest, but Dravline silenced her by planting her lips against Jet\u2019s, passionately kissing her for a full minute. When she finally pulled away, Jet had to gasp for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDravline let go of Jet, and the exhausted thief collapsed to the ground. Her chest had been slightly squashed by Dravline\u2019s boobs, and she was having a hard time breathing. Unfortunately, Dravline noticed her squished body, and cocked her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my. That\u2019s most interesting.\u201d Dravline shifted above Jet, and lowered herself down. Her ass pressed down onto Jet\u2019s legs, squashing them flat almost instantly. Dravline giggled, admiring her new, squishy lover. She looked into Jet\u2019s horrified eyes lovingly, and leaned in for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling strength well up within her, Jet smacked Dravline in the face, not sparing any thought for the consequences. Dravline gasped in surprise, and flew back a few feet. Jet crawled like a madwoman towards the exit of the cave, desperate to do anything she could to escape this obsessive dragon girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely made it ten feet before all of Dravline\u2019s weight pressed down onto her back, crushing her squishy chest flat. Dravline proceeded to systematically flattened out Jet\u2019s legs, arms, and head, and then she peeled Jet\u2019s now flat body off of the cave floor. She looked at her prey with a warm and cheery smile, a light blush in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can try to run my love, but that only makes it all the more excited to chase you down.\u201d Dravline sighed, her sweet-smelling breath washing over Jet. She traced a claw smoothly down Jet\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ve caught my heart, little thief girl, and now I\u2019m never letting you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet stared back, flattened and helpless, at the powerful dragon girl who held her in her clutches. She had never been more scared in her life. Minutes before, she had been angry at clueless Holly and the flirty lamia, Veria. Now, she would give anything to have them back. Why was her luck so terrible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Too squished to even speak, there was nothing Jet could do to protect herself as Dravline brought her forward and squished her into her chest, burying the tiny thief\u2019s head and shoulders completely into her cleavage, while the rest of her body was crushed against the dragon girl\u2019s tight abs. The massive woman\u2019s arms closed around her body, giving her no chance to even try to escape, and it was all she could do to draw breath as she tried not to suffocate between the huge squishy orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part Dravline had thought she was in love with Jet the first moment she set eyes on her, but if that was love, then she didn\u2019t even know how to describe what she was feeling now. Words could not come close to describing the feeling of ecstasy that coursed through her veins as her squishy love was subsumed within the welcoming embrace of her massive bosom, safe and warm and loved. The dragon girl wanted nothing more than to just squeeze and squeeze until the unfortunate thief became a part of herself, the two of them forever connected in an internal state of blissful oneness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off that urge, at least for now, the redhead ran a single claw down the exposed portion of her mate\u2019s spine, interpreting the shiver that produced as one of pleasure as she smiled broadly. \u201cDo not worry my love. There is no reason to run anymore. You will never have to feel scared again as long as I am here.\u201d Keeping one hand at the back of Jet\u2019s head to ensure that she was unable to escape the prison of her chest, she continued to run the claws of the other down the trapped girl\u2019s spine while using her legs and tail to kick a collection of dry twigs and logs into a makeshift pile. \u201cI\u2019m just glad my sisters aren\u2019t here right now. I know that they will fall in love with you as well, and right now I don\u2019t want to share you. You\u2019re all mine. My one and only. My precious love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Dravline was going to have to share her mate with the rest of her brood, she knew that. They shared everything after all, and after her elder sister had accidentally crushed their last mate they\u2019d been lonely and needy for so long. The last one had been\u2026 okay, she guessed, but she\u2019d never loved him, not like she loved Jet. She just knew that the others were going to love her as well too, and with her squishy nature they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about holding back either. There was a certain joy that could be had in sharing such things with her sisters, and a part of her looked forward to the chance of presenting her squishy love to them, but right now she wanted it for herself alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep inhale of breath was enough to light the fire in the dragon girl\u2019s belly, and from Jet\u2019s perspective the heat of the abs to which her lower body was crushed rose rapidly for a moment, before that same heat travelled up through Dravline\u2019s chest to be expelled out of her mouth in a short burst of flame. The gathered kindling obediently burst into flames, and the redhead wasted no time in lying her body down beside the warm fire, curling up as she wrapped her body around the tiny thief. \u201cHmmm\u2026 I\u2019ve been flying around all night. Why don\u2019t we get some sleep my love?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Jet was capable of responding she wouldn\u2019t have credited the dragon girl\u2019s words with a response. Sure the redhead was beautiful, she wouldn\u2019t deny that, and her interest was at least a little bit flattering, but she was not some object to be claimed so casually! She didn\u2019t even know this massive girl, and she definitely didn\u2019t want to be stuck with her for the rest of her life. And what was this about sisters? Was there really more than one of these crazy lizards out there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Dravline\u2019s soft snores filtered down into the recesses of her curled up body, the unfortunate thief knew that for now at least she was stuck. With the redhead\u2019s knees pulled up to her chest and her arms wrapped tightly around them, not to mention her thick tail curled around the whole mass, there was no way Jet was going to escape from this embrace, her tortured body squished into the folds of the dragon girl\u2019s massive body. The heat was intense, a naturally high body temperature combining with the nearby fire to leave the brunette drowning in her kidnapper\u2019s sweat and feeling like she was about to melt into Dravline\u2019s supple skin. Indeed as the minutes ticked into hours she felt like she was becoming adhered to her so-called love\u2019s flesh, and was terrified that she would truly become a part of this woman if this continued for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over two hours later, when Jet was about to give up any hope of being rescued that a small movement near the entrance to the cave finally drew the attention of the one eye that was able to peer out from a gap between her captor\u2019s folded limbs. Any fear that this might have been another dragon girl come to join in her torment was blown away as she saw the familiar form of Veria slithering further into the cave, a timid looking Holly following carefully behind her. She was saved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, however, it would seem that Jet was not the only one who had noticed the intrusion, as the body that surrounded her suddenly rumbled and shook, a deep and menacing growl emanated from somewhere above her squished head. The force of it vibrated the boobs that had eaten the thief\u2019s face and she cried out in silent fear against the all-consuming flesh as the limbs unfolded and the redhead rose up to her full height as she turned to face these intruders. Without a word Dravline\u2019s sharp nails descended on Jet\u2019s defenceless form and effortlessly peeled her partly adhered body from her skin. If the thief had hoped for salvation however she was sorely disappointed, as no sooner had her head popped free than the dragon girl quickly scrunched up the brunette\u2019s body into a wad of twisted flesh and then shoved the whole thing into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Dravline\u2019s perspective all she was doing was protecting her love from potential threats, her red eyes remaining fixed intently on the invading lamia as she stored away her squishy mate within the protective embrace of her chest. On powerful legs she strode forward, ignoring the protests of the blonde human who had accompanied the snake woman as her breasts bounced freely, the twin orbs shifting around with a sound like gum being chewed as they devoured Jet\u2019s rubbery body. \u201cWho are you? Why have you come to my home? Leave now, before I expel you from this place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow eye-to-eye with the angry redhead, Veria rose herself up as high as possible on her muscular tail, managing to get slightly higher than the dragon girl, even as the muscles of Dravline\u2019s arms flexed dangerously. She knew she had to tread carefully, but she also wanted to reclaim her squishy friend. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to get our friend back. The one that you just shoved between your breasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only caused Dravline to growl again, the noise reverberating around the cave. \u201cYou want to take my mate from me?\u201d Glaring intensely now, she forcefully folded her arms across her chest, crushing her breasts together and further compacting Jet between the jiggly masses as the thief tried fruitlessly to struggle free. \u201cI will never give my love to you. You\u2019d have to kill me first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been hiding behind Veria\u2019s back since the confrontation began, Holly finally gathered the courage to step out and face this dangerous-looking foe, her need to reclaim her best friend temporarily overcoming her survival instinct. \u201cShe\u2019s not your mate! She\u2019s my best friend! You can\u2019t just swoop down from the sky and take her from me like that!\u201d The healer glared as hard as she could, though her composure collapsed quickly as those burning red eyes turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the dragon girl it mattered not from where Jet had come, and she hadn\u2019t even taken the time to notice her travelling companions when she snatched her up. The thief was her mate, and she had known that from the moment she set eyes on her. Nothing else mattered. \u201cShe is my mate because I say she is. That is the way things are.\u201d She inhaled powerfully, allowing flames to lick around the edges of her mouth while the blonde yelped and hid back behind the larger lamia. \u201cI was having a good day, so I\u2019m giving you once last chance to get out of her alive. Now leave!!!\u201d The last words were bellowed, and the shout echoed around the cave while the redhead\u2019s wings spread out behind her, expanding her profile as clawed hands flexed in preparation for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria blanched at the threatening posture of her fellow monster, her instincts telling her that now was the time to run, while her heart wanted her to stay and fight for the freedom of her new friend. Complicating matters further, Holly was shivering in fear behind her back, and there was always the risk that staying would bring the healer to harm as well. After careful consideration, she decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

But at the same time she didn\u2019t want to leave Jet behind, not when she\u2019d finally managed to make such nice friends. Even if she\u2019d been a bit stand-offish sometimes, the lamia considered the tiny thief to be a precious friend of hers and she didn\u2019t want to lose her. Further, Holly was clearly very attached to the thief, and she knew it would break the blonde\u2019s heart to see her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired girl had to think quickly, knowing that they would be attacked if they waited too long, and that every second that passed would only raise the redhead\u2019s aggression. Eyes flicking down to flaming lips, the lamia quickly raised her hands in the universal sign of surrender. \u201cWait wait, just hear me out. We\u2019re not going to take your mate from you.\u201d Holly moved as if to protest but Veria silenced her with a gentle shush as she wrapped her tail around the healer\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBut I have a proposition. One that would help us both, as well as your mate, if you\u2019re prepared to listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDravline frowned, but did relax her muscles somewhat and quench the fire building in her belly. She didn\u2019t trust the lamia, knowing that her kind was slippery at best, but the mention of something that would benefit her mate forced her to pay attention. She loved that squishy girl after all. \u201cSpeak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHook, line and sinker. A wicked smile crossed Veria\u2019s face as she lowered her own body somewhat, two pairs of red eyes meeting in a more subdued embrace as a calmer air descended on their little gathering. \u201cJet. Your mate. She was harmed not too long ago by another woman. A rouge by the name of Clara, she betrayed her and this girl.\u201d The lamia gestured to Holly. \u201cAnd she left little Jet here cursed and in terrible pain. She hurt her body and more importantly she hurt her pride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon girl\u2019s eyes twitched at that, and she looked down at her cleavage again, parting the breasts slightly to look down at her squishy mate, one eye peering back at her from the tortured mass with a scared look that Dravline assumed was a result of remembering what had happened with this Clara woman. The idea of her love suffering at the hands of some human harlot made her grind her teeth, and right now she wanted nothing more than to find this traitorous rouge and tear her apart with her bare hands. She was happy to have finally gotten the chance to learn her love\u2019s name, and the sound of that name, Jet, reverberated through her head, so lovely and perfect, but the thought was soured by the mere knowledge that there was someone out there who had hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Dravline was at least considering her offer, Veria chose her next words carefully, so as to secure the deal. \u201cYou dragons seldom live alone right, and this is a big cave. That must mean you have sisters nearby. Once they get back they\u2019ll expect you to share Jet with them.\u201d She smiled, not wanting to insult the other girl\u2019s family. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with that of course, but wouldn\u2019t you like to be able to keep her to yourself for just a bit longer. Just you and her, and us, for as long as it takes to find Clara and get her revenge. They\u2019d understand that wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bark of laughter emerged from the redhead\u2019s throat and she released her chest, allowing her twin orbs to slam back together and once again submerge her lover within their embrace. \u201cHeh, I like the way you think snake girl.\u201d She paused for a moment, lightly squeezing her breasts and stifling a moan while feeling Jet\u2019s body squish delightfully between them, ignoring the dismayed face Holly was making as she did so. \u201cFine. We have an agreement. I will travel with you to find the one who has wronged my love, and in return you agree that she is my mate, and mine alone. If you try to take her from me\u2026\u201d She flapped her wings once, creating a strong gust of wind that blew back Veria\u2019s hair as it whipped around her, before folding them neatly at her back. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you both.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria smiled genuinely, probably the first time she had done so since entering the cave. \u201cGlad to have you on-board. My name is Veria by the name. This is Holly.\u201d She extended a hand, that was carefully grasped in the clawed grip of her new companion in turn. \u201cLet\u2019s be good friends.\u201d The dragon girl just snorted at that offer, though the twinkle in her eye implied some interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Holly gulped nervously as two pairs of red eyes turned to face her, one set happy and somewhat flirtatious, the other warm but firm, intensely studying her every move. \u201cIf\u2026 if it\u2019s okay with you, I would like to see my friend please. She may be hurt, and I\u2019d like to heal her\u2026 please.\u201d The last thing she wanted to do was to anger this powerful creature, but she also hated the idea of leaving Jet to suffer in that mountainous cleavage, clearly able to see the sweat flowing from between the massive orbs, and knowing there was no way the thief was enjoying her time in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRearing back slightly, Dravline considered the request from this small human. On the one hand she still didn\u2019t fully trust either of these two not to try and escape with her mate, and while she was confident she could track them down she didn\u2019t want to spend a single second away from her squishy love. But on the other hand, if she just kept Jet trapped in her cleavage the whole time, she would be deprived of so many other things, like kissing her, and hugging her, and squishing her under her butt, or her feet, or wrapping her up in her tail, or stretching her around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally coming to a decision, Dravline fixed her eyes back on Holly, and said\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright. As long as you don\u2019t try to steal her she can come out.\u201d Dravline was still reluctant to let her mate out of the protective embrace of her bosom, wary of these new acquaintances she\u2019d found herself with. Yet at the same time she was supremely confident that she could reclaim her precious Jet if either the small human or the slithering lamia made any attempt to steal the squishy thief. It wasn\u2019t even really possessiveness at this point. As far as the dragon girl was concerned she and Jet were already one, so reclaiming her from her former friends would be a rescue from the loneliness of an existence without mates, without knowing the pleasure of being one with a dragon brood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to protest at the idea that reclaiming her friend would be \u2018stealing\u2019, Holly knew that wasn\u2019t a battle she could afford to fight right now, so instead bowed her head quickly. \u201cOf course, I wouldn\u2019t dream of taking her from you.\u201d She would. In fact she was doing it right now, but the redhead didn\u2019t need to know that. The blonde mage chewed nervously at her lip as Dravline reached a scaled hand into her cleavage, the flesh undulating as sharp nails scrapped over her heated flesh and collected the mound of putty that was Jet\u2019s thoroughly squished form. It broke Holly\u2019s heart to see her friend reduced to such a state, and she had to forcefully hold back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs difficult as this was for her companion, it was infinitely worse for the unfortunate thief. By now she\u2019d lost track of how long she\u2019d spent in the horrendously sweaty cleavage, her body so utterly squished and soaked in her so-called mate\u2019s perspiration that it felt like it was becoming a part of her. The hand that descended to collect her spent what seemed an eternity rubbing and grinding her all over the moist flesh, before finally, finally, peeling her away and pulling her back into the light. It was an immense relief to be outside of the cleavage, to feel fresh air caressing her twisted skin, even as she could sense her captor\u2019s other hand closing in, its own sharp nails descending on her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of the pain she was inflicting on her love, Dravline allowed the claws of both hands to pick at the bundle of flesh that Jet had been reduced to, locating and extracting her limbs and tugging at the thief\u2019s head until she vaguely resembled the outline of a human. Once the brunette\u2019s head was clear the dragon girl wasted no time in bringing her lips down to meet her mate\u2019s, plugging the smaller girl\u2019s mouth with her own and blowing into her body to inflate it, much as Veria had done earlier. This was technically their second kiss, but it was significantly more intense then the first, with Dravline\u2019s tongue gleefully invading Jet\u2019s mouth, and maintaining contact well after the inflation process had been completed, before finally separating with an audible wet slurp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the squished girl it was a thoroughly confusing situation to be placed in. The natural warmth of the dragon girl pervaded her system, spreading from her mouth to her toes as the warm air was pushed into her lungs and pumped into her veins. It was a more intense feeling than anything she could recall feeling before, pleasurable and invasive at the same time. If Jet were to put words to it, she would have to say it was like Dravline was placing a part of herself inside of her, and even when their lips finally separated the warmth remained, nestled deep within. As the hands holding her up released their grip, the thief collapsed to her knees, both weak and delirious as her mind swam with unwelcome thoughts, her body crying out for more contact even as her mind rejected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of whether she could read the internal conflict, Dravline could easily see the desire in her mate\u2019s eyes, and chuckled warmly. A large part of her wanted to scoop the girl back up straight away but she\u2019d given her word that she\u2019d let the healer look her over, so she stepped back, turning to address Veria while letting Holly approach. For her part, the blonde immediately fell to her knees beside her friend, hands going to the thief\u2019s back to support her as she began casting healing spells under her breath, aiming to sooth the lingering aches that the squishing had left behind. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Jet. I should have kept a better eye on you. I don\u2019t\u2026. I don\u2019t know what to do now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill catching her breath, Jet didn\u2019t try to respond verbally, just extended her tired arms and wrapped them around Holly\u2019s shoulders, pulling the blonde in for a hug as they relaxed in each other\u2019s arms. She didn\u2019t blame her friend for what had happened. It was all because of the curse, because of Clara. All that mattered was that the mage had come for her. That she hadn\u2019t given up. That was enough. Whatever came next, whatever happened, they\u2019d work through it together, like they always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Holly clutched her tighter, shoulders trembling as tears began to soak into Jet\u2019s shoulder, the thief allowed her gaze to shift to their two larger companions, locked in a quiet conversation on the other side of the fire. Veria\u2019s eyes briefly shifted to meet her own, and the lamia gave a warm smile before turning back to their newest addition, drawing the thief\u2019s eyes in the same direction. It was fortunate that the dragon girl had her back to their little hug-fest, since Jet wasn\u2019t sure how she would react to seeing such closeness. Plus, she\u2019d be lying if she said the view from behind wasn\u2019t nice. Dravline\u2019s toned body was an alluring sight, even with the draconic features that occasionally interrupted the smooth flesh, and as her tail swayed slightly, the cursed girl couldn\u2019t help but take a moment to gaze at her firm posterior, remembering the feeling of it against her own flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet wasn\u2019t happy with this arrangement, not by a long shot. Her freedom had essentially been taken from her by some literal monster she\u2019d just met, and if what had transpired so far was anything to go by, Dravline\u2019s intentions for her were\u2026 intense. Not to mention the looming threat of the rest of the dragon girl\u2019s brood. But, she had to admit that it could have been a lot worse. When she\u2019d been snatched up she\u2019d thought she was going to be eaten, or otherwise killed. She\u2019d heard rumours of what happened to people foolish enough to step into monster territory, and worried that she would just become the latest statistic. By comparison, the present situation was almost comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being at least it appeared that she would be able to continue her quest to find Clara, and to be with Holly, whose body was still wrapped tightly in her arms. Their new companions would even provide a level of protection from the other threats in the Wildlands. She\u2019d have to get use to Veria\u2019s flirty nature, and the domineering Dravline, but she could make it work. While Jet did wish that her apparent mate had more of a concept of consent, it was clear that the redhead didn\u2019t really mean to harm her, and the lamia seemed similarly amiable for the most part, so maybe she could talk them around into being a bit less physical with her. It was worth a try at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was still muttering apologies when she finally pulled back from the hug, and her cheeks were wet, but there was a tentative smile on her face now. The healer looked like she wanted to say something else, but before she could find the words a familiar tail wrapped itself around her waist and lifted her into the air, swinging her onto Veria\u2019s back in a well-practised manoeuvre. Confused by the sudden interruption, Jet opened her mouth to protest, but was silenced as powerful arms pulled her up from behind, swinging her around in time to catch a brief glimpse of smouldering eyes before they slid shut, and she found herself pulled in for another searing kiss. This one was briefer than the last, but the moment if broke, the dragon girl forced the thief\u2019s head down into the waiting embrace of her chest, pushing the brunette\u2019s face into her cleavage as she held her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Jet\u2019s struggles made it clear that she wasn\u2019t exactly enjoying the experience, Veria couldn\u2019t help but smirk a little bit as she watched the thief\u2019s head being consumed by her partner\u2019s bosom. The lamia\u2019s tail ran gently across Holly\u2019s back, attempting to soothe the young mage as she frowned at her friend\u2019s predicament. Better than the humans, the snake girl knew that this was par for the course for a dragon and their mate, and that it was only going to get worst if they waited for the rest of Dravline\u2019s undoubtedly equally well-endowed brood to return. Such packs were usually made up of five to twelve individuals, so they\u2019d probably never see Jet again if she disappeared among such a mass of feminine assets. \u201cLike I said, we need to get out of here before your sisters come back okay. It will be faster if we carry the little ones. Once we catch Clara you can come right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it took her a long moment to draw her loving gaze away from Jet\u2019s form, Dravline eventually looked up to meet Veria\u2019s eyes and nodded solemnly, pulling the thief away from her chest and swinging her onto her back in one fluid movement. \u201cFine. The sooner we leave, the sooner I can sink my claws into that wretch.\u201d She reached up to pat the arms that had closed around her shoulders, not realising the embrace was more due to fear of falling than any sign of affection. \u201cLet\u2019s go my love. I will tear apart this Clara for you, and we can feast on her remains.\u201d The redhead smiled viciously at the thought, ignoring the way that Holly shied down behind Veria\u2019s shoulder and Jet shuddered at her back. Wings flaring, she stepped towards the cave\u2019s exit, the lamia close behind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By some miracle, Jet\u2019s terrible luck was held at bay long enough for the two monster girls to safely exit the cave and descend to the ground several stories below. For Veria this meant slithering down the cliff-face while Holly clung tightly to her back, unintentionally bringing her hands in contact with the lamia\u2019s heavy breasts. Dravline, on the other hand, opted to take a more direct route, leaping easily from the precipice and landing in a crouch far below. To the dragon girl the force of the impact barely even registered as the vibration was absorbed into her legs, but to the unfortunate thief on her back the unexpected high velocity fall and sudden stop at the end pressed her nearly flat against the redhead\u2019s back, all the air being instantly forced from her lungs as her diaphragm deflated. The wings which had flared out to help manoeuvre Dravline\u2019s descent now folded to her back, sliding over Jet\u2019s squished body and pressing her even more firmly against Dravline\u2019s taunt muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, their companions had joined them on the ground, and the larger girls set out on a path deeper into the Wildlands, deliberately choosing a route along which they were unlikely to encounter any more of the dragon brood. With their designated transports focused on moving forward, Holly tried her best to crane her neck for a view of Jet, but all she could make out was the back of the girl\u2019s head sticking up slightly over Dravline\u2019s shoulder, the rest of her hidden by wings. Slightly more at ease, the healer let her own grip loosen as she shifted her arms up higher to lightly circle Veria\u2019s neck, belatedly blushing scarlet as she realised just where her hands had been resting. Any hope that the lamia hadn\u2019t noticed was shattered by the low chuckle that rumbled through the body beneath her, and the gentle caress of the tip of the other girl\u2019s tail at the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrushed as her body was, Jet was still able to keep her eyes functional as she peered over Dravline\u2019s shoulder, keeping her gaze fixed forward and attempting not to dwell on how trapped she felt. As such, she was the only one with the time to scan their surroundings, at least as best she could with the limited range of motion she had. The only one who was able to spot the torn scrap of cloth on a nearby bush, the familiar velvet texture standing out vividly against the green and brown shrubbery. Suddenly desperate to be heard, the thief wiggled her body as best she could, frantically moving her head in the direction of the cloth, though groaning when the first reaction of her mount was to tighten the wings around her, crushing all the fight out of her body as she was squished even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the commotion was enough to draw Holly\u2019s attention to the bush as well, the healer frowning for a moment in thought before excitedly crying out and wiggling down from Veria\u2019s back to investigate, striding over towards the cloth without sparing a backwards glance for Jet. While the lamia followed the excited blonde, Dravline finally unfolded her wings enough for her mate to slip free, though the crushed nature of her limbs led to her simply sliding down the dragon girl\u2019s back and colliding with her tail. The redhead instinctively moved the offending appendage aside and let the thief slide all the way to the ground but then wrapped it back around the shorter girl to ensure she didn\u2019t fall, unintentionally driving her mate face-first into the waiting crevice of her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe introduction of Jet\u2019s face to Dravline\u2019s bountiful booty had not been intentionally, but instantly drove a wave of pleasure up the monster girl\u2019s spine. The cursed thief wasn\u2019t even given a chance to try to struggle free before the tail tightened its grip, pushing her in deeper as the cheeks squeezed shut around her face, smearing her across the smooth flesh while her captor moaned above. Since leaving the cage Dravline had still been wondering whether she made the right choice by releasing her little love from her cleavage, but now she was sure. Having Jet between her breasts had been great, but if she\u2019d kept her there she would never have been able to experience this pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly oblivious to what was going on behind them, Veria and Holly peered carefully at the cloth as the healer retrieved it from the bush. While the lamia generally had little experience with clothing of any kind, the blonde seemed quite enthused by the discovery, waving it around like it was some grand relic. \u201cYes! This belonged to Clara, I know it. It\u2019s her colour, and I recognise the weave.\u201d Pushing some obscuring branches aside, she smiled as she saw the path beyond. \u201cShe must have gone this way. If we just follow the path we can find her and maybe we can break the curse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyebrows creasing at the mention of their prey, Dravline finally released the grip of her tail from around Jet\u2019s head, allowing her partially squished face to pop free, imprinted with the shape of the larger girl\u2019s booty. By now the thief\u2019s limbs at least had mostly reform, and as disoriented as she was, the brunette was able to stumble pass her mate in search of her less destructive companions. For her part, the dragon girl mostly seemed amused as she watched her love struggle forward, though the smirk on her face dropped when Jet tripped over an exposed root and face-planted into the ground, the unfortunate thief flipping over onto her back just in time to be cast in shadow as Veria shifted backwards, her long snake body sliding over the prone girl as she turned to face her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDravline was frowning now, annoyed that someone else was touching her mate, and her red eyes were fixed on the lamia\u2019s lower half as it slithered and curled over Jet\u2019s body, completely hiding the unlucky girl from sight as it pushed her down into the dirt and dead leaves below. She wanted to admonish the other monster for getting so intimate, but even through the fog of her jealousy she knew well enough that it hadn\u2019t been on purpose so she held her tongue and waited patiently as Veria continued to advance, the length of her body dragging across the flattened thief before leaving her behind in the muck. Eyes flicking down briefly to confirm that Jet had not been carried along on the raven-haired monster\u2019s scales, the redhead raised her eyebrows in a silent question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as the lamia moved forward another length to place herself right in front of Dravline, the thief disappeared from her range of vision and she failed to notice as Holly stepped up behind her companion, unknowingly planting both feet on her best friend\u2019s face as she came to a stop. For Jet it seemed like was doomed to never ending squishing, and her last-ditch attempt to struggle resulted only in the healer unconsciously shifting her feet to get more comfortable, further smearing the other girl\u2019s features beneath her soles. It was only now that the brunette noticed that her friend had evidently removed her footwear at some point after her abduction, as the blonde\u2019s dexterous toes pinched ruthlessly at her features, those of the right foot in particular closing around her nose, and directly injecting a foul scent built up from travelling for days without a shower or decent rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnorant of the events beneath her soles, Holly enthusiastically waved the cloth at Dravline, bouncing on her toes as she got excited. \u201cVeria says you guys have an excellent sense of smell, and that it\u2019s how you were able to find us so easily before. Can you sniff this? It belonged to Clara, and it may help us to find her.\u201d The healer smiled broadly as the cloth was snatched away by the redhead, falling back onto her heels and paying little attention to the small squishy noise as her feet landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the cloth to her nostrils, Dravline took a deep sniff, her expression immediately switching to a scowl as she caught her first whiff of her mate\u2019s enemy. A growl rose in her throat as she took it in, pushing the other two aside as she strode towards the bush and the path beyond. Her eyes flashed dangerously as she passed. \u201cAs long as we stay on the track I can probably follow her scent. It will get easier if we can get closer.\u201d If the ground where Holly had been standing was a little uneven, it wasn\u2019t anything that couldn\u2019t be dealt with by a bit more force, and the dragon girl simply stomped forward, her clawed foot unknowingly descending on her unfortunate mate\u2019s face. Sharp talons clenched down with the footfall, digging into the earth around Jet\u2019s head and peeling her from the ground, only to carry her forward to be slammed down beneath the next step as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their focus fixed on the aggressive set to the dragon girl\u2019s shoulders, neither Holly nor Veria noticed the torso and lower body of their friend sticking out from beneath Dravline\u2019s foot, the weight of her footfalls following in the wake of Holly\u2019s toe bath leaving the thief too delirious to even try to fight back. The brunette\u2019s body lay limp and defeated as her captor brushed aside the obscuring branches and gazed down the path, her knowledge coming to the fore as she declared\u2026</span></div></div>",

Holly and Veria peered around her to get a better look at the path. Holly\u2019s bare feet slapped down onto Jet\u2019s crushed chest, prompting a mute groan from the battered thief girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026that leads to the tundra.\u201d Veria swore under her breath. \u201cAre you sure she went that way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you questioning me, snake?\u201d Dravline stood at her full height and glared at Veria. \u201cMy senses are unmatched, and my purpose clear. Nothing will stop me from finding this cruel woman and tearing her limb from limb to save the life of my beloved mate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria backed off and avoided eye contact with the muscular dragon girl, her eyes drifting to the ground. It was there that she spotted the mangled, muddy form of Jet, and a wry smile arose on her face. Dravline\u2019s talons were pinching into the thief\u2019s face, while Holly\u2019s toes scrunched and picked at Jet\u2019s chest. Neither girl knew the pain they were currently inflicting on the poor girl they cared so much about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDravline began heading through the woods, following Clara\u2019s scent expertly. As she took a step, Holly\u2019s feet kept Jet pinned, ripping her free from the dragon girl\u2019s claws. Holly then took a step herself, moving off of Jet and finally giving the exhausted and delirious girl a moment\u2019s respite. Veria lingered behind for a moment, and used her tail to prop up Jet\u2019s crushed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet reformed a minute later, and shakily climbed to her weary feet. Veria gave her a comforting smile and a quick caress on the cheek with her tail, and then the two picked up their pace to catch up with their travelling companions. Once more, Jet silently thanked Veria for showing her kindness and compassion. As flirtatious and playful as she could be, Veria clearly still had her best interests at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDravline cleared through the vines and thorns with ease, her powerful wings and scaled hands unaffected by the sharp, grasping plant life. Jet could hardly figure out how Clara had made it through this area, but she had always been an acrobatic and talented thief. Regardless, Jet and Holly were thankful to their two (sometimes overbearing) monster girl companions for escorting them with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuicker than Jet had thought possible, the warm woods were replaced with a cold, frozen tundra as far as the eye could see. Snow fell non-stop from clouds high in the sky, and the temperature dropped considerably. The change in environment had a noticeable effect on all four of the girls, but they still needed to press on. With each step, their elusive goal grew closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly, who had no shoes, climbed up onto Veria\u2019s back, and the lamia girl carried her across the frozen wasteland. Jet trudged through the snow beside them, noting Veria\u2019s near-constant shivers. She was trying to manage a brave face, but Jet knew how much snakes detested the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was about to say something when Dravline suddenly scooped her up into a tight and unexpected embrace. Dravline shoved Jet\u2019s face into her cleavage, burying her squishy head between her massive breasts. The rest of Jet\u2019s body was quickly and firmly squished into Dravline\u2019s toned stomach. It all happened in less than three seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will keep you warm, my lovely mate.\u201d Dravline declared, rubbing a strong, scaly hand along Jet\u2019s now flattened body. \u201cThe fire raging within me will keep both of us warm for several hours. Unfortunately, it will not last forever, but we should be able to cross this tundra in only a few hours with no complications.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently satisfied with her brief explanation for her rather sensual actions, Dravline continued on, with Veria and Holly lagging behind. Once more, Jet felt a conflicting sense of emotions aroused within her due to Dravline\u2019s actions. She hated being so carelessly crushed without a second thought, but the dragon girl\u2019s hot flesh radiating all around her provided a nearly incomprehensible level of comfort and pleasure. Jet almost felt herself falling asleep, head tucked neatly between Dravline\u2019s firm, gargantuan boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party of four trekked for another hour, until Dravline held up her hand to call a halt. Veria\u2019s movements were beginning to veer side-to-side, and her breaths were coming in short, ragged bursts. Holly, feeling bad for her lamia friend, tore off some fabric from her dress, wrapping it around her feet as makeshift shoes. She then hopped back onto the snowy ground, offering Veria welcome respite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Veria gave her lovely companion a wide smile, touched at Holly\u2019s generous display of friendship. Unable to control herself, she latched onto the timid blonde mage, planting a big, passionate kiss on her lips. Holly let out a cute squeal of surprise, and frantically backpedaled from Veria\u2019s unexpected show of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Holly backed right into Dravline, who was unprepared for anyone to be anywhere near her. The dragon girl cried out and fell face first into the snow, Holly landing on top of her. The added weight pressed Dravline even more into the snow, her already muscular and heavy body sinking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring angrily, Dravline burst up and out of the snow, Holly tumbling away from her. Dravline whirled to face her two travelling partners, trace flames snapping at the corners of her mouth. Unbeknownst to all three girls, Jet\u2019s flat body had slipped off of Dravline\u2019s chest during her fall into the snow, and was not lying crushed and half buried in the dragon girl shaped imprint Dravline had created in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, blonde one!\u201d Dravline snapped. \u201cI called for a halt, not a tackle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m s-sorry! It-it-it\u2026was an acc-accident!\u201d Holly stammered, frantically crawling back from the peeved dragon girl. Veria looked at Dravline quizzically, noting an absence of a particular squashed thief on the dragon girl\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDravline, oblivious to her missing mate, sighed. \u201cWe have bigger problems now. The snow storm is picking up. An ice lady is in the area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIce lady?\u201d Holly asked, standing up. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA monster with complete control over ice. Territorial, and emotionless. They have no qualms about killing anything they don\u2019t like.\u201d Dravline explained, surveying the area with her steely gaze. The wind picked up, and the snow began to fall harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorse still\u2026\u201d Dravline continued. \u201c\u2026very rarely, an ice lady will find something or somebody that captures their fancy. Their usually cold, emotionless persona will crack, and they will become enthralled with their new object of desire. They will pursue it and crave it eternally, to the ends of the earth. Nothing will satiate their desire to make it, or them, theirs. This is very well a fate worse than death, and something we want to avoid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t your fire fight the ice lady?\u201d Holly proposed. Dravline shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI too am reptilian, much like our lamia companion. I\u2019m far too weak to win a fight against an ice lady in her own domain. We need to hurry and leave, now.\u201d Dravline pointed to a small valley in the distance. \u201cPast that valley is the border of the frozen tundra. The magic sustaining this frosty realm will cease, and the ice lady will be unable to bother us anymore. If he hurry, we can make it.\u201d Dravline turned and started to move, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Holly nodded, leaping to her feet. She ran over to the big hole in the snow Dravline\u2019s body had made. Already, a thin layer of snow had covered Jet up, and only one tan, flattened hand was sticking up. Holly, as unaware of her best friend\u2019s predicaments as always, trampled right over Jet\u2019s snow covered body, sprinting after Dravline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet\u2019s mind began to waver, and her hold on consciousness began to slip away. Her body had sustained an inhumane amount of punishment in such a short amount of time. The cold embrace of the snow covering her paper-thin body beckoned her to sleep, and her eyes began to close. A moment later, she drifted off into a restless sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria slithered after the Dravline and Holly, pausing momentarily to look at the dragon-shaped snow imprint. She thought she could just make out a small hand sticking up, but even that was being quickly covered up by snow. The lamia tilted her head to the side and looked closer. She shivered, and her exhausted mind struggled to really perceive what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnake!\u201d Dravline cried, well off in the distance by now. \u201cHurry, or the ice lady will catch us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Veria! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Holly chimed in. Both of their voices sounded so distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria began to slither away, stealing one last look at the thin tan object poking out of the snow. She watched as the hand-shaped object folded under the pressure of the snow, disappearing at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this final moment, does Veria realize the hand was Jet, or not?</span></div></div>",

She whipped her tail forward and caught Jet\u2019s feet, ripping her free from Dravline\u2019s talons without the dragon girl even feeling a thing. She deposited Jet\u2019s crumpled body in Holly\u2019s awaiting hands, and the blonde mage immediately cast a few healing spells on her poor friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria and Holly took a moment to wipe Jet\u2019s dirty and muddy body clean, while Jet could only stare up at the two girls, still flatten and mangled. It was a confusingly pleasurable experience to be rubbed all over by Holly and Veria, both extremely gorgeous girls in their own right. Jet\u2019s squished face began to blush, and Veria smirked mischievously upon noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when Jet was nice and clean, Holly tucked the unlucky thief into her bag for safe keeping, and both her and Veria hustled to keep up with Dravline, who had continued to forge on ahead. While Holly ran, her bag jostled up and down, and Jet found her flat body soon buried under a pile of clothes, books, and potions, the weight of it all keeping her flat and unable to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three adventurers, and one flat thief girl, trekked through the woods for five straight hours with no interruptions or pauses. Dravline, other than a layer of sweat glistening off of her deeply tanned, bare flesh, barely showed any signs of exhaustion. Veria\u2019s pace had slowed just a bit, but she was more bothered by the rough ground scratching at her sensitive lower half. Holly was stumbling along, panting heavily and covered in sweat and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lake Marinarius came into view as the trees parted way and the path Dravline was trailing came to a stop. The lake was absolutely massive, with beautiful, crystal clear, blue water. A soft and pleasant breeze blew through the area, and the sun shone down from the gorgeous sky up above. Holly\u2019s exhausted mood instantly brightened, and she spread out her arms happily, letting her bag tumble onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDravline sniffed the air and frowned. \u201cThe scent stops here.\u201d She huffed. \u201cThat human cur was definitely here, and not long ago, but I can detect her no longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria shrugged. \u201cMaybe we should rest for a bit. Search the area for more clues. I\u2019m not sure Holly can keep going without a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly managed a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026f-fine. I can k-keep\u2026going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Dravline examined the blonde mage, and sighed. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll take to the skies and search from above. Take your short rest, but be ready to move out when I return.\u201d Without waiting for any approval or confirmation from Veria or Holly, Dravline flapped her powerful wings and shot up into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly watched her leave and then turned to Veria. \u201cI need to change into different clothes. This dress is a mess right now, and I think it\u2019s slowing me down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Veria nodded, not taking her eyes off of Holly. Holly fidgeted and blushed under the lamia\u2019s intense gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026do you have to look?\u201d Holly stammered, prompting a giggle from the playful lamia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Holly\u2026we\u2019re all girls here.\u201d Veria smiled warmly, and Holly finally relented. Slowly, she pulled off her dress and folded it up, placing it beside her bag. She then stripped out of her sweaty underwear, placing them beside her dirty dress. Stark naked, the blonde healer dug around in her bag for new clothes, her face as red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria watched her with a warm and comforting smile, though one could detect an excitable glint in her eyes if one looked close enough. Behind her genuine smile, Veria was struggling to contain herself in front of the unbelievable beautiful human girl she had become good friends with. It took all of her willpower to force back her instinctually, playful desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly changed into a swimsuit she had fashioned out of the same silk fabric from her dress. The swimsuit was two pieces, one of which modestly covered her breasts, while the other piece was wrapped around her waist and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look stunning, Holly dear.\u201d Veria cooed, slithering over to her after she had finished changing. Holly hid a smile behind her hand and blushed, shying away from the lamia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks\u2026\u201d She said, fishing around her bag. \u201c\u2026now, I think I have a towel too. Something to sit on while I rest\u2026yeah! Here it is!\u201d Holly declared, pulling a flat object out of her bag. \u201cLet me just stretch it out a bit.\u201d She said, mostly to herself, as she pulled at the stretchy object until it was a decently big size. She then spread the towel-shaped object out onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria was at a loss for words, as she watched Holly casually pull Jet\u2019s body out of her bag, refer to her as a towel, and then stretch and pull on her squishy friend. It hadn\u2019t yet dawned on Veria just how forgetful and oblivious Holly could be, especially with Jet\u2019s curse of horrible luck. Holly had completely forgotten that she had ever put Jet into her bag, and didn\u2019t even notice her friend\u2019s now comically stretched and squashed face on her \u201ctowel\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026Holly. Do you know that towel is\u2026\u201d Veria began, but her words were cut off as Holly plopped down onto the towel, her big butt crashing down onto Jet\u2019s face. Internally, Jet groaned at the pain her friend was obliviously inflicting on her, but could do absolutely nothing about it while crushed. Her entire face disappeared under her best friend\u2019s ass, the full weight of Holly pressing down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy towel?\u201d Holly titled her head in an adorable way. \u201cWhat about it, Veria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria stopped herself from explaining, a small part of her amused by seeing Holly sit on her unlucky little friend\u2019s face. Deciding that no harm was being done, Veria simply deigned to inform Holly of the truth later, and relish in her cute awkwardness at finding out what she had done to Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Holly. Forget I said anything.\u201d Veria had to look away quickly to hide her bemused grin from Holly\u2019s innocent eyes.<br>\r\nHolly shrugged and turned her eyes back to the lake, smiling from ear-to-ear. \u201cIt really is beautiful here. Dravline is missing this beauty up in the air. Although\u2026maybe it\u2019s even prettier from up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peaceful thirty minutes passed, while Holly and Veria chatted casually. Of course, Jet spent the entire time being sat on by Holly, her best friend\u2019s ass and thighs weighing down on her flattened body. Every time Holly would shift her position, Veria would steal a quick glance at the squashed thief before her face was inevitably covered up again by Holly\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Holly stood up, but did not give Jet a moment of respite. Instead, she wrapped her friend\u2019s crushed body around her like a skirt, Jet\u2019s face was still pressed into her jiggly butt as Holly tightened Jet\u2019s arms into a knot to hold her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to wade into the water for a bit, Veria.\u201d Holly explained, happily strolling towards the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you can swim.\u201d Veria called after her. \u201cUs lamias can\u2019t swim. We sink in deep water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go in too far!\u201d Holly replied. \u201cI just want to enjoy the water a bit before Dravline gets back.\u201d Holly stepped into the water, grinning as the water splashed around her feet. It was the perfect temperature. The blonde girl waded further into the lake, until the water was up to her thighs, and just beginning to lap at Jet\u2019s now skirt-like body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Veria!\u201d Holly turned back to the shore. \u201cThis lake is super deep in the middle! It looks like it leads far down\u2026somewhere! Maybe a cavern or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeria, who was resting by the water\u2019s edge, laughed. \u201cAre you going to swim down and check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly returned her lamia friend\u2019s laugh and was about to reply when something heavy latched onto her legs, and she was yanked under the water in the blink of an eye. Veria screamed, and watched in horror as waves rippled and water splashed about in the area Holly had vanished. A green-finned tail flipped up and down, clear evidence for Holly's attacker being a mermaid. Veria couldn\u2019t go into the water at all without drowning, and could only watch helplessly from the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Veria\u2019s scream, Dravline descended from the air a moment later and plunged into the water. After a long moment of terrifying silence, Dravline emerged from the lake carrying Holly, and deposited her onto the shore. The mermaid's tail vanished under the water, signifying she was leaving. Veria cradled the blonde mage\u2019s head against her prodigious chest, and soothingly rubbed her back. Holly had passed out from the shock, and was unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, where is Jet, who had been wrapped around Holly\u2019s waist like a towel right before the attack?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At just over two decades in age, Koi was still young for a mermaid, still naturally curious and playful as was usual for her kind, though yet to mature fully into their more sensual pursuits. Unfortunately, where once hundreds of her kind had swam freely through these waters, the dangerous and unpredictable nature of the Wildlands had now left her the only mermaid within the seemingly endless lake, as she had been for the last ten years. The young monster\u2019s parents had perished before they could teach her much of the outside world, and Koi found herself intensely curious of the lands beyond the outskirts of her lake, always alert for anything that approached the shore or disturbed the otherwise tranquil surface. It was within her nature to investigate such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaid had been happily gathering a few pearls near the lake\u2019s edge when she felt a stirring in the waters above, her eyes glancing up to see a distant shape moving across the surface. Dropping the pearls without a second thought, Koi kicked her powerful tail and accelerated up towards the movement, her visitor becoming clearer the closer she approached. It didn\u2019t look quite like anything she\u2019d ever seen before, scant coverings across pale skin, and no sign of the scales, fur or horns she was used to seeing adorn the humanoid creatures that entered her waters. It was smaller too than she was used to, and so very delicate looking. Yet it had made it all the way to the lake, despite the unspecified dangers she had been warned lied beyond, so it couldn\u2019t be completely defenceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer curiosity reaching its peak, Koi had innocently tried to pull this interesting thing down to her own level so she could examine it more carefully, gently grabbing it by its ankles and giving a firm tug. What she had not expected was the instant resistance and distress that her actions evoked, the mage girl suddenly kicking violently in an attempt to dislodge her and swirling her arms frantically through the water as she fought to escape the mermaid\u2019s innocent grasp. Caught off guard, Koi tightened her grip and tried again to pull this creature down so that she could show she meant no harm, only for another unexpected guest to arrive in the form of a dragon\u2019s talons suddenly piercing the surface and scratching at vulnerable flesh, leaving a shallow scratch along her arm. Recoiling in fear and pain, Koi pushed away and swam for the depths, heedless of her hand unconsciously closing around the towel that had been wrapped around the smaller girl\u2019s waist and ripping it free as she descended, instinctually gripping tight to the foreign object as she fled the danger above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Jet\u2019s perspective the whole event had been a blur of motion and pain. Still recovering from the shock of being so casually mishandled by her best friend, and wrapped tightly around the girl\u2019s hips, she had been terrified as she felt some unseen force trying to yank the two of them into the water. A brief flash of Dravline\u2019s characteristic warmth had brought hope, but as had been the case ever since she was cursed that hope was quickly dashed and the thief found herself being pulled deeper into the water. Holly had done a good job of thoroughly squishing her face, but she could see just enough to glimpse a dark shape in the water beside her, clearly belonging to whatever was pulling her down. The silhouette seemed strange to her, misshaped, though she wasn\u2019t quite sure what was wrong with it. Whatever it was would have to wait though, as the brunette\u2019s mind was quickly overtaken by a more pressing concern, her entire body beginning to vibrate as the need to breathe took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlight instincts finally beginning to subside, Koi blinked slowly, as for the first time she glanced down at the odd object in her hands, her attention drawn by an unexpected quivering. Not even sure what this object was, the mermaid brought it to her chest as she continued to swim down, clutching its flattened form against her breasts as she sought to bring comfort to\u2026 whatever it was. The odd vibrations continued, only mildly muffled by the pressure of her flesh, and with an instinctive sense of urgency, Koi made a beeline for her home, a raised coral formation at the bottom of the lake with an air bubble inside. It had been built long ago by a much larger creature that once called these waters home, but was now little more than the solitary abode of the lake\u2019s last remaining mermaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipping under the edge of the formation, Koi burst up into the small pocket of air with a splash that echoed loudly in the confined space. Well-adapted to the depths, she could see in near pitch-black conditions, but her sight here was aided by luminescent coral embedded in the walls, bathing the whole space in the light of day. Swimming to the narrow ledge that ran the full circumference of the moon pool, the monster girl pulled her prize from her chest and set it on the solid ground, pulling herself up slightly out of the water and setting her breasts on the edge, lightly brushing them against her new find. Over the years of loneliness, the young mermaid had gathered a number of interesting things from her lake to keep her company, but few as curious as this. The exposure to air seemed to have caused the quivering to subside somewhat, and she stared now with wide curious eyes as she waited for its next move, still unsure if it was some living thing or just a very strange substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jet, struggling to catch her breath but ecstatic just at the chance to breath at all, the light of the coral gave the first real opportunity for her to get a good look at her latest captor. Abnormally large, but not unattractive, sky-blue eyes stared down at her from a soft youthful face that could almost have passed for a human girl\u2019s if not for the shoulder-length algae green hair, emerald lips and ears that looked vaguely like the fins of a fish. The hands that gripped the edge of the shelf on which the thief\u2019s tortured body sat were also webbed, thin membranes stretching between each finger. Over the girl\u2019s slim shoulder Jet could just make out the shape of a long green fish tail swishing back and forth in the water, finally giving her a good idea of what she was dealing with. And, of course, like every other monster she\u2019d met since entering these lands, the mermaid was topless, perfectly symmetrical and seemingly impossibly firm and bouncy breasts practically being shoved directly into her face where they had joined her on the far-too-narrow shelf. They weren\u2019t as big as Veria\u2019s or Dravline\u2019s thankfully, but still large enough that they made Jet wonder exactly what these girls ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft chirping noise drew the thief\u2019s eyes back to Koi\u2019s face and away from her breasts, just in time to see the webbed hands shift forward and start to play with her flattened edges, painfully kneading her flesh as the green-haired girl innocently played with the squished thief. Fascinated by the texture of the unfortunate human, the mermaid started to run her fingers over every inch, marvelling at the feeling and chirping more in excitement at the discovery of something unlike anything she\u2019d seen before. Not at all liking the look in those large eyes, Jet knew she had to act fast to get properly noticed or things could go very bad very quickly, and tried to forcefully will her body to reform.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For once fate seemed to be kind to Jet, if only for a moment, and Koi\u2019s probing fingers kept away just long enough for her tired body to start to reform into its usual shape. It wasn\u2019t much at first, just a slight convulsion as limbs tried to unfold themselves from the squished mash they had been reduced to, but it was enough to get the mermaid\u2019s attention and she backed off as her eyes went wide, a louder chirping emitting from her throat as she lowered herself back into the water so she could float at eye level with her strange find. While she\u2019d suspected it may have been some kind of living creature, the green-haired girl hadn\u2019t expected this level of movement, and she watched in rapt fascination as the squished thief started to resemble a more familiar form, a head beginning to emerge as limbs became clearer and the whole mass started to move away from the water\u2019s edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure just how much of a threat this new monster posed, Jet tried to put as much distance as possible between herself and the curious mermaid, but even as her arms reformed enough to drag herself across the ground, she quickly found herself pressed up against a solid wall of coral, having gained only a few inches of solid ground. Even that gain was quickly undone as Koi simply pulled her upper body back out of the water, elbows resting on the edge while her chest cast a shadow over the unfortunate thief\u2019s now mostly reformed face. Prodigious chest notwithstanding, the mermaid\u2019s human half wasn\u2019t exceptionally large, but she still looked like she could easily be around six feet in height, big enough at least to tower over the still reforming Jet as she backed her into a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette was sure that at any moment this creature was going to bend down and take a bite out of her, that the high pitch chirping was just a prelude to an attack. It was only when several seconds had passed and her body almost completely reformed that she belatedly realised that Koi was trying to communicate, and attempted a response. \u201cHey, I\u2026 I need you to take me back. Back to the\u2026\u201d She trailed off as the mermaid titled her head in clear confusion and just chirped again, inching forward some more until her voluminous chest was pressing into Jet\u2019s own. \u201cAnd\u2026 you don\u2019t understand do you?\u201d The chirp she received was answer enough, making the thief\u2019s stomach drop even if it was accompanied by an innocent smile, as she feebly raised her hands in an attempt to defend herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jet, Koi had still been quite young when she\u2019d lost her parents, and had not had the time to learn to communicate with those beyond the lake. The underwater chirping language of the mermaids was less than ideal in the open air, not to mention unable to be reproduced by a human or similar species. The green haired girl could tell that this squishy person was trying to speak with her, but really had no idea what she was trying to say. Still, she was excited at the prospect of making a friend and when Jet raised her hands she quickly grabbed them with her own, squeezing happily and not even noticing as she squished the unlucky girl\u2019s hands into mush within her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs agonising as it felt to have her hands crushed like that, not to mention the intense pressure of Koi\u2019s massive breasts compressing her own chest, Jet pushed pass it as she desperately sought to communicate, meeting the mermaid\u2019s blue eyes with a pleading look. \u201cPlease\u2026 I need to go back. To the surface. Up. You know\u2026 up.\u201d The brunette directed her gaze up, trying to nod towards the ceiling to get her point across. Koi glanced up as well, so she hoped that at least was clear. \u201cSo\u2026 so just take me back to the water so I can go. Water, right, you must know what that is.\u201d This time she tried to shrug towards the pool in which the mermaid\u2019s lower body was still partially submerged, and was again rewarded when her companion\u2019s attention shifted that way, her grip finally loosening enough for Jet to slip her hands free, mangled and squished but quickly inflating back into shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hands mostly reformed, the brunette applied a gentle pressure to the mermaid\u2019s shoulders and was relieved when Koi actually seemed to receive the message and back off a couple of inches, immediately using the new space to allow for a broader range of visual cues. \u201cI need to go back to my friends okay. You saw them right? There was Holly, the girl you took me from. Her legs are kind of like mine.\u201d She ran a hand along her still slightly squished leg for emphasis. \u201cAnd she\u2019s got blonde hair.\u201d A mild tug to her own ponytail emphasised that point. \u201cThen there\u2019s Dravline and Veria. You may not have seen Veria but I think Dravline came to grab Holly. She a big kind of scary looking dragon lady. And\u2026 and you may have noticed she has massive boobs.\u201d Blushing at the admission, Jet raised her hands to her own much more modest chest and cupped them for emphasis, trying to imitate the way Dravline and Veria\u2019s larger breasts protruded out from their bodies. She was half tempted to point at Koi\u2019s more comparable assets, but was worried she\u2019d convey the wrong idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment there was silence, as the mermaid\u2019s gaze shifted between Jet\u2019s face, the hands cupped around her chest, and the water behind them. With a quiet contemplative chirp, Koi reached down to cup her own chest, gently running her webbed fingers along the flesh. This new friend wanted something to do with her chest and the water right? Which must mean\u2026 With a dawning look of recognition and a much more excited chirp, the green-haired girl turned herself around and excitedly dunked her head into the water, lightly whipping her guest in the face with her hair as she did so. Shaking off the strike, Jet wondered for a moment what exactly this girl was doing, only to notice with shock that the mermaid\u2019s breasts, now pressed against the edge of the pool, were quickly starting to expand, filling up with water and inflating like balloons. With each greedy gulp they expanded further until, with a wet slurping sound, Koi finally pulled her head free and turned back to her stricken captive, her massively engorged chest now visibly jiggling with all the water held inside as she slid back towards the frightened thief, the near-comically enlarged breasts now larger than her head, and big enough even to exceed the assets of the much taller Veria and Dravline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving an awful feeling that she knew what was going to happen next, Jet attempted to hurriedly back away, but with so little room to manoeuvre she was caught in no time at all, the mermaid\u2019s deceptively strong hands grabbing her head and bringing it straight to her chest, any attempt to protest cut off as the girl\u2019s right nipple was unceremoniously shoved into her mouth. Having interpreted the brunette\u2019s earlier gestures, through her limited experience and understanding, as a request to be fed, Koi chirped excitedly as she held the smaller girl against her, squeezing tightly to encourage production as she squirted a burst of water directly into the waiting throat. For her part Jet attempted to struggle, but did little but tickle the mermaid and encourage the production of more water as the green-haired girl hugged her tighter. Swallowing only because she was worried she\u2019d drown if she didn\u2019t, she shuddered at the warmth of the liquid as it travelled down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly a minute for Jet to be released, by which time she was blushing furiously at the indignity of being treated like a baby, while Koi\u2019s chirping had morphed into more of a cooing sound as she misinterpreted her companion\u2019s listless stance as satisfaction. The mermaid\u2019s chest had visibly deflated now, water having been drawn equally from both reservoirs, though it was still larger than it had been before she\u2019d filled up. The look on her face was gentle and caring, but the squishy thief was worried that if she didn\u2019t get through to her things would get worse before they got better. She certainly did not want a repeat of, or any conceivable variation on, what had just happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet weakly propped herself up on her arms, trying to push the memory of being breastfed by the beautiful mermaid in front of her out of her mind. She was fairly powerless in her squishy state, and needed to set the record straight with this na\u00efve fish girl as soon as humanely possible. Far above, she knew her friends were worried sick about her, and she was desperate to return to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jet was entirely unaware of the horrible misunderstanding being created within Koi\u2019s innocent mind. Koi was hardly world-wise, and had only memories with her mother and what little experience she had of the outside world to aid her thought process towards understanding the unique, frail creature seated before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Koi, it was abundantly clear that the humanoid creature in front of her was only a child, as it, or perhaps \u201cshe\u201d, seemed to be constantly frightened and on edge, and had seemingly welcomed and appreciated being breastfed. Koi also came to the conclusion that the other strange creature she had seen (Holly) was Jet\u2019s mother, and assumed she had been taken by the dragon girl who had slashed her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart filled with boundless joy, and longing for connection with another living creature, Koi began to smile warmly. This lonely little creature before her may have lost its mother, but Koi was not going to let anything else ever hurt it again. She was going to care for it like it was her own child, the mermaid girl\u2019s dormant maternal instincts beginning to blossom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet watched the unsettlingly pleasant smile grow on Koi\u2019s face with a rising sense of unease. She prepared to stand up, hoping the height advantage over Koi would give her more control of the conversation, though the grotto\u2019s ceiling was a little low. Before she could even begin to stand up though, Koi grabbed her shoulders and forced her down, the hidden strength she possessed behind her cherubic appearance startling Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlucky thief girl began to thrash about, thinking Koi was preparing to breastfeed her again. Koi pulled her upper body out of the water, pressing her abundant chest against Jet\u2019s own, and partially crushing Jet\u2019s stomach flat. She held Jet\u2019s head still with her hands, her pure eyes sparkling with purpose. Jet froze in fear as the mermaid leaned forward and planted a kiss on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Jet felt her body begin to lose the fill to fight, and her shoulders slumped. Jet\u2019s head fell down and landed on Koi\u2019s large breasts, the mermaid\u2019s jiggly flesh providing a comfortable pillow. Jet\u2019s eyes closed, and she was out like a light. Koi chirped in a manner akin to giggling, and didn\u2019t even dare to move, to amused by the squishy creature\u2019s slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoi, being a mermaid, would eventually develop the desire to find a man and mate. Her sensual drive would kick in in a few years\u2019 time, but her body still possessed the necessary properties to draw men to her. One such ability was a secretion from her lips that sedated anyone she kissed. Koi had seen her mother use it various times, including on herself to inflict instant sleep. Koi had always loved her mother\u2019s soft kisses before sleep, and was now employing her memory towards her new ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet slept for several hours, until finally stirring awake, glancing up groggily. She almost had a heart attack as the first thing she saw was Koi\u2019s perky nipple being thrust into her mouth. A firm, webbed hand on the back of her head kept her held firmly in place, despite her struggles. Jet endured another humiliating session of breastfeeding before the oblivious mermaid pulled away, allowing Jet to fall over onto her back, blushing profusely and mentally exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up at the ceiling, Jet could still see Koi in her peripheral vision, the green-haired mermaid continuously staring at her happily, a cute smile on her face. Jet cursed her terrible luck, and Clara specifically, for allowing something like this ludicrous situation to ever happen. Jet was trapped in this grotto by the unwarranted protection of a beautiful mermaid, and there was hardly a thing she could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet purposefully avoided Koi\u2019s gaze for a full thirty minutes, hoping she could eventually bore the curious mermaid. Her plan worked, as Koi eventually popped under the water, swimming away to somewhere or other. Jet didn\u2019t really care, as all she needed was for Koi to leave to put her escape plan into motion. It was a long way back to the surface, but Jet would have to take that chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet hopped into the water, and was almost instantly paralyzed by just how freezing cold the water was in the darkest depths of the lake. Her body froze up, her squishy properties having an negative effect in conjunction with the water temperature. Unable to paddle to stay afloat, Jet began to sink under the water, her eyes wide with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Koi burst out of the water, her powerful tail slapping against Jet\u2019s body and pushing her out of the water and back onto the coral grotto\u2019s ledge, partially crumpled. The curvaceous mermaid looked at Jet almost with an expression of disappointment. A sequence of melodic chirping noises from Koi seemed to convey that the mermaid was\u2026chiding her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoi, though she had been some distance away, had heard the baby creature fall into the water immediately, and had darted back in seconds. Seeing the squishy creature sink beneath the water made it clear (in her mind) that the child was simply incapable of swimming, and now needed her constant attention and supervision. She vowed to never take her eyes off of her strange but lovable new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet found herself being picked up by Koi, and though she weakly attempted to squirm away, was fairly effortless bunched up into a small ball by the mermaid\u2019s webbed hands. Koi, radiating motherly love, gently shoved Jet down her cleavage, tucking her between her two gigantic breasts. Unable to do a thing, Jet could only watch as everything became dark, and soft flesh surrounded her on all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoi\u2019s perfectly shaped breasts were firm yet soft, creating an uncomfortably comfortable sort of prison around Jet\u2019s entire body. The mermaid\u2019s soft heartbeat resounded in a rhythmic manner, and Jet could feel Koi\u2019s happy chirping reverberate through her flesh. Jet was now stuck with no hope of escape, completely at the mercy of a mermaid who only thought she was doing the right thing in protecting the helpless little creature before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to the unfathomably horrible situation her new friend was in, Koi pressed up against the ledge, resting her head and closing her eyes. She could fell the squishy little creature between her boobs, and it comforted her to know that the poor thing was loved, protected, and safe with her. Feeling exceptionally elated, Koi drifted into peaceful slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took the two girls some significant effort to track down a lead on the traitorous rouge, but they were eventually able to determine that she had fled to the east, apparently intending to sell the mirror before picking up some more work. Holly had wanted to just let things be, arguing that nothing good could come of following their former companion, but Jet was set on seeking justice for Clara\u2019s actions and stubbornly put her foot down until her friend eventually capitulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither was sure how far the other girl had intended to go. The Giantess Kingdom lay to the east but there were any number of smaller settlements along the way that could have been her destination. If her goal was the kingdom itself then things would likely become more difficult, since entry into those lands was tightly controlled for the safety of all involved. Still, Jet was determined to see this through, and told herself that she wouldn\u2019t allow anything to get in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays had passed, and the two had now been on the road for a full week since the incident with the mirror. In that time they had yet to see any sign of Clara, though in some of the towns they had passed through along the way they had been told of a person matching her description heading further east. The more they travelled the more clear that their final destination was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of this journey Jet had held no qualms at all about entering a kingdom full of women who would tower above her. In fact in many respects she had been looking forward to it. But\u2026 the last week had changed her viewpoint slightly, and as much as she tried to suppress it, she was beginning to feel fear gnawing at her mind. For there had been an unusual number of unfortunate incidents over this last week, instances of bad luck that were uncommon to the cunning thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Jet had tried to shake it off as a sequence of coincidences only. Sure she\u2019d twisted her ankle more often than someone as nimble as her should have, and taken more than a couple of tumbles, but maybe she just wasn\u2019t use to this terrain yet, and besides she had Holly there to heal her each time. And if the number of monsters and wild animals they encountered along the way seemed uncommonly large, then that was just the reality of these lands to which she had never before been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the more things that happened, the more the young thief was starting to think that the rumours of the mirror breaking curse may have been true. Some things were just harder to shake off than others. After all, there was only so many times she could put down Holly accidentally sitting on her face as a coincidence. She knew the other girl would never do that on purpose, yet lately it seemed like every time she let her head lay down the healer\u2019s rear would find it soon after. There was always an explanation of course, a fall or disorientation from tiredness, or even that the other girl was asleep and just rolling around, but it wasn\u2019t the kind of thing you expected to happen every day, and Holly had never been like that before in all the years that they had known each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t the other girl\u2019s butt then it was her feet making Jet\u2019s life difficult. On more occasions than she could count, she\u2019d hit the ground in a fight or from yet another fall and had had the healer obliviously trample over her, stepping on her chest, or crotch, or face in shoes and bare feet alike. More than once Holly had stomped down hard enough to temporarily wind or disorient Jet and had proceeded to twist her feet while searching for the missing thief. She had even wiped her soles clean using the other girl\u2019s face, which was made all the worse by her sudden propensity for going barefoot so frequently. Most of the time she didn\u2019t even notice what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rubberfy spell had only made things worse of course. Now not only did Jet have to deal with the weight of her friend\u2019s feet and rear pressing down on her, but half the time they left behind indents that she had to struggle to remove, and her squishiness only made it harder for the healer to realise her mistakes. There was nothing quite like being woken from a nap to find that your head had somehow been reduced to a flat squishy cushion for your partner to rest her sweaty ass on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse of all, on the first day of their trip Holly had eaten some wield berries that had apparently disagreed with her stomach, since she\u2019d been stricken with terrible flatulence ever since. The thing was, it never seemed to cause the healer any visible discomfort, and indeed she appeared almost unaware of it. Yet whenever circumstances would see her butt before, or on, Jet\u2019s face, a hot gust of wind would assault the thief\u2019s nostrils. Just today she\u2019d been helping the girl climb an embankment, pushing her from behind while a steady stream of farts were pushed into her face in return. And, of course, they\u2019d only brought one tent with them, which meant Jet spent most nights trying to get to sleep among the haze of Holly\u2019s fragrant emissions quickly filling the small confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Jet couldn\u2019t deny that there was something more serious at play here than happenstance, so now that they were finally approaching the outskirts of the Giantess Kingdom, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if this might not be a huge mistake. If she was having this must difficulty with a normal sized woman, and her best friend at that, was she really going to be able to survive among giants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she trudged on, leading Holly towards the nearest entrance. These were the spots where humans and other smaller races could gain entrance to the kingdom beyond, and where they would be provided with the knowledge and instructions they needed to stay safe within. The only downside was that the approach required the traversal of a fairly narrow path on a hill high above a much broader route that was used by giantesses returning from outside of the kingdom. Under ordinary circumstances, the nimble thief would have tackled that path without a second thought, but right now as she climbed up Jet couldn\u2019t help but feel like she was walking towards her doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite those misgivings, the two did make good progress for a time, and had crossed nearly half the distance to the entrance when minute tremors began to run through the ground. At first these were dismissed out of hand, but then they started to build and the sound of thunder began to sound in the distance, regular and powerful, and coming closer. With a startled gasp, Jet realised that this could only mean the approach of one or more giantesses, and she and Holly both turned to look behind them. But as she did so, the young thief\u2019s footing slipped in the dirt\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a fairly typical day for Liara as she made her way back towards her home. She\u2019d volunteered to visit the nearest human kingdom again to gather some supplies and delicacies that weren\u2019t usually available to her fellow giantesses, and was on her way back with a full bag of goods handing from her shoulder. Though she\u2019d only recently reached maturity this was already a common event for her, since she enjoyed getting the chance to interact with the smaller races in their own territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara had always been a kind girl, and absolutely loved doting on those who were smaller, younger or otherwise weaker than her. When she was younger and unable to leave the kingdom, this had mostly been confined to giantess children, although the occasional visitor from the outside world had also found themselves carefully tended to by the young girl. Though more than one had pointed out how patronising this conduct was, they mostly accepted that she had only good intentions. Now older, she\u2019d gotten over her previous habit of picking people up without warning, but still couldn\u2019t quite help fawning over them. Still, most people she visited accepted her readily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the massive girl, she had an audience as she closed in on one of the few mountain passes that allowed passage to the kingdom beyond. Both Jet and Holly looked up in awe as the giantess approached, her bare feet pounding against the ground and generating clouds of dust and mini-earthquakes as she walked. Long red hair framed a youthful looking face, offset against prominent and mature curves, and a simple brown dress covered the pale skin of her torso while leaving the majority of her arms and mile-long legs exposed. Neither of the two adventurers had ever seen a giantess up close like this before, and they were momentarily stunned at the existence of such a massive humanoid, the tip of her head reaching easily fifty feet, if not more, into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jet, while Holly continued to be mesmerised by the approaching titan, her own attempt to get a closer look resulted in her shoes slipping on the loose earth of the path, and the next thing she knew her feet went out from under her and she was tumbling down the side of the hill. By this point Liara had come so close that the thunderous sound of her footsteps covered the sounds of Jet\u2019s fall and her calls for help as she crashed down towards the path below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only now that the giantess\u2019s gaze moved to the path, having momentarily forgotten the need to keep an eye out for any tiny visitors. She was surprised and pleased to see Holly standing there, and offered a small smile and a wave as she approached, which was quickly returned by the awe-struck healer, neither of them aware of what was about to occur. Distracted as she was, Liara didn\u2019t pay any attention to her next footfall as her bare sole raised itself high above the unlucky thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jet the next few seconds happened in slow motion. Despite her best attempts to arrest her momentum, her uncontrolled tumble had carried her out into the middle of the path and left her lying on her back winded and bruised and unable to do anything but scream out as she watched the foot of the massive redhead slowly rise and cast its deep shadow over her defenceless form. \u201cNo! Please! You have to see me!\u201d It was pointless of course, even if she\u2019d had enough air in her lungs to scream at full capacity, the distance to Liara\u2019s ears was just too far for the sound to reach. As the massive sole descended there was just enough time for Jet\u2019s adrenaline-filled perceptions to make out the layers of dirt and detritus covering the giantess\u2019s left foot before it crashed down upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Liara it was a footstep like any other, and to Holly it was just another booming retort and a spray of dust as the titanic woman went to pass her by with one last smile. For Jet, however, it was perhaps the worse pain she had ever experienced. The boulder had been bad of course, and it had lasted for so long that she\u2019d felt like she wanted to die, but if she thought that rock had been heavy then she clearly hadn\u2019t known what heavy really was. While not overweight by any sense of the word, Liara was built on a whole different scale than anything the thief had encountered before, and probably weighed more than the combined weight of every person and building in her home town put together. And now all of that frightful mass was being pushed down on Jet\u2019s squishy body, pancaking her so quickly that the giantess didn\u2019t even feel a thing as Jet was smashed into oblivion beneath the ball of her foot, every nerve in the rubber girl\u2019s body flaring at the sheer agony of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got even worse as Liara moved to take her next step, her other foot rising to allow all of her weight to press down on the left alone, and then worsened further still as the heel of that foot rose as well, the ground beneath actually sinking down several inches from the force of it. By the time the whole sole finally lifted it had left a deep crater behind, filled with the leftover residue of the massive footstep, and already starting to crumble into dust as the earthen walls were shook apart by the continuing vibrations of the departing woman\u2019s thunderous steps. High above, and blissfully oblivious to what she had just done, Liara simply turned back to offer one last wave to Holly over her shoulder, before setting her sights on home and picking up the pace a little for the final stretch.</span></div></div>",

As her faced turned away her long red hair fanned out behind her on a gust of wind blowing down from the mountains. Slender shoulders sat above prominent breasts, the angle of the path allowing the tiny healer to see the edge of the right breast beyond the gentle slope of Liara\u2019s back. Further down a narrow waist flared into wide hips, the lowest reaches of the redhead\u2019s cheeks peeking out from beneath the hem of her dress as she bounced down the path. Beneath that, long slender legs rose and fell rhythmically, lifting smooth if somewhat dirty soles into the air to slam down on the path again and again. And there, barely visible against the ball of the left foot was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJet!\u201d The wonder that Holly had felt was suddenly replaced with terror as she just barely saw the flattened form of her friend adhered to the foot of the giantess moments before it slammed into the ground once more, raising another cloud of dust and debris. For several crucial seconds she was frozen in shock, just watching as Liara pulled further away, before finally lurching into motion and sprinting after her best friend and her unknowing captor. \u201cWait! Wait! Please stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Liara had heard Holly she would have stopped. If she had known what was happening beneath her feet she would probably have cried. The redhead was always accommodating to the smaller races, human or otherwise, and would have spared as much time as needed to settle whatever was on the healer\u2019s mind, but the sound of a human, from behind and at ground level, is little more than the tweeting of a distant bird to a giantess, audible only if specific attention is being paid. So it was that, instead of stopping, Liara actually increased her pace, moving from a sedate walk to a more powerful stride as she closed in on her home town and a chance to rest at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Jet!\u201d Even as the giantess began to pull away from her Holly still tried to give chase. No matter how many unfortunate incidents may have occurred over the last week, Jet was still her very best friend in the whole world, and it broke her heart to see her being taken away like this. Worse, she knew at least part of this was her fault, and that there was no way the thief would have gotten stuck like that without the rubberfy curse, though then she may have been killed instead. Regardless of her intentions however, there was simply no way Holly could hope to keep up with Liara\u2019s massive strides, a single step for the redhead carrying her over a distance Holly couldn\u2019t hope to match. Never the fittest person at the best of times, the healer eventually gave up on running, slowing to a more manageable pace and vowing that she\u2019d find a way to save her friend eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, unaware of events outside, Jet was suffering in agony beneath her unaware captor\u2019s left foot. When the massive sole had come down it had compacted her face-first against the ball of the foot and she was now forced to periodically endure the weight of this goddess-like being as she carried her who-knows-where. While it would be true to say that the flesh of Liara\u2019s foot was more giving than the boulder she had been crushed by a week ago, it was entirely evident that the redhead did not frequently wear footwear, if ever, as her soles were well hardened from a lifetime of being slammed into the ground and in many ways pressed down harder than the ground beneath. More significantly, the weight of that boulder couldn\u2019t hold a candle to the weight of this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hope that Jet may have had for peeling off the foot was quickly lost as a fresh layer of dirt and grime was caked over her body, each footstep packing in a little bit more to gradually obscure her twisted and tortured body from view beneath the dust and twigs. Even if Holly had someone been able to catch up, it was doubtful she would have been able to see the unfortunate thief at this point, and there was every chance that she\u2019d have concluded her to have fallen off and send Liara on her way. Though unable to see any of this from her position, Jet could feel the unpleasant sensation of the muck spreading across her back, even as the hard stones and brambles beneath tore and scrapped at her clothes, ripping them from her body. And she knew. She knew that if nothing happened to save her soon, she could remain trapped here for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully ignorant to the concerns of either of the humans, Liara didn\u2019t feel even the slightest hint of Jet\u2019s presence as she strode up the checkpoint, exchanging a cheery wave with the guard before stepping through. Reaching the township proper would require going a bit further uphill, over rougher and stonier ground, but that was of no concern to the redhead. She\u2019d tread this path many times before after all, and there was no reason why this time would be any different. Her tiny passenger would receive no mercy as she began her ascent, and by the time Holly reached the checkpoint to speak with the guard and attempt to gain entry, the giantess was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuilt similar to a human township, albeit on a much larger scale, the village of the giantesses had all the usual facilities such a town would offer. Scattered among the various houses were a number of common areas, ranging from communal eating halls to public baths, and various businesses and workshops that catered to the community\u2019s needs, including a library, a blacksmith, and a musician\u2019s tower. Right now though, after being away for so long, Liara had only one destination in mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sore and dirty after a week on the road, Liara wanted nothing more than to hit the baths and finally get clean. It wasn\u2019t that she was obsessed with staying clean or anything, if she had been she would have just taken a bath in a lake or something, observers be damned. Rather, she had simply reached her limit for an allowable amount of grime, well aware that she now had a thin coating of dust across most of her skin, and that her feet in particular were several shades darker than they had been when she set out. As such, she needed to get to the baths as a matter of priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill utterly oblivious to the squishy human who had become a part of the latest coating of her left sole, the redhead strode through the village and exchanged a few pleasant greetings with the other giantesses she met along the way, as well as the handful of smaller folks she saw on the higher walkways that crisscrossed above the streets. The pathways were deliberately positioned to stay out of the road of any gigantic foot traffic, though Liara still had to pay attention less she accidentally bump them with her shoulders or head. Fortunately, the villages\u2019 residents were well use to their tiny visitors by now and while there had been problems in the past, incidents were now unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Liara reached her own home and hurriedly dumped her bag at the door before changing direction and making a beeline for the closest baths. She twisted around on the ball of her left foot as she did so, and had her hearing been better she might have heard Jet\u2019s scream as her body was roughly stretched across the unforgiving flesh. A few more hurried steps brought Liara to her destination, and she took a deep and relaxing breath as she pushed through the curtains and allowed her feet to press down on the warm tiles of the bathhouse, steam from the baths billowing up to surround her as a pleasant heat settled into her tired muscles and bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jet the rough ground of the village was replaced with the smoother surface of the tiles, but any benefit was easily offset by the rapidly rising heat that made it feel like she was being ironed to the sole. Worse, the increased temperature was causing the pours of Liara\u2019s foot to open, and unleash a fresh torrent of sweat that immediately began to soak into the thief\u2019s defenceless body. The scent of dirt was replaced with the stench of sweat, and the redhead\u2019s weight continued to crush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased to see that the bathhouse was mostly empty save for a couple of other giantesses on the far side, Liara wasted no time stripping off her dress and undergarments, before grabbing a bucket and moving to sit down on one of the nearby stools. This provided some slight relief for Jet as the weight pressing down on her was drastically reduced, but she now found herself pressed down into a puddle of water, which was rising up to fill the gaps around her and restricting her breath. Whereas before the sole had lifted and fallen continuously, now it was pressed flat against the tiles, and the tiny thief tried desperately to struggle, less she suffocate beneath this oblivious woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to the dangerous situation beneath her left foot, Liara filled the bucket with water from the nearby tap and then upended it over her own head, shivering slightly as the cooler water ran over her skin before grabbing a nearby wash cloth. The fresh wave pooled around her feet and threatened to drown Jet once and for all, but she was saved at the last moment as her prison rose from the floor and was flipped over the face its owner. Saved from one potential fate that was, only to be plunged into one that may have been even worse as the redhead started to clean her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving decided to start her wipe down from the bottom and work her way up, Liara didn\u2019t hesitate to drive the momentarily clean cloth into the layers of grime that had accumulated across the ball of her left foot, frowning slightly at the chunks of dirt and bits off greenery that came free and showered down on the tiles below. She knew it had gotten bad down there, but this was frankly even worse than she had expected, and the feeling of it all mixing with her sweat was distinctly less than pleasant. Thankfully a few firm scrubs removed the majority of the detritus, and she was able to move to cleaning the remainder of her foot, scrubbing the cloth along the step and heel, and then driving it between each of her toes to remove the grime that had accumulated there as well. Had she taken a closer look at the cloth in that moment, she may have just barely been able to see Jet\u2019s twisted body stuck to the cloth as she scoured the unlucky thief all over her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the immediate threat to her life had been removed, Jet couldn\u2019t help but wonder if death would have been preferable to this torment. She\u2019d gone from being crushed beneath one part of a dirty foot, to being grinded into ever filthy inch of it, an endless torrent of sweat and grime smeared across her face and forced down her throat. Tears came to her eyes, mixing with the rest of the muck surrounding her, and bringing her no mercy as Liara simply switched her attention to her other foot, carrying Jet to the sole she hadn\u2019t yet met and making sure they became well acquainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was satisfied that her feet were sufficiently clean, Liara quickly moved to clean her arms, legs, shoulders and torso, rubbing her tiny prisoner over every inch of her body as she hummed a pleasant little tune and revelled in the feeling of all the dust being scrubbed away. By the time she reached her armpits Jet was wishing she could go back to drowning beneath this woman\u2019s feet, unable to do anything to defend herself as her face was scrapped over the sweaty pits and her screams muffled into obscurity by the putrid nectar. A week\u2019s worth of dried moisture was set free by the wet cloth, and it seemed like every last drop of it was pouring into the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not done with her unintentional torture, Liara lent forward and lifted her large butt from the stool, bringing the cloth and its passenger around to face the twin moons of her rear before forcing Jet into them face-first. The shortness of her dress meant that most times when she sat on the ground her cheeks would press into the dirt directly, so the redhead took her time thoroughly scrubbing every inch of her derriere, and the cloth had become almost black by the time she pulled it away. She finished by bringing the now thoroughly used fabric up to her chest and wiping off all of the dirt and sweat that had accumulated beneath her breasts and within the depths of her cleavage, plunging the cloth in and out of her cleavage as she made sure to clean every last bit of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after several minutes of cleaning that Liara finally judged herself fresh enough to enter the baths proper, dumping one last bucket of water over her head and running her fingers through her hair to remove the twigs that had gotten caught in the flowing locks. She scrunched the cloth up in her hands, wringing it out to remove as much of the accumulated grime as possible before dumping it next to her bucket and leaving both for the next person to enter the baths as she rose from her seat and strode towards the main baths, where she planned to join the existing bathers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whether it could be considered fortunate or not, Jet was spared being used to clean the endless expanse of Liara\u2019s chest, and the inevitable horrors that would have resulted if she was left behind on the cloth. Yet this was only because the giantess\u2019s thorough scrubbing of her own rear had peeled the unfortunate thief from the cloth and transferred her to the redhead\u2019s bulbous cheek. Smeared face-first against the near endless expanse of flesh, the comparably tiny brunette was crushed beneath it as her captor sat back down properly and finished her cleaning, and was then carried into the air as she dropped off the cloth and headed towards the baths proper. The swaying hips were nauseating, yet Jet knew full well this was nothing compared to what awaited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Liara had no idea that her ass had acquired a tiny passenger, and to any observer the squished girl would be basically indistinguishable, only a minute difference in tone differentiating her from the giantess\u2019s skin. Carefree, the redhead stepped up to the baths and exchange a casual greeting with some of the other bathers before waltzing into the nearest unoccupied part and shuddering in pleasure as the warmth saturated into her tired feet. For a short moment she just stood there, but soon enough the need to warm the rest of her body drove Liara to lower herself down, butt pushing outwards as she descended and plunged her new tattoo into the hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to even struggle at this point, Jet could only discern her surroundings through the feeling of the flesh to which she was adhered. The wobbling cheek stilled and began to warm as Liara stepped into the water, then tightened as it began to descend, the feeling of gravity starting to make itself known as the redhead\u2019s weight shifted. Scant seconds later a burning wave of water washed over the trapped thief, her flattened lungs attempting to emit a pained scream as her vulnerable skin was scorched by the sudden assault, only its rubbery nature preventing it from burning through. Realising what was about to happen, Jet wanted desperately to be anywhere but here, but there was nothing she could do as the stone floor of the bath rose up to meet her and in an instant she was flattened worse than ever as her captor sat down heavily, the ass above twisting around slightly as the giantess got comfortable. Nothing more than an insignificant speck on the rear of a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse than just being crushed, the unfortunate thief found herself wholly unable to breath in this position, drowning beneath not just endless gallons of burning water, but also the seemingly infinite expanse of flesh that bore down on her. High above, Liara remained oblivious as she shifted again, wiggling her butt around in pleasure as the warmth seeped fully into her body. After so long on the road there really was nothing better than a good soak to just wash away all of the aches and pains, and there was basically nowhere else in the world that a giantess could get this kind of treatment. If Jet\u2019s presence registered at all, it was only as I slight inconsistency in the texture of the stone, not even a discomfort, and certainly not something that required even a moment of her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulverised beneath the redhead\u2019s tremendous weight, Jet could feel her mind starting to waver as her body screamed for air, every nerve consumed simultaneously both with the incredible agony of her position and the desperate need for oxygen. Of all the ways her adventuring could have ended, she had known that death was a real possibility, but to pass on like this was something she\u2019d never imagined, not even in her worst nightmares. It hurt, it was humiliating, and worse than that there was a very real possibility her fate would never be discovered. That she would just become a part of this giant woman\u2019s rear, fading quickly from memory, like she\u2019d never existed in the first place. For someone who had wanted to be the best, to be remembered, that was the worst thing of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as the seconds ticked by, though the pain and searing heat remained, the need for air started to fade. The brunette\u2019s lungs still burned but the blackness at the edges of her mind began to clear, and it was with a sense of both relief and terror that Jet realised that with her body in this state her desire to breath was more one of instinct than actually need. Relief because it was not yet her fate to die in such a humiliating way. Terror because this meant she would be forced to endure yet longer beneath the crushing weight of Liara\u2019s booty, from which she might never again escape. Indeed, the unlucky thief continued to be smeared further as the giantess shifted around, ground into the bulbous rear as high above her captor calmly washed the warm water through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torment would continue for over an hour as Liara made sure to soak away every ounce of stress from her body, the nearby furnaces making sure that the water stayed pleasantly warm throughout, from her perspective at least. Her tired muscles relaxed and she threw her head back and moaned deeply as her pores opened and purged themselves of her accumulated sweat and grime, sliding off her current perch to sit even deeper in the water and allowing the water to flow over her shoulders. By the time the redhead was ready to depart the other patrons had already left, and she was alone in the room as she finally rose from the waters and headed back towards the entrance in search of her discarded clothes. She did pass some more women coming in as she left, but spared them little more than a casual wave as she recovered her clothing and moved to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Liara leaves, is Jet still stuck to her posterior, and if so, how does she now appear?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liara lifted her foot into the air once more, taking another powerful step forwards and towards her home. As her foot lifted off of the ground and into the air, Jet was paralyzed with fear as she felt her body rise into the air. Defying belief, her body was plastered to the dirty, slightly sweaty sole of Liara\u2019s foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet\u2019s body flew through the air, engrained into the very pores of Liara\u2019s foot. She tried everything she could to wiggle and shake her body loose, but it was useless. She couldn\u2019t budge at all, and soon found the ground crashing back into her as Liara\u2019s foot pounded into the dirt. Jet mentally cried out in pain as her body was smacked forcefully onto the rocky ground, but her silent pleas went unanswered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara continued walking towards her home, blissfully unaware of the torment she was subjecting Jet to. If she had known, her kind and caring nature would have led her to be horrified at her actions. Regardless, as she didn\u2019t know, she kept walking with a happy smile on her face. She had been out of her city and touring the world for the past week, and she sorely missed her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the cliff, Holly watched Liara until she was a long way away. She had never before seen a giantess, and their visage was enrapturing. Unfortunately, her attention had been completely focused on Liara\u2019s face and body, and not the sole of her foot. Jet\u2019s horrible fate had gone completely unnoticed. As Holly turned to a Jet who was no longer there, she wondered what had happened to her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the giantess city finally appeared on the horizon. Giantesses lived in what was basically a normal human city, only upscaled to the hundredth degree in order to fit with their massive size. Liara strolled through the city gates, taking note of the tiny door used for normal sized humans to enter and exit the city. She waved to a few tinies, and then walked onto the main street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling down the smooth paved roads, Liara felt the slightest irritation on the sole of her left foot. She decided to ignore it, as she was almost home. Turning down a few different roads, she reached her home and walked inside. Almost immediately, her mother lunged forward and embraced her daughter in a huge hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiara! I missed you so much!\u201d Liara\u2019s mother, Lana, bawled. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was great mom.\u201d Liara smiled. Lana looked a lot like her daughter, only older. Her red hair was a little shorter, and her skin was a little less smooth, but she still retained most of the charm of her younger years. She was only thirty-eight years old after all, and her massive and mature curves proved she still had a lot going for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it at dinner. For now, I\u2019ve already prepared the tub for you!\u201d Lana grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks mom!\u201d Liara strolled into the bathroom, closing the wooden door behind her. She unstrapped her towel and let it fall to the floor. She then stepped into the tub, letting the hot water sooth her spirit. She let out a low sigh of pleasure, and sank up to her neck into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jet\u2019s soft skin was practically being flayed by the hot water of the bath. Also, her flat body still needed air to breathe, and her lungs were quickly running out of capacity. She wondered for a brief moment if all her life had just been leading to this moment. Plastered to the foot of a giantess, and drowning in the water of her bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Liara lifted her feet out of the water and propped them up on the edge of the tub. Jet mentally shouted for joy, as her life had been spared. She also realized quickly that Liara had dozed off and fallen asleep. Though her body had been battered quite thoroughly, she was still able to finally reform after about twenty minutes. Thankfully, Liara stayed asleep the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her normal human shape, Jet carefully balanced on the edge of the tub. She peered around Liara\u2019s left foot, glancing at Liara\u2019s peaceful, happy, slumbering face. As much as the giantess scared her, Jet\u2019s best bet at the moment would be to get help from someone, and as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left her with only two options. She could try to get help from Liara, who was lying here, asleep in the bathtub. Or, she could leave the bathroom via the crack under the door, and try to get help from Lana instead. Jet assumed that Lana would be currently cooking dinner in the kitchen, if the conversation she had just barely managed to overhear was correct. That could be a very dangerous situation, but Jet also didn\u2019t know how difficult it would be to wake a sleeping giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Jet decide to do?</span></div></div>",

They knew the journey would take a few days, at least, and they didn\u2019t want to give Clara a bigger head start than she already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe travel was simple at first, and Jet and Holly were almost having an experience one could define as \u201cfun\u201d. The weather was nice, and the roads were well-traveled and easy to follow. Jet and Holly were able to joke and look on the bright side of their situation. They were making great time, and would approach the alchemist swamps in only another day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble started the morning of the third day of travel. Jet\u2019s cursed luck, all thanks to that shattered mirror, kicked in. Jet woke up in total darkness, having no idea where she was. It turned out that, during the night, Holly had rolled over Jet, squashing her flat. Then, the next morning, Holly had unknowingly folded Jet up and packed her into the bag of supplies she carried with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jet\u2019s body reformed back to normal size, she exploded out of the bag, ripping the bag in half. The contents of the bag, including all of their food, fell onto the dirty, trodden ground. Holly had, of course, apologized quite profusely, but they were still in a particularly sticky situation without any provisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Jet and Holly went out to scour for some food, managing to get the jump on a horde of wild pigs. It didn\u2019t take long for the stampede of pigs to trample Jet underfoot, squashing her onto the ground. Her own partner did the same moments later, desperately trying to catch a pig before they all escape. Jet had stuck to her boot, and was dragged along the ground behind her for the better part of half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet had insisted on sleeping away from Holly that night to avoid another accident. Unfortunately, Holly was stirred awake by her growling belly, and she fumbled blindly around their camp looking for food. She had stumbled into Jet, accidentally squashing her face. In her drowsy, craving brain, Holly had confused Jet for some doughy bread. Jet woke up with half of her head crammed into Holly\u2019s mouth, and it had taken all of her strength to shove Holly away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrible accidents plagued the remaining two days of the trip, not in the least limited to Holly stepping on Jet, sitting on Jet, leaving Jet behind, and unknowingly getting Jet stuck to various parts of her body or clothing. Nature itself was also cruel to Jet. She was flattened and blow for miles by the wind, trapped in quicksand, and struck by lightning. She would have most likely died without Holly\u2019s healing magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the weary duo entered the alchemist swamps, and a large building came into view. Not really having any other plan, Holly and Jet pushed through the doors and stepped into the strange building. It was a place like nothing they had ever seen. Alchemists bustled left and right, running all over the place. Chemicals and magic spell books were everywhere the eye could see. Complex machinery lined the walls, and boggled their minds. Jet and Holly were reeling, when a voice shook them from their thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me. May I help you?\u201d A kind voice asked, Jet and Holly turned around towards the source of the voice. A girl in her twenties stood behind them, and she was dressed in a tight brown coat and miniskirt. Her chocolate colored hair flowed down past her shoulders, but was pushed out of her face by two cute hairpins. She was wearing glasses that seemed to really accentuate her piercing, hazel eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026\u201d Holly stumbled over her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re\u2026explorers.\u201d Jet ad-libbed. \u201cAnd we\u2019re looking for someone by the name of Clara. Do you know her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026I can\u2019t say that I do.\u201d The alchemist rubbed her chin thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. If she\u2019s in the swamplands, there are many places that she may be hiding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Makes sense.\u201d Jet sighed, feeling defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be opposed to helping. My name is Dahlia.\u201d Dahlia pushed her glasses up and smiled cutely. \u201cWhat might you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFood.\u201d Holly admitted, rather bluntly. Jet was surprised. \u201cAnd a place to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly. We have all sorts of delicious food here at the School of Alchemy! Right this way.\u201d Dahlia took Holly\u2019s hand and began leading her down one of the various corridors. Holly looked over her shoulder at Jet, who was still not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you coming Jet?\u201d She inquired. Jet waved her hand at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a minute.\u201d Jet assured her. A few moments later, Dahlia and Holly disappeared from Jet\u2019s view. Jet was far too enraptured by the School of Alchemy to care about food at the moment. The building was huge and magnificent, and all of the marvels contained within fascinated Jet. Secretly, deep down, Jet was considering stealing something. Surely most of what this School contained could be sold for a fortune!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying her best to act inconspicuous, Jet glanced around at the various doors and corridors in the School\u2019s lobby. There were passages leading to labs and experimentation rooms, as well as libraries and study areas. Hundreds of alchemists scurried about, not paying more attention to Jet than their work. Jet smiled mischievously, wondering where she should go, and hoping that there wouldn't be any guards to catch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoolishly, she didn\u2019t stop to think how her cursed luck might turn her little exploring into a life-threatening accident. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jet strolled casually through the many different hallways and corridors in search of an easy mark her attention was grabbed by an almighty bang coming from a room just a few doors down followed by an almighty plume of thick black smoke. Weirdly enough the bystanders didn\u2019t even flinch, the devastating blast not even registering a response. Instead they continued to converse with one another and go about their daily lives like nothing had even happened.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity soon got the better of her and she rushed over to the doors entrance. Using her best stealth skills she pressed herself to the wall just opposite the two bulky iron doors. Jet knew that with her luck heading straight in would most likely lead to an unfortunate end with whatever was inside this mystery room. So instead she leaned over slightly casting her body in front of the right hand door and attempted to peek through the small window situated near the top of each door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room was a swirl of smoke, so dense she couldn\u2019t see anything that could have caused this mess let alone what was actually in there in the first place. Jet had to assume whatever it was in there, was probably just a big pile of rubble by now and definitely not in any condition for a thief to bother pilfering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that she stepped away only for the door to swing violently open knocking her back and pressing her into the wall behind her, and scrunching her facial features into the small window pane. Jet\u2019s squished lungs tried desperately to make a sound to alert the many others littering the hallways but no one seemed interested in the poor thief girls\u2019 attempts to free herself from the heavy door. So with her one un-squashed eye she began to scan around for any sign of rescue only to see a small woman appear from the billowing smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a slim build with a fairly flat chest compared to most of the other women in the building; her face was also very fair though covered with a layer of thick dust and her eyes hidden by a heavy duty pair of safety goggles. Her hair was a short and messy mane of mousey brown hair littered with soot and slightly singed in quite a few places. Her clothes were nothing more than a smart yet casual shirt covered up by a thick leather apron, trousers and thick work boots, upon closer inspection however she was a lot more sloppily dressed than the other people Jet came across. The shirt she was just barely tucked in as though it was more of a gesture and her trousers legs had been rolled up slightly and stuffed with a variety of different wires and small tools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww geez my instructors gonna kill me\u201d The woman sighed, stretching her small frame up towards the high reaching ceilings. \u201cBetter air the room out quick\u201d With that she turned toward the smoky room and pulled an odd looking remote, nothing more than a simple black box with a big red button that seemed almost faded with use. With a simple click an automated voice boomed \u201cStand clear ventilation in progress!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment the woman clocked Jet\u2019s flattened face pleading her to free her from this predicament. \u201cOh shit, shit shit\u201d she muttered, slamming the remotes button. \u201cI knew I should have put a cancelation function on this machine\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman than ran over to the tiny window and stood on the tips of her toes to meet Jets eye line and with her most apologetic face said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm I know we just met and sorry you got crushed by my lab door but things are going to get worse from here. You see when the ventilation program starts the whole labs structure shifts and changes to help expel all trapped gasses and fumes in the room. Now unfortunately for you that includes the lab doors.\u201d At this point the woman began scratching the back of her head awkwardly as she saw Jets eye fill with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we tested this scenario before many times, it\u2019s just a shame the result was always such a messy one\u201d her eyes fell to the ground trying to avoid Jets gaze. \u201cThough if by some miracle you do somehow make it out of this alive then I swear on the name Trucy *Twitch* Copperstone that I will make it up to you somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Jets position began to shift, the once solid feeling wall swivelled on its axis taking Jet and the door with it. Jets body was then subjected to a series of different torments while inside the ever shifting room. The door peeled free from the wall taking Jet with it, she then peeled free as the door shifted higher letting her paper like body float into the waiting teeth of a series of gears. With each rotation Jet was crunched and chewed by these metal maws passed around from one another in a disorientating spin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she reached the smallest set whose tiny teeth spat her out in the way of a concrete slab that was slamming its way across the room to reach its designated position. Jet could even summon the strength to even protest as the heavy slab teetered over her like a stepping stone, her heavily dented form now smeared smooth from the heavy piece of masonry left her spread out like a sheet. It was then the floor opened up and the all familiar door returned alongside its partner. They seemed to be attached by some form of axel and was thrusted up into the smoke filled room above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was struggling for what little air she could get with her squashed lungs and the smoke was making it almost impossible to get any form of oxygen. It was then Jets world began to spin, the two metal doors began rotating at an alarming speed creating a fan that blew the smoke into another set of fans that lined the ceiling. She span and span her dizziness making her feel beyond nauseous as the room spun faster and faster. Minutes passed by and Jet was barely able to keep conscious, she struggled valiantly to hold onto her last thread of resolve but ultimately the strain on her body was too much for her and she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the hallways automated voice rung out \u201cVentillation successful, have a nice day\u201d and Trucy stepped through the doors of her lab, right into a thick and gooey substance that pooled in front of the entrance. Her work boot lifted from the puddle taking a large section of goop with it that strung out like chewed bubblegum from the treads of her boot. \u201cEeewww gross this is the worst one yet\u201d she gagged, quickly realising this was the remains of the unfortunate girl that got caught in the labs mechanisms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as she finished that her instructor walked into the room with a clip board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trucy you better have a machine to show me, I'm not going to accept it spontaneously exploding right before I got here again.\" The woman that walked in had lavender hair, and large assets, even with the loose cut of her robe her figure was clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ms. Amethyst, this time my machine is fully functioning and will not explode.\" She quickly bowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was regaining contentiousness even still trapped within the machine and in a liquid state she could see out through a small glass window meant for viewing in. She could hear Trucy talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've filled this tank with organic matter that I collected myself, and it will convert it into a set of clothes that can absorb damage and block poisons and magic by tricking them into thinking that your clothes are a person! With the concoctions that I've got on the device mixed with the materials it will seal the shape.\" Jet wished she could scream to them but she was still to beat up to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well Ms. Copperstone, I shall be the one to judge that, you can put my measurements in yes?\" The purple haired woman said. Trucy looked worried for a moment but hastily agreed, not wanting to try and tell her teacher that she might not have enough material to cover the older woman's prestigious curves and height. She would just have to make it a lot tighter than it would be on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just enter your measurements here and...\" The machine hummed to life, Jet could feel herself being sucked through a series of tubes with some sort of potions being sprayed on her. the end of the device was pulling and stretching, Jet felt it pull her into thin fibers and weave the fibers together. everything was weird now, if her body felt displaced before it was doubly so now as she was settling into the form of a tight body suit sized for the shrewd teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet couldn't tell until she was a finished project but she had been died dark purple, and every fiber of her being screamed from chemicals and abuse. The busty woman ran her hand over jet's new clothing like body enjoying the feeling of it on her hand, but for Jet her hand felt like an electric shock all over. Being picked up the woman who had gotten naked while Jet was being made, she lowered the unfortunate Thief to the floor and stepped into her in one swift motion she pulled the suit, which looked more like a one-piece swim suit, all the way onto herself. The feeling of electricity was felt through Jet's whole body, she wanted to scream but she was to malformed to do anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Amethyst however was in heaven, this was the most comfortable clothing she had ever had, regardless of what else about it she was considering a passing grade just for that. \"Well Trucy lets-\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet strolled down the nearest hallway, carefully reading the nameplates above every door. Eventually, a specific door with the nameplate of \u201cArtifact Room\u201d caught her attention. Feeling her thieving, adventurous spirit rising, Jet pushed open the wooden door and stepped inside. No sooner did she step inside then she loudly gasped and almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was large, and filled to the absolute brim with priceless artifacts and treasures from all across the world. Jet practically salivated as she stumbled numbly through the room, her money-hungry brain struggling to keep up with everything that she was seeing. It was a thief\u2019s paradise, and it took all of her self-control to not grab everything in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she spotted another door in the back of the room, with a different nameplate. This door read \u201cSacred Relics\u201d. A name like that screamed riches and fortune, so Jet snuck over to the door and tried to open it. It was locked, but that was no big deal for Jet and the small lockpicking set she carried with her at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jet, her greed and curiosity got the better of her, and her mind completely tuned out her surroundings. As she worked with the door, trying to unlock it, she didn\u2019t even hear two School of Alchemy guards stroll into the room. The guards spotted Jet in an instant, and began rushing over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! THIEF!!!\u201d The lead guard yelled, brandishing her sword. Jet whipped her head around and cried out in surprise, seeing the two-armed guards running towards her. She dropped her lockpicking set and hopped to her feet. Springing forward, she grabbed onto a tall cabinet and began pulling herself up onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Jet would\u2019ve had no trouble avoiding two simple guards. Jet was a nimble, acrobatic master thief after all. However, her horrible, cursed luck kicked in once again. The cabinet wobbled as Jet grabbed on, and her balance was thrown off. The cabinet toppled over, crashing loudly onto the floor. Jet fell forward in a painful landing, and thirty priceless artifacts shattered to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was quick to recover, but not quick enough. The lead guard slashed at her with her sword, moving the sharp metal weapon in a downward strike. Jet\u2019s horrible luck struck again, and the guard\u2019s sword attack sliced neatly through Jet\u2019s shirt, bra strap, pants, and panties. In a heartbeat, Jet\u2019s clothes fluttered to the ground, and she was left naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate wasn\u2019t done yet, as the guard tripped on a broken urn, and toppled forward into Jet. The guard was taller and a little heavier than Jet, and so the flustered thief girl was easily pressed under the guard. Upon hitting the floor, Jet was flattened instantly, her face roughly squished into the guard\u2019s rather huge breasts. The rest of her body squished to the guard\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard groaned and stood up, brushing herself off. Glancing around the room, she saw no sign of the destructive intruder, which made no sense to her. She had definitely tackled her to the floor. Or rather\u2026gracefully fell on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d The guard cried aloud. Her partner ran up to her, and immediately spotted Jet\u2019s naked, paper-thin form adhered to the front of the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ashra.\u201d The second guard pointed at Jet. \u201cThe thief is\u2026uh\u2026squashed against your boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshra looked down at her chest, and almost screamed upon seeing Jet stuck there. She quickly recovered though, peeling Jet free. No sooner was Jet free then Ashra crumpled her up into a tiny ball, clenching her tightly in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s take her to the containment room. Miranda will see to her there.\u201d Ashra explained to her partner, and her partner nodded. As the two guards left the ruined artifact room, Jet could only mentally groan at how quickly everything had gone downhill. And, how much of it was her own stupid fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, Jet was fully reformed, and sitting in an uncomfortable metal chair in a cramped containment room, deep within the confines of the School of Alchemy. She was bound tight, with no chance of breaking free. Worst of all, she was still naked, a fact that caused no little discomfort for her. Her cheeks were burning with embarrassment and shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshra was standing watch over her, not once taking her eyes of the vile intruder who had caused incalculable damage to the artifact room. Jet felt horrible about what she had done, but no matter how much she tried to plead, Ashra wouldn\u2019t listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the lone door to the containment room swung open, and a girl entered. She was wearing a tight, blue, unbuttoned blouse, and blue shorts. Her impressive rack was almost entirely visible due to her unbuttoned shirt, and barely contained inside of a constricting bra. Her long white hair was disheveled, and her eyes had a wild and childlike aura to them. Her younger but still developed body conveyed to Jet that she couldn\u2019t be any older than nineteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there you!\u201d The girl giggled, closing the door behind her. \u201cMy, aren\u2019t you a cute one! My name is Miranda, and I\u2019m the head alchemist here at the School of Alchemy.\u201d Jet\u2019s jaw dropped open. This clearly hyperactive child was the most important alchemist in the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I need to explain some\u2026\u201d Jet tried to speak, but Miranda held Jet\u2019s lips shut with two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush. You don\u2019t need to do any talking now. We\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk in the future. I mean, you\u2019re going to be trapped here for the rest of your life!\u201d Miranda giggled again, smiling innocently, and Jet\u2019s eyes widened in terror. \u201cYou can\u2019t just destroy centuries worth of treasures, artifacts, and history, and think you\u2019ll get away with it!\u201d Miranda rubbed Jet\u2019s head like she was a little girl being scolded by a loving parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d Ashra cleared her throat. \u201cThere\u2019s something you might find\u2026interesting\u2026about this criminal. Her entire body is squishy. Like rubber. She can be stretched and molded into different shapes, and will eventually reform to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!?!?\u201d Miranda exclaimed, holding her face like a surprised school girl. She spun around in a circle, and laughed. \u201cThis is so amazing! I\u2019ve never met someone like you!\u201d Miranda playfully pinched Jet\u2019s cheek, watching how easily Jet\u2019s face could be flattened and squashed. She let out a cute squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleashhhh\u2026\u201d Jet moaned, trying to speak despite half of her face being crushed. \u201c\u2026Let me shhhheee Holly\u2026and Dahlia!!!\u201d Miranda grabbed Jet\u2019s lips again, but this time pressed them together with much more force, until they flattened and stuck together. Jet was left unable to speak, and could only make muted screaming noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Thief, what did I say about talking? You\u2019re interrupting my train of thought.\u201d Miranda frowned for half a second, but her Cheshire grin returned in an instant. \u201cAnd\u2026oh\u2026do I have thoughts. Imagine what I could do with a squishy little criminal like you! ANYTHING THAT I WANT!!!\u201d Miranda declared loudly, and she and Ashra shared a good laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda continued. \u201cAs the head alchemist, I\u2019m given special permissions that others aren\u2019t. For example, I have full jurisdiction over all prisoners and criminals captured in the swamplands. We alchemists don\u2019t take kindly to those who would break the law. We especially reserve special hatred for those who tarnish our belongings and keepsakes. Under normal circumstances, you\u2019d be dead by now. Count yourself fortunate I\u2019ve taken such a\u2026special liking\u2026to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sat down on Jet\u2019s lap, squishing the unlucky thief\u2019s legs beneath her body. She leaned forward until her breasts were resting against Jet\u2019s, and her face was only an inch from Jet\u2019s. \u201cFrom now until the end of time, you are my personal little plaything. Consider this your punishment. I certainly won\u2019t be merciful!\u201d Miranda giggled and hopped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet quivered in fear. Had a momentary lapse in judgment really sentence her to a life of being tormented by the world\u2019s most talented, and most insane, alchemist? Jet pictured Holly and Dahlia, eating a delicious meal in the mess hall and laughing, having a great time. How horrible was the twisted, cursed luck!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda paced around the room for a few minutes, trying to decide what she wanted to do with Jet first. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

SAAAAANND!!\" Jet shouted at the sky, clearly agitated by the scorching heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls had been making a trek across the desert in search of Clara. They had received a reliable tip that after the ruins incident she made to head west, in order to find some great sage (and probably con them). Jet was stubborn and couldn't let Clara's betrayal go, she was willing to hunt her down as far as she traveled. That said, her patience has wearing thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hollyyyy\" she whined childishly, \"Can't you give me some more of your waterrrr?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Just because you drank all of yours a day early that doesn't mean I'm going to let you drink all of mine. You should have sipped a little at a time, like I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeaaaasse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The map says we should be close to the village soon. Just wait a few more hours and then I'll let you have a small drink of- wait. Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly pointed out something in the distance. Over the hills of sand lied a few tiny dots, marking where the mid-desert village of mages was. Jet squinted her eyes. The buildings wavered in the sizzling heat but unlike the mirages that plagued them earlier, these were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'RE SAVED!\" Jet cheered, dashing ahead and kicking sand into Holly's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jet! *cough* *cough* Slow down! I swear, where does that girl get her energy...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour later and they made it. Holly had caught up by going at her own pace, but Jet was barely able to stand. Her knees wobbled, and a faint dry voice escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water... please... water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the many huts, the streets were empty. Likely the villagers were staying indoors, to escape the sun's brutal glare. Mages were typically hermits and rarely got out, they would stay isolated all day working on their magic. The desert seemed like a perfect fit for them, as they only went outside when they absolutely needed to. Holly surveyed the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, maybe there's an inn or somewhere we can stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So thirsty...\" Jet complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw it. In a horseless cart were several glass jugs, each shimmering in the intense light. There were at least three dozens, beautifully clear and filled to the brim with water. Jet's strength returned and she pounced onto the cart. Holly tried to stop her but Jet busted the lid off the first jug of water and guzzled it down. It was delicious! She couldn't believe how refreshing the water was. Even in the desert sun somehow it was still cold! Tossing the empty jug away Jet opened the next. This was easily the best water she had ever had in her life! She lifted it above her head and let it pour all over herself, showering in the cool feeling of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hut beside the cart had its windows slam open. An old man was yelling at Jet. The shock was enough to make her stop, blinking at him. Next his door swung open hurling up a puff of sand. He came out storming, eyes fixed in a rage at Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how precious that water is?! You damn travelers are all the same! You just take what you like without thinking of anyone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm greatly sorry sir.\" Holly intervened \"We had just crossed the desert and she was really dehydrated-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only had a few jugs old man, what's the big deal? You still have a ton left, don't you think it's kind of selfish to hog it all yourself?\" Jet talked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You utter FOOL!\" howled the man, fuming with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral other mages came outside to see what the commotion was. They didn't get visitors in the desert too often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That water was Pure Water delivered from the southern alchemists\" a kindly mage explained. He was thin and wore robes, but was polite enough to take off his hood to address the girls. \"Since water is so hard to come by here we have it imported. This Pure Water looks normal, but I assure you it is no ordinary drink. We process it with our magic, and can greatly expand it's quantities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" yelled the angry old man. \"One drop of Pure Water can be turned into gallons of water! What you just drank was enough to last a family for weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet shuddered. She had clearly messed up, big time. Holly came to her defense again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- We- We're so sorry! She had no idea what she was doing! Please can you forgive her, she meant no ill will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's unfortunate but I believe your friend has to be punished.\" The tall mage said. \"Stealing water is a great crime in our village and we'll have to go through the usual proceedings. You of course will be free to do as you please since you didn't drink any of the Pure Water. Miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Holly.\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ethos.\" he reached out and shook her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly blushed red. Ethos had a really handsome face, and was being kind to her. She wasn't used to guys touching her, even on the hand. Was this infatuation she was feeling? She looked back at Jet, soaking wet, and surrounded by angry villagers. Jet's eyes silently screamed for her to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Jet? Ethos is going to show me to the inn.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet cautiously opened the door, and was startled a bit when the hanging bell rang. Nothing inside the sorceress' hut seemed outright dangerous but she didn't want to let her guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the one they said was coming right? Forced labor for drinking our Pure Water the second you entered the town? Anyway, welcome to my shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was greeted by a woman. She looked mature, with long purple hair and a beautiful face. Her body was fully developed too, she had large breasts sticking out in the front, ones much bigger than Jet's. Her long green dress hugged the curves of her body, down her waist all the way around her big wide hips. Jet secretly hoped she could look that sexy when she grew older. This woman was a bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Beatrice.\" she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jet.\" Jet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They told me you'd be coming. Let me give you a run down. This is an item store, used by both travelers passing through and mages in town. We sell all sorts of magic books, spell scrolls, magical knick-knacks, and random things. You'll be assisting me for the next few days until your punishment is over. Honestly, I think they're letting you off easy, but maybe they were able to crack a deal with the alchemists for more Pure Water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet looked around the room. The mage's brick house was already small and cramped, but inside it was cluttered still with various items. Shelves lined the walls stocked with tomes, wooden carvings, and metal trinkets. Orbs swirled with illuminating gas next to bottles of multi-coloured powder. There was even a small collection of animal parts, no doubt used to concoct some magic brews. Everything had been sorted nicely but the sheer surplus of objects made the store have a disorganized appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" Jet spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly should I do when a customer shows up? I've never worked in a store before, I've only taken odd quests for cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you don't need to worry about that.\" Beatrice laughed. \"We barely get customers as it is. Maybe two or three a day if we're lucky. There's some sort of rumor going around that I'm a heartless old witch, but as you can see I'm nice when you get to know me. Either way the pay is good so running this store makes for comfy livin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was going to ask more about Beatrice's ...unique reputation but was stopped by a loud noise. It came from the back room, a huge crash followed by the sound of several objects dropping on the wooden floor. Someone emerged from the back room shortly after, clearly flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I was trying to carry too much at once and- Oh! Are you the new girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to Jet, curious to see a foreign traveler. This girl was young, and had bright green hair that was cut short. That wasn't the only thing short about her, she was only tall enough that her head went up to Jet's shoulders. Her body was the complete opposite of Beatrice's, small and still developing. Compared to the older woman's lax attitude, this tiny girl was almost bursting with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Nino! Nice to meet you!\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jet.\" she looked over the Beatrice \"Is this your daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WHAAA?!\" she yelled in surprise \"Do I look that old to you?! I've still got my youthfulness, right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino ignored her ramblings \"I'm Master's apprentice! She's been teaching me magic while I help her with the store!\" she explained to Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, now you go clean up your mess before you forget about it again.\" Beatrice ordered, sending Nino back from where she came. \"Who knows what kind of trouble could get stirred up if you broke the wrong kind of item...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething dawned on Jet. \"Wait a minute, if you already have an apprentice working here, then why do you need me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer answer came in another loud crash from the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-waah!! Sorry!\" Nino cried. Beatrice sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? That one causes as much trouble as she's worth. She's notoriously clumsy. I've tried all my spells and rituals to get rid of any 'bad luck' curses she might have caught somewhere, but there aren't any. She's just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet looked away guilty, knowing her bad luck was going to be just as big of a handful. Her curse was real, but she knew it couldn't be removed so easily until she found Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, now that you've met the two of us it's time to start working. First thing I want you to do is...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...take inventory with me!\" Beatrice finished her sentence, pulling out a clipboard. \"This isn't normally how we do things, but I'm going to have you go through each of our shelves and tell me how many of each item we have. Then I'll mark down that number and can also fill you in on what each one is. By the end of it you'll know exactly what products to sell and we'll have inventory managed. Two birds, one stone right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet looked at the daunting shelves, packed with various magical trinkets. This was going to take hours, at least one for each self. She only had herself to blame, her mistake got her in this mess to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right.\" she said back to Beatrice, with a total lack of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first item she picked up was on the top shelf. It was a long vial, almost like a test tube shape, filled with blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... one blue vial?\" she counted to Beatrice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ticked a single line on her clipboard. \"That's vulnerability juice, a sort of potion we sell to hunters. It makes an animal's senses go into overdrive. They get so confused that catching them is easy, and it makes their meat extra delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. One, uh... sparking necklace?\" Jet said, holding up a pink jeweled necklace. It looked like it cost a lot of money so she was gentle with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That one's really popular with couples. It's a necklace of paralysis, when you wear it your body is rendered almost entirely immobile. It's really exciting, especially in the bedroom.\" she whispered that last part with a smirk. Jet blushed bright pink, having been inexperienced with that sort of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee hee, no need to get all embarrassed!\" Beatrice laughed, sounding more like an old witch when she cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet frowned and went to the next item, there were several small glass flasks filled with sparking orange glitter. She picked one up, surprised to find a label on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Farting Powder?\" she read out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice's ears perked up. She turned to Jet who was already opening the flask, curious to see what it did. Beatrice ran to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JET DON'T!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Jet said confused, removing the lid off the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun around too fast and her foot slipped on a piece of paper. Her balance lost, she fell down, accidentally letting go of the glass of farting powder mid-air. Beatrice dove to catch it before its contents spilled everywhere, and crashed right into Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great weight was pressing on top of Jet's head. Her nose felt like it was being crushed by something big and warm. Confused and out of sorts, she opened her eyes, but could only see shadows and the faint colour green. If she looked up as much as possible, in the far edge of her vision, she could see more green. It was Beatrice's back, clothed in her tight green dress that stretched from her top... all the way down to her plump bottom. She had collided with Jet hard, and from total bad luck, ended up sitting right on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm? Mmmmnn! MMMHMMN!!\" Jet tried to yell at her to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer big butt was ridiculously heavy and all its weight was focused entirely on Jet's head. Not only that but Jet managed to somehow land in a way that wedged her nose and mouth right between Beatrice's round cheeks. She wriggled on the floor to get free, but only ended up sinking her face deeper into the woman's crack. There was a dampness on her skin, through the cloth of Beatrice's dress seeped some of her wet ass sweat. It was to be expected, they were in the desert after all, and in the blaring heat her butt had worked up quite a sweat. Salty droplets passed through the fabric and ran down Jet's face. Meaty cheeks surrounded her on either side, coated in the wet smelly moisture. Deep within Beatrice's ass was a body heated furnace, with little beads of sweat collecting at the bottom of her crack. This woman was incredibly sweaty, Jet thought, and yet somehow she hid very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet could hardly breathe under Beatrice's booty, the juicy butt cheeks were flattening her nose and covering her mouth. Nevertheless, her lungs craved fresh air, and if she didn't have some soon she'd pass out. Sharply, she inhaled, drawing in what little humid air her nose could find inside Beatrice's stuffy crevice. It was rank, the wet foul odor smelled exactly how one would expect: like sweaty ass. Due to the lack of water in the desert the grown woman often had to skip showers, and sadly today was one of those days. Droplets of sweat slid down her sexy back, naturally dripping between her glutes. Her runny ass crack steam-cooked Jet's face, and forced her to smell the tangy scent of her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-The powder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Beatrice returned to her senses, shouting her last thoughts out loud. She jerked her body a little as she came out of shock, rubbing her fat ass on top of Jet. The poor girl sank deeper between her buttcheeks, her face was pushing Beatrice's dress all the way up her sweaty crack now. Jet whined in dismay, she could feel the wet outline of the woman's butthole pressing against her nose. It twitched in response from her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~! Jet! Where are you- Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to sit on your face, it was an accident! But at least I managed to catch the farting powder, see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, even through diving in mid-air and being stunned for a whole minute Beatrice's hands managed to hold on to the flask of orange powder. When she came back to her senses, sitting on Jet's head, the tiny glass was still being clutched in her grip, with the top opened up. Miraculously, not a single fleck of powder had been spilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, thank goodness I managed to catch it in time. You do not want to know what happens when you inhale this stuff. Anyway now I just need to put the cap back on and... ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Ah...! AHH...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmfh mrmng?!\" panicked Jet, trying to ask 'what's wrong' while muffled under her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH...! AAHHH...!! AHHCHOOOOOOoo!!\" Beatrice howled, sneezing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer big sneeze blew into the powder, poofing it into a cloud of mist. The orange glittery flakes went everywhere, dancing around Beatrice's head. Recovering from her sneeze she took a deep breath, and inhaled all the airborne powder in a single go. It had an immediate effect on her body, her insides started to churn and growl. She held her hands over her mouth, realizing what she had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to get off of Jet's head, it was already too late. The young thief heard Beatrice's big ass grumble, organic belching noises traveled through her intestines. Her asshole puckered on top of Jet's nose, trying to hold back what was coming, but it was impossible. Beatrice moaned and let out a huge rumbling fart, vibrating her sweaty ass cheeks on top of Jet's head. Her anus opened wide blasting a hot stream of anal steam directly up the girl's nose. The fart smelled vile, the tangy wet scent of ass sweat mixed together with the rancid hot smell of poop, forming a cacophony of stink. Jet choked and coughed, forced to smell the horrid stench as the older woman's dress-clad ass cheeks rumbled around her head. Her whole booty shook uncontrollably, unable to stop the effects of the farting powder from making her release her loud flatus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the amount of powder she inhaled accounted for a few more farts than just the one. Her anus flexed for a moment, halting the explosion of gas before opening once again. Slowly the asshole exhaled her farts, accosting Jet's nostrils with silent potent gas. Jets eyes watered, her tears fell down her small cheeks and mixed with the sweat of Beatrice's much bigger cheeks. The silent farts were insanely stifling and smelled much stronger than the blowing winds before. It's like Beatrice's farts were the desert itself, viscous and searing with the smell of death. Jet's hands smacked Beatrice's flabby butt, begging the girl to get off of her. Beatrice could only groan and take short breaths, the magic of the farting powder concentrated her entire body on the one task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweaty anus puffed out more farts, sultry heated breaths of gas passed through the green dress and clung to the butt sweat on Jet's face. She could feel the asshole's hot rim on her nose and knew that Beatrice didn't wear any panties. In the western heat she couldn't blame her for trying to stay cool, but from the damp swamp of sweat found in her ass it clearly wasn't working. Regaining some motor control Beatrice fell forward, lifting her butt off Jet's head and crashing her own face down on the floor. Her plump posterior was pointed upwards and released a final smelly ham blast, blowing a stack of spell papers off a nearby shelf. The two girls took a few minutes to recover on the floor, both in bewilderment from the strange and unlucky accident that had befallen them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I'm really sorry about farting on your face like that. I couldn't get off after the powder had taken effect, I swear!\" Beatrice apologized. \"Either way, that's why you don't go opening random bottles in the shop, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... sorry I opened it without thinking.\"Jet nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aftermath of Beatrice's windy butt blasts still hung in the air of the shop. Jet felt like she needed a nice bath after what happened, but knew she wasn't going to be able to have one anytime soon. Sighing, she returned to taking inventory with Beatrice, and secretly hoped her bad luck didn't result in anything else terrible.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet really wanted to open a window. After Beatrice's gas attack the two of them were stuck working in an item shop that now smelled like farts. The older woman forbid her from cracking the window, even a slight amount. The desert air was really hot, and if the windows were opened her cooling crystals would melt. Beatrice had several of them set up in the shop to maintain a cool temperature, they glowed blue on the ceiling. Replacing them was a pain, so for now no fresh air. Instead Jet's current job was to collect all the papers that fell and scattered during the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Those are papers with single use spells. Don't read them!</i>\" Beatrice's words echoed in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started piling the papers in a stack, not even bothering to flip them or turn them right side up. As long as the page on top looked nice the rest should be okay. Most of the spells were in languages she couldn't understand but had weird drawings. Jet noticed that one drawing was of a curvaceous, full figured woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Could this be the secret to Beatrice's voluptuous body? Maybe she looks beautiful on normal days but when she goes home she looks like a old withering witch.</i>\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet looked down at her own chest in dismay. She secretly wished that she was that hot. The paper spell was in the common language, she could read it out loud and cast the spell on herself... but then Beatrice would notice right away and get pissed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hmmm...</i>\" Jet thought \"<i>Maybe I can memorize the spell and then speak it later. Would that work? Let's see... Aoubar leiftos charten haimos, expo yakflo marken daymos.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words rhymed in her head, she repeated them several times until she thought she had them down. Then Beatrice came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you done with those papers yet? Make sure to turn them to the right side, or else y-GHK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinched as soon as she made eye contact with Jet. Magic sparks zipped from Jet's eyes to hers shooting the spell into her mind. She stumbled, dropping to one knee on the floor. Her eyes glowed purple as the spell took effect. Jet jumped up in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jet...?\" Beatrice said in ragged angry breaths. \"Did you happen to <i>read</i> any of those spells when I explicitly told you not to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No?\" Jet said, intimidated. \"I've been in the room with you this whole time, you would have, uh, heard me if I read a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I'm sure you're aware that spells can activate even in someone doesn't read them out loud? <i>Like if they read them in their own head?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!\" Jet apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just- Just tell me what paper it was. If we're quick maybe we can stop it-OOHAH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice's body convulsed, she fell forward on her hands and knees. After a few seconds her clothes began to tighten. The skinny arms of her green dress started to stretch around her biceps, and the seams both ripped along the sides of her hips. It looked as though her clothes were shrinking but really Beatrice was the one who was growing! Already she had grown several feet, groaning as her body burst from its clothes. Jet stepped backwards in horror as she watched, knowing yet again this was her fault. The spell didn't make one sexier as she thought, the horny old wizard that drew that diagram just loved busty women. Really it was a growth spell, one that expands whoever the caster first makes eye contact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's breasts were the first thing to break free from her dress, her top burst apart flopping her oversized tits onto the wooden floor. Beatrice was in a hunched over position to try to conserve space but still her legs knocked over a table as they grew. Jet was behind her bent over body, right in front of her huge bloating ass. She got to watch the moment it happened: the tight green fabric was pulled to its absolute limit by Beatrice's glutes until it snapped, freeing her jiggly cheeks. The fat bubble butt was big enough when it was sitting on Jet's head but now it was as tall as her whole body! It was then that Nino appeared from the back storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, what's all the noise? Are you-WAAAHH~!!\" she screamed, face to face with her big naked boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice panted and heaved, her enormous breasts swaying in front of Nino. She groaned with a large voice, struggling to get out a few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOTH OF YOU... GET OUT. RUN. NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino dashed by Beatrice's huge head to the front door, making it outside safely. Jet however was blocked off. She made a start until Beatrice's foot expanded again, slamming itself in front of her path. It crushed the wooden shelf into the stone wall, destroying it in an instant. If Jet had been a second faster, that could have been her that was crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new problem immediately presented itself, Jet was trapped between her legs. With the left and right sides blocked off and a solid stone wall to her back, she was stuck facing Beatrice's humongous growing ass. The marble white cheeks wobbled as they grew, flipping tables aside and skidding across the floor. Jet backed up as far as she could until she hit the wall, and held herself flat to it. She had hoped to hold out there until the growing stopped but she had no such luck. Beatrice grew large enough to hit the ceiling with her back so she crouched down lower, trying to keep her building from being destroyed. Her ass jutted towards Jet, pressing the huge meaty cheeks against the wall with her. The girl shrieked in horror as her body was absorbed directly into Beatrice's giant smelly butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JET... I TOLD YOU. TO RUN.\" Beatrice's voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl could only let out muffled whimpers as she sank into her boss' dank crevice. The ass cheeks covered her from head to toe, tainting her with the same stench her face was washed with earlier. Beatrice's ass sweat was just as big as she was, and droplets the size of Jet's head splashed against her skin. She coughed, getting the taste in her mouth by accident. Beatrice's ass was cramped and warm, it gave Jet a steamy wet hug on all sides. She was absolutely buried in butt flesh, and had to push apart the layers of fat just to be able to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's absurd growth was starting to slow down, but not at the pace Jet needed it to. More her bubble butt swelled, spreading against the stone wall and swallowing Jet deeper inside her hot crack. The flesh opened up like an oven in front of her, dousing her with humid hot air and hidden beads of girl sweat. She could taste Beatrice's ass all over herself, felt it push against her body as it brought her to its center. The giant butt slammed into the wall again, its rippling layers of fat thrust Jet inside. Slowly the hot flesh creeped past her as it grew, bringing her to the crack's very bottom. A disgusting layer of grime coated the woman's seam, sticky with residue from the countless drops of sweat. The smell of ass was at its strongest, sharply stabbing at Jet's nostrils. Through the small amount of light she could see a distinct shape in front of her face, the round puffy lips of Beatrice's asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no no no no no no...\" she cried in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anus flexed, as if it could sense Jet's presence. She wanted to back away but behind her was impassible layers of sweaty ass fat and solid stone. She watched in horror as the anus grew with its owner, pulsating as it did so. Its numerous wrinkles contracted and engorged, each one like a juicy wet sausage. The anal circumference grew wider, spreading around Jet's head like a huge net. The opening, where all the lumps of skin would meet became bigger and more cavernous, as if it was drawing her inside. It was inches away from her face, she could feel the heat emanating onto her brow. It winked, oozing a wet gob of slime down to her feet like it was drooling with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet shuddered as the rank asshole slid over her head. It didn't come crushing down on her, rather it slowly creeped around her face and ears. Darkness engulfed her vision as she sank into the stuffy pink pit. Then huge anal maw began to clench, squeezing firm around Jet's head like the foreign object she was. She could feel the bands of flesh grope her cheeks, sticky gross anal wrinkles of a much older woman were massaging her skull. Beatrice's asshole was getting a taste of Jet, slathering threads of sweat and mucus on her in the process. The great pucker shuddered, sending chills of excitement up above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JET PLEASE. MY ANUS... IS SENSITIVE...\" Beatrice warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Jet was doing this on purpose! She wanted nothing more to get out of here! The rank backdoor clenched down on her again, pressing its lips into hers. She couldn't breathe, the asshole was lovingly suffocating her. Her nose was pinched by the tight wrinkles of Beatrice's inner anus and her mouth was being sealed shut. Jet thrashed in desperation, opening her jaw and gasping for air. Only small puffs were able to make it through, slipping past the small cracks of the giantess's outer rim. Her intake of air only served to tickle the woman's hole, further setting off her arousal. Beatrice tried to contain herself, but her lower body craved the attention and continued to convulse itself around Jet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The older woman panted, not knowing what to do. The magic had rendered her immobilized, forced to endure as her huge ass had its way with her subordinate. It had been too long since she touched herself down there, and ages since her little butthole was given attention. She hated to think of it, but Jet's tiny struggles felt amazing. The way she was nestled inside her ass, rubbing and teasing her most sensitive spot... it was driving Beatrice wild! She bit her lip, trying to focus on something else, anything but the delicious pleasure coming from her ass. Her toes curled, scraping the walls as her voracious ass made a meal out of Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHers was a hungry butt, eager to munch its hole around the tiny girl's skull. The anus was ravaging her, recklessly suckling its hot lips around her entire head. Jets hands came up to pry the asshole away, peel herself free of its gorging grip, but its strength was too much for her to fight. The hungry turd-cutter suckled even harder, pumping in and out as if to feed Jet to its master. Beatrice was moaning, her ambivalence was allowing her giant ass to reign free in violating Jet. Her mighty hips shook, her volatile asshole contracted, and a puddle of pussy juices spread along the floor. Jet felt the warm honey get between her toes and knew it wasn't sweat anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck... she's getting off... She's getting off to her asshole eating my head! Please Beatrice! Stop yourself! Hold back before it's too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice's tongue shot out as she panted. She was so horny right now. Maybe the spell effected her sensitivity? Really though a vial broke midway through her growth, the vulnerability juice, which splashed into her naked body. It was absorbed into her hips which made her loins become extra sensitive. It was too late now. She was past the point of calming down. Instead her body grew even larger, and she felt Jet slip further into her slutty butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet's head felt like it was going to collapse under the grip of the lusty anus. It contracted as it grew, thrusting her face into the supple, inner pink sphincter. Jet needed to breathe but she really didn't want to when she was this deep within Beatrice's shithole. How would it smell inside? The horrendous world of a giant woman's bowels... it felt like it was closely becoming a reality. Was she going to go all the way inside her ass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above her captor twitched, fighting the urge to grind Jet inside. Her giant head bucked, smashing a nearby shelf. Several items went flying, including a group of shimmering orange flasks. The shattered on the floor, releasing a big cloud of farting powder. Accidentally Beatrice inhaled, sucking up several bottles worth of magic farting powder at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO. JET. SORRYYY...\" her huge voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet perked up to what she said, wondering what exactly it meant. Her answer came in loud gurgling sound coming from the beastly ass. She could hear the onslaught of farts coming, the organic sounds of air spreading apart the woman's bowel walls as it traveled toward her location. Her first reaction was to get the fuck out of there but Beatrice's enormous anus clenched on reflex, pulling her head inwards. It trembled as the noxious gas made its way down, locking Jet into its warmth. The girl was screaming, held inside as the anal bands squeezed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMMPHH!! MMMHH MMMMMPHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot load of gas arrived, causing the anus to balloon outwards. Jet was crushed under the pressure for a second before she was blasted with release of Beatrice's fart. Her flatulence was tremendous, coming out in a gigantic rumbling explosion from between her butt cheeks. The sputtering anus flowered open on Jet's cheeks, erupting high-pressured gas up her nose. The anal winds were so strong it forced her jaw open and shot the air into her lungs. Jet's orifices were filled with the blazing hot farts, burning her insides as the rank butthole trembled around her face. The sticky wrinkles slapped around her skull in a circle, producing a wet flapping noise as the extra gas blasted through the cracks. Jet could smell the woman's bowels opening up, expanding her anal walls the let out more thick muggy farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer moisture from the hot gases collected on her face. The anus grew wider and wider as the waves of air rang out, loosening it's grip on Jet's head. Even bigger ones were coming now. Equal in girth to Beatrice's humongous body the fart blew open a hole in the back wall and fired out the other side. Her thundering ass continued to shake as her gas shot out, hammering into the side of the building until the rest of the wall collapsed around it. Sand kicked up everywhere, creating a huge dust cloud of potent smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was sent flying, knocked backwards with the rest of the rubble. She saw Beatrice's monster booty tear through the side of the house as it farted uncontrollably. The giantess groaned louder and louder, each fart made her cries more intense, until she rose up through the roof! Debris and wood fell everywhere as she ascended, finally free of the cramped house. The villagers came outside to watch the commotion, gasping in shock. They witnessed it, a giant woman standing on her knees in the desert sun, dripping with sweat and moaning erotically as she farted. The volume of gas spread into the sky, saving the people from its potent stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet started in awe at her boss, with a front row seat to her massive butt. The blubbery walls of meat rippled overhead, releasing fart after warbling fart. Her pussy was wet, dripping juices onto the sand below and turning it into thick mud. Beatrice panted and moaned with pleasure at each gaseous explosion, this went on for several minutes until she was done. Exhausted from her sexual outburst, she hunched forward again, presenting her smoking behind right above Jet. It was almost scary the way it hung overhead, her giant cheeks were spread apart exposing her gaping anus. Jet went to move out of the way, but noticed she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body wouldn't do what she told it to. She could barely move a muscle. Her eyes darted around, panicked, until she saw a sparkling glare. The necklace of paralysis, the thing that when worn renders one's body immobile, was wrapped around her arm. It must have attached to her during the huge explosion when she went flying out the wall. Desperately she tried to shake it off, but the pitiful movements she could muster weren't enough to make it budge. She wanted to yell for help but couldn't, and no one was brave enough to come to the smelly disaster zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something dripped on her face. Her eyes moved up to see Beatrice's asshole was even closer now, drooling hot mucus. It was gaping wide, relaxed from the many farts it had just released. The huge woman was wobbling and tired from what had just happened, the growth spell was taking a toll on her body. She needed to sit. Her titanic round booty stuck out as she bent over, slowly leaning her massive body backwards over Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe absolutely huge ass eclipsed out the sun, casting the tiny girl in shadow. She was trapped on the sand, her body locked into an upright sitting position as the giant ass lowered from above. Lined up directly with the anus, Jet was forced to watch its gaping mouth pucker and flex as it drew closer. It was going to eat her alive and there was nothing she could do to stop it. She wanted to scream, begging Beatrice in her mind not to send her up her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please! Don't sit on me! You asshole is going to suck me up! Aaah!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy slam Beatrice's ass impacted with the ground. It swallowed Jet's body whole, sending her inside the woman with ease. The necklace unraveled from her arm, allowing her to squirm and thrash as the bowel walls closed in on her. Beatrice was tuckered out and couldn't even feel Jet's fists pounding her from inside. Instead her eyes closed and she fell into a deep sleep. Many hours would pass until she would reawake, back to her normal size.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jet ended up stocking the back room with Nino. They worked together for several hours, moving boxes and crates into organized stacks to be opened later. Depending on the size and weight of the items the girls would sometimes need to work together in lifting. Nino was a short thing, with barely any muscle mass, so it was often she needed Jet's adventurer body to help her with the heavy stuff. To make it even harder, the back room was less cooled than the store's main room and the girls began to sweat in the stuffy heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino was busy with her back turned trying to pick up an especially big crate. Jet meanwhile happened to find something. She grabbed a small wooden box from on top of a chair and was about to place it on the side shelf when she noticed it. Underneath the box, laid out on the chair's cushioned seat was a piece of paper. It was engraved with a magic circle and strange writing, that which was glowing bright green. Unable to resist, Jet reached out her hand and touched the circle, curious to see what it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoof! In a puff of smoke Jet had vanished, the box she was carrying fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where am I?\" she said to herself, only no words came out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer view had shifted, from where she was standing to a spot much lower in the room. She was looking straight up at the ceiling, and the backboard of the chair was pointing up with her. It looked like she was on top of the chair now. She tried to move but then realized her body wasn't responding. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jet, you okay?\" Nino's voice asked, hearing the box fall on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nino, I can't move! Go get Beatrice!\" Jet shouted, but again, no words were said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where did you go?\" Nino asked, not seeing her new friend anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her the room looked completely empty, as if Jet had left. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if she's going to take a break, I might as well too.\" she said to herself, walking over to the chair for a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Nino entered Jet's vision. The frozen girl could see her from below, getting a view of her panties from under her skirt. They were white, nearly matching the young girl's creamy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nino?! I can see your panties! Wait, why can't you hear me?!\" Jet yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to move again but only heard the sound of paper crinkling. Then it dawned on her. When she had touched the magic circle on that paper, she had become the paper itself! She was stuck lying on the chair, looking up at Nino's underwear, trying to shout with a voice that didn't exist. Unfortunately the chair just happened to be the one Nino was keen on sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Nino! Don't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl turned around, displaying the back end of her panties to Jet. From this angle she could see the girl's butt in full, bending over, as it slowly went to sit on her. It looked big, but of course now everything from her point of view looked big. The soft cloth ceiling extended over Jets horizon, moments away from smothering her. It impacted the chair with a small squeak and in another puff of smoke the magic paper activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WAH!\" Nino yelped, jumping up from the chair. \"What was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small eruption of smoke dissipated. Nino could have sworn she saw a flash of light too, but when she turned to look at the chair there was nothing. She inspected it closer, running her hands along the wood, touching the cushioned seat. It seemed completely ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I could have sworn I saw something. Maybe the universe is telling me to get back to work...\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching her head the girl walked back to moving boxes. But what of Jet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was dazed for a few seconds but then her mind jolted awake. Her body no longer felt like paper, but now something else. She was spread outwards, and a soft warmness was blanketed under her body. A number of different aromas could be smelt, and for reasons outside her control, also tasted. Oddly enough all she could see was a soft peach colour in every direction, almost like skin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... Oh shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was Nino's panties! When the girl's underwear touched the magic paper containing Jet, it transformed her into panties! Now she was clinging to Nino's body, as the unaware girl walked around. Jet didn't notice it before but Nino had quite a round little booty hidden under her skirt. It was plump to the touch and had a tiny bit of jiggle to it when she walked. Being her panties, Jet could also feel her vagina at the same time. It was small and pretty, clearly unused, and with only a little bit of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt weird, but becoming a living piece of underwear meant Jet could see and feel everything at once. She could smell the front of Nino's crotch with its tender aroma while also tasting the back of her jiggly cheeks. All of her senses were active at all times, and in every place. It wasn't too bad either, of all the butts to be stuck to as a pair of panties, she was glad it happened to be this young girl. Maybe her luck wasn't so bad today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Who was she kidding?! She was trapped to someone's ass without them even knowing it! Her mouth couldn't makes words to get the girl's attention and she had no way of moving around. She could be stuck as a pair of panties her whole life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jet despaired Nino moved around. Her huge butt cheeks swayed from side to side, pulling Jet's body one way and then the other. The round globes of flesh tugged at her material, making her stretch to match her springy skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Oof! Her ass pulls me as she walks.\" Jet said, unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino's legs would swish across her crotch, pressing Jet directly against her pussy with every step. She could feel the puffy mound snug against her, it was almost hot with the warmth of her body. It was like her face was being rubbed by the pussy, up and down. At the same time Jet was getting a faceful of ass. Nino's enormous butt cheeks were jiggling all over her, grinding together happily as she walked. Jet couldn't do anything as she was rubbed directly into her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the girl stopped walking, but only to bend over and pick up a box off the floor. It was dense with magic stones and she had to bend her knees to lift it. At the same time, her big butt cheeks spread apart, and the Jet panties were wedged partway up her ass crack. Essentially Jet's face was shoved up in there, absorbing the salty sweat that was inside. Nino had been working up quite a sweat as she stocked the back room, and the amount of juicy droplets hiding inside her butt were there to prove it. The ass sweat splashed into Jet, being absorbed by her fabric. To her though, she could taste all of it, as if she had just run her tongue in a line up Nino's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww groooss! Tastes like ass!\" Jet complained to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sight was still working too. Even in the darkness under Nino's skirt somehow she could see, still clear as day. As the girl bent over Jet was unwillingly driven up her ass. She could just catch a glimpse of her anus, hiding between her juicy cheeks. It was small and tight, with a bright pink colouration. As innocent as it looked Jet still hoped she didn't have to touch it. Nino's sweat already reeked with the taste of ass, she didn't want to know what her butthole tasted like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the girl stood up, her two fleshy globes pressing into Jet on either side. As Nino's panties Jet could feel herself wrapped around the outside of the girl's buns but also squeezed inside them at the same time. She was damp with dripping sweat, scrunched up and stuck between Nino's meaty cheeks. The girl's giant hand came back to pick her wedgie, pinching Jet's cloth body in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Jet yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Nino, tracing her fingers along the damp spot on her underwear. \"Ewww I'm all sweaty down there, probably because it's so dang hot in this room. Better try to wipe it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet didn't have time to think about what she meant. Nino's fingers came back in full force, plunging her deep between the moist butt cheeks. The innocent girl was trying to clean the sweat off her behind by using her panties (Jet) to absorb the moisture. There was way more sweat left hiding between her cheeks than Jet thought, Nino was sure to explore every dirty crevice. Hidden droplets of perspiration seeped into Jet's body like a sponge, filling her with the smell of a young stinky girl. All she could smell, all she could taste, was wet teenage ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green-haired girl used her underwear like a towel, and finished it off by running her fingers along the seam of her ass crack. Jet screamed as she was crammed into it, yelling for mercy. Her voice wouldn't come out at all, instead she was forced to lick Nino's butthole directly. It clenched as if greeting her, and a hot tasty gob of sweat was squeezed out its wrinkly folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that should do it!\" Nino said, feeling refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked her panties out of her ass again, letting the soiled damp fabric hang around to dry. Jet was stuck to her sticky ass, waiting for this hellish day to end. She prayed for someone to notice that she had been transformed into this oblivious girls panties, before something even worse happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nino continued to work by her lonesome, organizing boxes in the back room of the shop. She wondered where her friend Jet had gone off to, but at this point it had been so long that she probably skipped town and wasn't coming back. What Nino didn't know was that Jet was closer than she thought, transformed into the very panties she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, why haven't you noticed me yet!\" Jet complained, her own voice still unable to be heard out loud. \"You'd think she'd be more worried about me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small girl had a cute round butt, one that filled out her panties nicely. Jet's fabric body clung snugly to her soft cheeks. She wasn't gripping on tightly, but close enough that she was touching the indent of her ass at all times. As Nino moved around stacking boxes her globes of flesh would pull at Jet, stretching her to fit whatever position was needed. With all this movement Nino's insides started to churn a little, and a soft gurgling sound came from her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGluuglugulgull..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Jet said, hearing the strange noise from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to get louder as the minutes went by. Eventually it sounded like it right next to her, but the foolish girl had no idea what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino's butt, like all girls, needed to fart. She sensed the bubble of gas at her backdoor, and looked around to make sure Beatrice wasn't in earshot. Seeing that the coast was clear she relaxed and let the fart come out naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPfffft!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fart was short and bubbly, just like her. It fluttered out her butt cheeks cutely, and was over as soon as it began. Nino went back to work like nothing happened, unaware of the hell she just unleashed on Jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet felt the burst of air impact her cloth body. Some of it passed through the weaves of fabric, but the majority of smell was kept inside. The hot aroma of gas spread, creating a warm spot at the bottom of Nino's butt. Jet's fabric absorbed the stink, weaving it into her very core. She had no control over her senses as a pair of panties, she could constantly taste and smell everything around her. That meant when Nino farted Jet was forced to eat it raw, like she was standing behind her with her mouth wide open. It felt like the entirety of the panties had become her taste buds, constantly licking the gruesome gas wafting around Nino's butt. Every gap in her fabric was a nostril, forced to smell whatever came by. The girls fart tasted disgusting, like hot eggy shit, and it wasn't dissipating that quickly either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was what it meant to be Nino's panties, Jet wanted out now more than ever. She wasn't cut out for this kind of torment, being a personal sweat licker and fart sniffer. This young apprentice mage was cute on the outside, but under her skirt was a reeking hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nino! Please hear my words! I'm trapped as your panties! Save me! Ugh, fuck your fart smells so awful... Please you gotta hear me!\" Jet yelled and yelled but her words were silent to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response she got was a distant gurgling. GlgugIugg...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck! No! Nino don't fart again please!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gurgling grew louder and more boisterous. Organic bubbling sounds echoed from deep inside Nino, signaling the churning of her intestines. The gross cacophony of noise became louder and less distant, slowly closing in on Jet. Nino's body felt like it was rumbling, a huge storm was approaching, closer and closer until!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Silence. Jet waited several seconds in terror. Nino had gone still. She braced herself for a massive explosion of farts but nothing happened. The little apprentice went back to work like usual, leaving Jet relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... I guess her stomach was just acting up. Maybe she was hungry.\" Jet smiled, if she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. An intense wave of heat enveloped Jet, accompanied by the most horrific stench she had ever smelled. It was ungodly, a blazing inferno of concentrated shit fumes spreading inside her body. Nino's petite butt had unleashed a massive silent fart, one that lasted way longer than her previous release. It slipped between her cheeks slowly, spreading across the entire backside of her panties. Jet's senses exploded, she felt like she was on fire with the incredible odor of Nino's gas. She was screaming incoherently, unable to stop her own body from absorbing the steaming hot gas into its fabric. The girls silent droning fart was incredibly strong, like it had been fermented and stewed inside the deepest most potent depths of her bowels. Jet could taste and smell everything, she wanted the fart to stop but it just kept coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino was leaning to one side, shifting her hips to let the fart escape out her anus silently. She gave a small push, making sure even the hottest gas from deep within her butt was let out. She could feel her panties start to burn up, overflowing with the miasma of smells coming from her shithole. Jet was ablaze with heat, physically roasting under the wafting hellfire of gas. She wanted to pass out, but her body wouldn't let her. Instead Nino's enormous ass let out even more farts, searing her cloth-like form. The gas had spread throughout the panties, but it was most potent in one spot, directly underneath Nino's asshole. It pumped out terrible pungent fumes, hot meaty loads of fart for Jet to unwillingly feed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell multiplied as the innocent girls fart came to its eventual end. The thickest, most rich-smelling gas spewed out her anus, brought from the farthest reaches of her colon. Jet yelled in horror as it hit her, reinvigorating her senses with another explosion of intensity. The temperature spiked under Nino's giant ass, burning from the oppressive hot flatus. It was so rank and humid inside her panties, that a tiny bit of moisture began to form. It was sucked into Jet's fabric, so she could taste to pure concentrated juice of Nino's farts. If she had eyes, they would be rolled back into her head right now, and also tearing up from the stinging gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah...\" Nino sighed contently. \"That feels a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she went back to the final boxes. Jet didn't come back to having rational thoughts for another 20 minutes. She was trapped in a prison of sensory overload, she couldn't perceive anything other than how bad the farts smelled. Nino's butt was cute and soft, but a monster when it had to let loose some gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jet returned to having her sanity back Nino was already done work. The sun had set and she was waving goodbye to Beatrice as she walked out the door. Jet could still smell remnants of the farts burned into her. There was nothing she could do. The smell was going to cling to her for at least the rest of the day. She heard Beatrice's goodbyes and felt the cool night air under Nino's skirt. Where was the girl heading?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nino stayed diligent at her job of stacking boxes, still unaware that Jet had became her panties. She was standing on top of a chair, lifting a particularly heavy crate to the top of a tall stack. It was wooden and filled with small pink rocks, each in the shape of a little heart. Nino didn't know what they did, but she thought they looked cute. That was until she tipped the crate too far and spilled dozens of them onto the floor. Nino's natural clumsiness kicked in. In that instant of losing her composure she too also lost her balance and toppled over. She fell to the floor ass-first, giving the stiff wood a hard introduction to her Jet panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" The two girls said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet felt the entire weight of Nino's body smothering her, but not that much pain. Physical impact didn't seem to harm her panty-body, but being cut up or ripped would. Still, the young girl was heavier than she looked and Jet very much wanted her to get off. Before that happened, Jet noticed something. A tiny heart-shaped object also being smushed under her, pressed uncomfortably into one of Nino's jiggly cheeks. It had a crack down the middle, apparently from when the clumsy girl landed on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino also felt the hard stone from under her butt and dug it out with her hand. Bringing it up to her face she could see that it was definitely broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot! That's the third magic item I've broken this week! I really hope Miss Beatrice doesn't deduct this from my pay again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween her fingers the pink heart's crack grew. It ran all the way down the middle until the small stone snapped in half, slipping from Nino's fingers. Before it hit the ground however, it turned into pink dust and fluttered away. Nino watched as this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird... oh... whoa... everything feels all... fuzzy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heart stone's magic began to take effect on her. Neither Nino nor Jet knew what it did, but they were about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino's head was spinning. Her pupils dilated and began to change, turning into tiny heart shapes. Her chest started thumping faster and her cheeks blushed hot pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuoo~ what's wrong with me...?\" She said in a trance. \"I feel so... hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to take off her hooded overshirt, slowly pulling it off one arm at a time. Her body felt so heavy like it was melting into the ground. It was hard to even keep herself propped up, she sat against a wooden row of boxes behind her. At the same time her heart was beating like crazy, she couldn't control it. Nino had never felt like this before, she brought her hands to her thumping chest to try and calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhn~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment her hands touched her chest it felt like electricity had shot through her body. Her nipple was stiff against her palm, and just grazing it was enough to make her moan. What was this feeling? Nino had never touched herself in this way before, never masturbated or indulged in the pleasures of being a woman. Living her life in a small desert village of mages, devoting herself to studying magic every day, she had never come to know the wonders of sexual release. This moment now was her moment of discovery. Her fingers traced the stiff nipples on her budding breasts, eliciting more electric sensations to pass through her body. She gasped out loud not knowing if what she was doing was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening? Why does my body feel so... warm? I'm so sensitive... If I touch right here I... ... Mmmm~!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed her right nipple like a button, shooting delicious sparks of pleasure throughout her chest. The young girl squirmed as she continued to grope herself for the first time, learning which ways to please her body. Her legs trembled and rubbed together. She didn't know what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet felt a change in the girl's demeanor. She remained seated on the floor, and her body temperature steadily increased. More apparent was her heartbeat, which grew from a dull tick in the distance to a loud thumping. It sounded like it was right beside Jet, beating inside her head because that's exactly where it was. Nino's pussy had become flush red with colour, and throbbing with desire. The inexperienced girl didn't know what to do with herself, but her body did. Her lower lips became plump with blood, pulsating with her heartbeat against the front wall of her panties. Jet watched in horror as the pussy became engorged in size, begging for it's owner to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?! Is she getting aroused?! Shit, if she starts to get horny then the next thing that's gonna happen is-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViscous juices started to leak from her lips before Jet could finish what she was saying. She knew from having a vagina herself that when girls become raring to go, they get wet. Jet had dampened a number of panties from her own lustful desires, but never thought that she would be on the receiving end of a giant pussy. Nino began to drip slowly, lines of clear honey emerged from her hot slit. The juices were squeezed out her puffy mound like a ripe fruit, directly into the cloth of her panties. The underwear was pressing snug against her crotch, now with a small spot of wetness growing around her oozing hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was unable to control her senses in this form. As Nino's underwear she was constantly smelling as tasting everything around her, so when the girl began to get wet, Jet was forced to taste it. Sweet juices clung to her taste buds and were absorbed inside the fabric. The sticky nectar filled her up, thick and hot as it dribbled out her pussy. Jet couldn't believe the taste, for a virgin pussy it was incredibly strong. The sweet savory flavor made her dizzy, it was overwhelming to the senses. The wet spot grew around Nino's tender hole, keeping her panties glued to the opening as it gushed more liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet felt something poking her from inside the panties. As Nino became more and more aroused her clitoris began to stiffen. It was growing larger by the second, swelling to the point of becoming engorged. The sensitive nub peeled back it's clitoral hood by itself, twitching with lust. Jet could feel the pink bean rubbing against her fabric directly. It pitched a tiny tent using her cloth, quivering up and down as if calling for someone to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnngh...\" Nino moaned softly \"I feel an itch... down there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the young girl flipped her skirt up, exposing her panties. Jet noticed the change of brightness immediately. With Ninio's panties in the open, one could see her clit nub pressing hard against the cloth, wiggling slightly in anticipation. The horny girl reached her hand down towards it, shaking in hesitation. Her body was aching, but she didn't know how it would feel to touch herself down there. Jet saw a shadow cast over her, Nino's giant trembling hand was getting closer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit oh shit!! Nino don't touch yourself! I know it feels good but don't touch your pussy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino's hand was inches away. Her pussy drooled with wetness, egging her on to masturbate for the very first time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nino's budding sexual desires won out in the end. Her hand met the surface of her panties and pushed against the bulging happy button that was her clitoris. Sparks filled her eyes, and a bolt of electricity shot up her body. She had to bite her lip to keep herself from shouting out loud. It felt amazing, just by grazing the itchy spot between her legs untold pleasures were surging through her. A glob of juices spewed from her pussy hole, further expanding the wet spot on her panties. Jet was forced to taste her slime, crying for the girl to stop masturbating. Nino couldn't hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt incredible.\" The young girl panted in surprise. \"What is going on with my privates? I don't remember this part being so... stiff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino's fingers traced around her clit, teasing the tender thing. It was throbbing with her heartbeat, eager for her to play with it more. She couldn't resist, just by pressing the pads of her fingers into the little bump she could make it feel like her body was floating. Her fingers rubbed the clit up and down, sliding it against the weaves of her underwear. It made her heart race. With trepidation she brought down her thumb, and dared to pinch the horny bean between it and her forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAHn~!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stop herself from moaning that time. Luckily no one heard it. A splattering of pussy juices came from her lips, spurting into her panties. Jet knew the girl must be feeling really good around now. She had schlicked a lot in her own private time, and was well aware of how great it felt to pinch down on a hard juicy clit. Just thinking about it was enough to get her wet... if she could. Right now she was stuck, trapped as Nino's panties, forced to watch the hungry pussy in front of her dribble with thick juices. The wet spot was increasing in size, nearly covering the entirety of Nino's lower lips. They quivered, slick wet with lubrication, ready to be penetrated by a dick that wasn't present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino's hands naturally drifted down from stroking her clit to her pulsating hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-? It's wet! Did I pee myself! Oh no...\" she worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aroused girl was in such a spell that she hadn't even noticed that her panties were wet until now. She brought her hand up to her face. The aroma was different than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this isn't pee... Then what is it? Am I sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, no mattered how worried she was, she couldn't help but return her hand to touching that wet spot. Jet felt the massive fingers dig in, fumbling between her hot pink lips. More juicy droplets of pussy juices could be found in the crevices of her slit, splashing into her underwear. Jet choked on the smell, the raw sweet taste of Nino's pussy was overwhelming her senses again. The girl's fingers cascaded into her crotch one after another, attacking Jet like thick powerful logs. Every stroke, every rub, every wriggle that her inexperienced digits made would push Jet further into her labia. The damp panties had formed a cameltoe around her pussy, outlining the perfect shape of her tight little cooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer juices ran relentlessly, expanding the wet spot into a massive patch of dampness that covered her entire mound. She panted, feeling the wetness stick to her fingers. She had no idea what it was, but it felt good, and she kept going. Her curious fingers prodded deep between her lips poking the entrance of her vaginal hole. It throbbed with pleasure and drooled more thick slime into her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was drowning in her honey, and beginning to feel overstimulated. It was hard to think of anything but the roaring loins smothering her. All she could taste was an ocean of girl juices, her mind pounded with the girl's heartbeat. The sound was deafening to the point where it overlapped her own voice of rational thought. Nino's pussy was searing hot, and flushed red with the colour of her blood. As her huge fingers poked deeper into her hole, Jet could see the entrance within. It felt like her face was being stuffed inside Nino's vagina, roughly pounded again and again by her clumsy hands. Inside the pussy was sloppy and wet, goopy waves of juices rocked around the pink walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino slid down the the floor in bliss and she stuck her fingers inside. She had no idea what she was doing, but her instincts told her this was right. The was some sort of itch inside the hole, drawing her fingers closer to touch it. Her panties were in the way, but she didn't want to take them off. She liked the way they made a wedgie in her butt, and how they tugged on her hard clit. Instead she kept them on and continued to stuff the center spot inside her tight vagina. Her young fuckhole clenched lovingly around her fingers, slurping them around the damp fabric of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino had to stifle more moans as she masturbated. Her hips began to rock, working in tandem with her digging fingers. They couldn't reach in far with the panties on, but just getting an inch or two inside the girl's vagina was enough to make her arousal soar. Her pussy was gushing now, leaking bigger and bigger loads of sticky girl-goop into her underwear. The juices rolled down her taint and into her butt crack, which was humping up and down off the floor. Nino could feel a pressure building inside. Like a bubble, the more she teased, the more it felt like it was going to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was being devoured by the girl's pussy. On the outside she was drenched, grown heavy and soggy by a endless supply of seeping girl juice. On the inside she was being fucked, literally being used to masturbate with inside a giant girl's pussy. Her cavernous hole was undulating, the hot steamy walls drooled with thick white slime. Jet would have been able to see deeper, gaze into Nino's pulsating cervix, but the untouched wall of her hymen stood in the way. The girl couldn't get her fingers in deep enough to break it, but just by rubbing the front entrance of her lusthole was enough to get her close to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet's panty body was rubbed into every inch of her gaping maw. It squeezed happily around her as Nino's fingers squirmed around. They were powerful, and easily grinded Jet's poor body into the inner pussy meat. The walls grinded back, engaging the panty-girl in the middle of a heated fuck session between pussy and fingers. Jet's mind was swirling, overcome by sex. The only sound she could hear was the hungry chewing of Nino's hole. All she could see was wet slime, tasting it, eating it, breathing it. She began to moan herself into a frenzy, hyper-stimulated by the giant pulsating fuckhole that surrounded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pussy... pussy... Nino's pussy. Hot. Girl Pussy. Wet. Juices. Taste... Pussy... Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! PUSSY. PUSSYYYY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have blacked out at that point, but due to not having a human body she was kept very much conscious. Her grip on reality was the only thing that slipped away, lost in the depths of Nino's pleasure. The young girl was wriggling on the floor now, finally close to cumming. She wanted to feel that electric feeling one more time and moved her second hand away from her stiff nipple, down to her clit. With a single pinch, the trembling bean sent a jolt through her body, and tipped her over the edge of orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time Nino began to cum. Her body seized up and her hips lifted off the floor. Her eyes rolled back, seeing white as a gigantic wave of pleasure swept over her. She was hit by it again and again, fucked senseless as the vaginal hole clamped down on her fingers. It tried to force them out, squeezing down repeatedly with its tight horny muscles. Nino's pussy walls caved in, giving one final clench that pushed out all her built-up juices. Frothy white liquid flooded her panties, erupting from her steamy fuckhole. Jet groaned barbarically, pulled under an ocean of girl cum. Nino's underwear was filled with it, the thick viscous slime dribbled through the fabric and fell the to floor outside. Her hips fell down too, and she was left panting like she had just run a marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exhausted girl was dripping with sweat and seeing stars, too tired to regain motor control of her body. She relaxed into the wooden floor, letting all the tense muscles in her body loosen. Apparently she became too relaxed, because her pussy began to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet just managed to gain some sanity back as it happened, right on time to see the sparkling yellow liquid spray out her urethra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pussy... pussy... Nino? Ni... no? Ahhh. AHHHH. AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nino's spurt of girl cum earlier was an ocean to Jet, her ungodly amount of urine was like the seven seas. Jet was stained yellow, forced to drink the salty hot mixture of piss and vaginal juices. Nino was holding a lot in her bladder and it all came out her tiny pee hole. The hole gushed like a hose, pumping out more and more piss than Jet thought possible. It peeled Jet's panty body back, off the front of Nino's sticky lips from sheer force of water pressure. Her whole body was soaked, and Jet lost her sanity again from the incredible salty taste. It poured out onto the floor like a bucket, drenching Nino's ass in the pungent smell. She didn't care, she was still too dazed from her orgasm to feel anything but pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet wouldn't regain her mind back for another couple hours. What happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Holly lowered her gaze sadly. \u201cI tried to follow her, but I have no idea where she went. I couldn\u2019t find out anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Jet soothed her best friend, rubbing her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll just scour around for a bit of information. Someone has to know something, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Holly sniffled, smiling. The two adventurers returned to the main area of the village, and began asking around for information about Clara\u2019s whereabouts. It was a long, slow process, and no one seemed to know anything. Eventually, they decided to split up so that they could cover more ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet watched Holly walk down the main street, until she eventually disappeared from view. Jet was normally a calm and confident girl, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel an overwhelming sense of dread being out in the village by herself. That damn mirror had cursed her with horrible luck, and to make matters worse, her body was still squishy from the Rubberfy spell. Any number of horrible things could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet glanced around, taking a few extremely cautious steps as she examined the village. The village was quite big, almost like a large town. There were quite a few people walking the streets, going about their daily lives. There were also a lot of different buildings, serving various purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jet was walking, she ended up down a small side alley by complete accident. In the alley, she slipped on a puddle of mud, falling down onto her back. As she fell, she grabbed for something to steady herself, instead toppling over precariously positioned tower of crates. The crates fell right on top of Jet\u2019s collapsed body, squashing her flat in an instant. She hadn\u2019t even had a second to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud commotion of Jet\u2019s fall and the boxes tumbling down did not go unnoticed. A wooden door leading into the alley swung open, and a girl walked out. She grumbled under her breath upon seeing the fallen boxes, and begrudgingly went to work stacking them again. Jet was thankful for the weight being lifted off of her, but totally unprepared for what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl lifted the boxes, Jet\u2019s flat body was blown by a gust of wind, and her paper-thin was carried a few feet to the left. She landed on the step right outside of the wooden door that the girl had walked out from. Jet stared up in horror as the girl finished stacking the boxes and walked back to the door. She towered above Jet like a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet tried to scream, though her squished, crushed lungs could make no sound. Without looking down, the girl stepped onto Jet\u2019s body, one foot on her face, and the other on her waist. Oblivious to what lie under her, the girl scrapped her mud-covered boots all across Jet\u2019s body, using her as nothing more than a floor mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet mentally cried out in pain as the girl carelessly dragged her boots back and forth across Jet\u2019s crushed body, merciless and painfully. Each time she ground her feet across Jet, Jet\u2019s clothes began to tear and rip. By the time the girl had satisfactorily cleaned her boots, Jet\u2019s attire had been torn to shreds. Blissfully unaware of what she had just done, the girl opened the door and headed back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet was left in an incredible amount of pain, and it took her almost ten full minutes to reform back to her normal human shape. Blushing furiously at her nakedness, she wiped the mud off of her body. Creeping to the edge of the alley, she glanced left and right. Now, more than anything else, she needed to get some spare clothes, and also find Holly. Her mission to gather information and gone horribly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her left, Jet spotted a building that surprised her greatly. It was a brothel. Most villages didn\u2019t have one. Out front, two scantily clad girls waved and cheered to passing villagers, enticing them to come inside. Just barely, Jet could spot a back door into the brothel, which was propped open. Jet knew that, if nothing bad happened, she could sneak inside unnoticed. There would surely be something outfit to find in there. Anything was better than being naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her right, Jet saw the village\u2019s public bathhouse. The baths were indoors, contained within a large building. Seeing two women walking inside the bathhouse carrying bags, Jet assumed that it was the women\u2019s time to use the bath. That was another option for her, as Jet took note of the open window near the rear of the building. She could slip in without being spotted, steal some clothes, and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Jet knew that her cursed luck had the potential to make everything horrible. Her squishy body didn\u2019t help either. Both a brothel and a bathhouse were terrible places to be when the slightest accident could lead to a terrible predicament, but Jet didn\u2019t really have any other choices. The alley behind her was a dead end, and too tall to climb. Going anywhere other than the brothel and the bathhouse would lead to huge groups of people, something Jet desperately wanted to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing deeply, Jet took a moment to calm herself. She then began stealthily sneaking towards her chosen location, hoping that nothing bad happened.</span></div></div>",
