Remember:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Victoria Wolfe - <span class=\"cgrey\">Wolf shifter.</span></b> Brown hair, golden eyes. She has a patch over one eye when she lost it in an arena fighting match. She's cold and distant but a born leader. She doesn't take bullshit and she hardly laughs. She's always down to business but only if it's something worth her time. She's constantly appraising people and only surrounds herself with people she feels deserve to be there. But even though she is distant from most, she is extremely dedicated to the people she cares about and will do anything to protect them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Location:</b> Beijing, China<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Occupation:</b> Death Match Cage Fighter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Simon Welsh - <span class=\"cplum\">Black Panther Shifter.</span></b> Short black hair, green eyes. He has tattoos that span the length of both arms and wrap around his back, also on his calves. He's light hearted and good humored. Though he tends to stay on the quiet, reserved side, he can really let loose when around friends. He's muscled and good in a fight. He tends to hide it when he's hurt or upset, instead playing it off with a smile or a joke. He's good at what he does, but seems to attract trouble and violence. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Location:</b> New York, New York<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Occupation:</b> American League Show Fighter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lyle \"Tex\" Liddle - <span class=\"cgreen\">Viper Shifter.</span></b> Sandy blonde hair, yellow eyes. His most famous quote: \"It's pronounced Little.\" He is uppity, self-centered, sneaky and like his animal counterpart suggests, slimy. You never know if he's on your side or not, and that constant doubt and questioning usually keeps people at arms length, never getting close. He talks slowly, calculating his words. On his good days, he can have the humor of a clown. On his bad, he'll shoot his best friend in the head.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Location:</b> Cairo, Egypt<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Occupation:</b> Tomb-raider, thief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jezibel Givessi - <span class=\"cteal\">Snowy White Owl Shifter.</span></b> Bleach blonde hair, sky blue eyes. She is soft spoken and gentle. White is her favorite color and chastity comes without question. She is quick to befriend and slow to anger or doubt. But she is smart and wise and knows who to trust. Her delicacy can sometimes work in her favor, making people underestimate her ferocity in protecting those she cares about. She's a girly girl, very beautiful, and silently deadly when she needs to be. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Location:</b> Paris, France<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Occupation:</b> Dancer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alexey Romanova - <span class=\"cred\">Fox Shifter.</span></b> Long black hair, piercing green eyes. He is Simon's younger half brother, they share a mother. He's cocky and arrogant. His favorite person in the world is himself, but that doesn't keep him from easily making friends and keeping them. Even with his odd humor and \"I'm a badass\" attitude, he's very protective and caring with his friends. He's a womanizer and a flirt.

Since she'd left Simon naked under the sheets in his bed and heard his groggy, \"Bye, Vic,\" as she was pulling her shirt on over her head. She'd hadn't turned around. She hadn't looked to see if he was watching. But she'd called back to him. She'd said it like it like it was forever - and in her mind, it was supposed to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Simon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd walked out the door. She'd left him naked under the sheets and she'd been saying goodbye forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was two years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna kick ass, I know it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria Wolfe ran a hand over her face, pausing to adjust the eye patch covering her left eye. She'd lost it a year ago in an arena match in Dublin. The bastard hadn't been playing by the rules. He'd taken a swipe at her face with his claws, which was against the rules of the sanctioned arena matches. You fight with your animal counterparts, you stay away from the face and the vital organs. You go for the limbs. Fists were free reign to hit where you please. Claws had limited ability. There weren't meant to be deaths in arena fights. It happened though, sometimes. Luckily, Vic had only lost her eye. Unluckily, she'd been so pissed she'd torn out the fighter's throat. They'd kicked her out of the Sanction after that. She'd never be allowed to fight in the arena cage matches again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was what brought her to Beijing. A different kind of fight. A different kind of cage. The kind where two walked in, but one walked out. Death Matches. She never thought she'd be one to take part in them, because years ago when she'd agreed to take on these animal genes, she thought that it was brutal and immoral and wrong in every sense of the word. But after the genes, after the arenas, and after seeing what Shifters did and were capable of doing if they weren't reigned in, she'd given in to the temptation. And what was worse than giving in, she found she enjoyed it. She found she was good at it - taking lives that is. She knew it should have scared her, this strange bloodlust, but it didn't. She didn't know the people she killed in the matches and they had signed up to die, basically. She felt little remorse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention to the young man sitting across from her, she forced a smile at his expense. Death matches had an odd following. It was an underground organization that attracted criminals and adrenaline junkies alike. The matches also brought in the high roller gamblers. What better sport to bet on than death? As such, fighters who signed up to be in these matches were assigned a \"keeper\" for the few days before the match, to ensure no one got cold feet and backed out. It only happened a handful of times, where people wanted to call it quits before the match. But when it did, the Keepers were there to ensure they either died fighting or died running. Either way, Vic wasn't going to run. The match tomorrow would be easy, she was sure. And her Keeper was apparently giving her a pep talk because of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kick ass?\" She asked, grinning at him. \"I intend to make it quick,\" she said, serious. She hated drawing out death matches. Although it made the crowd go wild when there was showmanship involved, Vic did not play along. She didn't draw out someones death longer than it had to be. Maybe that's why the small underground following seemed to like seeing her. They knew she didn't do it for show. She did it for blood. Plus, it paid well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keeper, his name was Sung, grinned wider. He was a mild-mannered kid, but he was also a Tiger Shifter and she had no doubt he'd put up a damn good fight. Otherwise he'd never of been picked to be a Keeper. \"I know, but you'll still kick ass. That other guy is going down. Have you seen him yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic shook her head. \"No, I don't like making friends with my opponents before I kill them,\" she said dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung shook his head. \"You're in for a shock then. The guy is huge. Like a freaking bull!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that his Shifter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't know what it is,\" Sung answered. He looked around and then leaned in closer. \"But the bigger they are, the harder they fall.\" He winked at her and Vic resisted the urge to roll her eye at him. She looked around the small diner, studying the patrons. It was the night before a fight and even though she was confident in her own abilities, she knew there was a chance that tonight would be the last night she was alive. It happened before every fight. She called it her own special jitters, because it wasn't nerves or anxiety, it was just - peace. Being at peace with the possibility of death. If she lived, great. If she died, that was okay too. She'd said her goodbyes. She'd cleaned up her messes. She'd left her life and her organization behind. She'd left <i>him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic looked up as a waitress brought their food over. She'd always liked the local food. Something about being less processed, more raw, always attracted her wolf-senses. She'd ordered fish. It was placed in front of her with head and scales still attached. If she looked hard enough, she thought she could even see the damn tail squirm. it made her want to dig in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung snorted as he grabbed his dumplings and looked over at her. \"That could be your last supper, you know,\" he joked humorlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at him through her one good eye, then dug in. </span></div></div>",

He had an expression of sympathy on his face and she almost wanted to believe it if she didn\u2019t know he probably did this every day. It was his job to process the final paperwork. He was the one who would take her life and file it away in his computer and the metal cabinets behind him and she would become a number in their system. She was going to be just another cog in the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated this feeling. She hated feeling trapped. She wanted to spit at him, to tell him to go to Hell, to tell them all to go to hell. She hated that she was more afraid than she\u2019d been in her whole damn life because she was looking at death either way. She either gave her life to them, or she gave it back to the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife in prison, that\u2019s what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d thought she was doing the right thing. She still did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her hands in her lap and they were handcuffed together, metal edges just touching the sleeves of her orange jumpsuit. They could erase all of this with the click of a button and all she had to do was sign that little scrap of paper in front of her. Words jumped out at her, words like \u201cliability\u201d and \u201cexperimental procedures\u201d and other bullshit that basically meant once she signed it she was theirs until the end of the contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowds were the worst thing about Death Matches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria fucking hated the crowds. All those people gathered together in one place to watch two people try and kill each other and they called that entertainment. She couldn\u2019t complain too loudly because they put money in her pocket every time she walked out alive, but at the end of the day they were the worst thing about her job. They got off on watching the world\u2019s most popular and legal snuff film because they were fucking cowards who would never step in the ring themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated them because they were weak, and Victoria had based her entire life on being strong. She had to be strong at all times because it kept her heart beating and her lungs breathing. It was what kept her surviving from one day to the next when she should have been dead years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she always been this way? She couldn\u2019t remember anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a girl once, a girl named Victoria Boston, but they had buried her name deep in the records and forgotten she had existed because that girl was supposed to be in prison right now. Victoria Wolfe had been born from the ashes of that girl\u2019s life and the gene therapy that had turned her into an animal. She didn\u2019t have to worry about what her parents would think because they\u2019d been nothing but dust blowing in the wind before she\u2019d turned ten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria didn\u2019t have anyone to worry about, not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd in this corner,\u201d the announcer was saying, \u201cweighing in at one hundred and thirty-seven pounds, we have the Wolf!\u201d A second announcer was rattling off the information in rapid Chinese. When they were done a cheer broke out over the audience and she knew she was supposed to wave or bow, but she just didn\u2019t have it in her. She stretched her hands over her head and then bent to touch her toes. Her back snapped and settled into place and she felt a little more loosened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still felt numb and peaceful, even with the crowd cheering around her. They were a sea of faces and at the end of the day they wouldn\u2019t matter, just like she wouldn\u2019t to them. Maybe they would win some money on her winning, or maybe they would lose it when the clean up crew came and rolled her body onto a gurney. It didn\u2019t matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that mattered was life and death, strength and weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that mattered was the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only thing that made her feel alive anymore. When she\u2019d signed that contract and signed her life over to the Big Bosses, she had never expected that she would actually enjoy the work she was doing. She hadn\u2019t expected that she would enjoy being the wolf, or that she would find a family in their ranks. She hadn\u2019t gotten close to anyone in her life because that was the way she was, constantly pushing people away from her with words or fists. People were attachments and love and friendship or hatred and loathing and all those emotions jut ended up tying her to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t want to care about anyone but herself. Luckily in the arena she didn\u2019t have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the drums and glanced up as they let her opponent into the ring. A hiss escaped her throat and couldn\u2019t stop the word that tumbled out unbidden from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she had to pick she would have done a rerun of last year\u2019s fight where she gutted a spider shifter on the concrete because she really didn\u2019t like spiders and it made her more inclined to want to taste blood in the morning. It didn\u2019t matter what she wanted, the dream was always the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting on the floor and her head was buried in her hands. In the dream she\u2019s crying and she can\u2019t remember why anymore but it had something to do with her last fight. She hadn\u2019t killed anyone, it was years before that started, but she\u2019d wanted to and she hadn\u2019t gotten used to that feeling yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t hear him come in the room. She didn\u2019t know he was there until she felt his hand brush hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria jerked in surprise, trying to wipe away the tears as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon stopped her, catching her hands in his. He used the edge of his shirt to wipe them off her face and she stared at the floor so she didn\u2019t have to look at his face. She felt so stupid and she pulled her knees up to her chin so that she could hide behind them. He laughed a little at her and she let him get away with it because if she opened her mouth she\u2019d probably just say something nasty that she didn\u2019t mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and there was the lump in her throat from crying and she felt weak and tired and honestly she liked that he was there. Not that she\u2019d tell him that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay, Vic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no.\u201d He puffed air out of his lips to try and get the hair out of his eyes, and she realized he was still holding her hands. His thumbs were rubbing in small, smoothing circles on her skin and she glanced at his expression. He had his concentration face on, staring at her hands, studying the scars. He was probably one of the few people on the planet that knew where every one of them came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked up at her and she thought how unfair it was that he had such beautiful green eyes. \u201cYou gonna tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teeth worried at her bottom lip and the words came out in a quiet whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a monster, Simon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to laugh and then he realized she wasn\u2019t joking. His face turned thoughtful and then the lines of concern formed between his eyes and then he broke her by brushing her cheek with one hand. He cupped her face in his palm and it was rough against her skin. \u201cNo,\u201d he told her. \u201cNever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slid open at 2am to the sound of her phone ringing. She stretched across the mattress and grabbed weakly at it, both disappointed and relieved that she\u2019d missed the rest of her dream. She didn\u2019t need to be reminded of what she\u2019d left behind because she had left him for a reason. She didn\u2019t want to be thinking about Simon fucking Welsh because she wasn\u2019t that girl anymore and hadn\u2019t been for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck you phone,\u201d she growled as her fingers knocked it clumsily to the ground and now she was half crawling on the floor and wondering who the fuck was calling her this early anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d she snarled into the receiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria?\u201d a familiar voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked in surprise and fell the rest of the way out of her bed. \u201cJezibel? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a quiet, demure laugh on the other end. \u201cYou always did cut right to the chase.\u201d Then the laugh faded and there was a quiet, pregnant pause coming over the line. Victoria was just about to reach through the line and throttle the girl when she finally asked \u201cAre you sitting down?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Jesus Jez, just spit it out. It\u2019s 2 o\u2019clock in the fucking morning over here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like someone had dumped a bucket of ice water over her head. Her skin when cold and numb and she suddenly couldn\u2019t breathe. She felt like someone was sitting on her chest and she was going dizzy picturing a million possibilities over and over and she didn\u2019t want to ask if it was serious because Jezibel of all people, a girl she hadn\u2019t talked to in years, wouldn\u2019t have called her if it wasn\u2019t. She wanted to ask if he was okay but her lips wouldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria? You still there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and bit her lip so hard it bled but the metallic taste in her mouth helped snap her out of it. \u201cYeah,\u201d she finally managed. \u201cHow bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was really all the answer she needed and her imagination filled in all the blanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe, ah, he hasn\u2019t woken up yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d she said. Her fingers were cold and she couldn\u2019t feel the phone in her hand anymore. She knew what she should\u2019ve asked. She should\u2019ve asked how his vitals were and if Alexey had been called yet and whether they thought he would wake up. She wanted to ask who the fuck was responsible for it and whether they were still living and breathing because if they were she had to fix that immediately. Instead she took a breath and tried to tell herself it wasn\u2019t her problem anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a fight tomorrow. I can\u2019t come back to the states right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVic,\u201d Jezibel said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s Simon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d she breathed. She pressed her forehead into her knees and tried to tell herself she didn\u2019t care. \u201cI just can\u2019t,\u201d she said, more harshly than she meant to. Then she flipped the phone shut and let it slip from her nerveless fingers to the ground. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she told herself, and no matter how many times she said it, she still didn\u2019t believe it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd made sure the merc was dead, and then he doubly checked by ripping limbs apart and throats out and heads open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all Vic could do was sit up, holding her bleeding side and watch. Because it was his first kill and it was the bloodiest fucking thing she'd ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon turned and shifted back to the man she knew - but covered in blood and flesh. He rushed to her side, maybe he wasn't aware of what he'd just done. Or maybe he didn't care. A hand came to cup her cheek gently as he inspected her for other wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vic? You alright?\" he asked softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at him. \"Gee, Simon,\" she said, cursing mentally when her voice shook. \"Why don't you hold back next time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. And it was so <i>Simon</i> that she grinned too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only I get to call you a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat crying on the floor in her underwear and tanktop. The phone lay a few inches from her, mocking and driving her depressive thoughts. She should call back. She should call Jez and ask all of the million questions that were racing through her mind and keeping her from going back to sleep and preparing for tomorrow's fight. Was he okay? How bad was it? What happened? Who did she have to kill? The last part seemed to run through her mind more than the others. Whose fault was this? They were going to pay. She'd make sure they paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd always been there for her. Always. There to pull her back from despair and hurt and death and everything else that had ever threatened to consumer her. He'd given up a lot for her. The more she looked back on it, the more she realized just how much he sacrificed to keep her happy, to keep her alive, to just fucking be with her. And what had she done? She'd up and left and hadn't looked back. And now he needed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she needed him. More than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined, she picked up the phone. The operator connected her to the last number called and Jez picked it up on the second ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vic.\" Her voice was small and meager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" Vic asked, surprised that she managed to keep the tears from her voice. She reached up and wiped the remaining evidence from her face, listening for Jez's answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owl shifter on the other end was quiet a moment, but Vic could hear background noises and Jez's heavy heels clicking on tiled floor. She was walking, to get privacy most likely. \"Mercy Hospital,\" Jez said quietly, and then seemed to find her privacy as her voice rose. \"In New York. There's a flight that leaves from Beijing in two hours. I already booked you a ticket.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic let out a small chuckle at that. She couldn't help herself. The girl was on top of things and she somehow knew her team, even after years of separation, better than anyone. Vic reached a hand up to pinch the bridge of her nose. \"What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk when you get her, Vic,\" Jez said, her voice small again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, though the other girl couldn't see her, she looked around the room. \"It's going to be complicated.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complicated how?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a match tomorrow. When I don't show, they'll send people to kill me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJez scoffed. \"Kill them back!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile that reached Vic's face was genuine and whole hearted and it had been so long since she'd had one like that. They'd been a team once, all of them. And she was remembering just what she left behind. Jez's happy and naive attitude. Alexey's cockiness. Lyle's worm tongue. Simon. Her mind picture him in a hospital bed and it was all she could do to keep from crying again. She wouldn't cry. Not anymore over this. She had work to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call when I land,\" she said into the phone and then hung up before the girl could get a chance to reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, her eyes went around the room. She quickly packed a light duffle bag. She pulled on a pair of jeans and shirt. Heading to the closet, she threw it open and rifled through the clothes hanging there, stopping when she found what she was looking for in the back. One of Simon's shirts. She'd accidentally taken it with her when she left. Running a hand over the fabric for a moment, she leaned into it and took a deep breath. It still smelled like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly pulling the shirt off the rack, she stuffed it carefully into the duffle bag and then slung it over her shoulder. She walked quietly to her bedroom door and peeked out. Sung was on the couch in her living room. His feet propped up on her coffee table. The apartment was small and she'd decorated it to fit American culture more than Chinese culture. In the apartments around her, families of ten to twenty people lived in the same space she herself occupied. She tried to not to feel guilty when she still found it to be small for her taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung was asleep. He was Shifted and orange and black striped fur ran the length of his body. His sense were more alert when he had cat ears listening to everything. She was somewhat surprised that he hadn't woken up as she'd packed up her things. But she counted it as a blessing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking as lightly as she could across the hardwood floor, she made her way to the front door, her eyes never leaving the sleeping Shifter. He stirred once, and she froze, holding her breath. When he settled, she smiled somewhat and opened the front door. It was louder than she hoped and she thought for sure he'd wake. By some grace of god, he didn't and she slipped out, half jogging the rest of the way to the staircase. She took them four at a time and reached the bottom of the building faster than she ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be seeing you soon, Sung,\" she whispered to the building as she ran up the sidewalk to where her car was parked at a garage. She knew that when he woke up to find her gone, he'd report it to the Death Match organizers. They'd send people after her. Probably Sung himself. And the high rollers would send people. She'd be running for a good long time, if not the rest of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause all she could think about now was Simon. And he'd better wake the fuck up before she got there. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The flight was long and ridiculous. Vic thought more than a couple times about pulling open the emergency door and flying there herself. Nevermind the fact that wolves weren't airborne animals, she'd will herself to sprout fucking wings and flap her damn way to Simon's side way faster than this hunk of junk airplane was going, she was sure. Lucky for her, and the 300 other passengers who shared her flight, she managed to restrain herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind wandered for the thirteen hours it took to get to the States. She dozed on and off, but could never truly fall asleep. Each time she did, she'd wake with a jolt and Simon's name on her lips. She tried listening to music or reading a book or watching the in-flight movies, but she couldn't focus. She couldn't pay attention. The names, the words, the actors - they all looked the same and they all reminded her of him in some way or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sad thing was, she hadn't realized how much she missed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years ago when she'd walked out, yeah it hurt. But she'd gotten over it. Any time something reminded her of him, it didn't hurt as badly as she was hurt right now, because in her mind, she'd been done with him. She'd never see him again. He was a person from her past, a memory in her mind, a name in her history. She tried to convince herself that she wanted it that way. In reality, she had always wanted to run back to him and there wasn't a day she'd felt otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the plane landed, she'd shoved her way out of the cluster fuck of unloading the plane and had gone straight out to try and find a taxi. She shouldn't have been surprised to find Jez waiting for her in the lobby, but she was. And a little pissed. If Jez was here, who was with Simon? What if he woke up? Dread flashed through her as she thought of reasons why the girl had abandoned his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jez?\" Vic asked as she came up to the blonde. Jezibel had gotten a hair cut since last she'd seen her. And it looked like a boob job too. She was still beautiful and sexy without taking on the skanky slutty look like most girls with her beauty did. Her icy blonde hair was pulled back into a bun and she wore her typical white outfit. Her leather heels were six inches high, but you'd never notice as the girl stood only about 5'1. It made her look normal height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJezibel smiled at her. \"Vic,\" she enveloped her in a hug and Vic tried to remain calm, waiting for the girl to explain why she was here, why she didn't just let her catch a cab. When Jez pulled back, she frowned a little. \"Oh, honey, we're gonna have to get you a better eyepatch. Maybe one with a diamond in it. You'd look fabulous with that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon?\" Vic choked out, appreciating the attempt at familiarity, but not wanting it. She wanted to know how he was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile faded from Jez's crimson lips and she wrapped an arm around Vic's as the smaller girl led her towards the parking lot where her flashy car was waiting. Vic would have to remember later to ask how Jezibel had come to have so much money for all the flashy things she had. It made her envy the girl a little, to know she was doing so well for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJez sighed. \"Let's just get to the hospital.\" </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An electronic voice was coming over the PA system and Vic sat back on her hard plastic chair, arms crossed over her chest. Her body portrayed boredom and irritation, but her eyes were constantly moving, scanning the airport. The flight was delayed and she had somehow convinced herself that Sung would be awake and looking for her now. There would be Keepers swarming the airport soon. She was convinced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd come for her and they'd kill her. They wouldn't stop until she was dead. The Keepers would think it an honor tracking her down because she was a regular in the Death Matches. They all watched her fight, watched her win, and watched her kill. She only hoped that she'd survive long enough to help Simon. And that thought alone was what kept her from racing back to fight in her match. She couldn't guarantee she'd live through the match. She couldn't take the chance that she would be killed before seeing him again. It also meant that when she got to Simon, she couldn't get close again. Because now, she couldn't stay with him even if she wanted to. They'd come for her. She would die. And she'd be damned if she got Simon hurt, physically or emotionally, in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone going off in her pocket made her nearly jump out of her seat. She pulled it from her pocket and looked at the caller ID. She frowned a little at the unusual phone number. She didn't recognize it. Against her better judgement, she flipped the phone open. She didn't say anything, however, because she didnt' know if it was a Keeper or an Organizer on the other end of the line. She didn't expect the voice that came through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you pulling the heavy breather on me, Vic?\" It was Alexey, pure and sweet. She felt tears sting at her eyes in relief at hearing his voice after all this time. He was joking, which was so much more welcoming than the greeting she thought she'd get out of the Fox Shifter. She reached up to wipe the tears from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexey,\" she choked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have caught on to her saddened tone. \"So I guess you heard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jez called me,\" she said quietly, standing up and grabbing her backpack. She hefted it over a shoulder and decided to take a walk through the airport while she spoke to him. She didn't want to sit still anymore. She kept seeing Keepers in all the different faces passing her by. \"She said he was in the hospital. What happened, Lex?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and she could hear the exhaustion in his voice. \"He got cut during a match.\" Vic frowned, but let Alexey continue. \"Nothing big, nothing he hasn't had before, you know? He won the match and then afterwards they were trying to stitch him up, but he just kept fucking bleeding and he was bruised everywhere.\" She heard Alexey give an angry growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the fucking cancer, Vic. It's back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stopped her dead in her tracks. A tourist walking behind her nearly collided with her. He cussed at her in a foreign language and wheeled his giant suitcase around her. She glared at him with her one eye and headed towards the wall. She lowered her voice, like they were talking about something taboo. Simon had never liked talking about being sick. The cancer had nearly killed him. Then the geneticists had given him panther DNA and he'd been cured. He'd owed the government his life, after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, clutching her phone tightly in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has fucking cancer and he nearly bled to death because his blood wasn't clotting. I don't know the medical reason behind it all, I'm not a fucking cancer expert.\" Alexey was yelling and she had to resist the urge to tell him that she never said he was a cancer expert, or even asked about the blood clotting. When Alexey yelled, he usually did it because he was scared, not angry. When he was angry, he got quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic ran a hand through her hair, looking around the airport before responding. \"Can't they do something? Can't they just replace more genes or...\" she trailed off. She'd never really been an expert on the science behind their process either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it, Vic,\" Alexey's voice got soft and she could almost picture the Fox Shifter sagging his shoulders in defeat. \"They can, but Simon won't let them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the fuck not?\" she demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because his fucking contract was up last week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath, her mind reeling over that piece of information. When Simon first had his genes spliced, he'd signed away years of his life to serve whatever purpose the company wanted. When the contract was up, he was a free man. He'd served a few years as a mercenary, then had movie on to be a prize fighter. Now his contract was up, and in the first week, he had life threatening cancer again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How convenient,\" she voiced her thoughts without realizing it. Alexey must have been thinking the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said. Vic, god dammit. Those fuckers did this on purpose.\" Vic closed her eyes. Yeah, her and Alexey were definitely on the same wave length. \"Look, those scientists pick out specific gene codes and sequences. They know what they're putting into you top to fucking bottom. There's no way they wouldn't have seen this coming. They just wanted him to fucking sign up again, those god damn bastards.\" Alexey was raging now and Vic let him. She felt like punching her fist through the wall too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's not going to sign up again.\" She didn't have to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's a dumbass. He thinks he'd rather die than work for the company again. Asshole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic chuckled and she heard Alexey give a tired chuckle on the other end of the line. If there was one thing the both of them could agree on, it was how stubborn Simon was. She sighed into the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at the airport,\" she said and she heard Alexey stay quiet, like he was afraid to ask where she was going or coming because he didn't want to scare her off. \"My flight's delayed, but I'll be there late tonight. Come pick me up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From Beijing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"We'll convince that stupid brother of yours that he'll sign the contract and then we'll come up wtih a way to pay those fuckers back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey laughed and Vic grinned herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you, Bitchzilla.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria leaned over the sink and pulled the eye patch from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nasty lump of scar stared back at her and she didn\u2019t even have the dead eye left in her face. She still remembered the pain of it, the pain of claws searing through her skin and the burning agony of having one of her eyes practically torn out of her head. She\u2019d gone insane with it, the wolf taking over completely in rage and anguish. She remembered the rest of the fight through a haze of red and she remembered what happened after it even less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d been taken to the hospital at some point and she remembered Jezibel calling her there too. How the girl managed to keep tabs on all of them she didn\u2019t ask, but she was probably still in touch with the Big Bosses and they knew where every one of their investments had run off to, no matter how far they ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered Simon calling, and he\u2019d barely gotten her name out before she\u2019d hung up on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms were shaking she was gripping the sink so hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t like to admit to herself how tempting it would have been to ditch the fight and fly back to the States six hours ago. The quickest flight she booked would still take over thirteen hours and she didn\u2019t know what kind of condition Simon was in because she hadn\u2019t asked. She could have called Jezibel back and gotten all the details from her, but that would have been admitting something to herself that she wasn\u2019t ready to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t say she was just asking as a friend because he hadn\u2019t been just that to her for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped when Sung knocked on the door. \u201cVictoria? You ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer one good eye focused on the face looking back at her and it looked cold and hollow to her. The peace she normally felt was gone and shattered in one phone call. How could she go into this fight while constantly wondering in the back of her mind if Simon was flat-lining? How could she die without knowing if he was okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d she snarled, and punched her reflection. She kicked the shattered pieces of glass and yanked the bathroom door open. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she snapped, and Sung took an involuntary step backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew how she looked. She looked like a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I wanted to be when I was a kid?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon laughed at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A serial killer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha, very funny asshole,\u201d she said. She mock-glared at him and shoved him away from her. He barely stumbled and caught himself by slinging an arm around her shoulder. She shrugged it off out of habit and turned so that she was walking backwards and could keep an eye on him. \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t tell you after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still smiling and he reached out to catch her hand in his. \u201cAw baby, don\u2019t be like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help the laugh that followed. \u201cOh fuck you! Don\u2019t think that sweet talk is going to work on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d he asked, and then he stopped, pulling her back towards him. She thought about fighting it and then his other hand caught her around the waist and pulled her against him. \u201cWill this?\u201d he asked. She could feel the smile still on his lips when he kissed her and she couldn\u2019t decide whether to push him away or pull him closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lion tamer,\u201d she said, her lips still brushing his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head so he couldn\u2019t kiss her again and she was laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to be. When I was a kid I wanted to run away and join the circus. I wanted to tame lions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. \u201cLuck you. You get to live the childhood dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the fuck up Welsh,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she made him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his arms at the crowd and they howled for him. She couldn\u2019t remember his name or how many kills he had to it, but it really didn\u2019t matter in the end. In the beginning she\u2019d studied her opponents and she\u2019d sweat when she walked into the ring. Her first Death Match had been a close thing and she had been terrified that she was going to die here on the mats in China, thousands of miles from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she\u2019d stopped being afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, it wasn\u2019t about winning or losing. It was about life and death, about walking that edge between human and animal and seeing who had the stronger will to survive. She\u2019d gotten used to toeing that line and it shouldn\u2019t have been any different this time, except it was and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe official stepped into the arena and blew his whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo enter, one leaves. No holds barred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he headed back to the sidelines where he could watch. She wondered in the back of her mind who he\u2019d bet on to win and then he blew the whistle and the match began. The man let loose a roar and barreled across the arena at her. She didn\u2019t know if he was trying to scare her or just encourage himself but she side stepped the charge easy and landed a roundhouse kick to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t want to fuck around today but he when he came up with fists swinging and no sign of claws or fangs she knew he was trying to make a match of it. The crowd cheered when his fist clipped her jaw and it cheered when she landed a knee in his gut. The crowd was a living, breathing thing and they were the heart of it. They didn\u2019t care who was winning as long as blood was flowing and they had something to make the day go faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed two more kicks to the guy, one in the stomach and the other on the kneecap, before he started getting mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl escaped his lips as his fangs came out and then he was charging her again. She tried to dodge but they were too close and his arm caught her across the chest and brought them both to the ground. She tried to roll but now claws were digging into her side and trying to hold her in place. She slashed at his face with fresh claws and it forced him to move his arms, but now he was holding both of hers down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a growl rumble in her own chest and her teeth snapped at the guy\u2019s throat that was just out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned at her and she snarled back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to heave the guy off her but he weighed too much and she barely moved them off the ground. Another growl escaped his throat and even if he was using all his energy holding her down he could still tire her out that way and then she would be an easy kill. She hated even the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wolf form ripped through her, enough to rip one arm free and roll out from under the guy. He turned and he was still midway through his change when she hit his chest and sunk her teeth into his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a mix of thick hair and flesh when she leapt away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a lion shifter. She would have laughed if she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that was a mix of a paw and a hand came up to clasp a hand over his throat and while maybe that wouldn\u2019t have been enough to kill him the opening he left her was. She darted in quick under his chest and her teeth sunk into the soft skin of his belly. She ripped at anything she should reach and it was probably too little too late when a heavy paw smacked her to the side. A bestial roar echoed around the arena and then it fell quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still alive when she dragged herself over to him. He was going to bleed to death, eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to remind herself she was doing him a favor when she ripped his throat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung was the first one to clap her on the back when she limped out of the ring. \u201cI said you would kick ass today, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he grinned. \u201cA little quick, but that\u2019s your style, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have the energy to smile back at him. She didn\u2019t have the energy for anything except to grab her coat and her bag. She didn\u2019t want to see the medic or her \u201cfans\u201d or the judges and she didn\u2019t care about setting up another fight. Her side was throbbing and her chin felt bruised and this was the part where she was supposed to feel like a survivor, like she was one with the beast and everything was right with the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted to see Simon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her flight had been delayed twice and it was turning into a twenty hour trip. It made her wish that she\u2019d left at two o\u2019clock when Jezibel had first called because then she might already be there and wouldn\u2019t be reading the in-case-of-emergency instructions over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d made the mistake of calling Jezibel while she waited for her plane to take off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria,\u201d she said, and didn\u2019t even have the decency to pretend to be surprised that she was calling. \u201cHow are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Vic sighed. \u201cI\u2019m at the goddamn airport. Now tell me what happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Jezibel was smiling because she could be a smug little bitch sometimes. Most people never saw that side of her, but they\u2019d been closer than family once and they knew how far they could push each other. She was also an idealist who thought there was a happy ending at the end of the rainbow or some shit and she didn\u2019t understand that sometimes things couldn\u2019t be fixed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone assaulted him on his way home from the bar last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, Vic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d She was snarling into the phone now and she had started to pace in front of the bench. \u201cHow the fuck do you not know? Aren\u2019t you still in with the Big Bosses and all? Don\u2019t they know who attacked one of their own? Jesus, what fucking good are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop yelling at me Vic,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I can, but there\u2019s not a lot to go on yet. We won\u2019t know more until he wakes up and even then it might not be any help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t calm down, but she did manage to sit back down because her legs felt wobbly. \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t woken up?\u201d she asked. She was proud of how steady her voice came out because her hands were shaking. How long had he been out and how hard did someone have to hit him to knock Simon out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic hated false optimism. \u201cI gotta go, my flight\u2019s here,\u201d she said, and then hung up without saying goodbye. She hated goodbyes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane rumbled as they flew through a cloud. She sighed and tried to listen to some of the music they had on these things but none of it slowed her thoughts. She picked at her nails and there was still blood caked under them and she wondered what Simon would say if he knew she was fighting in Death Matches. She wondered what he would say when he saw the mess that was left of her eye, and if he would still think she was pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tipped her head back against the seat and took a deep breath. It was almost funny. Two years ago she\u2019d though she couldn\u2019t get far enough away. She\u2019d gone to Ireland and she still felt too close after that call to her hospital bed, so she\u2019d moved to Russia and that was too close to Alexey, so she\u2019d finally settled on China and she\u2019d though she was far enough away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out she was, and now she was damning herself for it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before a fight she always felt this weird sort of calm like whatever happened next was going to be okay, whether it was good or bad. If she died and ended up being scraped into a black bag after the match, it didn\u2019t matter because she\u2019d come to terms with the important bits. If she lived, then she would go on to fight another day and send someone else back to their families in a body bag. It was nature and she had peace with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling started during the last two hours of her flight. It stayed with her through customs and calling the taxi cab. She was fine on the ride to the hospital and even standing outside it, watching the spectacle going on there, she still felt strangely calm about the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd of teenagers, mostly girls, were gathered outside the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were carrying homemade signs reading \u201cGet well soon Simon!\u201d and \u201cYou can do it Big Cat!\u201d She didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or gag and she wondered what had happened in the two years she\u2019d been gone. It still didn\u2019t shake her, even the goddamn newscaster that stood outside and did a report on his condition only managed to piss her off a little bit. She was fine all the way up the elevator and to the end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second she set foot in his room it came crashing down around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay in the center of a white bed; an IV drip hooked up to one arm and wires running all over the place to keep track of his heart rate and blood pressure. He looked like he\u2019d been put through a meat grinder, dark bruises all over his face and arms. He had stitches holding his eyebrow together and his lip was split and bleeding. His left arm was bound, but not in a cast, so at least it looked like nothing was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and looked away because she wasn\u2019t ready to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two giant vases of flowers set up by the window and a little parade of teddy bears keeping him company. Someone had started setting up all the cards and get well posters he\u2019d received on a table in the corner, and none of them said anything she hadn\u2019t seen on the signs outside. She flipped through them, not really reading any, but she did pause on one from his mother and she couldn\u2019t stop the sneer that pulled at her lips. \u201cTo my dear boy, wishing you a speedy recovery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear boy\u201d her ass. His mother had always been a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and turned back around to face the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated seeing him like this, all weak and fragile and breakable. She hated that they didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d wake up or who she had to fucking kill for doing this or how they\u2019d managed it in the first place. She held back the tears and walked over to the bed, fingers brushing the hair out of his eyes. She kept waiting for him to open them and tell her that she looked like someone had run over her dog or something equally as stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she was terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was terrified that he wouldn\u2019t wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled into the bed next to him and laid her head on his chest. She could hear his heart beating slowly against her cheek and she closed her eyes, holding on to the sound. \u201cPlease be okay,\u201d she whispered. Her fingers tangled in the hospital gown and she pulled herself closer to him, twining around his form. There were tears slipping down her face and if he were awake she would never hear the end of it because Vic hadn\u2019t cried since that first night he\u2019d kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her eyes closed and her tears dry up and she just focused on the steady sound of his heartbeat and the low breaths that still passed through his lungs. She tried not to look at the split lip or the stitched up gouge running from his forehead over his temple. Those things would heal. Simon would heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure when she fell asleep, but she woke up when she felt him shift under her cheek. She went to move but his arm came up around her waist and held her there. She watched as his other hand came up to cover hers and his fingers played over her skin in a way that was all too familiar. \u201cHey Simon,\u201d she said after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVic,\u201d he whispered back, and his voice was harsh and ragged and didn't sound like him. A cough shook his body and his hand clenched around hers. She squeezed reflexively back and crushed her eyes shut until the fit passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was crying again, and she didn\u2019t want to be. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d she said quietly and she couldn\u2019t put any force behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle rumbled through his chest. \u201cI missed you too.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was so much to say and neither of them knew where to start, so it hung over both of them in a way that was familiar and awkward at the same time. Victoria wondered if she should apologize for leaving but she didn\u2019t know if she was sorry yet, and saying it implied that she wished she\u2019d never left. Whether it was true or not didn\u2019t matter, saying it would change things in a way she didn\u2019t know if she could face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cough shook him and it forced her to look up at his face. His eyes were shut as it wracked his body and his lip split open and started bleeding again. She used the edge of her sleeve to wipe it off his chin. When it stopped he looked at her and for a second his e yes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand brushed her hair out of her face and she realized he was staring at the eye patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced down at the bed so she didn\u2019t have to see his expression but she didn\u2019t stop him when he slid it off her head and then his fingers brushed over the scars. \u201cThis is from Dublin?\u201d he asked, even though he already knew the answer. She almost told him that but instead bit her lip and nodded. He smirked, but it wasn\u2019t a cruel thing. \u201cLooks like it hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been hurt worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so maybe that was a lie. But he laughed anyway. \u201cThat\u2019s my fearless girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to tell him she wasn\u2019t his girl anymore, but that would have been a lie too. She wondered if she\u2019d ever stopped and she let her hand come up to trace the lines on his face. He winced when her fingers brushed over the black stitches, but he didn\u2019t stop her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She demanded, changing the subject. \u201cWho the fuck did this to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and coughed, hand reaching up to catch hers again. \u201cWhy, so you can hunt them down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just shrugged. \u201cSome assholes caught me unprepared. I was drunk if that counts for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled, her eyes narrowing. \u201cSomebody puts you in the hospital for two days and all you can do is shrug? What aren\u2019t you telling me, Welsh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d he asked abruptly, ignoring her question. The laughter was gone from his voice and he just sounded sad now. She tried to sit up and tried to pull her hand back but he laced his fingers with hers so that she couldn\u2019t run away. \u201cI thought you\u2019d come back, but you were just\u2026 gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath caught in her throat and she swallowed it down. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cThen I can\u2019t kill them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria\u2026\u201d he began, and she pulled her hand roughly from his because she didn\u2019t want to talk about it and if she stayed there she might even tell him the truth. She stumbled climbing out of the bed, but he let her go. He struggled to sit up and she could feel his green eyes staring at her as she turned her back on him. A heavy sigh escaped his lips and she wondered if she was pissing him off. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you until you talk to me,\u201d he said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious? You\u2019re lying in a hospital bed and you want to talk about our relationship?\u201d she asked and now she was digging through the cards just so her hands had something to do. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of you!\u201d and \u201cGet well soon\u201d flashed before her and she realized there were tears stinging at her eyes again so she tossed them into a pile on the table. \u201cIt was time to go, so I left. I told you at the beginning not to read anything into it,\u201d and the words came out cruel and harsh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Vic, I\u2019m trying not to but I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out what it was to you to begin with,\u201d and he just sounded tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn\u2019t she stop being a bitch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head at her, running one hand through his hair and he winced when his fingers brushed the gash on his face. His face just looked so goddamn sad. Her mouth wouldn\u2019t open to apologize even though her brain was saying the words over and over again. She was sorry for leaving, sorry for being a bitch about everything, sorry she couldn\u2019t say sorry. There wasn\u2019t enough time in the day to tell him all the things she was sorry for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced up at her and he looked exhausted. \u201cWhat was I to you? Was I your boyfriend, your friend with benefits, was I just a fuck buddy? I\u2019m trying not to read into this but I don\u2019t know where the line is with you. You just up and leave for two years and then you come back and it\u2019s like nothing changed and I don\u2019t even know why you left in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this fucking conversation right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled a little. \u201cWell, we could have it later but there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019d stick around for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw a teddy bear at him and she didn\u2019t want to smile but she couldn\u2019t help herself when he was giving her that look. It was everything she loved about him. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned back and caught it before it hit him in the face. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said already. You gonna answer me today sometime? Because I can wait, but I figure eventually the nurses are gonna kick you out and then it\u2019ll be another two years before I can ask you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled but she didn\u2019t know what to say to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not just a fuck buddy,\u201d she managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good to know, at least.\u201d He laughed at her and struggled to sit up. She didn\u2019t miss the wince on his face or the blood that still trickled from his lip and she just wanted to be done with this so that she could fucking kill whoever had hurt him and then leave again. It was too hard to be here and see him like this and not tell him all the things she wanted to say and couldn\u2019t because it was too hard and when it came to Simon she was nothing but a damn coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me make this easy for you Victoria,\u201d he said. She didn\u2019t expect the words that came next, at least not coming out of his mouth while she was still awake. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to leave. I still don\u2019t and if I didn\u2019t hurt so goddamn much then I would think this was a dream I was having. Fuck, come here,\u201d he told her and held a hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to tell him no. Her feet carried her over to him anyway and she sat on the edge of the bed with his hand in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was staring at the bed, his thumb rubbing small circles on her skin and it was so familiar it made her chest ache. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered to the ground. Then his head rose and he was looking right at her and she couldn\u2019t pretend she hadn\u2019t heard him because it was hard to breathe. Tears pricked her eyes and she dashed them away with the back of her hand. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cCome here.\u201d He pulled her back onto the bed with him, hand settling in her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t cry Vic. It kills me when you cry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she told him. She was shaking and she didn\u2019t know what to say because the words were everything she wanted to hear and the one thing she\u2019d been terrified of. How did she justify leaving him now, knowing how he felt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. The asshole laughed at her. \u201cDon\u2019t what? Love you? It\u2019s a little late for that, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be nice to me,\u201d she said, and buried her face in his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, rubbing a comforting hand up and down her back. \u201cSome days I don\u2019t get you at all,\u201d he said, but his voice was calm and almost cheerful. \u201cI tell you I love you and it makes you cry. Not that you\u2019re the only girl who\u2019s ever had that reaction, but I gotta tell you, it\u2019s still a blow to the ego.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and sat up, swallowing the last of her pride as she looked into his face. He was staring back at her with those green eyes and they were crinkled at the edges because she\u2019d made him sad and he was trying to pretend she hadn\u2019t. He was still handsome, even with that mask of bruises on his face, and she brought a trembling hand up to his lips. She was tired of lying to herself, tired of running away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and then his lips were brushing hers and the kiss was small and soft because she didn\u2019t want to hurt him. It had been two years since they\u2019d seen each other last, but he was right. It was like nothing had changed at all, and she felt her heart pounding in her chest. He pulled away all too soon and they were left staring at each other with the same expression. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d he asked after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she was the one that grinned, and it was a wicked, feral thing. \u201cNow you tell me who the fuck put you in a hospital bed so that I can return the favor.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And he knew that she saw it, so she pretended like she didn't. She reached up to run her fingers lightly down his face, careful of the stitches, careful of the bruising. She lingered a bit on a small cut on his chin, before looking back up into his eyes. He looked tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you involved, Vic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words caught her off guard, because whether he realized it or not, he'd just admitted that this had been more than just a random happenstance. It was more than \"some assholes catching him unprepared.\" Because as much as he loved her and tried to protect her, he wouldn't keep her out of just anything. He wouldn't ask her to stay out of a random hate crime just for the sake of keeping her safe, because he knew what type of fighter she was. He knew that she could kick his ass, even on his good days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late,\" she said, leaning to kiss him again to silence whatever words were on his lips. \"You can't say you love me, then <i>trick</i> me into saying it too and expect me to not get involved.\" She grinned at him, but watched his eyes. He let out a low chuckle, but there was worry and anxiety behind it. She brought his hand to her lips and kissed his fingers. \"Tell me, Simon. Who did this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed quiet, his eyes studying her for a moment. She tried not to let the hurt shine in her eyes because his silence meant he was hiding something, that the trust wasn't there. She didn't blame him. She'd been gone, she'd left. It would take a while to mend what she'd done to him. Even if today they were okay and together again, she knew it would take a while before he didn't panic every time she left his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, Vic...\" he struggled for words. \"These guys don't play around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously,\" she said, running her hands to his arm, to his side. She could feel the bandages beneath his hospital gown. She imagined the bruises on his chest. She needed to go kill someone, soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked away and she could see him swallow thickly. His hand gripped hers and he coughed. It was raspy and violent and she laid a hand on his chest to tell him she was still there. When he opened his eyes, he didn't look at her. He spoke quietly and he spoke brokenly. She'd only heard him talk like this a few times before. When he talked about the cancer that had nearly killed him before he had the panther inserted into his genes. When he talked about his father leaving when he was a kid. When he'd said her name on that phone call while she was in Dublin. She hated this weak voice. This was his defeated voice. And Simon Welsh should never be fucking defeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was suppose to go down in the third round,\" he whispered. \"I said I'd do it but, fuck, I only said it so they'd leave me the hell alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic sat up a little, keeping her eyes on his face. She squeeze his hand for encouragement and because he looked lost, he looked like he needed a hug, he looked like he needed her to go make it all go away. \"Someone asked you to throw a fight.\" She didn't ask it, because she was starting to put the pieces together even before he explained it entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and it looked painful. \"I don't throw fights, Vic, you know I don't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward and ran a hand over his head again because he was getting upset and she hated when he got upset. \"I know,\" she told him and she did know. Simon wasn't a fighter for the money or the fame or the violence, even though he received plenty of all of them. He was a fighter because he didn't have a choice. He followed contracts because the contracts had saved his life when he'd been dying. He did what he was told and along the way, he'd become honest. He'd become loyal. He'd become a fucking model citizen in a world of crime and hate. She loved that about him. She always had. \"I know,\" she repeated when it looked like he didn't want to tell her anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were so fucking persistent. They were every where, damn,\" he growled and she ran her thumb over his hand, trying to keep him calm but knowing he'd just woken up to a world much different than the one he'd gone to sleep in. He needed to vent, if only just a little. \"Every match, in the locker rooms, they even showed up at my apartment, Vic. They just wouldn't go the fuck away so I said I'd do it. I said I'd take a dive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't.\" Again, not a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed but it turned into a cough. She waited for it to pass. She thought she had an idea who they were, but she needed Simon to tell her. She needed to confirm it. There were reasons people asked fighters to throw matches. Most of them involved gambling. In Beijing, the chinese crime lords would convince death match fighters to make martyrs of themselves and die in battle and glory so they could bet on the opponents and win big. They'd make the underdogs win and the one predicted to win the fight would always die. In America, it was the same gist, but no death - most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don Corleone and the entire cast of the fucking Godfather,\" Simon hissed out, looking pissed off and rightfully so. She chuckled, because he was cute when he was pissed, and she leaned forward to kiss his lips again. It seemed to calm him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight,\" she said, moving her kisses to his chin, to his cheek, to his neck. She couldn't seem to stop because she was just so fucking happy she could touch and smell and taste him again. His hand came up to run through her hair and she was fairly certain if Simon wasn't in a hospital bed, they would have found their way to another bed soon enough. \"You tell the mafia that you're going to throw a fight. You don't. Then you decide to get drunk and walk home alone from a bar?\" She pulled back to look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was grinning and she shook her head. \"Good thing you only like me for my charm and good looks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay.\" He answered so quickly and the look on his face was so serious that she paused for a moment, her smile fading. She looked at him and his eyes were watery. He reached a hand up to cup the side of her face and she placed her hand over his, keeping it there because, damn, it felt so good to feel him again. \"Stay with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed him and it was passionate and she felt and tasted his lip bleeding. He winced beneath the kiss but she didn't pull back or hold back. She wanted to prove it to him that she loved him and she'd made a mistake and she wouldn't make it again. When she pulled back, she wiped the blood from his lips and hers and he was looking at her still, looking tired and pleading and hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here now,\" she told him and his eyes closed as she ran her hand over his face. He was tired and he needed rest and her words were soothing and comforting and he seemed to believe them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere, not now. Not ever again.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doctors had come in to check up on Simon, now that he was awake. They'd given him two more days in the hospital, to watch for hemorrhaging on the brain, and then he could go home. He'd be sore, dizzy and need lots of rest, but he'd heal completely. Shortly after the doctors left, the police showed up to take a statement. Simon had bullshitted his way through that, and Vic let him get away with it. Because the further away from the truth the cops were, the closer she could get to the actual fuckers who'd put Simon here. A reporter tried to sneak in to see Simon, but security escorted her out rather quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was gone, a nurse came in to give Simon morphine. He complained his eyeballs itched, then fell to sleep immediately. Vic watched the nurse blush and grin and eye fuck Simon in his sleep and she couldn't help the jealous rage that almost had her leaping out of her chair next to his bed to throttle the bitch. But then she left and the room was quiet except for the heart monitor they wanted to keep up. They weren't kidding about the brain hemorrhaging thing, and Vic let them take all the extra precautions they needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching him sleep, she had to remind herself that he was only resting. He wasn't unconscious or in a coma, just resting and if she wanted to, she could reach out and shake him awake. She was tempted to do it several times, but held back. Simon looked so tired, even while he was sleeping, he looked exhausted. She stood up and gently placed a kiss on his forehead, because she couldn't help herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back,\" she whispered to him. He actually mumbled something in his sleep that she couldn't quite understand and she gave his hand a squeeze before letting go. He didn't stir again and she laid her coat over the chair so if he woke up while she was gone, he'd at least know she was coming back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out into the hallway, she walked down the hospital wing and towards the waiting room, where she knew a coffee machine was calling her name. She'd had a long day and she was going to have a longer night because she'd already told the nursing staff that she wasn't leaving. Surprisingly, they agreed to let her stay and even offered for a cot to be brought to Simon's room. She hadn't understood their compliance or hospitality at first, but when the doctor had been in examining Simon, she didn't miss the way the man had referred to him as \"Big Cat\" on several occasions. It must be nice to have fans. She guessed Simon had already informed the doctors that she would be staying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiting room was remarkably empty. She got a coffee and grabbed a few packets of sugar, dumping them in without hesitation. As she sipped at the sugary, bitter drink, her phone went off. She grabbed it and flipped it open. \"Yeah?\" she barked into and winced slightly. God she was a bitch when she was tired and cranky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you with Simon?\" It was Jez and Vic sighed, taking a seat in one of the chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm at the hospital.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJez gave a relieved sigh on the other end as Vic took another sip. \"Good, stay with him. I think I know who did this to him. I think it was-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, the mafia.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Owl Shifter was quiet on the other end of the line and Vic had to supress a chuckle as she tried to picture the smaller girl's face. Jezibel had always prided herself  at being the one with information, being the one in the know. She scoffed. \"How did you know that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon told me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's awake?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic nodded, then realized the girl couldn't see her. \"Yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Victoria, have you ever heard of picking up the phone once in a while? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic shrugged. \"We were busy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was quick. Was he as good as you remembered?\" Vic could almost hear the naughty grin spreading onto the girl's face. She took another sip of her coffee to keep the colorful retort to herself. Jez laughed when she didn't answer right away. \"Okay, well tell him I said hello and that he needs to stop lying around. Oh, and keep an eye on him. If it really was the mafia and he cost them money, I doubt they're done yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic bristled at the words and her eyes involuntarily went to the exterior doors, like she was daring some mobsters to roll up with machine guns and try to start something. She'd rip all their fucking throats out. \"They won't touch him again,\" she said quietly into the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful, Vic,\" Jez said, her voice growing serious. \"He can't lose you again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain and guilt struck through her heart and she sat forward in her chair, letting her styrofoam cup dangle from her fingers, the coffee almost gone. \"He won't,\" she said, her voice catching on the lump in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll stop by in the morning.\" And with that, the girl hung up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic sat quietly in the waiting room for a moment, her phone in one hand and the coffee cup in another. She closed her eyes, processing it all. She'd thought there might still be a danger to Simon out there, when he'd first said who did it, she'd thought it. It only fueled her anger and hatred towards these people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, she realized she'd been gone from Simon's side for longer than she wanted to. She finished off her coffee and threw the cup in the trash, then headed back down the hallway to his room. As she entered, she stopped in the doorway, the unexpected visitor in the room stopping her in her tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vic tensed in the doorway, her eyes on the dark haired man standing over Simon's bed. The man's hand was running over Simon's head, barely touching the same black hair they both shared. Simon remained asleep, either oblivious of the touch or so tired he didn't care. Either way, she was happy he was asleep. She knew this wouldn't be pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexey,\" she said in response. The man smiled softly and looked up at her, withdrawing his hand from his brother's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise, surprise,\" he drawled to her. His voice was different. He'd gotten a slight accent in the two years he'd been apart from them. His face was colder, not the same she remembered on him. \"The bitch shows up after Simon's already in the hospital.\" She bristled at his words. She was right, this wouldn't be pleasant. \"Not like if you stuck around, none of this would of happened, or anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Vic, fuck you,\" he all but shouted. Simon shifted on the bed, his face turning towards Alexey as he responded to his brother's distress. The Fox Shifter reached out to put a hand on Simon's arm to settle him, but lowered his voice. \"You hurt him worse than these pricks ever could,\" he growls at her. \"So if you're back, you're back for good. Otherwise, I want you to leave right fucking now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic sighed, watched the younger man go off. She crossed her arms over her chest, raising an eyebrow. She knew Alexey was pissed at her. He had every right to be. Luckily, she also knew he was much easier to appease than his older brother. \"Are you done?\" she asked, a small smile quirking the side of her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey was quiet for a moment before his own lips quirked into a smile. \"Yeah, I think so. How was it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed at that. \"Did you practice that speech?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little. I had it much better in my head this morning when Jez called me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"No, no, you did good. Sounded like you were really mad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was mad,\" he let the smile fall from his face. \"I am mad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are.\" She moved forward into the room, coming to stand on the other side of Simon's bed. She reached out with a hand to brush his hair from his eyes, looking down at him. \"I'm not leaving him again, Alexey. I shouldn't have in the first place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey nodded. \"You're damn right, you shouldn't have.\" He too looked down at his brother. \"He was crushed, Vic. I didn't think...\" he trailed off a little. \"I was scared to let him out of my sight.\" He looked back up at her, his face a mixture of emotions. She cringed inwardly, trying to hide it from the younger man. How many times would she have to say she was sorry for the whole thing? Sorry she ever left in the first place? She didn't think there would ever be a time when she would say it enough. Even if she said it every fucking day of every fucking week from here on out - it wouldn't be enough. She could only make up for it now. Stay with them, protect them, make sure he was never hurt like that, or this, again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I hurt him,\" she whispered quietly, reaching out to touch the bandage wrapped around the length of Simon's right forearm. \"I'll make it up to him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey smiled at her. \"If you're here, and you're here to stay, you already have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so cheesy, Romanova.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snorted. \"And you're full of shit, but I still like ya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic laughed, looking away, her chest becoming tight as she realized it was just like old times again. She looked down at Simon's sleeping face, actually kind of surprised he was still asleep after the argument being had across his bed. It made her more determined. She reached out to touch his face again, her hands drawn to him. She needed to make sure he was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to kill them, Lex.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are,\" he replied simply. \"And I'm going to help you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be dangerous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey snorted. \"Vic, did you forget how awesome I am? I live for danger. No, no, I <i>am</i> danger. Danger is my middle name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like dumbass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low rumbling chuckle from Simon brought both of their attentions to him. He peeked open his eyes and looked between them both. \"Would you guys keep it down?\" he asked quietly, though there was a smile on his face. \"I'm working on my beauty sleep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey chuckled. \"Like that would help, Mr. Potato Head. You look awful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...whatever,\" Simon said, groggy from the drugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let that lame insult slip by, since you're concussed and drugged. But tomorrow you'd better come up with a really good one, or I'll laugh at you for getting your ass kicked by goons with the IQ of a ping pong ball.\" Alexey glanced back to Vic and she smiled between the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Simon repeated, closing his eyes again. \"Just shut up.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vic held the apartment door open for Simon as he walked gingerly into the room. She watched him closely, because even the walk from the parking complex to the elevator had worn him out. It would take a while for him to get his full stamina back, but she was certain she could help him with that. He'd only been released from the hospital that afternoon. Alexey had gone of with Jez to try and put a name to the \"mobster\" behind Simon's attack. Simon swore he didn't know who it was, they'd never told him their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he crossed the threshold into his apartment, Vic closed the door and looked around, first and foremost scanning the place for anyone who wasn't supposed to be there. Simon had told her that the guys who were behind this knew where he leaved and had even showed up here once. She'd been leary about even allowing him to come back here, but he'd insisted they would leave him alone. That they'd gotten their point across. Vic somehow doubted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simon made a beeline for the fridge, Vic moved into the living room, eyes scanning for danger. She continued down the hallway to Simon's study, the bathroom, then finally to his bedroom. She found the apartment to be empty of anyone meaning to do Simon harm. She relaxed a little and headed back to the kitchen area, stopping in the doorway to eye Simon as he pulled a sports drink from the fridge. He'd always been a health nut. It had drove her crazy sometimes because the stuff he ate and drank, she'd never be able to do it. She smiled as he took a swig of the drink and sighed contently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like what you did with the place,\" she said from the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon turned to look at her, smiling a bit as he reached out for a bowl he'd left out days ago on the counter. He tipped it towards him and made a face at the eco-system growing inside. Sighing, he turned to dump the dish into the sink and ran the water over it. \"Everything reminded me of you after you left,\" he said, his tone light and not accusing at all, but it still made her wince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take a shower,\" she said, to keep herself from apologizing again. Simon would get sick of hearing it. After a while, it would stop meaning anything. She's said it enough. She'd had to start showing her regret to him now, instead of using words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin spreading across his still bruised face, he turned to look at her. \"You want me to join you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to bed, Welsh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bed? I just got home!\" he called after her as she headed down the hallway towards the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say you had to go to sleep!\" she answered and grinned as she heard him laugh in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimons' shower always took a while to heat up, but Vic didn't mind. She kept the water cold and let it run over her. She placed her palms flat on the shower wall and leaned over, closing her eyes as the water ran over her head over her face, dripping off her nose. She breathed through her mouth and simply let her thoughts run. About Simon, about the people who'd put him in the hospital, about Alexey and Jez, about everything. She'd always found wisdom in Simon's shower, always. Being here felt like she was coming home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys who hurt Simon were dead men, of that much she was certain. There was no way she would let them go on living. Not when there was the possibility of them coming back and hurting him again. She would have to take the whole operation out. And if she was going to do that, she'd need firepower. Being a Shifter only went so far when you were up against guns and ammunition. She knew Alexey and Jez would help. She knew Simon would want to. She wasn't sure if she'd let him or not. Not yet. He was still injured and frail and in danger, to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was back at Simon's place and she'd told him she was here to stay, but she wasn't sure if she'd been lying or not. She liked to think she wasn't. She'd even been convinced she wasn't when she'd said it. But now, she wasn't sure. Love was the one thing in the world that terrified her. She wasn't sure she could do it right. She wasn't sure that she wouldn't hurt him again. The longer she stayed, the more damage she'd do if she left, which terrified her and made her want to kill the pricks who hurt him and then get out of dodge. She just wasn't sure if she had it in her to stay. But she could figure that out afterwards. She'd have to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic thought about all the things she'd done while she was gone and all the things she knew Simon had done in her absence. They'd lived two separate lives and that confused her. Because as long as she'd known Simon, even before they'd really known each other, she'd always thought of them as sharing a life. Sharing their memories. But now there was a two year gap. She didn't like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the water off, she stood and wiped her hands over her face to clear it of the water. She toweled off and pulled on her underwear and a t-shirt. She'd left clean clothes out in the apartment. As she exited the bathroom, she passed near the bedroom and peeked in. Simon was on the bed. He'd striped down to a t-shirt and a pair of boxers. He hadn't even managed to crawl under the covers before he'd passed out, face down, on the bed. She smiled to herself, watching him for a moment. He really should cover up, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she entered the bedroom and walked over to the bed. She crawled up onto it and kneeled next to him, leaning over him as she ran her hands through his hair. She could still feel the swollen bumps that were hidden beneath his black hair. \"Simon,\" she cooed, trying to wake him up enough to get him under the blankets. \"Come on, hun,\" she whispered, seeing him crush his eyes shut before they opened and he was blinking, trying to remember where he was. The doctors said this would be common for a while. He'd sleep heavier and become disoriented upon waking. It would pass within a week. \"Under the covers,\" she said, trying to tug on the comforter to pull it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised when Simon reached out to gently hold her wrist. He rolled over and pulled her with him. She caught herself, still aware of his bruised ribs, and leaned over him, her face near his. He smiled up at her. \"Did you use all the hot water?\" he asked, moving his head up to kiss her. She kissed him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said around his lips. \"Cold shower.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, babe,\" he chuckled. \"Why'd you go and do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Needed time to think,\" she said, moving her kisses across his cheek and to his neck. She moved her legs so she was straddling his waist. He grunted slightly as she jarred his ribs and she smiled apologetically at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned down at him and reached for the hem of his shirt. She pulled it up and off of him, throwing it to the ground. She stopped, however, as she looked back down at him. His chest was a mess. Dark purple and red and blue bruises still littered his sides and chest. It had started to fade to a sickly yellow at the edges, but they were still vivid and horrifying on him. She let her hands come down and trace the outlines. A couple even had the nerve to take on the shape of a fist. She tried to remain calm, finding solace in the face that whoever did this wouldn't live to see the end of the week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About you,\" she said, her fingers coming up to trace a new scar that was long since healed, but she'd never seen before, just below his right breast. \"Where is this from?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon lifted his head, grunting at the pain it caused his abdoment. He smiled and looked up at her. \"Unsanctioned blow in a fight. Won me the match. Was a spider shifter, disgusting bastard.\" Vic smiled back at him and then grabbed the hem of her own shirt and lifted it off of her head. She found him frowning afterwards. 'Vic...\" he trailed off, looking a little apprehensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and leaned over him, so her breasts were pressed against his chest. He gave a small sound of discomfort at the jarring out his wounds and she went back to kissing his neck. \"I'll be gentle,\" she whispered into his ear. She felt Simon's hands come up and trace multiple scars along her back and near her hips. She had too many new ones, she knew. Death matches didn't spare her injuries like sanctioned fights did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to be,\" he said back to her, pressing his cheek against hers. She laughed. \"Are you just doing this because you missed me?\" he asked quietly as she reached to pull his boxers away. He let her lead and take charge. She crawled back up the bed, feeling his thumbs hook into the waist of her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said sternly, kissing him fiercely. \"I told you. I love you. I want to show you how much I love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon let out a small groan as her found it's way down to him. He tugged at her underwear. \"I love you too, Vic,\" he whispered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then show me, Welsh,\" she growled and snapped her jaws at his neck. He laughed, wrapping his arms around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic didn't know what woke her, but for a moment she forgot where she was. His apartment was so different from the last time she'd been there. She lay on her side in the bed, facing the wall. She panicked a moment, not knowing why, and turned to look over her shoulder. Simon lay on the bed next to her. His chest slowly and steadily rising and falling. It had been rough, it had been long, and it had been the best fuck she'd had in a long time. She hadn't gone easy on him, but in all fairness, he hadn't gone easy on her either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back around, she looked around the room, trying to figure out what woke her up. She glanced to the clock. It was four in the morning and still dark out. She lay still and listened. That's when she heard it again. A small crash out in the kitchen. A dish clinking or a glass breaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled deep in her throat, her mind reeling with who the fuck could be in Simon's apartment. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Climbing out of bed, she headed for the dresser near the window, hoping Simon hadn't changed too much in the two years she'd been away. Judging by his prowess in bed, he hadn't. He'd always been and always would be the best she ever had. Pulling clothes to the side and scrounging through one drawer and then the other, she was ready to turn around and cuss Simon out, but stopped when she found what she was looking for. The gun was tucked into his sock drawer. She pulled it out, checked the clip, and found it was loaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder, she frowned when she saw Simon hadn't stirred from all the commotion. That in itself told her everything she needed to know about how Simon was healing. It was slow going. Because he had feline DNA in him and even before he'd gotten the panther in him, he'd been a light sleeper. She'd never been able to sneak out on him without him knowing. That's how she'd actually gotten to say goodbye last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctors told her that sleeping and waking would be ten times harder than normal. They'd used the word brain trauma and Vic had shut them up at that and told them to fuck themselves and just tell her when he'd be okay again. They said \"probably a week\" and she'd flipped them off and went to get Simon ready to come home. It wasn't the doctors she was mad at, but she had no one else to carry out her anger on at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the safety off the gun, she gave one last glance to Simon, still asleep on the bed, and moved to the door. Silently, she checked the hallway and the bathroom for intruders and found none there. She crept down the hallway, keeping herself low to the ground and against the wall as she did so. She could hear someone moving around in the kitchen. The fridge door opened and closed, then some cupboards. She heard the sink being turned on and off. What the fuck were they doing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning against the wall, she moved ever so slightly so she could get a look into the kitchen. The lights weren't turned on and in the dark she could see a figure standing with his back towards her. He was leaning over the counter next to the sink. She aimed her gun out, slowly rose to a standing position, and moved forward with silent footfalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fucking move,\" she said in a low voice and took pleasure in seeing the figure stiffen. She thought about just shooting, just firing the gun and being done with it, but the thought that this person could lead her to Simon's attackers kept her from doing so. \"Turn around,\" she commanded. \"Slowly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it when you get bossy,\" the figure said and Vic frowned. She knew that voice. Quickly moving to the lightswitch, she flipped it on and watched as the figure relented to her request. Her eyes widened as she saw who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sung?\" she asked in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tiger Shifter grinned, holding a bowl of cereal in his hands. He took a spoonful and brought it to his mouth, speaking with his mouth full. \"You're boyfriends got a nice pad,\" he said, looking around the room, his eyes coming back to the gun and he tilted his head at her, giving her a <i>come on</i> sort of look. She lowered the gun, but kept her finger on the trigger, just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing here?\" she demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung took another bite of cereal before he answered. Vic thought he did it just to piss her off because she hated when he spoke with his mouth full. It reminded her too much of Alexey. \"Well I was looking for a beer, but your boyfriend's a bit of a health nut, eh? I mean, come on, Grape Nuts? That's old man food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not my boyfriend,\" she said automatically and tried to keep the wince from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung raised a brow at her. \"Oh really? Then what is he?\" Now that was a good question. She chose to ignore it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sung, what the <i>fuck</i> are you doing here?\" she asked again, tightening her grip slightly on the gun. There were a million possibilities running through her head and not a one of them were pleasant. She'd fought her match before coming, she hadn't been signed up to fight anymore, so what the hell was he after? He wouldn't just chase her around the world to congratulate her on fight well won. No, he wanted some. Or rather, his bosses wanted something. Sung was just a Keeper. He wasn't the one calling the shots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Sung set the cereal bowl down into the sink and actually had the deceny to rinse it out. He dried off his hands on the kitchen towel and turned to lean agains the counter, crossing his arms over his chest. He looked nonchalant and mellow. But she could see the tense muscles in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you,\" he said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sung,\" she spat out at him, not in the mood for his jokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up a hand before she could chew him out. \"Okay, okay. Can you just...put the gun down? I'm a messenger and we all know what happens to the messengers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, fine, straight to the point, I like that in a girl.\" He jumped up onto the counter and swung his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will put a fucking bullet in each of your knees if you don't tell me, right now, why the fuck you're here.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vic rolled over and ran her head down the side of Simon's cheek, trying to rouse him. \"Simon,\" she whispered, aware of the urgency in her voice. Apparently, Simon caught on to it too, because he frowned and rolled his head towards her, moaning slightly. \"Shh, Simon, wake up,\" she said, keeping her hands by his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vic, what-\" he said groggily, but she moved his hand to cover his mouth. That seemed to clear the cobwebs in his head real quick and he looked up at her with wide eyes. She tried to offer him a reassuring smile, but she'd already slipped into guarded mode. Whoever was out there, she would <i>not</i> let them get to Simon. Whatever the cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon, shh,\" she said, keeping her hand over his mouth. \"There's someone in the apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, there was another crash that resonated out from the depth of the apartment. This time it sounded as if it were coming from the living room instead of the kitchen. She growled low in her throat, they were looking for something. Rolling away from Simon, she found her underwear and t-shirt and quickly threw them on. She stood at the side of the bed, trying to peek out of the doorway and into the hallway. There was no one there. She turned to look at Simon and paused. He had managed to get into a seated position on the edge of the bed and was finishing pulling on his boxer briefs. She held her breath when she saw that the dark and vivid bruising that had lined his chest and stomach also circled and covered his back. There were several new scratches that led sideways by his shoulders. She'd given him those just hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon-\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already knew what she wanted. \"There's a baseball bat under the bed,\" he said and she nodded, but watched him try to stand. He failed his first attempt, waivering on his feet and falling back to the bed. But the second attempt fared better and he stood, hand coming to his head as he turned and headed towards the closet. She didn't wait to see what he was fetching as she bent down and pulled the baseball bat from beneath the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice that called out from the hallway was something completely unexpected. \"Welsh, we know you're in here.\" It was sing-song and deep and it made Vic shudder. She leapt to the corner of the room, just behind the door and looked over at Simon, who emerged from the closet with a golf club in one hand. His eyes were wide and that was all she needed to tell her that he recognized the voice. She swallowed thickly and looked at her. She put a finger to her lips and motioned for him to get back into the closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated at first and she nearly growled at him, but then he slipped back behind the doors and she steadied herself, gray and white fur already appearing over top of her skin as she shifted into her wolf form, tighetning her grip on the bat. She waited and her wolf hearing could pick up the footfalls of someone coming down the hallway, heading towards the bedroom. She grit her canine teeth and tensed her muscles, ready to jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the bedroom creaked open and she saw the gun enter the room first. It was all she needed. They weren't here to talk. They weren't here to kick someone around. They were here to kill. And she'd be damned if she let that happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriking quickly, she brought the bat down onto the arm holding the gun. The scream resonated through the bedroom and she didn't give the attacker time to finish it as she threw the bat to the side and grabbed the arm, flinging him into the room and onto the bed. She leapt onto him and was actually mildly surprised when he started shifting. Horns sprouted on his head and his muscles seemed to triple in size. A freaking Bull shifter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted her off of him and easily flung her across the room. She managed to rake her claws up his arm and gave a gratified growl as she felt them snag on the exposed bone in the arm she'd broken with the bat. He gave a raging and painful yell as she landed near the window to the bedroom somewhat gracefully. She crouched low and brought her head up, ready to get back into the action, but she froze as she saw a second attacker in the doorway, and who he had his gun aimed at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon had come out of the closet as the sounds of the struggle. He didn't see the second attacker in the doorway. And as the gun fired, Vic screamed out of fear and rage and terrifying, dehabilitating anguish as she could almost picture the bullet ripping through his head and spraying the wall and the room with blood and brain matter and bone. But that didn't happen. Instead, a dart exited the gun and Simon only gave a sudden gasp as it entered his neck. His hand weakly came up to grasp it and pull it out of his skin. He already started to stagger on his feet, the golf club dropping from his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon!\" Vic screamed, her voice deep and animalistic in her wolf form. She watched as he turned his eyes to her. The motion and the drugs now coursing through his system sent him off balance and he teetered a bit before collapsing to the ground, blinking owlishly as he still watched her. There was an apology in his eyes and she fucking hated that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowling in anger, she tore her eyes from his prone form on the ground and leapt at the man in the doorway. She barely felt the dart enter her back, having dismissed the Shifter on the bed as not being a threat. She managed to slice open the man in the doorway before she felt the darkness and the stars and the the world spin around her. She fellt to the floor, covered in a strange man's blood. Her head lolled to the side and her eyes sought out Simon, who hadn't moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon...\" she pleaded. Not for him to help her, but for him to forgive her. She'd failed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fuckers had cheated.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking was slow. It came gradually. The first thing she realized was that there was a gag in her mouth. She tried to reach up and withdraw the cloth, but then found out her hand were tied to the arms of a chair. That notion alone was enough to clear the cobwebs in her head and force her to open her eyes. Her head was pounding but she couldn't remember hitting it. It felt like a bad hangover, many of which she'd had throughout her days. But never before had she woken up gagged and tied to a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned and closed her eyes. But when a groan responded to her own, she quickly opened them and whipped her head up to look at the source of the sound. Her eyes widened and it all came back to her. Simon. She'd been with Simon in his apartment. Someone had come in. They'd been tranquilized. And now, she was bound and gagged and sitting across from her, so was Simon. Anger spiked through her as she found new wounds on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was tied more than she was. Whereas her arms were tied to the arms of her chair, his were bound behind his back, with a rope tied to the supports on the bottom of his chair. His ankles were bound to the legs of the chair and he had duct tape over his mouth instead of a soft gag. He was still in his boxer briefs. His knees were both skinned and she imagined whoever had done this hadn't been as gentle getting Simon in here as they were with her. Not to mention the new cuts on his chest, which had bled and dripped down his abdomen. His face, if possible, looked more bruised than it had before and the old cut on his eyebrow had been reopened. Dammit, it looked like he'd woken up and put up a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the gag, she tried to say his name. His eyes rose to meet hers and she could see the utter exhaustion and pain there. She growled deep in her throat. She began working her hands back and forth up the length of the arm chairs, feeling the ropes rub into her wrists but not caring. They needed to get out of here - wherever here was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door to the dark room opened and Vic had to blink against the sudden light, but she focued quickly on the three figures who'd entered. One was the Bull Shifter from the apartment, his arm in a cast. The other two she didn't recognize. There was a smaller one trailing behind, holding an uzi, which really dampened her spirits. The third man was wearing a suit and was incredibly clean cut. He was older, mid fifties probably. He looked like he was in charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Wolfe,\" the man in the suit said and his voice was smooth and calm and she didn't like it one fucking bit. Nor the fact that he knew her name. She watched as he came over to her and the Bull Shifter walked over to Simon while the little dude stood guard in the doorway. \"I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic had a colorful retort for the fancy pants man, but the gag stopped it from coming out. She just glared at him. But they weren't allowed to continue their conversation as the Bull Shifter suddenly and without provocation, backhanded Simon, hard. Simon's head whipped to the side, blood splattering the ground from the heavily bleeding cut on his eyebrow. Vic growled and tried to rise to go to him. Simon hadn't made a sound and he bowed his head, swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" the suited man said. \"Is that necessary?\" The Bull Shifter turned to look at him, then submissively took a step away from Simon. Vic breathed a small sigh of relief. The man turned back to her and smiled warmly. She wanted to wipe that smile off his fugly face. He squated down in front of her just watched her a moment. \"Do you know who I am?\" he asked after a moment. Vic gave him a look and all he had to do was nod his head before the Bull Shifter came over and pulled the gag from Vic's mouth. \"Let's try again,\" he said, chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic didn't answer, just spit on him. \"Fuck yourself,\" she said afterwards. The Bull behind her grabbed a fist full of her hair and pulled her head back violently. She couldn't help but cry out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop,\" the suited man said and she was let go. She turned around to glare at the Shifter behind her. The touch of a hand on her thigh had her whirling her head back around, though. She forgot that she was only in her panties and a t-shirt. Fucker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me,\" she growled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled. \"I can't help myself,\" he drawled. \"You are very beautiful.\" His eyes went to the patch over her eye. \"Despite your flaws. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" she demanded, deciding to change tactics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to rub her thigh for a moment, moving his hand higher and higher until it came to her hip and around to her back. She suppressed a shiver at the unwanted touching. He looked up at her, grinning, and ignored her question. \"Mr. Welsh is a lucky man to have found a woman like you,\" he said and stood up. He brought his hand to her chin and tilted her head up, running his thumb along her jaw. She jerked her head away, but he caught her chin in a violent hold. \"Does he fuck you like you want to be fucked?\" he asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic heard Simon say something muffled. It didn't sound pleasant. She ignored the man's question, not giving in to his stupid mind games, although she knew there was a distinct possibility this man would be capable of getting, or doing, whatever he wanted to her. Like hell she'd let him do it without a fight, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" she repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Strong willed, I like that.\" He let go of her and walked away, heading towards Simon. Shit, that wasn't the way she wanted him to go. \"Well, I <i>did</i> want something out of Mr. Welsh here for a while. But he didn't follow through on our little bargain.\" The man's hand came to Simon's shoulder and she saw him tense. His eyes darted to her for a moment and she read fear in them, which is something she didn't often see coming from him. \"So I think I'm done with him.\" He nodded to the little guy at the door and the guy pointed his gun, straight at Simon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Vic screamed, trying again to come out of her seat. \"Please!\" she begged, her heart pounding so heavily in her chest she thought she'd pass out right there and then. She couldn't fucking lose Simon, not now, not after she just got him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man held up his hand, stalling the execution. Simon had gone white, but a look of anger had settled itself onto his face. He was getting pissed. \"No? What, do you think there is something you could offer me that will save Mr. Welsh's life? I have no use for him. I have no qualms with killing him where he sits.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do anything,\" Vic grit out. \"Just, please, don't hurt him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I wanted to hear.\" </span></div></div>",

It hurt to think that he'd hide something from her, but she had to remind herself that she'd walked out on him without so much as a look back. It would probably take a long, long while before the trust was back. She'd hurt him and she knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand came up to weakly brush through the hair hanging over her shoulder. He looked her in the eyes. \"Vic, I-\" Whatever he was about to confess or tell her was cut off when a familiar and distinct voice sounded from the doorway of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not welcome here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic saw Simon flinch and it confused her at first. The voice was enough to make anyone flinch, sure. But Simon's eyes had held fear for a moment as they darted towards the door. And Vic had only ever seen him express anger, frustration, betrayal and love towards his mother. Never fear. What was worse, she couldn't tell if it was just because he'd been beaten within an inch of his life or because something else entirely. It sent every protective instinct of her on edge and she gave his hand a squeeze before she leaned back and hopped off the bed. She turned to eye the woman standing in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie Welsh was the epitome of a rich bitch. She kept her hair died an unnatural blonde color. She'd had work done on her face to keep her looking young, but Vic thought it just kept her looking dehydrated. She wore a fancy blue dress suit with skirt and a hat that was too big to be from this century. She held sunglasses in her gloved hands and there was a fur scarf around her neck. Vic hated the woman to the core of her very being. Back in the day, she'd thought about putting a hit out on her more than once. But being Simon's mother, Vic had restrained herself. As much as Simon may get frustrated and want to cut her out of his life, she was still his mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny,\" Vic forced a smile onto her face. \"I could say the same to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman huffed and waved her sunglasses at Vic. \"You get out of this room or I will call security.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic made an overexaggerated roll of her eyes at the threat. \"Go ahead. I'm sure they wouldn't mind escorting you off the property.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie bristled and yelled, \"You little bitch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a comeback on the tip of Vic's tongue, waiting to come out, but Simon's quiet, \"Mom,\" from his bed was enough to bring both their attention to him. Vic frowned. He looked ten times more tired than he had been only moment ago. She cursed herself for not calling the doctor in to take a look at him. She thought about going now to do it, but there was no fucking way she was leaving Simon alone with his mother. He was practically defenseless. Not that she ever thought Sophie would hurt her son, on purpose that is. There were ways family could hurt each other without drawing blood. Sophie was damn good at that kind of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boy,\" She cooed and purposely shoved Vic out of the way to come to Simon's side. Vic let her get away with it, because she wasn't going to drop an old lady in the middle of the god damn hospital. She took a few steps back, standing at the end of Simon's bed as Sophie took her spot by him. Simon's eyes met Vic's for a moment and an apology passed between them before Sophie was reaching out to touch Simon's face. He winced as she didn't go easy in her examination over him. Vic gripped the end of the bed until she was white knuckled, managing to keep a growl deep in her throat. She really fucking hated Sophie Welsh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Mom,\" Simon said. Vic wanted to reach out and slap them both. She hated this. She hated how Simon turned submissive around his mother, because he wasn't submissive. Not the way his mother made him be. And as Vic watched, she realized it must have gotten worse while she was away, because Sophie stood back and put her hands on her hips and Simon looked like he'd just gotten kicked while he was down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What good did all those years of practice do if you're just going to let a bunch of hooligans jump you on the way home from a bar?\" she demanded, her voice scolding and piercing and entirely unneeded at the moment. She didn't give him time to answer. \"And what good is having animal genes if you don't use them. I'm disappointed. I thought you were better than, this.\" She waved a hand near over his face, gesturing to the bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who did this, Sophie?\" Vic asked, trying to draw attention away from Simon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie turned and let out a snarl. It was very feral for someone with no animal genes. \"Why are you still here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you,\" Sophie snapped at Simon, who sighed and seemed to settle into the bed, defeated. Vic could see his eyes droop a little and he brought a hand to his face, feeling the bruises and wounds there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll get the doctor,\" Vic growled, bringing both of their attentions to her. She smiled at Simon, who returned it gratefully. Then she glared at Sophie, who did the same, before she left to get the doctor. </span></div></div>",

She'd called Jezibel as soon as the pilot had announced their arrival and the use of cell phones. Jez had told her the hospital wasn't allowing visitors. Simon had gotten worse. He was in ICU and he was limited to only a few hours a day of visitation for as long as he stayed in the intensive care. She thought about going to the hospital anyway. She could scale the walls, climb in through a window, kill a few doctors, no big deal. But Jez talked her out of it. Told her to find a motel somewhere and get some rest. Simon would still be here in the morning. They both knew that could be a lie as soon as she'd said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His heart stopped. They had to put him on life support.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played the words over in her mind. He'd died. He'd fucking died on her. She'd have to kill him later for doing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he was getting worse, instead of better, didn't slip pass Vic unnoticed, either. A part of her had hoped he'd be awake when she landed in the States. She hoped he'd be up and at 'em when she got to the hospital. She hoped he'd smile and say something funny and witty and make her angry and happy all at the same time. But it didn't look like it was going to work out that way. Nothing ever worked out the way she planned these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a motel in New York that seemed to suit her. She didn't have a lot of cash on her and she didn't keep credit cards, they were too easy to track. There was one place she could go and she hoped that he hadn't changed the locks on her while she was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's apartment building was looking a lot better and less \"hell-hole\"-ish than the last time she'd seen it. Someone had put a lot of money into the building to fix it up and it actually looked decent. The smile that crept across her face was barely contained as she entered through the familiar doorway. She paused a moment to look at the names on the mailboxes, just to make sure that he still live here. Sure enough, apartment 305, Welsh was scribbled onto a torn up sticky note and stuffed beneath the plastic cover. Her hand written had been better back then, even if she'd put it in there out of anger. He'd always been lazy and bad about taking care of small household chores like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing the stairs, because she still didn't trust the elevator in the building, no matter how nice it looked now, she reached the third floor and made her way down the hallway. Last apartment on the right. A corner apartment. Two hundred bucks more a month than other apartments, but not as much as the penthouse. They'd always talked about moving into the penthouse together. She closed her eyes as she reached his door. For a moment, she wanted to turn around and run straight to the hospital and demand to see him, demand to make sure that he was still fucking breathing even if it was with the aide of a tube and a machine. She wanted to touch him, to smell him. She just wanted him, god dammit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic's thoughts were stilled as she heard noise come from within the apartment. She was part way shifted even before she threw the door open with a crash and lunged inside. Her eyes caught a man standing in the kitchen, with the refrigerator door open. He whirled on her and she froze, recognizing him instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey had a beer in one hand and a half eaten sub in the other. His mouth was full and his hair was pulled back in a tight pony-tail and he looked years older yet more immature than the last time she'd seen him. Surprise etched into his face and it would have been comical if the situation hadn't been so dire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the food in his mouth, Alexey set his food down and narrowed his eyes at her. \"About time you showed up,\" he said, leaning against the counter in his typical swagger type of way. \"Simon's only been unconscious a day and a half. No need to rush or anything. Not like he means anything to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething snapped insider her at the words. Something that had been bending and bursting and festering within her and at those words, it exploded. She leapt across the counter in one fluid motion, shifting completely as she brought her fists to meet him. His surprise turning to utter shock at the motion and he cried out as she slammed into him, shoving him up against the counter, one hand wrapped around his throat, her claws digging slightly into his skin. She lifted him off the ground. \"Fuck you!\" she screamed at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed and white fur sprouted on him instantly in a defense mechanism. He shifted easily within her grasp and with the agility she'd always known him to have, he twisted his body up so his legs wrapped around her. He reached out and slapped her across the face. She fell backwards, letting go of his neck. He flipped, gracefully, over the counter and ducked down low, gauging to see if she'd come after him again. She whirled on him, unable to keep the tears from coming as she shifted back, her wolf form disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got here as fast as I could,\" she cried softly, feeling a tear slip out of her eye and down her cheek, still smarting from his slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey's eyes widened a little and he stood, shifting himself back as well. He looked a little confused at her reaction. He reached a hand up to rub at his neck. \"Well fuck, Vic,\" he said, looking at her. \"Don't pull out the damn tears. You know I fucking hate it when you cry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never seen me cry,\" she growled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused a moment to think about it, then shrugged. \"Guess your right, still doesn't change anything.\" He hesitated a moment before he moved forward, still agile even in his fully human form, to wrap an arm around her. \"Good to see you, Bitchzilla.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic let out a small laugh at the nickname. She hadn't heard it in forever. He'd always called her that. Then Simon was supposed to punch him in the arm, brotherly and lovingly. She threw the punch, weakly, for their missing family member. \"You too, you little shit.\" She pulled back and looked up at him. \"What do you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey sighed and let his arm drop from her. \"We're gonna need something harder than beer.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Turns out the only hard liquor Simon had in his apartment was blackberry brandy. Vic decided she'd rib him about it if he woke up. Correction, <i>when</i> he woke up. She hadn't really expected anything less from him, though. Simon Welsh had never been much of a drinker. He stuck mostly to beer and, on occasion, wine when he was trying to be sophisticated and classy. It didn't happen often, but his mother seemed to like it when he drank chardonay instead of Pabst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey poured them both a tall glass of the putrid drink and then pulled a stool to the other side of the counter island in Simon's apartment. He sat down and raised his glass to toast her. There was a goofy, giddy look on his face and she couldn't help but smile as she raised her glass, clinked it with his, and they both gagged on the girly liquor. Vic wondered if Simon kept the alcohol around only to please his mother. Probably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" She repeated as she placed her glass down, looking up at Alexey. He was staring at his glass, licking his lips as if he was trying to rid himself of the taste in his mouth. But she caught the far away look in his eyes and the small sigh that escaped his lips. It did nothing to calm her down. Because as long as she'd known Alexey, she'd never known him to look so...lost. Or worried. Or whatever hell other emotions were on his face that she couldn't read. Seeing him without a grin or no jokes escaping that dumb mouth of his - it wasn't natural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon's a dick, that's what happened,\" he growled suddenly and brought his glass up to take another long swig. He finished it off and then shoved the glass aside, leaning heavily onto the counter as he finally rose his eyes to meet hers. They lingered a bit on the eyepatch over her eye and she gave him time to take it in, almost daring him to ask her how she got it. But he didn't bring it up, instead looking at her good eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted and took another sip, her nose turning up, before she pushed it away and stood back. She didn't want to sit. She'd been sitting for so long on the airplane. \"I know he's a dick,\" she said. \"But that doesn't explain why he's in the hospital.\" She paused long enough for Alexey to smirk. \"What happened?\" she asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand over his face, Alexey looked tired suddenly. She imagined him getting the call, probably the same way she'd gotten one. How long did it take to get from Russia to the States? She wondered if he'd even still been in Russia. He was the last time she'd been there, that's why she'd left. She hadn't kept in touch with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fucking Lyle,\" Alexey spat, the venom and hatred in his voice slipping out when he said the other Shifter's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise registered on her face and she felt her heart skip a beat for a moment. \"Tex?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking Liddle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time Victoria had seen Lyle Fucking Liddle, he'd been lazing at work and throwing spitballs into the garbage can while Jezibel was going off on some rant about their last job. It had been the day before she'd left and she'd paid just enough attention to the Viper Shifter to observe he looked bored before she'd walked over to Simon and told him she wanted to come over that night. She'd wanted to say goodbye. She hadn't bothered with a goodbye to Lyle. She'd never really liked the slimey bastard, and sure as hell didn't trust him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out she had been right not to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex,\" she said the name again and Alexey nodded, quirking a small smile despite himself. He must have known where she was going with this. \"Fucking Lyle Liddle put Simon in the hospital?\" she was having trouble picturing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey straightened a little, a snort escaping his mouth. \"He's not the same,\" he said. \"Lyle, not Simon. Simon's...pretty much the same bastard you left two years ago.\" She tried not to be hurt by the statement. \"But Lyle, he went rogue. And he must have some serious fucking backing because he broke his contract and the Big Bosses just let him walk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic worried her bottom lip at that. Contracts were serious business in Shifter world. You didn't break them and keep breathing free air. Everything came with a price. You either wound up in some lab somewhere or in jail or six feet under. Those were the options. You didn't just break a contract and do whatever the hell you wanted. Unless someone bought you out. She frowned and Alexey must have seen it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think too hard, you might hurt yourself. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" she said half heartedly as her mind continued to work. She raised an eyebrow at him though. \"How'd he get the drop on Simon? And why? They always got along.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey shrugged. \"Don't know why he did it. And I don't know how either. Simon's good, Vic.\" He didn't have to tell her that. She knew how good Simon was. He was one of the best fighters she'd ever seen. He'd beat her once, in a caged match. He used to like to rub it in, until she'd beat him back. Not in a cage match. \"I can't picture Lyle ever winning against him. But it was him. There were witnesses. And the way they talk..\" He trailed off shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Lexey?\" she asked. She leaned forward to try to catch his eye. \"Tell me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated a second. \"I don't know. It's like he was suped up on something. Made him faster and bigger and...I don't know. I want to kill him, Vic.\" He'd slipped the last part out, like it wasn't something he had meant to admit, but he looked at her with such earnest eyes that she knew he meant it. Hell, she felt the same way. If Lyle really did put Simon in the hospital, there was no way she'd let him get away with it. She wanted an explanation. And after she got one, she'd gut the bastard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at Alexey. \"Me too.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They'd shared another drink, had gone into Simon's living room and watched the Kung-Fu movie he had in his VCR - god he was so old fashioned - and then Vic couldn't deny how tired she was. After telling Alexey to fuck off after he offered to keep her warm in the bed, she'd closed the door to Simon's bedroom and had stared at the room as Alexey found a spot on the couch. It was like a foreign country to her, one she somewhat remembered, but couldn't quite recall how to navigate. He'd gotten a new comforter. She'd told him for a long time he needed a new one. She'd tell him again when she saw him, because this one was ugly. He'd rearranged the room, the dresser was on the opposite side. Clothes were strewn about the bedroom and she was reminded what a slob he could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she climbed onto the bed, she lowered herself face down into the familair feel of it. Her face buried into one of the pillows and she inhaled deeply. It smelled of him. She kicked off her jeans and pulled off her shirt and cozied herself beneath the covers, hugging one of the pillows to her chest, trying not to pretend it was him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have been tired. Sleep came quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe street corner was foreign to her. She couldn't remember how she got here and it took just a moment to realize she must be dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned at the voice and there, walking up the street, pausing beneath a streetlight to peel gum off his shoe, was Simon. And damn he looked good. He was dressed up for something. Nothing fancy. Just a nice shirt and a pair of jeans that made him look more cowboy than street fighter. His signature work boots were his pride and joy and it was no wonder he hated it when he stepped in something that had no right being on the ground. Fucking teenagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack came out of nowhere and Vic was frozen in place, unable to stop it, forced to be a bystander to the crime. She wanted to scream. She wanted to run in there and pull Simon away. But she was dreaming. And there was no stopping what was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle jumped from the roof of a building like some god damn super hero monkey man. Only scales covered his body and a wild snaked tongue trailed to the side as he hissed his assault. He looked bigger than she remembered. He looked more monster than she knew him to be. Alexey's voice came to her mind. <i>It's like he was suped up on something.</i> Suped up, more like he was juiced up on steroids - a shit ton of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked up in time to let out a startled gasp as the Viper Shifter landed on top of him, sending him to the ground. He was shifting even as he whirled, trying to gain his feet back. Maybe he didn't think Lyle was really going to hurt him, because he didn't move as quickly as she knew he could. Maybe he thought this was a prank or a joke. But the cry he emitted when Lyle's snake fangs entered his shoulder was not a joke. It shook Vic to the core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Viper Shifter had Simon pinned beneath him. He aimed punch after punch to Simon's face. The Panther Shifter's struggles were growing weaker and weaker, not all from the punches. The venom coursing through his veins slowed and numbed him. She heard bones crunch. She saw blood spill. The beating Simon was taking was horrific. And Lyle carried on, eyes narrowed and focused on the feline. Simon shifted back somewhere around the ninth punch to the face. His arms fell limp to his side. He jerked with each additional punch, but he'd stopped struggling a while ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle screamed into the night air suddenly and stood, giving Simon several kicks to the side for good measure. Then, the Viper Shifter was scaling the wall and he was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Simon was bleeding and broken on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic wanted to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up quickly in bed, she wasn't sure at first if she'd actually screamed outloud. But as Alexey came barging into the bedroom with a spatula in one hand, she knew that she had. His eyes darted around the room, scanning for an enemy or an attacker. When he didn't find any, he looked back to her, lowering his cooking utensil weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vic?\" he asked, looking frazzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at him for a moment, frowning as she tried to catch her breath and stop herself from shaking. She glanced to the clock. It was morning. They could go and visit Simon soon. The smell of bacon and eggs filtered in through the open door and she reached a hand up to run it over her face. \"Shit,\" she growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey snorted and Vic wanted to punch him. She would have, if he wasn't across the room. Bastard probably knew that too. \"Bad dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I got a girlfriend to do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic looked at him curiously after that, raising an eyebrow. \"You do?\" she asked, somewhat surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey grinned and it looked so much like Simon when he did that Vic felt pain strike at her heart, the blood and violence of her dream flashing through her mind again. \"Sure do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left hands don't count as girlfriends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laugh that emitted from his voice sounded good and calmed her. He shook his spatula at her. \"Get dressed. I made your favorite. Jez called and we're leaving in fifteen minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic frowned. She hadn't heard the phone ring. She must have really been tired. \"And?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"What did she say? Is he awake?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey grinned. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The drive to the hospital was too slow for Vic's liking. She'd threatened to rip Alexey's throat out if he didn't pick up the pace. He'd complied, not wanting to test the validity of her threats. She was out of the car before he had it fully in park. He had to run to keep up with her as she entered the elevator, smashing the button fifteen times to get the doors to close faster. Vic ignored the dumbass grin on Alexey's face, her thoughts completely on Simon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the sweetest words she'd ever heard in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator doors opened, she bolted out. Completely bypassing the reception desk, she ran down the corridor and nearly collided with Jez as she was exiting Simon's room. Vic took a deep breath, looking at the petite blonde woman a moment. Jez looked somewhat startled to see her, but then gave little warning before she leapt forward and wrapped Vic in a rough hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Vic, it's so good to see you!\" she said, giving her a tight squeeze. Vic returned the favor lightly before pulling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is he?\" she demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJez didn't look offended. She seemed to understand. It made Vic cringe a little. Because that kind of understanding was not something you just packed your shit up and ran away from for two years without a word. That kind of understanding was reserved for the deepest of family ties. It made Vic want to hug her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's resting,\" she said, smiling as Alexey finally caught up, having fended off the angry nurses Vic's wild dash through the hospital had created. Vic didn't miss the way his hand entwined Jez's. She looked at the both of them, sure that <i>that</i> hadn't been there before. She'd have to ask later through, because Jez's words decided her actions before she did. \"You can go see him though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at Alexey, who waved her into the room, bringing an arm up to wrap around Jez's shoulder. Yeah, she'd have to ask them later. \"Go ahead. I'll take sloppy seconds,\" he winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thankful nod, she entered Simon's hospital room and immediately froze. All of her hurry and rush to see him seemed to melt away. She almost wanted to turn around and leave again, because looking at him, lying there asleep, with all those tubes and all those bruises and his arm in a sling - she wanted to run away all over again. But she knew it wouldn't erase the hurts. She knew it wouldn't take his bandages away. Alexey had informed her of his injuries, but she still wasn't ready for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's head was wrapped in gauze. His messy dark hair poked through the white bandages in spots. He'd had a severe concussion and bleeding in his brain, which was what had induced the coma. The gauze came down and around his chin. His face was bruised and swollen. One eye was swollen completely shut, a blow to the head had broken his left cheekbone. A single laceration across his nose told her it had been broken, but not shattered. It would heal. Purple bruises spread out along his chin and down his neck. He was slightly propped up on the bed. His right arm was in a sling and she could see bandages poking out from beneath his hospital gown. His arm wasn't broken, but there had been large puncture wounds in his shoulder and he needed to not move his arm. Three broken ribs were hidden by the gown. There were wires and IVs connected to his free arm, which was just as bruised and lacerated as his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing thickly, she realized her dream probably hadn't been that far off. She'd seen Simon beat up before. It came with being a cage fighter. She'd visited him in the hospital before too. But none of them, absolutely none of them, had been this bad. The one that came closest was four years ago when he'd taken a fall off of a scaffolding. They'd thought he'd broken his back. Turns out cats really do have nine lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fact for which she was so grateful for as she stood in his hospital room now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to be running out of lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving slowly to the end of his bed, she stared down at him. The closer she got, the heavier the air in the room was. Her eye darted to the flowers and cards littering the room. Fans, family - they'd all sent him things. There were probably more out there that the nurses couldn't fit in. Simon had a big fanbase. She'd heard of his fame even in China. At one of the matches she'd fought, she had nearly died of shock when her opponent had come out wearing a t-shirt with Simon's scripted catch phrase on it. It read, \"Big Cat's gonna bring tha pain!\" She hated that catch phrase. And she'd never actually heard him say it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding around the side of his bed, she stood at his side. She felt a lump form in her throat, because how was she going to handle this? How was she supposed to handle this? She didn't know and she needed help. She thought about going out and getting Alexey, because he always broke the tension in a room. But she didn't have the chance. Simon didn't give her the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne eye slowly fluttered open. It was bloodshot and glassy. It scanned the room quickly, coming to rest on Vic for a moment before he closed it again. Her heart beat heavily in her chest as she thought he didn't recognize her or didn't care enough to stay awake. She shouldn't have fucking come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, almost comedicly, he frowned, and it looked like it hurt, and the eye opened again, staring up at her. He licked his lips, when he finally spoke his voice was raw and rough and painful. \"Vic.\" he couldn't quite form it into a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers slid out to grasp his gently. She felt him squeeze, too lightly, back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to work on your bob and weave,\" she whispered to him as he stared up at her, his glassy green eye begging for answers, for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile that broke onto his face was enough to make the trip worth it. </span></div></div>",

Vic wasn't moving from his side, just watching the losing battle he was waging with consciousness. She imagined the drugs and the concussion were really fogging up his mind right now. He'd open his unswollen eye and search her out. Looking frantic for a moment that maybe she'd left him again while he wasn't paying attention. He'd spot her, she'd squeeze his hand, and he'd be so content that she was there his eyes would slip close again. She would have thought it was cute, if he wasn't so good damn worried that she'd leave. It made her feel guilty. She wouldn't be leaving again. Not until whoever did this was dead and gone and she was certain he would be sticking around for a while longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft knock came from the doorway and Vic pulled her eyes from Simon to find Alexey standing there. He grinned at her, but it faded a bit as his gaze wandered to his prone brother lying on the bed. \"He's back asleep?\" he asked, stepping into the room and walking over to the other side of the bed. He frowned down at Simon, hand reaching out to ghost over the swollen eye. God someone had really done a number on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying not to be,\" she said and as if on cue his eye opened again, searching her out. He found her and she nodded in Alexey's direction. Simon actually turned his head a bit when he realized his brother was standing there too now. The motion seemed to take it out of him and his eyes slipped closed a moment, a small wince escaping before he opened them again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey grinned down at him. \"Hey, bro,\" he said, louder than he had to. He reached out and gave the bandage around Simon's head an extremely gentle tug. \"I like the new do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon actually smiled again, looking increasingly more alert. Vic still held his hand in hers. His thumb moved ever so slightly over her fingers. It was a  motion she was painstakingly familiar with. He'd always been gentle. But never because he didn't have the strength to be rough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all the new rave in France,\" Simon rasped out, his voice no more than a whisper and it looked like talking took a lot of effort. Alexey and Vic exchanged a look, neither one of them really used to seeing him so weak and banged up. Vic couldn't stop herself from lifting his hand and bringing his fingers to her lips. Alexey stuck his tongue into his cheek and turned his attention back to Simon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never been to France, dickweed.\" A laugh escaped Simon's lips but it turned into coughing. He drew his hand away from Vic's and held his own side. Alexey's face fell a little and he reached out to gently put a comforting hand on Simon's leg. \"Hey, easy,\" he said softly. Vic watched, trying not to feel like a stranger among the two. She wasn't sure, but she had to guess that Alexey and Simon had had more contact with each other in the past two years than she'd had with either. She still knew them, still loved them, but this situation was all so foreign to her that she couldn't seem to jump in and break whatever passed between the brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the coughing subsided, Simon brought his hand away from his ribs and it blindly seeked out the comforting touch of Vic's fingers. She gave him what he sought and squeezed his hand gently. His eyes were closed again, but he was moving his jaw. Finally, he opened his eye again and looked between the both of them. \"How bad?\" he asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you got your ass handed to you,\" Alexey said, laughing as Simon's face fell into an annoyed glare, regardless if it lost most of it's effect through the bruising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic reached a hand out to run her fingers down the side of Simon's face. He turned to look at her, knowing she'd have answers. \"You're going to be fine, now that you're awake,\" she assured him. He nodded slightly, eyes slipping closed as the motion made him dizzy. She gave him a second to reopen them before she added. \"It'll take a while, but you'll fully recover.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon tilted his head at her, as if he suddenly noticed something. His eyes lit up as he spoke. \"Are you a pirate now?\" There was mirth in his strained voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey had the decency to only giggle and not outright laugh. That or he knew Vic would leap across the bed at him. She shook her head at Simon, lifting his hand again to kiss it. \"Ass,\" she told him with her lips still on his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think...you're beautiful,\" he said, blinking heavily. Vic winced. A part of her wished he didn't. A part of her wished he'd be angry at her, instead of happy to see her. Maybe he was angry. But maybe his happiness at seeing her again was clouding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan escaped Alexey's lips and he threw his hands up in the air overdramatically. Both Simon and Vic turned to look at him, Vic annoyed and Simon just trying to keep up with it all. \"Oh god,\" Alexey drawled, playing up his disgust for the sake of lightening the mood and keeping his brother from worrying too much over his own wounds. \"I would say get a room but I think I'm in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic sighed and Simon just smiled and closed his eyes. He seemed to take comfort in the familiar and long missed banter. She felt his hand going slack in hers and she laid it down gently onto the bed, her fingers tracing his. Alexey turned to pull a chair over for her and then grab another for himself on the other side. She sat down and watched Simon's face, watched the rise and fall of his chest. He seemed to realize he was falling asleep though and his eye opened again, turning to try and look at both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, just sleep,\" Alexey said, voicing Vic's thoughts before she could. \"Your sweet, beautiful, and amazing guardian angel is here to protect you now. Oh, and Vic's here too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic rolled her eyes as Simon gave a soft, painful laugh, not opening his eyes. She leaned forward and said quietly, \"He's right, though. Get some rest. We'll take care of Lyle for you.\" Her words didn't get the reaction she'd thought out of him. His face furrowed into a frown and he forced his eye open. He looked at her then, studying her for a moment, like he didn't understand what she'd just said. She frowned at him, glancing to Alexey who looked equally confused at his reaction. \"Simon, what is it?\" she asked. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon and Alexey were shooting hoops on a cracking and rotting basketball court. They'd just gotten off a job the previous day and this was their down time. Vic hated basketball. She hated anything that didn't involve her punching something or making something bleed. But the boys loved it and she'd go and watch just to make them happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting on a bench under the sun, bored. Lyle came up to stand behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop sneaking up on people,\" she said to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not sneaking if you hear me coming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day I won't. And I'll rip your face off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and patted her shoulder and she wanted to break his hand but restrained herself because then there would be a trip to the hospital and she knew Simon and Alexey would be angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle leaned in closer and she turned to look him in the eye. He had snake eyes. Even in human form. He was grinning at her. \"He loves you,\" he said, voice quiet, calculating. She frowned, eyes darting a moment to Simon, who had just scored a three point shot and was ribbing Alexey about it. The younger man seemed to rage and it turned into a scuffle. She looked back to Lyle. Boys would be boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he doesn't,\" she told him. \"He thinks he does.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle shook his head. \"No, he does. And he's lucky, because you love him back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Viper Shifter stood up and walked away at that. Vic watched the spot he'd been standing in for a moment before turning back. She'd swallowed thickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour weeks later, when she realized Lyle was right, she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't Lyle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's broken voice echoed in the silence that followed the statement. Vic seemed surprsied at that and she looked to Alexey for an explanation, since he'd been the one to tell her the information. But one look at the younger man and she realized he was more shocked than she was. He shook his head, leaning forward to look Simon in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, bro, it was him,\" he said, trying to keep his tone light. Vic knew him too well, though. She knew when Alexey got serious because he could never quite keep that look out of his eyes or the quake out of his voice. He was one of the worse poker players she knew, because he wore his emotions on his sleeve at times. He couldn't hide joy and he couldn't mask anger. It was what she loved about him. And she loved that he tried to hide it, even though he knew he was terrible at it. \"There were witnesses. They identified Lyle's scale markings. You know those can't be replicated, even if they used the same snake's DNA. Those markings are unique to each Shifter. They're better than fingerprints, man, remember? Lyle hated that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon shook his head again, his sudden burst of energy fading quickly. \"It wasn't him,\" he rasped. He had to lick his lips afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic leaned forward. She clasped Simon's chin in her hand, gently so as to not hurt the obvious bruising there. She guided his head so he was looking at her instead of trying to argue with his brother. She knew how the two of them could get and even in his drugged, concussed and injured state, she could see Simon's argumentative side flaring to life. She wouldnt' allow it. She needed answers. \"How do you know?\" she asked. \"How do you know it wasn't Lyle?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed thickly, his glassy eye distant a moment. \"The eyes, Vic,\" he choked out. She frowned at him but he continued without needing to be prompted. \"They weren't his eyes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simon finally lost his battle with consciousness, Vic looked over at Alexey, who had a perplexed look on his face, but she could tell he was thinking the same thing she was. Lyle had unmistakeable eyes. They were piercing and yellow and so unique in the fact that they didn't change between his snake and his human form. It was a flaw, the scientists had told him. Well, for a flaw, he'd always been proud of them. Because they scared people and fascinated people and seduced people all at the same time. Hell, he'd almost won Vic over once. If she hadn't known what a pompous ass he could be, she may have even wound up fucking him instead of Simon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contemplative silence was broken as Jez came into the room, carrying a tray with three coffees fit snuggly into their holders. She was grinning as they looked over at her. \"I brought gifts!\" she said happily, but the smile faded from her face as she looked at them, taking in their stares and worried looks. \"What's wrong?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey voice their predicament. Because even if Simon was lying in a hospital bed and he was drugged, concussed and loopy as hell - they knew he was right. Vic knew what it was like to be attacked. She knew that one of the first things you looked at while it was happening was the eyes. Because eyes were something people remembered but seldom looked at. Look into them and you can see the future. You can see whether this person beating the crap out of you is just going to leave you broken and bleeding or if they're going to leave you dead on the street. She knew Simon and she knew he'd look at the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd because she knew, and because Alexey knew too, they knew they had a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't Lyle.\" </span></div></div>",

A small moan escaped her lips and her nails dug into his back. They were both covered in sweat and panting now, the last of their clothes lying in a trail leading from the door to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria\u2026\u201d he said. His eyes fluttered and he was breathing hard, but he slowed the pace down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d she snarled at him. Her teeth sunk into his skin again and she pushed off the wall so that they both tumbled to the floor. She didn\u2019t want him to be nice or slow or gentle, she just wanted to feel every inch of him tonight with a feverish desperation that she couldn\u2019t put into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straddled his hips and he groaned underneath her. His fingers dug into her hips and he sat up, stubble rough against her breasts as his teeth scraped her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know this was her way of saying goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped the last of the meat off her fish and tossed the bones to the plate. One nail scraped a scale out from between her teeth and then she spit that out as well. When she glanced up, Sung was staring at her from across the table, shaking his head in mild disgust. \u201cI\u2019m from here and I don\u2019t even know how you can eat that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned. \u201cI pretend it\u2019s still alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \u201cI\u2019d like to pretend you\u2019re kidding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged and glanced around the diner again, lacing her fingers behind her head as she leaned back. She used to wonder what her opponents were doing right now, if they were kissing their husbands or wives goodbye, or tucking their kids into bed for the last time. She used to wonder who would be at their funeral or what they would be leaving behind. After a while, she\u2019d stopped caring, because she\u2019d figured out that the people she fought were like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had nothing to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one entered Death Matches because they wanted to die, but most of them had come to terms with the idea. The ones that didn\u2019t died in the lower tiers because they weren\u2019t willing to sacrifice everything for the fight. Most people didn\u2019t understand the idea that not being afraid of death wasn\u2019t the same as wanting to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure there were things and people she would miss if she died tomorrow, but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop her. Once she would have felt bad for killing someone, or felt afraid that tomorrow would end with her in a black bag. She\u2019d been a different girl once, the kind that worried about the world and people and her soul. Things had changed before she\u2019d gotten the wolf in her genes, and they\u2019d changed even more after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point in worrying about the weak. In the end, only the strong survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had fought long and hard to try and be the strongest, and that didn\u2019t leave room for regret. It didn\u2019t leave room for pity or fear, and it especially didn\u2019t leave room for love. She couldn\u2019t afford those things, because if she was weak she would die, inside and out. It was the way of the world and she had learned that lesson the hard way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s staring at you,\u201d Sung said, nodding behind Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved her thoughts away and turned halfway in her seat to look at the doorway. A small groan escaped her lips and she almost stormed out then and there, but the man had seen her and now he was headed her way and there wasn\u2019t much she could do about it. \u201cSung, maybe you should take a walk,\u201d she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of against the point of a Keeper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the man was at their table. \u201cHello Victoria,\u201d he said, taking off his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes and a sigh escaped her lips. She wanted to tell him to fuck off, but if he was here than it was either about the old team or her old contract and either way she couldn\u2019t make him leave. Unfortunately for her, she owed them, whether she liked it or not, and she should have known the expiration of a contract didn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t come back with another one in hand. \u201cHello Elias. Something I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias was one of the liaisons for the big bosses and he was her favorite, not that it counted for much because she still hated the prick. He smiled and slid into the seat next to her. \u201cFunny you should ask that.\u201d Then he looked up at Sung. \u201cHey kid, why don\u2019t you take a hike?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung snorted again, half a dumpling in his mouth. \u201cDo either of you understand what they pay me for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSung,\u201d Victoria said sweetly. \u201cIf you stay at this table, this man is probably going to put a bullet in your head. Watching me from across the room probably isn\u2019t against policy and it\u2019ll save your boss a lot of paperwork.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared at her before tossing his dumpling down on the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes,\u201d he snapped, and then wiped off his hands to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and rubbed at her temples. \u201cWhat do you want Elias?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you haven\u2019t lost your touch.\u201d He patted her on the back once before swinging around side of the booth so that he could face her. The grin never left his face the whole time and she hated that about him. He was like one of those stupid actors who always smiled because he thought it would look better for the press and make people like him more and it just made him look like a jackass. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a job offer for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted. \u201cNot interested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stupid damn smile never left his face. \u201cNow you haven\u2019t even heard the offer yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t need to,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a fight here in the morning and I\u2019m really not interested in renewing with you folks. No offense, I\u2019m sure your Christmas bonus has really improved, but I\u2019m afraid the company and I will have to stay our separate ways. Thanks for thinking of me, maybe next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tipped his head back and laughed. \u201cWell, that\u2019s nicer than Alexey\u2019s response, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou asked Alexey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to wipe that fucking grin off on the concrete. \u201cYup, and he still signed on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it. He had her attention now, as much as she didn\u2019t want to admit it. She played with the bones on her plate and sighed. \u201cAlright,\u201d she finally said, kicking at the bench. She really didn\u2019t want anything to do with them anymore, but she wanted to know what was so interesting that Alexey had agreed to sign up for it. Last she\u2019d checked, he was off fighting evil and Russia and didn\u2019t want anything to do with their initial employers anymore. \u201cWhat\u2019s your offer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were hoping you and your associates could help us track down an old friend. Lyle has ah, gone missing, and he\u2019s done so with some very sensitive property of ours. Now, if he were the only one involved it would be no problem for us to find him, but it seems the associates he was dealing with decided to kidnap him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you want us to find him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias nodded. \u201cAnd the property he stole, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eye narrowed. \u201cWhat did he take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s classified. We would of course, tell you once you agree to help us and sign a confidentiality agreement.\u201d He chuckled, putting the sunglasses back on his face. She wondered why he was wearing them because it was dark out, and she figured it was probably because the asshole thought he was a goddamn special agent. Stupid fuck.  \u201cHere\u2019s my number. Call me if you change your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up to go and a hand on his arm stopped him. \u201cWho else is signed up for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, and this one was almost cruel. \u201cAlexey and Jezibel are all already on board, as well as Tony and Delia. You were the hardest to track down, so you\u2019re the last one we\u2019re waiting on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon?\u201d she asked, and she knew as soon as she said it he\u2019d tricked her into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, did I forget him?\u201d He grinned wickedly and then pulled his arm away. \u201cHope to hear from you soon, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her whole body ached, and the claw marks on her side were still fresh and oozing blood every time she moved. She hadn\u2019t skipped out on her fight, but it had been over faster than even she\u2019d expected. They guy had been huge, like Sung said, but he\u2019d been slow and stupid and most of all new. He didn\u2019t understand that Victoria wasn\u2019t going to hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also hadn\u2019t understood that a girl half his height could be faster, tougher, and stronger, and now he never would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and slid into the tub, letting the water soak away her aches and pains. She kept staring at the goddamn card, studying the numbers over and over again and wondering if she should call. What could Lyle have possibly taken that would piss of the Big Bosses so much and who was involved that could keep him hidden from them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if it was really a kidnapping, or if he\u2019d cut some kind of protection deal. She wondered if he was dead and a feral grin crossed her face because she had really never liked him. It was hard to work with someone who might be thinking about stabbing her in the back every time she turned around. She had wanted to trust him, wanted to like him even, but he was a snake through and through and had never let anyone close enough to understand what made him tick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day had probably been coming for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the number slip from her hand to the bathroom floor and tipped her head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t thought about the old crew much in the last two years, partly because it wasn\u2019t convenient, and mostly because it hurt too much. Even if Lyle Liddle was a prick, he and the others had still been like family to her. He was just the little fuck-up brother that she knew she was going to have to bail out of prison one day, and this felt like the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJezibel had been her little sister, the kind that showed up in chick flicks and was into those dressing room fashion montages. She laughed a little thinking about it because she\u2019d tried to drag her out to that kind of thing more than once and Victoria had sat on the bench with a bemused expression on her face the whole time. She\u2019d been the only one she\u2019d actually told she was leaving, and Jezibel had only one thing to say about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you told Simon yet?\u201d she\u2019d asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m telling him tonight.\u201d Only that had been a lie. All she\u2019d said was goodbye, and then she\u2019d been gone. The only evidence she\u2019d left behind was the picture he kept in his living room and she was pretty sure she\u2019d left a change of clothes in his bottom drawer. She\u2019d been so busy trying to sneak out without waking him that she\u2019d forgotten about grabbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, she didn\u2019t want to be thinking about Simon right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he going to say when he saw her again? It was too much to hope that he wouldn\u2019t say anything, and she didn\u2019t have an explanation for him. She tried to turn her attention to the last member of their group that had really mattered, but it was still too close to home because now she was thinking about Alexey and he was like Simon in a lot of ways. Alexey was always getting into trouble and half the time it was Simon and Vic had to bail him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a good kid though, and she missed him too. She groaned and hugged her knees to her chest. She missed all of them really, more than she wanted to admit. She couldn\u2019t pretend that the thought of working together again didn\u2019t appeal to her because it was one of two things she\u2019d tried not to think about in two years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and finished up her bath, wrapping a towel around her frame and grabbing the card off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d known it would come to this in the end. She\u2019d just been putting it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias picked up on the second ring, and she could even hear that fucking stupid smile on his face over the phone. \u201cVictoria,\u201d he said, drawing out her name. \u201cI\u2019ve already booked you a flight to Cairo for ten o\u2019clock tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know what I was going to say,\u201d she grumbled into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed at her and she really wished he were here so that she could punch him in the face for it. \u201cOf course I did. You wouldn\u2019t be calling if you weren\u2019t taking the job. You can sign all the paperwork at our offices in the morning, and you\u2019ll be filled in on the rest of the details once you land in Egypt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking prick,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She reread the contents of the manila folder four times before the plane touched down in Cairo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing in there was a copy of the contract she\u2019d signed that morning. She was tired because she hadn\u2019t slept much the night before but she\u2019d made herself read it through twice before she\u2019d signed anything. It promised standard rates for a one time mission, but the part that worried her was the terms of the contracts dissolution. It basically said that if they didn\u2019t find Lyle or what he\u2019d stolen, they were locked back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had missed it and she was cursing herself for it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing in there was a detailed, scientific description of what exactly he\u2019d stolen, and it was more than she\u2019d expected. \u201cJesus,\u201d she breathed after the second time she read it, because she still couldn\u2019t believe that Tex had the balls to pull off a heist like that and that it had even been made in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Shifters weren\u2019t the end of the line when it came to human gene manipulation. She didn\u2019t know why she ever thought it would be, but she was kicking herself for it now. It looked to her like they\u2019d been developing some kind of super race, a Shifter with all kinds of strength and speed capabilities and a last bit that looked like it was straight out of a science fiction novel because it gave the human part psionic capabilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mind-reading fucking killing machine and a copy of the gene had been stolen by Lyle Liddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her head fall back to the seat and she laughed because it was just too damn funny. Maybe he\u2019d thought they could work it into his own system, because then he\u2019d never have to worry about the Big Bosses or anyone ever again. He could go where he wanted, when he wanted, and no one would be able to stop him. She wondered if he had really been kidnapped or if this was just Tex\u2019s way of setting them up, because it sure felt like the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane jolted when it hit the runway and she was still in shock when she grabbed her carry-on and started walking off the plane. She was so distracted by what she\u2019d learned that she almost forgot about the second part of all this, that she\u2019d be working with the old team again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lasted until she got to the terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVic!\u201d A familiar voice called, and her head twisted to her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere they were, three of them in a group by the sleek blue benches. Jezibel was talking to him, Simon Welsh, and of course he would be here, she\u2019d known he was part of this. She\u2019d just thought she\u2019d had more time. Alexey was the one that had called her and he was trotting in her direction with a grin on his face. She gasped in surprise when he picked her up in a bear hug and then he was slapping her on the back. \u201cHow you been, bitchzilla?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d she said, slapping him lightly across the back of the head, and he laughed at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! Glad to hear it.\u201d He left his arm slung lightly around her shoulders as he guided her over to their small group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria,\u201d Jezibel smiled, the same glittering and perfect smile she\u2019d always had that rubbed in just a little bit how rough Victoria herself was. She gave her a light hug before stepping back to study her. She shook her head, staring at the black eye patch. \u201cOh no dear, this will never do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you too,\u201d she said, brushing the hand from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Vic,\u201d came a quiet rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d prepared for this moment a thousand times over the last few hours, it was part of the reason she couldn\u2019t sleep the night before and part of the reason she\u2019d wanted to tell Elias to go to hell. She had imagined how it would go a thousand times, told herself she would be cool and calm and wouldn\u2019t give him an inch. She had told him goodbye, said the words, said it in ways that didn\u2019t involve words, and she should have been over it by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept her voice from shaking, but she couldn\u2019t meet his eyes. \u201cHey Simon,\u201d she said, and she stared at a scar on his chin so she wouldn\u2019t have to see his expression. He looked the same, tattoos curling up under his shirt and was it really so long ago she\u2019d been able to trace them all the way across his skin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized he was staring at her, and she made the mistake of glancing at his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made her forget why she\u2019d ever left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, our chariot awaits, and so do Tony and Delia,\u201d Alexey said, breaking the awkward silence. He started off towards the doors, arm still around Victoria\u2019s shoulder and she went with him easily. She didn\u2019t want to face him with everyone around and she didn\u2019t want to face him alone and she wanted to go back to Bejiing where it was easier to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to listen in, but she heard Jezibel\u2019s quiet voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d she was asking Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, fine,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me Little Bird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, Simon,\u201d she said softly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as they stepped outside she felt the sweat break out on her forehead and she realized she was still wearing a long-sleeve shirt and jeans. She was stupid, she hadn\u2019t even thought about the climate change. Between Elias and his stupid contract, the lingering soreness from the fight before, and the thought of seeing Simon again, she\u2019d had more than enough on her mind. She dropped her bag on the sidewalk and proceeded to strip down to her tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey whistled at her and she tossed the shirt in his face. \u201cFuck off,\u201d she told him with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so violent today,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI think you\u2019re sexually frustrated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep it up and I think you\u2019re going to be,\u201d Jezibel said sweetly from behind her and Alexey\u2019s face paled a little. At first Victoria didn\u2019t understand what had happened. Then it hit her and her head whipped around to look at Jezibel. Apparently the shock was evident on her face because Jez blushed, looking down very intently at her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two?\u201d she blurted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey laughed and shrugged, not embarrassed in the least. \u201cWhat can I say? She couldn\u2019t resist my charms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon didn\u2019t seem phased by it, so she imagined his little brother had already told him. She wondered what else she\u2019d missed in two years. He chuckled and ran a hand affectionately through Alexey\u2019s hair, making him look like he\u2019d just rolled out of bed. \u201cLex, you\u2019re about as charming as a drunken hobo and smell just about the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill makes me more charming than you,\u201d he grinned. It turned into a yelp when his brother put him in a headlock and Victoria couldn\u2019t help but laugh. It was almost like old times again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of tires squealing around a corner drew her attention to the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she just stared at the car as it whipped through the parking lot. There was something strange about it and for the life of her she couldn\u2019t place what it was, but a bad feeling hit her gut and she started to turn back towards Jezibel when she saw the machine guns appear in the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJezibel just managed to shout \u201cGet down!\u201d before the gun fire started and people started screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria dropped to the ground seconds before the car next to her rattled as bits of metal tore through it. A tire popped and hissed and then she felt a fiery pain rip through her shoulder. She clasped her hand over the wound as blood started to spill out and she pressed her face closer to the ground while she waited for the maelstrom to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJezibel lay next to her, her white dress smudged and dirty. \u201cGet down!\u201d she shouted again at the small family cowering behind a van ten yards away. She didn\u2019t understand why they hadn\u2019t already hit the dirt but at Jez\u2019s cry they crouched down on the asphalt, the father leaning over his children to protect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a fucking major airport. This shouldn\u2019t be happening here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple had just been walking out of the doors when the attack started and they hadn\u2019t had time to duck. She could only watch as red flowered out from their bodies and they tumbled to the ground in a morbid pile of blood and flesh. The whole thing felt weirdly familiar and for a second her eyes shut and she could see a stone building erupting into smoke and metal as the enemy assaulted their makeshift base. She remembered screaming as a bullet punctured her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered Simon holding onto her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay Vic,\u201d he\u2019d told her. \u201cJust stay awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at him now, and she could see Simon lying half on top of his brother but there was no sign of blood or wounds on either of them. His gaze met hers across the sidewalk and his expression was unreadable. She swallowed down the lump in her throat and pressed her cheek back into the ground while bullets rained down around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gunfire stopped and she heard feet pounding across the ground towards them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vic tensed at the sound of approaching footsteps. She felt Jez's hand lay gently on her arm and the girl whispered quieted, \"God, you're bleeding.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled out, \"It's fine,\" before she even knew the validity of that statement. She assessed herself quickly, finding it to be true as the pain from her shoulder could only be from a graze at most. She tried not to let the fact that she knew the difference between a bullet graze and a bullet wound upset her. Right now, someone was coming and she threw her gaze to the side to see who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were men with guns and they were aiming at her. She growled, shifting already, because she still felt Jez's hand on her arm and she knew if they shot at her, they'd no doubt his the Owl Shifter too. And there was no fucking way she would let that happen. Not to Jez. The girl, though bitchy and moody at times, was like a little sister. And she'd die before she let the smaller woman die so violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, she didn't have to worry. Alexey and Simon must have felt the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers were up and charging the gunmen before Vic could even gain her feet. Alexey flipped and whirled around like a fucking gymnast on crack, because his fox genes accepted nothing less than flexibility and show. Simon was less artsy in his fighting style, but he still had grace and speed and he pounced on the gunman without hesitation. The guns went off several times as the two knocked them away and Vic heard someone cry out in pain, but it wasn't one of hers, so she threw herself into the fray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like old times, like she thought it would be. Because back in the day, she would have gone to Simon's side and helped him take out his attacker. She would have teamed up with the Panther Shifter and they would have taken out bad guys like they took out the fucking trash. They had been a team. They had been partners. They'd been lovers admist battle. But not now. Because now, she helped Alexey over Simon. And she wasn't sure if it was a conscious decision or not. But she noticed it and that was enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a dozen men, all with guns. Alexey was flipping and whirling and twisting about them with agility and speed that blurred even Vic's wolf senses. She'd always liked that about the Fox Shifter. He was quick and he was flexbile, but he wasn't strong. His claws weren't as sharp as Vic's or Simons and his teeth weren't as lethal. He often didn't slash or bite, but hit or distract. It was a much different fighting style than anyone else on the team. He wasn't a killer. He was just a quick sonofabitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic took out the guys for him as he whirled and cracked the guns out of their hands and knocked heads together. She'd finish them off, following behind him ripping out throats or slashing guts. They tore threw them and it was like some kind of sick dance they'd coreographed beforehand. She found she liked it. It was beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the end of the line, Alexey crouched low to the ground, breathing heavily, his eyes darting around. He grinned wickedly at Vic, adrenaline coursing through him and she grinned back before turning around, eyes seeking out Simon. Because even though she'd followed after Alexey, even though she was pretty sure she'd done it on purpose, she would never, ever leave the Panther Shifter to fend for himself for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for her, Simon was handling his own. He'd taken out a few guys, who lay on the ground. One was crying out with a broken scream. The others would never scream again. Simon was still locked in combat with what seemed to be the leader of the attackers. It was a Shifter. A big Shifter. It took Vic a moment to realize she didn't know what the animal inside the Shifter was. Brown fur, massive claws, muscles that stood out starkly even against the hair covering him. He crouched and stood with knees that went backwards and she could tell that's the part that was giving Simon difficulty. This was a creature, with a weird anatomy and Simon was having trouble adapting. Plus, it was damn good at blocking every hit Simon threw at him and finding openings where he could throw his own punches back unblocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon took a punch to the face that ellicited a strangled grunt and broke something in Vic. She howled and leapt and the strange Shifter must not have been expecting it because her claws dug into his spinal cord and paralyzed him at the same time Simon threw a fist the his face and his neck snapped beneath the force of it all. He was dead before he hit the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic's eyes came up to meet Simon's as they both shifted back to their human forms. She eyed the forming bruise on his cheekbone and he eyed the bullet graze on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both asked it at the same time. A smile crept onto Simon's face and Vic had to look away. Because she didn't like it. She didn't want to like him anymore. He would only get hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey's voice broke the awkwardness of the mellowing moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...shit.\" </span></div></div>",

He shivered once and then looked down at his hands. He flexed them, watching the skin stretch over the muscle. His hands were calloused and covered in little scars that he\u2019d acquired over years of fighting. \u201cI had cancer you know.\u201d His voice had fallen to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly, and she did. She knew, but they never talked about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI was supposed to. I had only weeks to live, until they put the cat inside me. It was all they could think of to save me.\u201d He grew quiet and let his hands fall to the bedside. Then he looked up at her and smiled. \u201cIt worked. I just wonder sometimes\u2026\u201d he laughed and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI just wonder if sometimes this isn\u2019t all a dream I\u2019m having because of the cancer in my brain, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to him then, running her fingers through his hair. He pressed his face to her stomach, his hands resting on her hips as he breathed her in. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream,\u201d she told him softly, fingers sliding down his neck to where his shirt began. She started to pull it off and he leaned back to let her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her, fingers still on her hips, and normally he would be smiling, but he just looked sad. \u201cProve it to me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cProve to me I\u2019m still alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of something banging against her door woke her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell out of the bed onto the floor just as the door slammed open and someone charged in. The coffee table crashed as they slammed a boot into it and some of the splinters flew into her room. She started shifting almost immediately, but the guy was fast and he was already in her doorway by the time the claws had come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt at him from the ground, slashing at his stomach with one hand and staying low, thinking that maybe that would help her. He howled as her claws drew bloody furrows across his chest but it didn\u2019t slow him down any and he charged straight towards the bed. She dodged sideways and she heard a rush of air as the fist just barely missed her face. Jesus his fists were the size of fucking hams. She got hit with one of those, she was going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a hand closed around her throat and picked her up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand snapped out and claws slashed across her attacker\u2019s face, drawing bloody lines in their skin and summoning a bestial roar from his throat. He tossed her to the side like a ragdoll, but she hit the ground rolling. She hadn\u2019t spent the last year in a Death Match arena just to go down easy. She kicked high at his chest but it barely even budged him and then he was charging her again, hands going back towards her throat. She rolled out of the way, lashing out another kick towards his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing hurt this guy. She felt a sliver of fear go down her spine, and then there was nowhere else to dodge in the tiny bedroom and he was slamming her against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held her there with an arm across the throat and caught the arm heading towards his face with his other hand. She clawed weakly at the arm holding her up and wondered who the fuck this was. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she gasped, claws digging into the skin of his forearm. If anything he just pressed on her throat harder and then she couldn\u2019t form words at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did Elias want?\u201d he asked. His voice was a low growl, barely even human anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she gasped. She was seeing stars now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled again, tossing her to the floor. A heavy boot landed in her gut, forcing all the air out of her lungs. She was already bruised and battered from the fight and she would be lucky if she was only limping tomorrow. Then the boot smashed into her jaw and she heard something crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry again,\u201d he said, and the hand closed around her throat again. \u201cWhat did he want? Who was he looking for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head lolled to the side. She couldn\u2019t form words, her lips moving weakly. One of them was split and she felt blood trickling down her face. She couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from anymore and her head was throbbing, fiery pain lancing through her skull. He leaned down and she mouthed the words for him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d she said, and then spit blood in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe howled at her, throwing her through the door and back into the living room where she landed on the broken pile that used to be her coffee table. A sharp cry escaped her lips as she felt something pierce her side. She struggled weakly to her knees, grabbing the broken chunk of wood and pulling it from her skin. The beast was stalking across her apartment towards her and she lashed out weakly with the make shift weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snarled and batted it away before he was on her again, pressing her face into the ground. \u201cTell me you fucking bitch,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me or you die right now. What did Elias want? Which one of you was he looking for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed a snarl and then it turned into a laugh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go ask him yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a dark glint in the dim light from his eyes, and they looked like fucking snake eyes. She thought briefly of Lyle and the laughter bubbled over bloody and dark onto the floor as she realized that\u2019s probably who he was looking for. Well, maybe the little shit hadn\u2019t gotten himself kidnapped after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw him raise his fist over his head and she managed one last desperate lunge towards his neck. She felt teeth sink into flesh and blood burst in her mouth and then he was howling again and tossing her across the room. There was a crash as she slammed into the television and she felt splintered shards puncture her skin. Through increasingly blurry vision she saw the attacker stand up, hand clutched over his neck, and then she couldn\u2019t see anything anymore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The plumber said something about high acid content in the water and that was going to wear away at any system she put in. She didn\u2019t know shit about pipes and home repair so she had to take his word for it but she honestly thought he was scamming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to roll over because if it was the sink again then she was going to have a fucking mess to mop up and she might as well get started now before it got much worse. Then she felt splinters digging into her skin and she gasped at the pain because she hadn\u2019t expected it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer good eye slid open and she realized the dripping sound was the blood falling from her fingertips onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a gasp escaped her lips as she saw the body lying next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d she groaned, trying to push herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain lanced through her as she put pressure on her already wounded hand and a hiss escaped her lips. She was still lying in the remains of her broken television and she thought distantly how much it was going to be to replace it. That and the coffee table because there was no way wood glue was going to be able to fix that thing. It was massacred, the pieces strewn about her apartment and she would be lucky if she wasn\u2019t pulling splinters out of her ass for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled her way out of the wreckage, trying not to look at the corpse she\u2019d left. His eyes were empty and lifeless but she was still afraid to get close to it in case her attention would wake him up. She knew better, she knew he was dead, but the fear sat in her gut anyway and she wasn\u2019t sure what had put it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone was still on her nightstand, and right now it seemed really fucking far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled herself across the remains of her apartment, hands digging into the carpet for purchase. She wondered what time it was, if she\u2019d already missed her flight to Cairo. She wondered who had sent the bastard, if he was from the arena, the Big Bosses, or whoever had kidnapped Lyle. She would check for an I.D. in a second because she wasn\u2019t afraid of a corpse no matter how big it was or how much it had hurt her when it was still a living, breathing person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked the nightstand over when she grabbed at her phone and the lamp fell to the floor with a deafening crash. She winced at the sound, ducking her head like she expected it to hit her. The phone bounced onto the ground next to her and she was so tired she didn\u2019t have the energy to pick it up at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did, she just hit the redial button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rang three times before a groggy voice answered \u201cHello?\u201d and she\u2019d never heard Elias sound groggy before. Never mind that it was past three o\u2019clock in the morning and he\u2019d probably been asleep, she still expected him to sound awake and alert and like his usual prick self. This was the asshole that never went anywhere without a smile plastered on his face, couldn\u2019t he summon a little more enthusiasm for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElias,\u201d she said, and her voice sounded like it had been put through a blender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice evened out and she heard him moving in the background. \u201cVictoria? Everything okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she told him. She shook her head and then stopped when he realized he couldn\u2019t see that through the phone anyway. Her arm was shaking with effort of holding her up. She twisted so that she could lean back against the bed and that helped a little. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here. I think he\u2019s dead now, but I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes,\u201d he snapped. \u201cStay where you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard something crunch and her breath froze in her chest. \u201cElias,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSomeone else is here. Be careful.\u201d She snapped the phone shut because she didn\u2019t know who was here and if they could hear her or already had. She\u2019d called Elias. He knew where she was. That would have to be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the sound of a gun cocking and she hoped she had enough strength left in her for one last fight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt some small relief when her hand closed around the handle of her gun and she raised it towards the door. It was heavier than it should have been in her hand, and she was tired, oh so tired. There was blood trickling down into her one good eye and it was making everything blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if Elias would get here soon. She hoped this wasn\u2019t someone else coming to finish the job, but there was no reason for anyone else to be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost pulled the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have if he hadn\u2019t said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria?\u201d he said. The word was more of a gasp, but she would\u2019ve known his voice anywhere. Her arm wavered, still sighting along the gun and then it fell to her side because it really was him standing in the doorway. There were circles under his eyes and his black hair was a ruffled mess. He had a gun in his hand, but he holstered it when he saw her, hurrying across the room to her side. She was surprised he even had one. Jumbo must still be a mess out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVic, fuck\u2026 are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost laughed at him, but it might have hurt his feelings, and he\u2019d only just gotten here, so instead she plastered a shaky smile on her face as she looked up at him. \u201cSure babe, never better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at her, but it didn\u2019t quite turn into a laugh. His hand came out to grasp her chin, lifting her head so the light from the window hit her face. \u201cJesus,\u201d he whispered, his eye scanning her features in quick glances. She didn\u2019t like the way his gaze focused on her missing eye or the way it scoured the cut on her temple. His gaze was full of concern and she hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her head from his grasp and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back on his heels, and there it was, that hurt puppy dog look on his face. It was only there for a second before he smoothed it away, but she had seen it and that was enough. \u201cI came here with Elias, he didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. She didn\u2019t mention that Elias had never said his name at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled a little, but it was strained. He didn\u2019t give the awkward silence time to settle in between them, instead sliding an arm around her back and then under her knees. She barely had time to protest before he stood, her cradled in his arms. \u201cJesus,\u201d she said, trying to pretend that every little movement didn\u2019t hurt her. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to fucking carry me like some damsel in distress, Welsh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the fuck up, Wolfe,\u201d he told her cheerfully as he carried her into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should have argued with him more, should have told him to fuck off after he set her gently down on the edge of the tub. She didn\u2019t, so he kept going, calloused hands gentle as he peeled the bloodstained tank top off her skin. His face was like stone and she wanted to ask him what he was thinking, but he wasn\u2019t giving anything away. He started the bath running and she felt warm water running over her feet. It came away red and she wondered if there was anything left in her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe just broke in?\u201d he asked, and she knew he was just trying to distract her. He had a washcloth now and was cleaning the wounds on her face. She felt her forehead sting as he brushed over it and she couldn\u2019t stop the wince. His motions paused, his gaze focusing on hers. \u201cVic?\u201d he prodded gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, probably an hour ago?\u201d she shivered and looked down at the bathwater. \u201cIs he really dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI checked the body myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned her slowly so that he could get to the mess Jumbo had made of her back. A gasp escaped her throat as he wiped down the hole her coffee table had left in her lower back. She was lucky it hadn\u2019t punctured a kidney or something, and then he put pressure on it and she didn\u2019t feel lucky anymore. \u201cFuck,\u201d she growled, her fingers turning white around the side of the tub. She bit her lip to keep from saying anything else because the last person she wanted to look weak around was Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon, how did you know to come here?\u201d she asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElias,\u201d he said. She winced as he pressed down on the wound again and she wondered just how much fucking blood was back there. Then she glanced over her shoulder at him and saw the look on his face. His hand was shaking and he looked exhausted. How was that fair that she was the one running on no sleep with the crap beaten out of her and he was the one that looked so tired? \u201cHe told me to stop by and check on you every few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow considerate of him,\u201d she growled, her eyes narrowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon shrugged. \u201cTurns out it was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and started rummaging through her medicine cabinet. He passed over the pain killers, pretending not to notice how empty most of the bottles were, and pulled out the first aid kit she kept on the top shelf. She looked down before he opened it, knowing it was going to be even emptier than the painkillers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was still alive, but she got hurt a lot in Death Matches. She didn\u2019t want to know what he would say about that, assuming he would even say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kneeled back down next to her, the gauze in his still shaking hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she whispered. Her hand came out to rest on his forearm and he glanced up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t remember what she was going to say. Two years of silence stretched on and on between them. She could see the gap that she\u2019d opened up, see it in the way he kept studying her face, like he was afraid if he didn\u2019t memorize every inch of it now then he would just forget when she was gone again. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWhy did you come here with Elias?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d he told her, and then he looked at her back, pressing the gauze pad against the wound. She felt warm blood trickling down her spine and then she felt him wipe it away again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take care of me,\u201d she told him. It came out harsher than she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want me to go, I will,\u201d he said. \u201cbut not until you\u2019re patched up and Elias gets here. I\u2019m not leaving you here to bleed to death now that you\u2019re not being beaten to death anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You want me to stay, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like I didn\u2019t?\u201d she snapped. Guilt twisted into a knot around her heart and she tried hard to choke down the sensation. She looked away from him and down at the tub where water still swirled over her toes and back down the drain. \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need shit from you, Welsh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe regretted the words as soon as she said them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you Victoria,\u201d he snapped, and she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d heard so much venom in his voice. Her head snapped up to look over her shoulder and she wanted to pretend she was feeling tears of rage stinging at her eyes and not the tears of hurt that she knew where threatening to fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, asshole,\u201d she spat. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you kick me while I\u2019m down too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anger was misplaced and she knew it. She was pissed that she\u2019d been taken down by anyone, and more pissed that he of all people was the one that found her. She was pissed that he was being nice to her, and really fucking pissed that she needed his help at all. She wanted to tell him to fucking go, but it wasn\u2019t the truth and she was a bad liar even when she was mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was staring back at her, one hand still holding white gauze to the wound in her flesh, but he just looked mad and hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you expect Vic? You left me, not the other way around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo fuck yourself Simon.\u201d Her hands were shaking now and she wanted to hit him. \u201cI told you not to get attached.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, I\u2019m so fucking sorry that I gave a shit about you Vic. Sorry that was so fucking inconvenient for you.\u201d His voice was rising and she had never seen so much anger in his eyes before. \u201cIf you just wanted a fuck buddy you should have been talking to Lyle. Because me? I actually cared about what happened to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bottom lip was trembling and she felt the tears slip and fall from her eye. She turned her head quickly to stare at the wall as she swept them off her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can go fuck yourself,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and she felt him slap medical tape on her spine, less gently than a minute again. \u201cYou can be such a bitch sometimes,\u201d he told her quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t say anything else to her and she crossed her arms self-consciously over her bare breasts. She glanced backwards at his face and it was cold and tired. His eyes just looked distant and sad and he was barely looking at her anymore, patching up the last of her wounds with quick deft movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d had enough practice patching wounds over the years, both hers and his, and probably Alexey\u2019s for most of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed the lump in her throat and tried to ignore the sickening sensation of guilt settling in her stomach and making her sick. Her arms tightened around her chest and she knew this is the part where she should apologize. She wanted to, felt the words on her tongue, but she couldn\u2019t force them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you Vic,\u201d he said after a moment. She heard him stand and turn to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost let him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over her shoulder at him and he looked so tense and strained as he reached for the doorknob. She would have let him walk out, except a terrible feeling settled in her gut that if she let him go now, she would never see him again. Maybe that\u2019s what she thought she wanted two years ago, but then she was leaving him, and she knew she could always go back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was leaving her, and she was scared it would be forever. The truth was that she had missed him, more than she would admit to herself, and now that he was here again she was terrified of losing him again. Even if it had been her fault the first time, even if it would be her fault next time, even if he hated her right now, she didn\u2019t want him to leave. Even if he didn\u2019t love her anymore, she still just wanted him to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t know how to tell him any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced her pride down to fester with her guilt and stood on shaky feet. \u201cWait,\u201d she whispered. She licked her lips because they felt dry and chapped and they didn\u2019t want to say the words she felt hovering on the edge of her tongue. Her steps were unsteady as she stumbled across the bathroom carpet and she felt her head pounding as the room spun around her. Then her hands met his arms and she was pressing her face into the hard plane of his back and the world fell back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed in the smell of him, as comforting as she remembered, closed her only eye and whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a stone statue. His hand still rested on the doorknob but he didn\u2019t move to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou only say that when you want something,\u201d he said. She could hear the quiet smile in his voice, but it sounded just as tired as the rest of him looked. His shoulders sagged as he glanced back at her, his eyes tracing her face. One of his hands came up to cover hers as she held onto his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \u201cYou say that now,\u201d he said to her. He turned slowly, hand still holding hers so that she didn\u2019t fall. She wavered as the steadying force of his back left her and then he was pressing her hand over his heart, letting her head come to rest on his chest. \u201cWhat happens to me when you change your mind, Vic?\u201d His chin came to rest on the top of her head and a heavy sigh escaped his lips. \u201cI can\u2019t go through that again, babe. I just can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered as the cold settled on her bare skin. She pressed her face harder into his chest, holding onto his shirt to keep from tipping over. The pounding in her head was increasing and she closed her eyes against it, leaning into Simon. She had missed this, the solid warmth of him, the hand on hers, and the fingers in her hair. She had missed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. \u201cI missed you. I was stupid. I\u2019m still stupid, I just\u2026 I want you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tensed under her skin, and she kept waiting for him to tell her to go to hell. It\u2019s what she would have done, if he\u2019d just up and left her for two years without a word. She tipped her head back so she could see his face and he didn\u2019t look sad anymore. She couldn\u2019t tell what the look on his face was, but his breathing was quickening and he was staring at her. \u201cVic,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face wrinkled in confusion. \u201cHow am I cheating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, and his hand left her hair to settle on her hip. \u201cHere you are, telling me the things I want to hear most, that you honestly missed me, that you\u2019re sorry, that you still want me and you\u2019re telling me these things in your goddamn panties. I call that cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and pressed a kiss to the hollow of his throat. \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cheating bitch,\u201d he growled, and then he was kissing her. His lips claimed hers with an animal ferocity and she felt her own body rising to meet his. His tongue snaked into her mouth and his hand tightened on her hip with a groan as her teeth snagged his bottom lip. She had missed this so fucking much.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t care about the pain, as his fingers dug into her hips and his hand brushed already bruised ribs. She wanted him to be rough. She wanted him to take her and hurt her and make her his all over again. Suddenly two years wasn\u2019t long enough to forget how much she wanted to be possessed by him. His tongue slid against hers and he was setting her on fire with his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were just sliding under his shirt when she heard the door slam open. She growled at the intrusion and at the sound of Elias\u2019s voice as he called out, \u201cVictoria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell him to go away,\u201d she said against Simon\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and for a moment she thought he might because his fingers were playing with the band of her panties. She pressed herself tightly against him, fingers digging into his back and breath hot against his throat. His hands were sliding over her skin and making her crazy with need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said abruptly. His hands left her hips and slid up to her arms where they rested for a moment. She tried to stretch up on her toes to kiss him again but he looked away at the last second and her lips slid over his cheek. Then he was pushing her away with a gentle, frustrating force. \u201cVictoria\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVic you here?\u201d Elias called again. She heard the moment he found the body because he started cursing and Elias almost never cursed. He was too fucking professional and too much of a stuck up prick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon\u2026\u201d she said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \u201cNot right now, Vic. We\u2019ll talk, but not right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother growl escaped her throat and her teeth nipped possessively at his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk, I want to fuck,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and his voice had dropped in temperature. She scanned his face and realized she had said the wrong thing again. What did he want from her, professions of undying love? He had everything of her that she had left to give, and she didn\u2019t know if love could ever be a part of that. She could give him her loyalty, her compassion, her body, but she didn\u2019t know if there was anything in her that knew how to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to talk,\u201d he said. He pushed her gently away and steered her back towards the edge of the tub. He crouched down next to her, cupping her face in his hand and the look he was giving her caused that knife of guilt to twist itself into her stomach again. \u201cI need to go talk to Elias. Stay here, I\u2019ll get you some clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she said as he stood to go. \u201cI really am sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Vic,\u201d he said, closing the door behind him. He didn\u2019t look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias was bent over the body, but he looked up when Simon came out of the bathroom. He barely got his mouth open to speak before the man was punching him in the mouth. He felt the hit connect with his jaw and his head snapped back. He barely had time to think of what kind of a shiner that was going to leave before he felt a fist close around his shirt collar and yank him to his feet. Simon\u2019s eyes were narrowed and dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you know this would happen?\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias smirked, because he just couldn\u2019t fucking help himself. He thought about lying, but either way he was going to get himself in trouble. He might as well get all this unpleasantness out of the way as soon as possible, and hope that Simon wouldn\u2019t get any more physical or he\u2019d be in trouble. \u201cI suspected,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the Shifter\u2019s teeth grind together and he couldn\u2019t wipe the damn smile off his face. Christ, he was about to start laughing because Simon just looked so damned mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What did you expect?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen Jez and I went to fetch Alexey from Russia, he was attacked in his apartment. Luckily both of them were there at the time, and\u2026 well they weren\u2019t asleep, so they dealt with the attacker fairly quickly.\u201d He smiled, straightening his tie as Simon released him, though his hands clenched at his sides like he really wanted to hit Elias again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you warn Victoria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias snorted. \u201cWarn her of what? I didn\u2019t know for certain until tonight that the attacker was trailing me and not your dear brother. Besides, we both know it\u2019s Victoria we\u2019re talking about, and she wouldn\u2019t take a warning from me anymore seriously than she would anyone else. That\u2019s why you were supposed to be keeping an eye open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe could have died,\u201d Simon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias grinned again. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you have felt like an asshole then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t surprised at the fist that connected with his stomach, but it was harder than he\u2019d thought and he doubled over with the impact. Simon shoved him roughly away and he felt his knee hit the carpet. He was grinning as he looked up at the Shifter, but it had become a feral thing. \u201cAnd that,\u201d he said coldly, his expression never wavering. \u201cIs the last time you get to hit me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her head in her hands and shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was exhausted and it felt like it was shutting down on her. She slipped down next to the tub and rested her back against the cool porcelain. Now that Simon was out of the room and away from her, she could feel all the pain coming back to her. She didn\u2019t even have the energy to climb up her bathroom sink and take a painkiller because she was afraid if she moved then she would start bleeding again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers touched her lips and she could feel his kiss still lingering there. A shiver went down her spine and she let her fingers travel her face until they were running over the scars on her face. She was sure she had scars all over her body and her soul, going all the way back from when she was six years old and her father had started abusing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her knees up to her chest and closed her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision was getting blurry. She hoped it was from exhaustion and not blood loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open again and she glanced up as Simon opened the door. He looked tired and irritated but he offered her a small smile, even if it was a lie. He tossed her a change of clothes, but didn\u2019t come any farther into the room. She bit her lip hard and grabbed the old tee-shirt out of the pile. \u201cWhat did Elias say?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze narrowed again. \u201cThat the attack was not entirely unexpected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted, attempting to wriggle into a pair of jeans without standing up. It was more work than it should have been and she felt the cuts on her back split open. God, would she ever stop bleeding again? \u201cThat\u2019s nice. A head\u2019s up would have been good. What else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to rest,\u201d he said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \u201cFuck that. I want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria,\u201d he whispered. He sighed as she struggled to her feet but when she stumbled he reached out to catch her. He was holding her at arm\u2019s length and she couldn\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t hurt. Should she start assuming that kiss was an accident? The look on his face said no, but the way he held her away from him, like she was fucking diseased or something, felt like a yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, you\u2019re exhausted, and we probably need to travel tomorrow. Go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cOnly if you come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that cold expression on his face again. \u201cI won\u2019t fuck you, Victoria.\u201d He at least had the decency to look like he regretted saying it. It didn\u2019t make the words hurt any less and it didn\u2019t help that knife of guilt from twisting itself all the way up through her ribcage to her heart, but at least he looked like he felt bad about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly, and now she was looking at the floor. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon slid an arm under her shoulders and helped guide her out of the bathroom. At least he wasn\u2019t carrying her this time, though she wasn\u2019t sure that was a good thing now. She felt the distance between them like an open wound, but she was too tired to fight him. Her head was fuzzy and she didn\u2019t know what she wanted from him except that she didn\u2019t want to be just friends and she didn\u2019t want him to leave her right now. She had missed him, despite everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias was on his phone when they limped into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want your best investigators and a clean up crew here by ten o\u2019clock,\u201d he was saying. \u201cFind out who this guy is and how he\u2019s been following me. This is the second massive asshole that\u2019s tried to go after one of my contacts and I want to know who sent him and where he came from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence and he glanced up at the two of them. \u201cGo to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria nodded, but her gaze lingered on the corpse in her living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had competed in dozens of death matches, but somehow this had felt different. He had come onto her turf and he had almost won. She knew she shouldn\u2019t have been standing at all. It had been a lucky hit that had taken him out and he easily could have ended her before he\u2019d gone down. A split second either way could have her just as cold a corpse right now, and Simon would have been the one to find it. Probably not the reunion he was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the door to her bedroom open and she was almost embarrassed by it. It wasn\u2019t messy, because she liked to keep things neat and utilitarian. It was just so bare. She had her bed, with plain green sheets on it, a dresser that had the usual jeans and tank tops, and a night stand that was on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hotel room. It wasn\u2019t a home; it was just a place she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe missed his place, because it was messy and the bed smelled like Simon and she was at home there. She had bitched about having to pick up his jeans off the floor every morning and how he always left his dishes in the sink instead of washing them, but right now she missed all that because it was normal and comforting and she\u2019d been happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set her on the edge of the bed and bent down to straighten the mess she\u2019d made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d she asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stilled for a moment but didn\u2019t look up at her. Then his hands started moving again, sweeping the remains of her lamp into his palm so that he could dump them in the trashcan. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d Then he turned to face her and he looked as tired as she felt. His eyes didn\u2019t meet hers as he helped her pull the jeans back off and it was almost funny that she\u2019d gone through all that work just to walk from her bathroom to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled under the sheets first and she was ready to fall asleep before her head hit the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the bed move as he lay down next to her, but he didn\u2019t make any move to touch her. She rolled over, fingers brushing his arm and she could see his eyes in the predawn light just coming through her window. \u201cSimon?\u201d she whispered and he grunted in response, trying to pretend that he wasn\u2019t still wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you just hold me?\u201d she asked, and it was the closest she would ever come to admitting how afraid she\u2019d been that she was going to die alone in her apartment two hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe understood. She knew he did because he wrapped his arms around her and held her against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo to sleep, Victoria,\u201d he said, and for once she did what he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamed about gunfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamed about pressing her back to the wall and holding her gun between her legs as the world around her was riddled with holes. Clay and dust fell on her in chunks and she fought against the cough rising in her throat because when the gunfire was over she was going to kill the bastards who were shooting at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her were the two brothers and Alexey was laughing maniacally. She could see Jez in the corner and she was rolling her eyes at him. Victoria could understand what Lex was feeling though, because she felt it too. The adrenaline pumped through her veins and she knew that the second the gunfire stopped they would be over the wall and ripping some assholes a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smiled at her. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him an animal grin in return. \u201cAlways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite her she could see Lyle trying to get a good shot out of his sniper rifle. He was crouched behind the remains of the wall and he had his goggles pulled down over his eyes so she couldn\u2019t see the snake eyes looking out at her. The sun glinted off his scope and she watched as he swung the barrel of the gun until it was pointed at her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he grinned, and whispered \u201cBang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she couldn\u2019t remember where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so familiar, the sensation of waking up in Simon\u2019s arms. She made a noise in her throat that couldn\u2019t pass for any word she knew and rolled over into him. She felt sore and for a minute she couldn\u2019t remember why, but it wasn\u2019t a new sensation so she wasn\u2019t worried about it. Her lips brushed his skin and she felt him grumble something in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms tightened around her as she bit gently on the skin at his throat. She trailed kisses up his neck and then his ear and she was tugging on it with her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his hand closed around her arm and his eyes slid open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria,\u201d he whispered, and the expression was so unlike what she\u2019d expected that it brought her back to painful reality. The playful smile fell off her face and she pulled her lips away from his skin, swallowing hard. She had forgotten that he didn\u2019t want her anymore, because she had fucked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head fell back to her pillow and she pulled her fingers back from his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, his hand coming out to catch hers again. \u201cVictoria,\u201d he said. His voice was a harsh whisper. His hand squeezed hers, and then brought it back to his chest. \u201cI guess we should talk.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>His hand curled around hers on his chest and she felt him take a deep breath. She was suddenly afraid of what he was going to say next, because this felt like more than just him being afraid to get hurt again. She wondered if he was about to tell her he\u2019d found someone else, and she felt her heart slam against her ribcage. Jealousy was a bitter taste in her mouth and she tried to swallow it down. She had left him. He had every right to move on; he should move on, she was bad for him. She was the girl he couldn\u2019t bring home to mom, the one that had broken his heart once and would do it over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a fucking liar who couldn\u2019t tell him the truth when it mattered most. She was the bitch who kept her secrets locked in the back of her mind so that they could fester and rot in the darkness where no one would have to face them, not even herself. She was dead inside and Simon was the only one who\u2019d made her feel alive, so he was the one she hurt the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said quietly. He wasn\u2019t looking at her face, and she was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes met her and he looked so fucking miserable that she almost wished she hadn\u2019t asked. He took a heavy breath, and the hand around her hand tightened, squeezing so hard it almost hurt. Then his other hand came out and rested on her abdomen. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered again, and now her heart was thundering so heart in her chest she thought it was going to claw its way through her skin and die a slow death on the bed. He swallowed hard, his eyes begging her to say something back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, and suddenly she was on the verge of tears again. She hated that fucking pitying look she saw staring back at her, that defeated, sad look, and she felt herself punching him in the chest. \u201cFuck you,\u201d she snarled, pushing his hand away from her abdomen and away from the thin white scars that his fingers had brushed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you Simon, you don\u2019t know a fucking thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was punching wildly now and she couldn\u2019t stop the tears or the sobs that ripped their way out of her chest because she had tried to forget that, tried to bury it in dark corners and pretend it had never happened. It was most of why she left, because she was scared and confused and didn\u2019t know what to do. She had fucked up, and he wasn\u2019t supposed to ever find out about it and she hated him and she hated herself more. Her fist hit his chest again and then she felt his hands around her wrists, pinning them to the bed just to stop her from hurting him. \u201cVictoria,\u201d he said, and she thrashed her head from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d she snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she just couldn\u2019t fight anymore and her head fell to the side, tears streaming off onto the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested his forehead against hers, his hands still pinning her wrists down, and she could feel his breath heavy and strained across her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Vic. I\u2019m so fucking sorry,\u201d he whispered, and it just made the tears fall harder. She couldn\u2019t look at him, couldn\u2019t breathe, because he was never supposed to know and it must have been fucking Jezibel that told him because the girl was the only one who knew what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lost it a few months after I left you. It was the fight I lost my eye in,\u201d she whispered, still not looking at him. She stared out into the dark room and tried to pretend that everything didn\u2019t hurt right now. She was going to yell at Jez when she talked to her again, if she ever spoke to her again, because right now all she wanted was to run across the world again and disappear into corners so dark that no one could find her again. She swallowed the lump in her throat and her lips kept moving, even though she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to say the words aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, so I kept fighting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him in the face now, feeling the tears drying on her face. He still hadn\u2019t said anything, but he released her wrists slowly, now that he was sure she wasn\u2019t going to try and hit him anymore. She rested them over her stomach, fingers tracing the scars where the Shifter\u2019s claws had pierced her skin. It was an unsanctioned move, just like the hit that took her eye, and it never should have happened that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you find out?\u201d she asked, glancing at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJezibel called me from the hospital after the fight,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t look mad, just depressed and tired. He scrubbed a hand through his hair and shook his head at her. \u201cShe told me the truth, told me what had happened. Why couldn\u2019t you just tell me, Vic? We would have figured it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to figure it out,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to pretend nothing had changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand cupped her face. \u201cVic\u2026 it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed at that, and then she cried. \u201cI know. I know it doesn\u2019t, but I wanted to pretend it does. You know the worst part? Some part of me was relieved. Some part of me was relieved when I lost it because I was so fucking scared,\u201d she told him. \u201cI hate myself for that. I understand if you hate me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told you I don\u2019t hate you, Vic.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was gentle, and his hands covered hers on her stomach. She couldn\u2019t look at him anymore and she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he was telling the truth or not, she still couldn\u2019t stop hating herself for it. She took a breath, trying to keep from crying again. She hadn\u2019t been ready for the responsibility. She had found out the day her contract ran out from a home pregnancy test. She had promised Jez that she would tell Simon before she decided once and for all if she was leaving or not, but then she\u2019d gone over that night and she just couldn\u2019t do it. She\u2019d panicked. She\u2019d a total break down and she had run like there was no tomorrow, from him, from everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t really understood what it meant until she\u2019d lost it, and by then it was too late. She\u2019d already been a few months into it and they\u2019d had to cut the corpse of her baby out of her womb. They said it was a boy. She wondered if he would\u2019ve looked like his daddy, and she felt the tears come again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her up to his chest and she let him hold her there while she cried out the last two years into his chest. \u201cMe too,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon was on top, his hands running through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, and it startled her because he\u2019d never actually said those words before. She started to sit up, but his weight held her down and then he moved and a small gasp escaped her throat. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said again, his lips brushing her neck. She knew this was a dream, knew this had never happened before because maybe if he\u2019d said the words she never would have left, or maybe she would have left that much sooner but it was a really good dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved inside her and she clutched at his arms, gasping at the sensation. This wasn\u2019t like them, because they never went slow. She never let him. Fucking was always like fighting with them, all rough hands, teeth and nails and most of the time it left them with bruises. She tipped her head back to kiss him and he tasted just like she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he said a third time, and then he smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands moved from beside her head to around her neck and at first she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cSimon, what\u2026?\u201d Then his fingers were digging into her throat and she couldn\u2019t breathe. She clawed at his arms but they were like steel around her skin and she felt them crushing her windpipe. She hit desperately at his chest and his face and he didn\u2019t flinch, didn\u2019t move, and his eyes glittered like snake eyes in the dark bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStars were bursting in her vision and she felt her lungs start shutting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned down, his lips brushing her ear. \u201cWhat did Elias want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she just lay there, taking stock of what hurt and where. It felt like there was still blood trickling down her forehead and she could taste it on her lips. Her tongue probed at the gash, tasting the familiar metallic tang flood her mouth. Her arms were throbbing and she remembered distantly the sensation of smashing into her television, the tiny shards embedding themselves into her skin. She was fighting for every breath and she wondered if one of her lungs had collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, her throat was really fucking sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t see anything at first and fear lanced through her. Maybe she\u2019d lost her other eye now too. Maybe she was going to be blind for the rest of her life. She didn\u2019t know if she could handle that and she felt panic blossoming in her chest. If she lost both eyes then she was done professionally. She would end up in a lab with all the other Shifters that had lost their contracts or gone rogue because she wouldn\u2019t be able to fight or hunt or do any of the things that kept her free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a breath and reached up towards her face. Her fingers brushed over the empty space where her left eye used to be and then it traveled over to the right one. She realized she wasn\u2019t breathing and then her fingers brushed over the gauze on her face. A sigh of relief swept through her and she peeled it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least she was still only half blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lying in a bed, but it was hard to tell in the dim light if the sheets were gray or blue. She was heavily bandaged and she felt her chest constrict when she took a breath. She wondered if any of her ribs were broken and she prodded at them, wincing at the pain she felt on her right side. It was hard to tell anymore what injuries were from what. The last two days, if it had been only two, felt like a haze of blood and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t tell if she was in a hospital, because if she was it was the quietest one she\u2019d ever been in, and the darkest. She could barely see across the room, but that was partially due to the gauze still covering half her face and the blood in her eye. She tried to blink it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still trying to figure out where she was when she heard an all too familiar voice from the corner of the room. \u201cHey Vic,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout damn time you woke up.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She remembered the day she\u2019d met Lyle \u201cTex\u201d Liddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d been hitting on Jezibel, because everyone hit on Jezibel, but he had this look on his face that seemed like he didn\u2019t even want to be talking to her. She got a bad vibe off him, and no matter how much she wanted to like him, she found that she just couldn\u2019t. If she were really a wolf her hackles would be raised and she would be growling every time he walked in the room. He hadn\u2019t given any of them a reason not to, but everyone knew instinctively that this was a man not to turn their back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked like he was trying to be the goddamn Marlboro man, his blonde hair hidden under a brown Stetson and a cigarette hanging from between his lips. He looked like he hadn\u2019t shaved in a couple days and he completed the look with dirt smudges on his jeans and on his brown snakeskin boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what they say about Texans\u2026\u201d he said, winking at her as he leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat they\u2019re compensating for something?\u201d  Victoria said, stopping next to Jez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at her and the look sent shivers down her spine. It wasn\u2019t mean or irritated, it was just appraising. She remembered hearing about some girl a few years ago who\u2019d let her boa constrictor sleep in her bed with her. After a while the snake started sleeping stretched all the way out next to her, and then it had stopped eating. She took it to the vet, and it turned out the snake was sizing her up to see if he could swallow her whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what she saw when Lyle Liddle looked at her. He was a snake, trying to see if he could swallow her whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyle,\u201d she said. She forced herself into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked almost exactly as he had that first day she\u2019d met him, though there were a lot more scuffs on the snakeskin boots, and the Marlboro man was short a cigarette or three. He leaned forward into the dim light when she said his name and she saw a wicked scar running from the corner of his lip up towards his eye. \u201cHow you been?\u201d he asked, and the deadness of his eyes made her wonder if he really even cared if she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had better days,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled dryly. \u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d she began. \u201cAre you the one I have to thank for Jumbo\u2019s visit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed again, reaching into his pocket for a cigarette. \u201cYou\u2019re a quick one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She couldn\u2019t tell if it was sarcasm or not, so she didn\u2019t say anything, waiting for him to answer. He ignored her for the moment, sticking the cigarette in his mouth and flicking his zippo open. A tiny flame shot to life and it gave her a better view of the room for a split second. There was no carpeting or windows, and she was getting the impression from the giant vent in the ceiling that this was no apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he snapped the lighter closed, studying her through the haze of smoke. \u201cWhat did Elias want with you?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. She couldn\u2019t help herself, and even when it turned into a cough she kept laughing. \u201cRight, so you admit you send that fucking monstrosity to beat the shit out of me, and then you expect I\u2019ll start talking as soon as you drag me back to your bachelor pad? What the fuck, Lyle?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t blame a guy for trying, but alright. How about quid pro quo then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat works more in your favor than mine, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, shaking cigarette ash out on the floor. \u201cSo he didn\u2019t even tell you why he\u2019s looking for me, did he?\u201d He shook his head, clucking his tongue in mock disappointment. \u201cElias is looking for me because he wants what I have, and he doesn\u2019t want the Big Bosses to get it first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d she said. \u201cElias isn\u2019t stupid enough to try and cross them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cYou think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the problem. She didn\u2019t think Elias would try and double cross the organization, but she didn\u2019t know for sure. She also couldn\u2019t tell if Lyle was lying to her because if he was a master of anything, it was that. He was considered a snake for a lot of reasons, not just because of his Shifter form, and not just because of those stupid fucking boots. \u201cAlright,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do I have to tell you so that I can get out of here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, and he tried to make it pitying but it just came out mocking. \u201cCan\u2019t let you go right now, Vic. Sorry. My other associates would probably be pretty pissed if they even knew you were alive after seeing me here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cThen they can go ahead and just fucking try to kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed again, spinning the butt of his cigarette off onto the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d win. Most of them are just goddamn suits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow nice for them,\u201d she snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, leaning forward. \u201cListen Victoria, I always liked you the best, so I don\u2019t want this to go badly. I just really, really need you to tell me what Elias wanted from you. Was he trying to hire you back? Does he have the old team looking for me? Does he have the backing of the Big Bosses\u2026 never mind, scratch that last one, you wouldn\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t. But seriously here Vic, if you want me to try and help you out, you\u2019re going to have to throw me a bone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speech almost worked on her. If she didn\u2019t know him any better she might have believed him. He looked so desperate and scared. She wondered again what he\u2019d taken that was so important, and if maybe he was telling the truth about Elias. If he was, he might honestly be her best shot at getting out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if he was lying, the Big Bosses would bring hell down on him, and her for trusting him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vic took a good long look at Lyle. She wasn't sure if she trusted him. She wasn't sure if she ever had. But he'd been like family once and that had to count for something. She wasn't sure if he'd ever felt the same, but back in the days, he'd give people looks that she just couldn't figure out. He'd given Alexey many of the strange looks, usually when the Fox Shifter had been making fun of Texas or cowboys or something to try and rile Lyle up. He'd given the look to Jez a few times when she seemed oblivious to his charm. He'd give it to Simon just once, when he'd beat the fuck out of some guy for almost killing Lyle. He'd given Vic the look many times and she couldn't remember what she'd done to garner it. But he was looking at her with that look right now. And she thought she finally understood what it meant. It was admiration. And it wasn't something he gave out often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd looking into those god damn yellow snake eyes right now, she could see it. She could see it clearly. He admired her for taking a beating and still ticking. She wondered if she was going to disappoint her when she agreed to help him. She hoped not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're fucking lying to me, or if you fucking betray me, I'll kill you, so help me god,\" she dug out, staring at him with her one eye to make sure he knew she wasn't kidding around. His brow rose in feigned surprise, but she watched his face for signs of disappointment or other emotions. He didn't seem phased. He seemed happy. And they both knew what she meant, even if Lyle wasn't 100% sure on what Elias had told her, he already knew the answer. He just needed verbal confirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he hurt the team or got any one of them killed with whatever stunt he was trying to pull off, she'd fucking kill him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle snorted and pulled out another cigarette. He lit it and then made a half hearted crossing motion over his heart. \"I swear, Vic,\" he grinned and the words sounded slimy, and she tried to convince herself that he was telling the truth. She had doubts. But she didn't have a choice. \"Tell me what Elias told you and I'll help you out of here and that'll be the last you see of me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe highly doubted that, but she narrowed her eye and whispered to him anyway. \"He signed me up to retrieve you and whatever the fuck you stole from the Big Bosses.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else did he get?\" he demanded, apparently done joking around. Damn, he must really be needing answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The team,\" she answered simply, trying not to feel like she was betraying them. She didn't want to say their names outloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle raised an eyebrow. \"All of them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones that fucking count.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snorted and the grin was back on his face. He leaned back in his chair, pulling the cigarette from his lips to tap the ash on the ground. He seemed to be thinking and Vic gave him some time. She had questions of her own, but she knew Lyle was the dominant one in this situation. She didn't want to push. She didn't want to make him mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle's voice was quiet when he spoke. \"He's going to get them killed.\" The drawl was thick in his voice and Vic had to pause a moment because the words and the way he said them were so...unnatural on his tongue that she wondered if there was a speaker in the room and someone else had said them. There were truth to these words, and it made her wonder if she'd ever heard actual emotion come from him before. Lyle's eyes came up to meet hers for a moment before he leaned forward, face falling a bit. \"The people I work for now, they won't hold back, Vic. They'll kill the team, all of them. And they'll make it bloody, just to prove a point to Elias.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you work for?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had the decency to laugh. \"Sorry, Wolfe, that's a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to talk to them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle snorted. \"Not gonna happen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have information about the team,\" she found herself saying before she had a chance to think her plan through. \"I can tell them how they work, how they operate. I want in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle sighed, seeming to catch on to what she was trying to do. \"Vic, I have all the same information.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"Not like me. I know how Elias works. I was his second in command for a year, I know how he operates, I know how'll he command the team. Let me talk to them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going to work,\" and he almost sounded sorry that he even had to tell her that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want in, let me talk to them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle ran a hand over his face and Vic watched him think. She hoped she knew what she was doing. She hoped she could talk to his new employers, get the scoop on what he stole, infiltrate from the inside and protect the team. How, she'd figure out later. Right now, she just needed Lyle to get her to the employers. He shook his head. \"If they've already signed on, they're already dead, Vic,\" Lyle let out slowly. She bit her lip. \"No matter what you think you can do, they won't let the team walk away. If they signed the paper, they're done. They're the walking dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed her for a few more moments before he turned and left without another word. She could only lean back and hope she knew what she was doing. </span></div></div>",

She was in a terrible bargaining position right now and she knew it, but at least she had that tiny scrap of information that he wanted and maybe it would keep her alive. She felt the bandages shift around her midsection and the terrible warm, wet sensation of blood beginning to trickle down her side. If he decided to come after her now she might not win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Tex,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I trust you about as far as I can throw you right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. It really is.\u201d He sighed and leaned back in his chair and he was digging for another cigarette. \u201cI thought maybe we could help each other here. I thought maybe you of all people would understand\u2026\u201d He sighed, lighting up and blowing smoke at her face. \u201cThere\u2019s a revolution coming Vic, and it\u2019s coming faster than you know. People are a thing of the past, we are the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her eyebrow at him. \u201cRight and you\u2019re going to usher in the new era? That\u2019s all bullshit Lyle. You don\u2019t care about the world or the people in it. Why don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s really in it for you? Is it money? Jesus, who the fuck trusted you enough to steal from the Big Bosses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. \u201cTell me what Elias said, and I\u2019ll tell you. Who\u2019s he got looking for me and where are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head at him. \u201cNot going to happen, Tex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, standing up from the chair and heading towards the door. His snakeskin boots clicked loudly on the cement and the sound felt so final in the stillness. He paused with his hand on the latch and glanced over his shoulder at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it came to this, you know? If you\u2019d just told us what you knew in your apartment we could have left you there instead. Maybe you could have gotten out of this in one piece.\u201d Then he yanked the door open, waving a hand at her from over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them not to mess up what\u2019s left of your face too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lyle,\u201d she called. He paused in the doorway and his snake eyes slid over his shoulder to meet her one good one. \u201cDo you think you can trust your associates? Do you honestly think they won\u2019t betray you too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019ll worry about me, Wolfe. You just worry about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he was gone, the door snapping shut behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a hurried breath and then started to roll out of the bed. Her movement stopped abruptly when she felt something tug on her ankle. She jerked her foot again and heard metal banging against metal. \u201cFuck,\u201d she growled, ripping the sheets of the bed to reveal a chain running from her leg to the end of the bed. The thing was freaking huge, each link about as big as her thumb, and she would have smiled if she weren\u2019t so annoyed. At least they weren\u2019t underestimating her, for all the good it was doing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and dropped the sheets back down. Her arms were stinging now, all the little cuts and scraps whimpering in silent protest with every movement. Her head was starting to hurt and a tentative touch to her skull came away bloody. They\u2019d bandaged her up at least, though it sounded like that wasn\u2019t going to last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you Lyle,\u201d she growled darkly, yanking on the chain. Fuck him and fuck Elias. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouldn\u2019t have taken the contract. Maybe if she\u2019d just told him to go to Hell like she wanted then she wouldn\u2019t be here now. Then again, maybe she would still be here with an even smaller idea of what was happening. She pressed her heels to her eyes, trying to focus enough to untangle the mess. There were at least two major parties involved, plus Elias and Lyle and she couldn\u2019t figure out which one of them was really on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to get out of here and find the Big Bosses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished Simon or Alexey were here. They would figure out a way to get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jezibel was here she\u2019d be able to tell what was going on. Jez was good at seeing through all the bullshit to the person underneath. That was part of the reason she and Vic had been friends when anyone else probably would have been scared off early on. The girl had a knack for understanding what made people tick, and she had never hated Lyle, even if she never trusted him. She would have been able to tell Vic whether or not he was telling her the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter because none of them were here. She was on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the door open and she pulled herself off the bed, trying to keep it between her and whoever was in the doorway. \u201cGet the Hell away from me,\u201d she said, and she almost hoped it was Lyle again because at least he\u2019d just talked to her and she had a bad feeling about whoever was here now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man came into the room. He never turned the lights on, but the dim glow from the hallway illuminated a briefcase in his hand. For a second she thought it was a fucking suit and then she realized that it probably didn\u2019t contain paperwork. \u201cPlease sit down, Miss Victoria,\u201d and his voice was cold and smooth. She watched him set the case down on a metal table and undo the snaps and her heart thundered rapidly in her chest when she saw the collection of tools and needles inside. He was a goddamn torturer. Lyle had sicced a fucking torturer on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d she said, her voice stronger than she felt. He laughed, and snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second form appeared in the doorway, and a groan escaped her throat. \u201cDidn\u2019t I already kill you?\u201d she asked Jumbo, and the torturer laughed quietly. He stepped out of the shadows and she could see his face now. She didn\u2019t recognize him, but then she hadn\u2019t expected to. There was a needle held up in one hand and his eyes were cold shards of glass in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack on the bed, if you please,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled back, crouching into the best fighting position she could manage with that goddamn chain around her ankle. She felt the blood began to ooze down her side and she felt all her cuts stretch and burn. She couldn\u2019t let them see it, or that the pain in her head was starting to make her dizzy. Weakness was what got people killed. Strength was the only thing that mattered. \u201cWhat part of \u2018fuck you\u2019 did you not understand?\u201d she growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe part where you don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said. Then Jumbo or Jumbo\u2019s fucking clone was in the room and the kick she threw at his chest mattered just as much as it had in her apartment. He knocked it aside, grabbed her by the throat and forced her back onto the bed. She heard the quiet click as handcuffs closed around her wrists and then she felt something piercing her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to cry out. She bit the sound off of her tongue and tasted blood in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumbo\u2019s hand covered her mouth and she heard the torturer again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold still,\u201d he said. He was smiling. \u201cThis will only take a second.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she wasn\u2019t dreaming than it meant it was her voice she heard screaming into the darkened room and her throat that was raw and sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dreaming, and in her dream Simon was brushing the hair from her face. \u201cI miss you,\u201d he said, and she believed him. She was sorry she had left. Even if she didn\u2019t say it out loud, even if she didn\u2019t dare to think it most days, she was sorry she had walked away from all of them. She was just sorry about him most of all. She was sorry she had let herself fall in love with him and sorry that it still hurt after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sorry she couldn\u2019t let him go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was talking, and she didn\u2019t know what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was swimming and she wondered what they had injected her with because it was making her see things and she couldn\u2019t tell the difference between awake and asleep. She blinked hard and there was a man in a suit sitting next to her and his vision blurred. \u201cElias?\u201d she tried to say, and she wasn\u2019t sure if the words actually came out of her lips or if they just floated there in the back of her head like the dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned at her and that looked like Elias. \u201cVictoria,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was I saying to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over the side of the bed and threw up on his shoes and it made her giggle like a little girl. What did Elias want? She couldn\u2019t remember but she thought it was important. Her head was swimming with the pain and the drugs and she felt something piercing her arm and she screamed again. She let the screams come out because the alternative was crying and she didn\u2019t cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Simon could make her cry. When he looked at her with those puppy eyes of his and whispered in the back of her mind \u201cWhy did you leave me?\u201d it made her cry. When he was half asleep and his arm draped over her stomach and his lips pressed tightly against her neck as he whispered \u201cI love you,\u201d in a mumble that promised he wouldn\u2019t remember he\u2019d said it in the morning, it made her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cElias?\u201d she asked again, shaking her head as she tried to clear it. \u201cDid you bring the contract?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward in his chair, and he smelled like smoke. \u201cWhat contract?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head again and this time the world spun around her. She didn\u2019t understand the question, didn\u2019t understand why she hurt so bad and she couldn\u2019t remember where she was. Was she still dreaming? She couldn\u2019t tell anymore. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid Elias, you\u2019re the one that came to me,\u201d she mumbled. She felt numb and her skin was crawling over her bones. With a slow certainty she realized she was high and she didn\u2019t remember taking anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been years since she\u2019d even tried drugs. She\u2019d still been a teenager and then her teeth chattered as she wondered if maybe she was still a teenager or maybe she\u2019d been in a coma for the last ten years and if maybe the whole thing had been a dream. She wondered if Simon was a dream and remembered him asking her that same question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had proved to him they were both alive, why was she so confused?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me again,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted me to look for Lyle,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou were sending me to Cairo\u2026 but he\u2019s not there, he\u2019s here\u2026\u201d her eyes narrowed and she tried to shake the fog from her brain but it just made it worse. Something pricked her fingers and she winced because it hurt more than it should. Her head fell to the side and her left hand lay next to her head. All her fingers were crooked and thick bruises had made the skin swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood trickled down her hand to her arm and she followed the trail of red to her midsection. It had bloomed all over her body and she couldn\u2019t remember where half the cuts had come from. She remembered hitting her television, was that it? Because she didn\u2019t remember breaking her fingers but they looked broken now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smelled smoke again and her eyes rose to Elias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Simon?\u201d she asked. She thought he was supposed to be here and she missed him. She missed him so much that it made her chest hurt and she tried to breath but her lungs were constricted and she felt like crying. Was he okay? Had he been okay after she left or had she just broken him even more? She knew he loved her and that had driven her halfway around the world because she was so afraid to be loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was afraid that maybe he would see past all the bullshit and realize who she really was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was nothing. She was a ghost. She was just a dead shell of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had died once. Someone she had loved had killed her and she was terrified that if she cared about anyone again then she would realize that she had either never come back to life or that all that waited for her was a second death. She wasn\u2019t afraid of dying, but she was afraid of letting someone kill her, inside and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Elias asked her, but she couldn\u2019t remember what they were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him and realized she didn\u2019t recognize him. He didn\u2019t look like Elias anymore, he looked like a slender man with graying hair and he had gloves on. The white gloves were splattered with blood and she wondered whose it was. \u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d she asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and pulled a syringe out of a suitcase. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d he told her, flicking the air bubbles out of it and then he was pressing the needle into her neck. It pinched, but she still felt numb and foggy so she barely winced at the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he leaned down by her ear. \u201cWho else is looking for Lyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and it hurt and turned into a cough. She choked on the blood in her throat and then she was throwing up again and her stomach hurt and her legs and arms and side and her everything hurt. Her head was pounding and there was a red fog over everything. Her right hand came up and played over the scars where her eye used to be and she felt like a broken thing. She was used up and hollowed out and she missed Simon because he made her feel like a person again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking for him. The Big Bosses, Elias, the old crew\u2026he took something\u2026 something important\u2026\u201d she trailed off and stared at the ceiling trying to remember, but Elias had never told her what he\u2019d taken. Lyle himself hadn\u2019t told her and she tried to remember where she\u2019d seen him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head fell to the side and she looked at the nice doctor. \u201cWhat did Lyle take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. Was there anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing, why\u2026? Why don\u2019t you know all this? Wasn\u2019t Elias here? Did you tell him about Jumbo because I was half asleep and he was fucking huge.\u201d She started coughing and her fingers dug into the mattress and as soon as they did pain splintered through her arm and her mind. A sharp cry escaped her lips and it helped to sober her up a little. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d she asked, because she couldn\u2019t remember how she\u2019d gotten here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere had she seen Lyle? Wasn\u2019t he just\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Fuck.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A shock ran through her body and she felt her back arch off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slid open and she could see needles sticking out of her skin, running down her arms and her chest in lines. The shock hit her system again and her muscles jerked violently. Something was on her mouth, running down her throat and she started to choke on it. She tried to cough or swallow and it just hurt. She tried to pull it out with her hand but they wouldn\u2019t move because of the white straps holding her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, why is she waking up?\u201d she heard the voice from across the room, but she didn\u2019t recognize it. The sound of footsteps echoed across the tile and she tried to shake her head and tell them no but she was going into panic mode because she couldn\u2019t move and she was choking.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSomething pierced her skin. She felt numbness flood her and then the blackness came again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slid open. There was a bright light over her head, and she could hear the quiet beeping of a heart monitor next to her. She blinked again, her movements sluggish and slow as she tried to look around the room. White gauze was wrapped around her neck and her abdomen but she couldn\u2019t remember why it was there. Her eyes slipped shut for a moment and she had a sudden flash as she remembered thick fingers digging into her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands started shaking. Oh God, was he here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head fell to the side and she could see a man sleeping in the chair next to her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease no, she thought quietly. She bit her lip so that she wouldn\u2019t cry because he liked it when she cried. It just excited him more, and then he would hurt her more. She took a shaky breath and swallowed down the fear because he liked that too. Sometimes she thought he could smell the fear on her, or maybe he just knew that it was on her all the time. She hated him with all her might and she was afraid to even say the word now because he might wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about closing her eyes and going back to sleep, but then she might just dream about him again. They slid shut anyway and she tried to slow her breathing. Next to her she could hear her own heart rate rising in steady blips. Please, let it not be him. Please don\u2019t let him wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria?\u201d a voice said, but her eyes opened when she realized it wasn\u2019t him. \u201cVictoria Boston?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sat up in his chair and he must have been sleeping because his hair looked ruffled and his suit had wrinkles and creases in it. He adjusted the glasses on his face and licked his lips, trying to put himself back together. \u201cYou are awake,\u201d he said, and he forced a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face fell into a serious mask and he straightened his plain black tie. \u201cI\u2019m your arresting officer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArresting\u2026?\u201d she tilted her head to the side and went to raise one of her hands but she realized it was handcuffed to the bed. \u201cWhat am I being arrested for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked in surprise. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and tried to think. She remembered the hands on her throat, remembered her father forcing his way between her legs. She remembered screaming at him but that just made him hit her harder. Her hands scrambled desperately on the countertop for something, anything that could make it stop because she just wanted it to stop. She had just turned eighteen and she had just come back to get the last of her things and then she would never have to see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered her fingers curling around the knife. She remembered the look on his face when it sunk into his chest, remembered the surprise and fear, and it felt good. For the first time he was the one that was fucking afraid, and even when he hit her across the face and knocked her to the ground she didn\u2019t care, because she had made him afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered stabbing him in the chest again. She must have stabbed him a hundred fucking times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t feel guilty at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething punctured her spine and she arched back off the table again, her eyes fluttering open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling over her head was white, fluorescent lights staring down at her. Her head fell weakly to the side and to her right was a pane of glass. She could see her own reflection on it and there were so many things wrong on what was looking back at her that she couldn\u2019t breathe. Then again, maybe that was because of the tube still coming out of her throat. Needles lined every inch of her and when electricity arced between them, she saw her hands shift into claws and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening to her? Where was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElectrodes had been fastened to her temples. She wondered what happened to her when electricity was shot through them. Maybe that was how they got her whole body to shift. She wondered why she felt a throbbing pain the back of her neck. She wondered how long she\u2019d been here and what they were doing to her and she wondered when she had gotten her left eye back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered who she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to choke on the tube again as her lungs tried to breathe by themselves. She gagged and coughed and this time when she tried to raise her and to pull it out her body actually listened to her. The tube scraped against her throat as she yanked it out and gasped for air. No one was running across the room to stop her and drug her, but she heard the door opening and closing and she wondered how she could hear that from all the way the hell over here, behind two panes of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnakeskin boots clicked on the tile and she felt like that sound was familiar anyway, even if this place wasn\u2019t. Bits and pieces of memory swam at the edge of her mind but she couldn\u2019t pin any of them down. Her hand came up to brush over her left eye and she felt scars leading into a lid and she blinked when her fingers almost touched the iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun and sat on the edge of the table, watching the man enter the room in the glass reflection. She knew him, even if she couldn\u2019t remember his name or where she had seen him before. Recently, she thought, and her eyes narrowed as she tried to place him. He was wrong too, his eyes strange and golden snake eyes. He smelled wrong, smelled like an animal instead of a person and there was something about the way he moved that wasn\u2019t human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a shifter, she remembered. Like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she responded, because she didn\u2019t know what else to say.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAre you going to the bar tonight to celebrate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked up at her and smiled. He was sitting in a chair, lacing his boots up as he got ready to leave for the last time. They all were, gathering their things together and saying goodbyes to all the other folks they\u2019d worked with for the last few years. It felt weird to be saying goodbye after everything they\u2019d been through. They had become a team, a family, and now that the contract was over they would start drifting apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figure Alexey will make me, whether I want to or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and then she reached for her hand, catching his fingers in hers. His smile softened a little and she hated it, because it made her chest hurt. It reminded her of the things she hadn\u2019t told him yet, that she was leaving and not coming back. It reminded her that she loved him, no matter how much she said otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t afford love. She couldn\u2019t afford weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to come over later,\u201d she told him quietly, and his smile widened. He brought her fingers to his lips and brushed them lightly over her skin, eyes never leaving hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a hand slap her on the back. She didn\u2019t manage to even turn around before Alexey was draping himself over her shoulder, a stupid grin on his face. \u201cHey, if you two are all done eye-fucking each other, there\u2019s a lot of drinking to be done and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re the only ones for the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a little shit, you know that?\u201d she said, her arm wrapping around his neck as she grabbed him in a headlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to scream as the blade twisted into her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was being careful not to permanently damage anything, but everything except vital organs was apparently fair game. Two of her fingers were already broken and they throbbed and screamed up her arm and into her brain. Most of her wounds had reopened and she was covered in sweat and blood and pain. Her hands were shaking and she pulled futilely at the handcuffs holding her down. Her wrists were numb from the metal digging into the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did Elias want with you?\u201d he asked, twisting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClouds of white and red burst in front of her eye as she stared at the ceiling. She tried to imagine they were clouds or stars or anything but her brain overloading on pain. She tried to tell herself she\u2019d been through worse, remembering the sensation of claws ripping out her left eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clamps closed down over her middle finger. \u201cWhat did Elias want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head from side to side and bit her lip as she prepared for the crunch that came with snapping bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back arched when it came but the scream never left her throat. She thought maybe Simon would be proud of her. She wondered if Elias had realized she was missing yet and if he would bother to send anyone after her. No one else had known she was in China. Her match had ended yesterday and no one from the arena would bother to look for her for at least a week, if then. No one knew where she was. She didn\u2019t even know where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t depend on anyone but herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out another needle and there was a pinch as it entered her neck. Her vision was beginning to swim and she was seeing all kinds of things around the room that she had to remind herself weren\u2019t really there. For a moment she thought Simon was holding her broken fingers in his and then the sensation was shattered as her index finger cracked. This time the scream pulled its way from her throat and she could hear it echoing back to her across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swam in and out of consciousness, and after a while she couldn\u2019t even feel the pain anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria.\u201d Someone was lightly slapping her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her head over and found herself staring into a pair of wicked gold eyes. They were the fucking snake eyes of Lyle Liddle and she growled and snapped at the hand. He laughed, pulling it back and stepping back away from her. He was digging into his coat pocket for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she blacked out again and then she heard him speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I lied to you Vic.\u201d Lyle was sitting in the chair in the corner of the room again, smoking his Marlboros with his feet propped up on the end of her bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not my favorite. In fact, some times I really fucking hated you. Between you and Welsh, you were always making things worse. You know why?\u201d He laughed and shook his head. \u201cBecause you two never know when to throw a fight. You never know when to just fucking walk away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexey and Jezibel understood, though not as well as I do. Sometimes you just can\u2019t fucking win. Sometimes you just have to throw in the towel and let it go.\u201d He kicked the edge of her bed and the move reminded her of just how sore her body was. \u201cYou were never satisfied until something was dead, and you didn\u2019t fucking care who it was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could\u2019ve told you that would get you in trouble one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to rip your throat out,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just smiled. \u201cThrow this fight,\u201d he told her. \u201cTell me what I want to know and this will all stop. He couldn\u2019t have told you anything that important. He didn\u2019t even tell you what I took.\u201d He sighed and leaned forward. \u201cVictoria, this is the last time I\u2019m going to come here to ask nicely, because honestly you\u2019re starting to piss me off. Tell me what he said and I\u2019ll help you out of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned and there was blood on her teeth. \u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d she told him, spitting blood across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again, shaking his head as he stood up. He walked across the room before hauling his fist back and punching her in the face. She heard a crack as his knuckles met her jaw and the pain seared through her nerves again. Then black flooded back into her good eye and she was gone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blood bubbled from between her lips and she watched it puddle on the floor in front of her eyes. There was light in this room at least and she could see the mangled remains of her hand hit the cement next to her. A quiet whimper slipped from her lips and it was the only sound her raw and bleeding throat could manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt someone land a kick in her gut and a quiet laugh over her head and then the door slammed shut and left her wherever the hell she was. It was a struggle to breath and she felt the world tilting around her, spinning in a slow rotation over her head. She couldn\u2019t remember how long it was since she\u2019d last been conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t remember how long it had been since she hadn\u2019t been in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, strangled groan escaped her lips as she struggled to her knees. A cough wracked her form and she splattered blood across the concrete. Her elbow gave out from under her and she felt it slam against the floor. Another whimper dragged its way from her throat as she crawled her way to the wall. She fell back against it and tried to take stock of her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure how far they\u2019d gone from the last place they\u2019d held her, whether it was out of the country or just a floor down, but this room wasn\u2019t half as nice as the other. There was a hole dug in the corner, presumably the bathroom and other than that it was concrete floors and thick mason walls. There was no window in this room either and the only airflow came from under the thick metal door and the giant vent in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, it was really fucking cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t been aware of it at first because she was still only half conscious, but now that she was aware of it, her teeth began to chatter in her head, goosebumps spreading across her skin. She pulled her mangled hand to her chest and whimpered as the broken fingers brushed her skin. Air hissed out of her lips and it came out in a white plume in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so fucked. For the first time in her life she didn\u2019t honestly know how she was going to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned her head back against the wall and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if she should call Lyle back in. She wondered if she should just tell him what Elias had asked her, because it honestly wasn\u2019t that fucking much that it would compromise everyone. The old crew was hunting him in Cairo. That was it, that was all she knew, and she couldn\u2019t even get herself to tell him that much. What if her saying that put the others in danger? What if just mentioning their names was enough to get them a visit from Jumbo 2.0?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if it was worth it to try and escape. Her eyes traveled up to the vent in the ceiling. Her claws could probably rip the screws off. Maybe she had a chance to escape. Or at least, maybe she wouldn\u2019t if all the fingers on her left hand were broken and there weren\u2019t cuts all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fuck it, it wasn\u2019t like she had any other ideas.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every motion jostled her broken fingers and she had to bite her tongue to keep from crying. She didn\u2019t cry over fucking pain, she was Victoria Wolfe and she was the baddest bitch this side of the planet. She told herself that over and over again, trying not to choke on the blood in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to stop twice to let the room stop spinning and she hated herself for it because the goddamn door was only five feet away. She hated being weak, hated that she felt absolutely helpless in this situation and she didn\u2019t know how to get out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated that she kept wishing Simon was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing was heavy and ragged by the time she got to the door, pouring out from between her lips in thick white plumes. She closed her eyes and rested her forehead against the metal, trying to ignore the chill that shot down her spine and made her teeth chatter. It was so fucking cold here. Where the hell had they taken her, Siberia? She laughed a little because it was better than screaming and then she dragged herself up to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wavered for a moment and she thought she was going to crash back down to the ground. Her fingers dug into the mason wall, trying to hold herself upright long enough for the spinning to stop and the pain to recede back down to a manageable agony instead of this fiery horror that was racing through her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she raised her fist and slammed it against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sent shooting pain up her arm so she did it again and again until she was numb with the shock of it and all she could hear was the rhythmic pounding, over and over again in her brain. \u201cLyle!\u201d she shouted. Her voice was ragged and harsh. She didn\u2019t recognize it as her voice anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyle you dirty fucker, where are you?\u201d She bit down hard on the inside of her cheek because the tears were building in her eyes and she didn\u2019t fucking cry over pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, but this was bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hurt so fucking bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teeth pierced the skin and she felt blood gushing into her mouth in a metallic flood. A harsh cry ripped itself from her throat and she slammed her fist against the door with more force as she howled into the room. \u201cLyle fucking Liddle!\u201d and she didn\u2019t know what else to say because she hated him right now with every piece of her she could spare because the rest of her was made of knives and needles stabbing into her over and over again until she was screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crumpled to the ground when the door opened because it had been the only thing holding her up. She was hauling deep, shaking breaths into her lungs, her whole body shivering now. She wondered if this is what going into shock felt like. She wondered if she was dying. The whole room was tumbling around her now, and in the center of it were a pair of snakeskin cowboy boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused on those and followed them up to the ceiling, where a pair of golden eyes stared down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to make a deal,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a cup of coffee from across the desk and she took it more gratefully than she wanted to. Her body welcomed the warmth, though her stomach probably would welcome the acidic liquid she was pouring into it. They had splinted the fingers, stitched up a couple of the knife wounds, and given her some painkillers. Amazing how quick things turned around when they thought she was giving them what they wanted. Suddenly Lyle was her best friend again, instead of the asshole punching her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at him now, and while he looked like he hadn\u2019t slept in a couple of days he was already doing better than her. He was kicked back in the plush leather chair; his boots thrown up on the desk which she doubted was his. If it was, he probably wouldn\u2019t be getting mud all over the paperwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said from across the desk. \u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded slowly, wincing at the throbbing it started in her head. Most of her was numb thanks to the drugs they\u2019d given her, and it was a sign of how bad off she was that she hadn\u2019t even questioned it. If they wanted to kill her, they would just do it. If they wanted to seriously drug her, they\u2019d just stick more needles in her. Either way she couldn\u2019t stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got three pieces of information for you,\u201d she said. Her eye narrowed. \u201cSo I want three things in return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked. \u201cAlright, what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the coffee cup down on the edge of the desk so that she could lean forward and look him in the eyes. \u201cThe first thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to know what you stole. If I\u2019m in the middle of this clusterfuck I at least want to know what the fight is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \u201cAlright. Maybe I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips and nodded, because that was one of the things she was willing to give up. She didn\u2019t honestly expect him to keep his end of anything but if she could get something out of this it would be better than where she was at before. \u201cThe second thing,\u201d she said, and her voice lowered in case anyone was listening. \u201cI want the fuck out of here. Don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t be done, just tell your associates you fucking shot me and left me in a ditch and let me out the back door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tipped his head back and laughed, cigarette still between his lips. She hoped he died of lung cancer, except shifters couldn\u2019t get cancer anymore. They had too much going on in their bodies as it was. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that. It\u2019s not them I\u2019m worried about, though I don\u2019t want to piss them off. But if the Big Bosses find out I\u2019m alive and the general area I\u2019m at\u2026 well that could get messy for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, rolling her eye back in her head. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to inconvenience you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, his eyes narrowed slits. \u201cNot right now you wouldn\u2019t. What\u2019s the last thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip, wondering if she should tell him now. She wanted his fucking word on this, and it was the one thing she couldn\u2019t compromise on because it was the most important. Even if he betrayed her, even if he didn\u2019t let her go, she had to know that the others would still be safe. The problem was, even asking it of him let him know that they were involved and she couldn\u2019t afford for that to backfire on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t come back on the old crew,\u201d she said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked confused. \u201cWhat do you mean? Why would\u2026\u201d and she saw the moment it dawned on him. He burst out laughing, running his hand through his blonde hair and shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cOh, I\u2019m fucking stupid, I should have caught that to begin with. If he was dragging you into it, I should have assumed the others would be involved somehow too. So they\u2019re the ones he\u2019s got hunting me, huh? Is that one of the things you were going to tell me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bared her teeth at him because she couldn\u2019t quite make it a smile. \u201cYes. And I fucking mean it Lyle, you don\u2019t hurt any of them or I swear to Christ I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll what? Bleed some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d she said, more calmly than she felt. \u201cIf I have to fucking crawl back out of a grave to do it, I will find you and I will rip your fucking head from your shoulders and no one will find the pieces that are left when I\u2019m done with you.\u201d She was breathing heavy because she was getting mad and her fingers were digging into the arms of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still laughing. \u201cYeah, you probably would. Fair enough, what else did you have for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna give me what I asked for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"I suppose there's no reason not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a breath and then she told him. \u201cElias came to me to get me to sign a new contract, just to hunt you down. He told me that Alexey, Jezibel, Simon, Tony, and Delia had already signed up, and when I called him the night you sent Jumbo to visit me he was setting up a flight to Cairo. He said I\u2019d get more information there, but that\u2019s where he planned on looking for you first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, grabbing the coffee cup off the desk. \u201cThe thing I think you\u2019ll be most interested in is that if he really is a traitor, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Big Bosses know about it yet. So you\u2019ve got leverage on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. \u201cAll good things for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are you going to keep your end?\u201d she asked, and she watched his eyes over the cup of coffee. \u201cOr is this the part where you fucking shoot me in the back because if it is at least make it quick.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She was running down the docks with Alexey at her heels. A yacht behind them was still burning and there was debris everywhere. She didn't care. All she cared about was the figure clinging to the end of the dock, half in the water, half out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd jumped into the water beside him, because the closer they got, the better look they got at the hunk of boat that was sticking out of his side and bleeding crimson into the water. He was pale and struggling to pull himself up and he'd always hated the fucking water and why the hell was he even near the yacht when it exploded. He was suppose to be on the other side of the fucking town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Vic hefted him up as Alexey grabbed his arms and together they manuevered him onto the dock, careful of the wood in his side and the lump on his head. He was conscious and that was a good thing. Alexey moved to his side, he'd always been better at first aide, and she took her place craddling his head. She looked down at him as Alexey pulled his phone out to call the team and make sure they had a fucking ambulance ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were dull. She remembered thinking she was going to lose him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate swimming,\" he'd rasped up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd laughed, because if she didn't, she'd cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have asked to be a dolphin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung fucked like a train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was rough and hard and fast and she liked it. She liked that he didn't expect anything from her. She liked that it was just fucking, and not anything more. It had never been anything more with any of the guys she'd been with since <i>him.</i> It probably never would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't sleep with all of her Keepers, because some of them weren't worth it to her, even if it was possible she only had one more day to live when they spent the night at her apartment. She'd have to take her chances. Not like she was a virgin or anything. But with Sung, she was just feeding a primal need that had popped up. And she tried to convince herself of that. She tried to forget what day tomorrow was. Because she'd always fucked Simon on his birthday. And it had always been the best she'd ever had. Because it was more than just fucking. It was love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung rolled over in his sleep and she turned to look at him. His back was facing her and there were new scratches that ran criss cross over his shoulders. Damn, he liked it rough. So did she, though. Tomorrow, she'd go fight. Then she'd probably never see Sung again because he'd be assigned someone else to go play babysitter for. She didn't think he fucked everyone he watched, and not just because some of them were guys, but because he didn't seem the tpe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the clock, she sighed when she realized how late it was. She should be asleep, she should snuggle Sung and just be content there was someone with her on what could possibly be her last night on earth and she should go to sleep. But she couldn't. She couldn't because of what day tomorrow was. It hurt. Because she wondered what he was doing and whether he was thinking of her and whether he was happy. Would anyone call him? Did anyone even talk to him anymore from their old crew? She hoped to god Alexey still did. Because if everyone had abandoned him, then she'd feel ten times worse. And that was saying something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang and she reached out to snatch it quickly, glancing back over her shoulder at Sung. The Tiger Shifter stirred a little, but settled almost immediately. She pulled the phone to her ear and said quietly, \"Yeah?\" Who the fuck was calling her this late? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice on the other end was not one she expected. \"Bitchzilla!\" He was loud and obnoxious and the nickname spiked her heart with anxiety because she hadn't talked to him either since she left. But there was a hint of something else in his voice and she wondered what he'd been up to the past two years. She'd heard he'd been in Russia, playing super hero. Sounded about right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered his voice, trying to be playful, but she could hear the strain and the exhaustion seep through anyway. \"Why are we whispering?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" She ignored his attempts at light heartedness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexey sighed and she pulled herself from under the covers and went into the bathroom, shutting the door with a final glance to Sung, who was still peacefully asleep. She sat on the edge of the tub and put her head in her hands. If Alexey gave in that easily, something was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vic, how fast can you get to the States?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned. \"Why would I want to go to the states?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scoffed. \"Because I'm here, duh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lex,\" she said softly, not in the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pause he gave her was enough to know that she should probably already be packing. Fight be damned. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He really fucking hated interviews. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just something about reporters that grated on Simon's nerves. The way they smiled at you and pretended to be interested in the bullshit spewing from your mouth when really all they wanted was for some tidbit of juicy gossip to slip out so they could exploit it all over tv or in the papers on or the internet. So and so was sleeping with so and so, this person had this addiction, this person was in this rehab, bullshit, bullshit, etc, etc. It's how it went. They'd slide in next to you, be your best friend. You'd open up your heart and the next day everyone and their mothers knew your deepest, darkest secrets. And Simon Welsh didn't like it one fucking bit. Fucking reporters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the American Cage Fighting Association loved interviews. They loved selling off their stars to the tabloids and coming up with some grand schemes and stories to blow out of proportion. Because it put butts in the seats and money in their pockets. The ACFA was good for that. So if they told you to go out there and tell everyone you wore tutu's on Sundays because it made you feel so fucking alive - then you'd better do it. If you didn't, hey, you might find your contract with the association slipping. Maybe your name would stop appearing on the rosters. Or worse of all, maybe they'd ban you from organized fighting rings around the world. So the only action you'd ever see again in your life would be unsanctioned and much less pretty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Simon did his interviews. He gave the public what they wanted and his face was plastered on posters in pre-teen's rooms across the nation. He was allowed to fight in the cage fights. He was given sponsors and had a fan base and people adored him. It was the life of a star, of an athlete, it's what some kids dreamed of becoming when they were younger. Only Simon wished he could throw it all away and be done with. But this sort of contract, you didn't just walk away from. You walk away, you give up your Shifter rights, and they use you as a test subject in some lab - dead or alive, they didn't have a preference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon had been dying. When the research had advanced far enough to allow humans to change their genome and shift between a human state and an animal state and somewhere in between the both, that's why Simon had been dying. Cancer. Spread through his body. No hope of survival. Weeks to live. Dying. The only cure science had found for the damn disease was Shifter genes. Replace the bad ones with the animal ones. He wasn't sure the science behind it all. But he was sure of one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd be dead without the animal inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did what he was told. At first, he'd been enlisted into a contract enforced by the government. Going to boot camp to learn his new skills and abilities, he excelled. He'd been one of the best. They'd agreed and had thrown him onto a mercenary team. The best fucking team around. He didn't regret a day of that contract. Because as terrible as the work was, the team had been family. Literally, in the case of his half brother, who'd been on the team. But the others, he'd die for them. Any of them. But especially her. Especially Vic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe missed her. God, he missed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team had split, a couple years ago and they'd all gone their separate ways. Some had gone off the radar, because their contracts weren't up. They refused to go on to other contracts. Refused to play puppet to some fighting association or side show company. Simon had stayed. The rest had left. And besides a few Christmas cards here and there, he didn't hear from any of them. Not Alexey. Not even Vic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon, tell me what you think about this upcoming fight,\" the reporter broke his thoughts and he looked up, forcing the cocky grin to his face that had become his signature among all the teenage girls who swooned over him. \"Do you think you can beat the Rider brothers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reporters at the press conference waited patiently for Simon to answer, their individual taped to the table in front of him. A few other fighters who were on his \"team\" sat on either side of him, letting their \"star\" handle the questions aimed at him. Simon had no doubt he could beat the Rider brothers in a fight. He'd done it before. But, he stuck to the script he'd been given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you something,\" he said, leaning closer to the mics. \"There is no way that the Rider brothers are walking away from this fight. Because the Big Cat's coming out tomorrow. And he's bringing the pain!\" Simon's teammates on either side let out a war-whoop and he forced his cocky grin to stay on his face. The few fans that had been let into the room who sat behind the reporters started screaming and yelling. A couple security guards had to come over and quiet them. Simon sat back in his chair, letting his teammates answer more questions as he maintained his character. Cool, calm, collected, ready to rumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really fucking hated interviews.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night before his fights, Simon had a ritual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started back when Vic and Alexey and the others were around and they were a family. The night before a mission, they'd get together and watch Kung-Fu movies and drink beer and eat cheesy burritos and listen to each other scold themselves on how unhealthy and ridiculous their pre-mission rituals were. And you'd think they'd wake up the next day and be worse for wear. But they never were. There were never hangovers or re-appearing burritos. There were just focused Shifters and much too much adrenaline for one room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo every night before his fights, Simon would rent a Kung-Fu movie. He'd pop a disgusting frozen burrito into the microwave. He'd crack open a Bud Light. And he'd sit on his couch alone, half watching a movie he'd seen a million times while trying not to choke on the food or the beer or the emptiness of the room. Sometimes he'd picture Vic and Alexey going at it. Fighting about some mundane topic like health care or muscle cars. Because whatever Vic said she liked or agreed with, Alexey would disagree and dislike. Simon knew his brother did it just to rile Vic up. Hell, he'd do it too if he wasn't certain she'd knock him unconscious to just shut him up. Vic always had a soft spot for Alexey. But she never seemed to hold back with him. He always thought it was because she was afraid of breaking Alexey's scrawny ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory, or the dream, whichever it was, made Simon laugh as he sat alone on his couch with a half-eaten burrito in one hand and a beer in the other. Some guy was getting his ass handed to him on the television and all Simon could think about was how empty the goddamn room was. He never thought they'd leave, like they did. He never thought that one night they'd say goodbye and disappear, just like that, without looking back. He understood why they did it. They'd said a long, long time ago that when their contracts with the government were up there was no way they'd be sold to some ridiculous other contract. Not like Simon and his showmanship association. They did real work. They did real fighting. They left like they said they would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head to eye the picture on the coffee table, Simon rolled his eyes. He kept the team picture there. Him, Vic, Alexey, Jez, even fucking Lyle. There were others too. Bull, whose real name was Tony, and some rookies they'd conned into standing with them to make them look big and tough. Everyone was smiling. Even Vic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod he was lame. He chuckled soberly at himself as he leaned forward and set his food and drink down. Who would of thought this is where he'd be. He hated how he came to these dark places before a fight. How he lived in the past and couldn't seem to get a grip on the future. Maybe it's because he didn't like the here and now. He didn't like what he'd become and that he couldn't escape it. He couldn't go fight bad guys in Russia with Alexey. He couldn't go do whatever the hell Vic was doing wherever the hell she was. He'd tried to keep track of her when she left, but she'd always been good and covering her trail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door had Simon running a hand over his eyes to clear them of whatever it was that was stinging at them and threatening to spill over - because it wasn't crying, he didn't fucking cry - and glancing at the clock. It was late, pass 1:00 in the morning. Whoever was interrupting his pre-fight ritual had better have a damn good reason to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, he walked to the door and yanked it open, not bothering to look through the peephole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it was a mistake the moment he saw the person on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baseball bat hit the side of his head with a force that sent him into the wall and onto the floor before he could catch himself. He'd seen it coming and only quick reflexes kept him from getting the full brunt the attack had meant to hold. It was a glancing blow off his cheek, but still sent him to the ground, dazed and seeing stars. He tried to push himself up, even before the cobwebs cleared. Years of fighting and taking hits like this, maybe not as hard but similar nontheless, conditioning him to keep going. He'd gain his bearings while the ref held the other guy off. Oh wait...there was no ref. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second blow caught him square in the back just as he was raising himself off the ground. It sent him back to the hardwood floor with a grunt that stole away his breath. He felt as though his chest had turned to stone, refusing to draw in air while a firey agony exploded between his shoulders. He coughed, expelling air, painful and slow and ripping out of his throat. He sucked in a gasp, equally as tricky and painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eyes, he saw his attacker drop the baseball bat. Simon thought about grabbing for it, but his new concussion and shock to his lungs slowed his reaction time. A pair of black boots came into sight and he tried to roll his head so he could see who was standing over him. A boot greeted him in the face instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\" Simon growled, breath still struggling. His face and chest were on fire. The left side of his face felt broken and he wasn't sure but he thought maybe his left eye was swollen shut. When he moved his arm, his back flared with pain. Another boot to the face split his lips and shattered his nose. He cried out, only to have someone grab his hair and roughly jerk his head back, hand covering his mouth. He tasted blood, draining back from his nose and coming in from his lips. Tears came unbidden to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny, the only thing he could think of at the moment was how much shit he'd get from Vic if she ever found out he'd let him get his ass handed to him. Excuses ran through his head. Like maybe he hadn't expected to be attacked at 1:00 in the morning. Maybe the beer had slowed him down. Maybe the burrito had clogged his arteries and not enough blood was getting to his brain. She'd probably laugh at that one. Then smack him upside the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished she was here. He wished she had never left. He wished he could tell her how much he loved her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's head was slammed into the floor once, then twice, and on the third time, his world went dark and he swore he could hear Vic somewhere out there in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd man, she sounded pissed. </span></div></div>",

He'd confessed that to Alexey once, when they were both drunk, and the fucker had the nerve to make some stupid G.I. Joe comment and Lyle had decided that from then on, he'd keep his own personal wants and desires to himself. Fucking Romanova, he should have kicked his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle hadn't thought about that cobra comment for a long time, but in Egypt, he was reminded of it constantly. There were snake charmers bascially on every corner of the fucking street. Anywhere he went, someone was playing a pipe or kissing a cobra or doing something else with the most deadliest snake in the world that no one in their right mind would do. Lyle thought about showing them what a real snake looked like and shifting in front of them. He wondered how many Egyptians he could get to crap their stupid robes. The thought made him laugh. He shut up though, because then he realized that was something that Alexey would come up with, and there was no way he was going to laugh at something that little prick would laugh at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years. It seemed like longer. Two years since Victoria Wolfe's contract was up and she'd walked out on the team. Lyle always thought that was the beginning of the end for them. Simon still had a few months left on his contract. Alexey's ended the same day Victoria's had, and Lyle and Jezibel still had a year left each. Lyle hadn't stuck around, though. Simon had turned into an emo bitch, while the others said every day how they couldn't believe she'd just leave. Lyle got sick of it and a month later he'd left. Simon and Jez finished up their contracts and had taken on some ridiculous ones after that. Jez maybe just renenewd hers, Lyle couldn't be sure. She seemed like the type to stick around with the Big Bosses watching over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd came after him at first. The Big Bosses didn't like contract breakers and they'd sent bounty hunters after him to either bring him back or take him out. They'd almost succeeded in both, several times. But an \"almost\" was still a failure. Because Lyle wouldn't go back to them, ever. He'd slit his own fucking wrists before he went back to those bastards. And now, he'd found something ten times better to look forward too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTreasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded ridiculous every time he said it. He knew the others would laugh at him if they got the chance, but in all honesty, once they say the type of money he brought in with his so called treasure, they'd shut their fucking mouths, that was for sure. He'd come to Cairo with a few other Shifters who had ended their contracts early. They were a rough sort and Lyle seemed to fit right in with them. He wouldn't exactly call himself a bad guy, because he'd never done anything like kill a guy who didn't deserve it. But he wasn't exactly an upstanding citizen, either. He was greedy and he was slimy and he lied every other word out of his mouth. Maybe that's why Diego and Vanya liked him. They were just like him and neither of the three trusted each other and it was a mutual and respectful relationship - with the chance of being backstabbed made very clear from the beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego was a Dingo Shifter, and that made Lyle laugh on a daily basis. Vanya had eagle in him. Lyle had always liked the avian shifters. They were a different class of style altogether. Jezibel had been avian, an owl. She'd been graceful and seductive and altogether deadly. Vanya wasn't graceful or seductive, but Lyle had seen him kill a man and he had to admit, talons were way fucking cooler than claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie-del,\" Diego's Mexican accent rang out and Lyle sighed, not bothering to look up from the drink he had in front of him. They said it was homemade whiskey, but he thought it tasted a lot like Jim Beam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pronounced Little,\" he drawled out in his Texan accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man snorted and took a seat next to Lyle, who gave him a half grin before ordering a round of drinks for both of them, an extra one for Vanya when he showed up, because Lyle didn't want to hear the fucking Russian bitch and moan about not having a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex,\" Diego said, drawing Lyle's gaze towards him. \"I think I found what we've been looking for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle scoffed. \"That's bullshit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego raised an eyebrow, confused. \"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bullshit,\" Lyle repeated. \"If you found it, you wouldn't be here. You'd be out trying to get it for yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mexican laughed and Lyle couldn't help but smile. \"That'd be true, if I didn't think it's going to take all three of us to pull this off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle snorted. \"Are you going to shoot us in the backs when we get it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, I'll bring my glock. We can have a shoot out. It'll be fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed and clinked glasses before downing their shots like it was some funny joke and light banter that passed between them. But they were both aware that if at any time one of them deemed the other two unnecessary for this job, or future jobs, they wouldn't hesitate to kill the others. Luckily, so far, the \"future jobs\" part was what kept the blood from spilling. They hadn't scored anything big enough to retire happily yet. But once they did, it was a mutual agreement that their partnerships would be over and that meant there would be two bodies and only one rich sonofabitch in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle only hoped he would be the rich sonofabitch and not a body. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alexey hated the snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy the hell he ever moved to Russia was beyond him. It seemed to snow every day, no matter what time of year it was. He wasn't sure if that's how this country was suppose to be, but it's how it was. Maybe the weather had just been bad because he was in town and the world was entirely working against him. He didn't know. He didn't care. He just knew he hated the fucking snow. And he was getting damn tired of this stupid country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't have a choice. He couldn't exactly turn around and tell his contractors that he wanted to walk away because he hated the weather. They'd probably laugh at him and then put a bullet in him. That's why he liked them. Well, liked was a loose term. That's why he was entertained by them. They kept things interesting. The only contract was less entertaining. A bunch of suits with sticks up their asses. Kill this person, steal this stuff, retrieve this information, blah blah blah. At least with bounty hunting things staying interesting. Mercenary work was...predictable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did miss his old team, though. His new team was a bunch of amateurs and he was the only Shifter. The only one held to a contract so the no one stuck around long. They got their feet wet in Russian bounty hunting and then moved on, because they weren't required to stick around and they definitely weren't required to enjoy it. Not like Alexey was. Not like he had ingrained himself to be. So he considered himself a solo artist, with some back up singers every once in a while. He couldn't count on them because one day he may have someone with years of experience at his back and the next day he's got a rookie fresh out of basic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes he missed having people he could trust. People he could count on. People he could call friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon, Victoria, Jezibel, Lyle. Well, maybe not so much Lyle, he'd always been a prick. But the others, for sure. Simon because he was his half brother. Victoria because she was just a badass. And Jezibel because she was fucking hot as hell. And they were a family. But, using the term loosely, because he didn't really want to call Jez family, just in case, you know? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you showed up.\" The voice caught him off guard and he turned quickly to look behind him. His employer was walking towards him, through the few inches of snow accumulated on the ground. He had his hands stuffed into his coat pockets and there was a furry god awful looking hat on his head. Alexey snorted. Russian fashion, he'd never understand it. Although, it was probably warmer than his own wimpy hat. He frowned. Dammit, now he wanted a stupid furry hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and threw his cigarette to the side. Simon had always told him smoking was bad for him. Ever since they were teenagers and Alexey had gotten into the \"dark side\" of beer and cigarettes. Simon had always been the healthy one. But with an unusual obsession with tattoos. He'd still eaten healthy, worked out and stayed in shape. Alexey had gone the opposite route, although still maintained he had a nice body, even if he was a little skinny in some places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny how it had been Simon who'd wound up with a fucking brain tumor, even with his obsession with being healthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, there was nothing funny about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been here for twenty minutes,\" Alexey complained half heartedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Employer grinned and came to stand next to him. \"Fucking cold,\" he said and pulled an envelope from his coat, handing it to Alexey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fox Shifter looked at it for a moment, keeping it closed. \"You know, I was thinking about suggesting moving this little operation of ours to warmer climates. I hear Costa Rica is a nice place for criminals and heathens.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with that,\" the man grit out, shivering a little. He'd probably made a half dozen other stops to bounty hunters before he'd gotten to Alexey. He didn't envy the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the envelope, Alexey reached inside and pulled out the picture of the person he was supposed to hunt. He quirked a brow and looked to his Employer, grin on his face, though it was timid and unnatural. \"You're joking, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gave him a pointed look. \"I don't fucking joke when it's this damn cold out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grin faded quickly from Alexey's face and he turned back to the picture. \"Shit.\" </span></div></div>",

The world now had the technology to cure cancer, escape disease, and create a new kind of human altogether. Though some had trouble admitting they were human at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started simply, merging pig genes with that of a human. The human body seemed to accept pig tissue more than any other creature. But technology grew and experiments grew more complex. It changed from just replacing human hearts with pig hearts and went to replacing entire chromosomes, changing the human genome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earliest experiments had no choice but to take on a half human half animal form after their genes were spliced. Many were scrutinzed and even unaccepted by the public eye. So scientists began to develop a way of switching between human and animal form. Thus began a new sub-race of humans known as the Shifters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifters began finding a new role in society. From entertainers to soldiers to criminals. It is the Shifters now who will mold our future. It is the Shifters now who will save us from ourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~***~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Characters:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Victoria Wolfe - <span class=\"cgrey\">Wolf shifter.</span></b> Brown hair, golden eyes.

She's always down to business but only if it's something worth her time. She's constantly appraising people and only surrounds herself with people she feels deserve to be there. But even though she is distant from most, she is extremely dedicated to the people she cares about and will do anything to protect them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Location:</b> Beijing, China<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Occupation:</b> Death Match Cage Fighter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Simon Welsh - <span class=\"cplum\">Black Panther Shifter.</span></b> Short black hair, green eyes. He has tattoos that span the length of both arms and wrap around his back, also on his calves. He's light hearted and good humored. Though he tends to stay on the quiet, reserved side, he can really let loose when around friends. He's muscled and good in a fight. He tends to hide it when he's hurt or upset, instead playing it off with a smile or a joke. He's good at what he does, but seems to attract trouble and violence. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Location:</b> New York, New York<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Occupation:</b> American League Show Fighter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lyle \"Tex\" Liddle - <span class=\"cgreen\">Viper Shifter.</span></b> Sandy blonde hair, yellow eyes. His most famous quote: \"It's pronounced Little.\" He is uppity, self-centered, sneaky and like his animal counterpart suggests, slimy. You never know if he's on your side or not, and that constant doubt and questioning usually keeps people at arms length, never getting close. He talks slowly, calculating his words. On his good days, he can have the humor of a clown. On his bad, he'll shoot his best friend in the head.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Location:</b> Cairo, Egypt<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Occupation:</b> Tomb-raider, thief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jezibel Givessi - <span class=\"cteal\">Snowy White Owl Shifter.</span></b> Bleach blonde hair, sky blue eyes.
