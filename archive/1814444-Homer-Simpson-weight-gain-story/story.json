Pawing through the cupboards, Homer couldn't find anything that really took his fancy, sure there were pork rinds and beer and many other treats but they were not filling enough to get his weight goals on the go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer thought to himself 'Hmmm what should i do?' </span></div></div>",

He put on one of those weight loss shows, where the contestants start out huge and end up slightly less huge. Homer shook his head. \"Those guys don't know what they're missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer made several trips from the kitchen to the couch to the bathroom and back to the couch, letting his pants unbutton and eventually just lounging around in his briefs.

Homer shouted, he ran back inside launching himself at the cupboards, ripping some of the doors of their hinges just to get at the food inside. He ate everything he could get his hands on and his belly just wouldn't be satisfied, food flew at his mouth and down into his expanding belly that just seemed to be turning everything into fat, it didn't even spend time in there to digest it just turned straight into fat, making his belly and love handles bigger, softer and very wobbly. However in comparison to his very large middle, the rest of Homer had stayed the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for the last remnants of a cake mix he found at the back of the cupboard, Homer threw the packet on the floor and grabbed his belly. 'Uhhh, so.....HUNGRY!!!!' Homer shouted again, pushing over the fridge in anger that his belly hadn't been amply stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe marched into the living room in time to see an advert for Pizza on the TV. He grabbed the phone and dialled 'Hello?! So hungry....I want everything!!.....YES EVERYTHING!!! Belly....needs food....I don't care about cost...JUST HURRY UP AND DELIVER TO 742 EVERGREEN TERRACE' Homer slammed down the phone and waited for his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly two hours went by and Homer was getting hungrier by the second! 'DAMMIT WHERE IS MY FOOD!!!!!!!!!' Homer wailed as his belly growled louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came at the door, Homer rushed over. His belly bouncing and wobbling with delight as he went, 'Yes?!' Homer said trying to stay calm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ummmm someone ordered.....everything' the young Pizza delivery guy said. 'Yes...i'm hungry' Homer said rubbing his extremely empty belly, the delivery driver began to carry all the food into the house. Homer couldn't help but notice that the Delivery Driver was quite fat, his belly bounced with each stepped and his work attire was far too small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer licked his lips, to which the Pizza Boy noticed, 'you want this?' The boy said slyly grabbing a pizza box, and holding it at belly level 'yes....oh god yes!'

Homer said, 'Well open up fatty!' the Pizza boy said, he folded the pizza up into one big cylinder of cheese, dough, tomato and meat. Homer opened wide and let the pizza boy drop the pizza in, but that was it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Homer swallowed the pizza, he tasted something wonderful and it was coming from the delivery boy. Without hesitation homer clamped his mouth shut and began licking his hand 'that's right, suck off all the grease, let it trickle down into your huge belly' The delivery boy said whilst smacking homers belly. Homer didn't need telling twice, he began to suck harder as the boys arm disappeared into his mouth 'Hey easy there! That hurts!' The boy said as he tried to pull his arm out, but homer wouldn't let him 'Hey come on! Let go!!' Homer just shuck his head as he sucked even harder, the boy flew forward and hit homers belly making homer wobble and moan, homer grabbed the boy by his uniform and ripped it off him as he stood there naked and scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer knew it was time, sucking even harder the boy began to lift off his feet 'no! No please!! Don't eat me!! NOOO!' the boy began to scream, as his head entered Homers mouth. Homer kept sucking as the boy slowly disappeared into his mouth, his cries becoming muffled as he fell further down his throat, but he kept kicking and pawing at homers belly in some vain attempt at getting some footing to pull himself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer finally reached the point he had been waiting for, the delivery boys large belly! He had fitted in easily up to this point but at around 18 years old and a good 250 lbs, homer had his work cut out for him to get this into his mouth. He tried sucking harder but the boys belly was just too much. That's when homer remembered the food he had ordered! All that fatty food, just sat there dripping with grease. He bent down with great difficulty and began rubbing the boys belly with burgers, pizzas and all sorts of fatty foods to grease him up real good. Homer tried sucking again and opening his mouth as wide as he could, and inch by inch the fat belly in front of him began to enter his mouth! This made homer grunt in delight as he rubbed his own growing belly and began to pay special attention to the belly entering his mouth as he licked it up and down. Homer sat on the stairs, letting his belly hold up the boy as he played with his belly. Each inch the boy disappeared made homers belly notch ho, pushing the boy higher and easier to swallow. This was all getting too much for homer as it turned him on with every second, he grabbed the boys large ass and began to push hard, forcing him further in until his ass and belly were in his mouth and with that, homer tilted his head back and swallowed hard as he watched the legs of his meal vanish into his belly forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer lay back, in shock and breathless as his immense belly shook up and down with the boy frantically panicking inside. He began to laugh at what he had just done and began rubbing his now enormous belly in circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer sat there in ecstasy as he said '........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began to laugh at what he had just done and began rubbing his now enormous belly in circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer sat there in ecstasy as he said 'I think I might have over done it', he moaned as his belly still bounced around with the boy struggling but this only served to make Homer moan louder and become increasingly horny. With extreme effort he tried to reach mini Homer but his belly was just so big now that all the fat just got in the way and he couldn't reach it properly, but this gave Homer an idea as he began to push his belly down and thrust upwards into the underside of his belly. It was sheer bliss for Homer, he couldn't stop himself and began to breathe heavily as he bumped faster and faster, his belly bouncing high and slamming down on top of him. Homer resisted the urge of relief for five minutes but the pleasure got so intense he had to release all over the underside of his fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there breathless Homer muttered 'that.....was.....incredible', it was at this point his belly began to growl. The pleasure of the last five minutes at distracted Homer from the belly shaking of his living meal but it looked like he was now a part of Homer completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'oh god...the hunger is starting again, but no! That was a one off! I couldn't eat anyone else. Besides, I have all this pizza....mmm pizza.....pizza dripping with grease.....pizza to fill my belly.....pizza for guys like me.....fat guys wanting to fill their beautiful bellies of all sizes.....fat guys who are probably waiting for their order right now' Homer said rubbing his belly and drooling, Homer's belly growled loudly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one huge push, Homer managed to get himself vertical. His belly completely free of the restraints of clothing, his white top rested firmly at his now ample moobs, his belt had burst a long time ago and his pants rested below his belly, unbuttoned and so tight they would have to burst off to remove them. It took Homer a few minutes to get used to his size and how to walk, he waddled from side to side, his belly bulging out with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer grabbed the hat of the pizza boy and the keys to his delivery car. He went and sat in it with sheer difficulty, his belly firmly pushed up against the wheel and the car basically hitting the road below it, but Homer would find a way. He looked at the next destination on the boys list and began to drive there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car, Homer grabbed some empty pizza boxes from the backseat that the boy had clearly ingested prior to getting to Homer. He walked up to the house and rang the doorbell, Homer began to get excited as the door slowly opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was...a man around 5ft10, fairly well built with large arms and pecs, an extremely tight long sleeved shirt and at his middle a big beautiful ball belly, so firm looking and Homer could see the outline of his deep belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pizza delivery' Homer said, 'you aren't the usual guy?' The well built man said, 'no...I'm new' Homer replied, 'Oh I see. Please come in' He stepped aside and squeezed passed the home owner but Homer heard him mutter under his breathe 'whoa he is a big one'. The man closed the door and Homer ventured into the kitchen to place the boxes down. As he did he looked to his right and saw a huge spread of food laid out, 'are you having a party?' Homer asked, the man laughed 'No....that was for the other guy' he said as he walked up to Homer and pushed him against the counter 'he was my eating partner....but you..I bet you could eat a lot more' The man said, he opened the boxes and saw they were empty 'mmm I bet you were real hungry on your way here' Homer could only nod as he was so turned on and hungry at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How about some more fatty' the man said poking Homer's belly button and moving it around, Homer moaned 'oh god...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer had to make a difficult choice, gulp down this sexy ball bellied man and satisfy his belly for a short time or be stuffed full of foods and let the man continue to pleasure him.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Homer began to drool as he looked at the man who was still playing with his gargantuan belly, he thought to himself 'one more human couldn't hurt', before he used his belly to push the guy to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa careful big guy' The man said rubbing the back of his head. Homer crouched down and rested his belly on the guys legs so he couldn't get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm....I'm so sorry, I'm just so so hungry' Homer said as he placed his hand on the guys belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's ok...There is so much food here, you can eat everything' The man said reaching and slapping Homer's belly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's not what I meant' Homer said, drooling more. 'I....can't stop myself'. Like the pizza boy, Homer began to tear the clothes off the man, seeing the firm mound of flesh, Homer drooled more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey...what are you doing? I usually like a bit of foreplay before this sort of thing' the man said, 'what with your friend?...Well you'll be joining him soon' Homer said with a grin on his face, the man looked shocked, 'yeah I ate him up....I was so hungry and he just looked so tasty....I can still feel how he tasted and it was beautiful' Homer said licking his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa....whoa man, please no...Don't do this!!' The man said struggling to get free, Homer lent forward and began to open his mouth wider, his belly growling louder. The man kicked frantically and managed to slip free, he rolled onto his belly and began to get up to run away but Homer lunged forward and grabbed the naked fat mans shins and made him fall over. He had a cushioned landing however with his belly, Homer didn't waste anytime dragging him back and putting his legs into his hungry mouth. Inch by inch the man began to disappear in seconds as he scratched at the floor trying to stop his fate, when Homer got to his belly he began to lick it all over knowing that all that fat would be apart of him shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please.....stop this!' The man pleaded but Homer was in a trance as he pulled him in further and began to swallow, the man shifting down his throat and with one huge gulp he was gone....pushing against Homer's belly, trying to escape but Homer knew it was impossible. Homer let out a huge burp as shirt and pants grew tighter with his belly having gorged on a 300+lb meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh god, he tasted just as good as the pizza guy....but I can't keep doing this...the blob is taking over....No more humans! Even if they are.....tasty......and making me fatter than my wildest dreams.....mmmm I'm so fat' Homer said and began to play with all his belly</span></div></div>",

Despite Homer's best efforts his belly demanded he eat more fat men, he resisted as best he could as he waddled home but he caught sight of one walking down on the beach, his belly bouncing up and down with each step on the sand. This was enough for Homer, even with his enormous bulk Homer moved extremely fast and caught the poor unsuspecting fat man. Homer wasted no time in shoving the man into his mouth and as the gulp indicated, it didn't take him long to swallow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer's belly bounced and grew larger as his shirt began to tear at the seams. 'Oh god dammit Homer!' He said to himself, poking and slapping his belly. 'No more!' Homer said to himself, but something inside of him shouted 'MORE!!', Homer's belly growled loudly as if he hadn't eaten for weeks. 'AHH!!' Homer screamed 'this is too much....I've....I'VE GOTTA EAT!!' Homer said as ran towards the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer's belly bounced in all directions as he moved incredibly fast to find more food of any kind. Thats when he saw it...an all you can eat buffet. He pushed in through the door and was astounded by what he saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery person in there was a man at least 300lbs...Homer's eyes widened and he began to salivate. 'NO! These men are here to enjoy the food! I can't eat them' Homer said as he tried to turn away, as he heard a man complain 'aww man! You got BBQ sauce all over me!' Homer turned around to see a man who looked to be around 400lbs, a shirt that barely covered his belly was indeed soaked in BBQ sauce. Another man walked over and dragged his finger across the fat guys belly, he stuck the finger in his mouth and said 'mmm, sorry. Makes you taste real good' and laughed. Homer began to salivate again, and without warning he blocked the door with as much as he could and shouted 'I'LL HAVE A TASTE!!' and ran towards the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer licked the guys belly saying 'mmm Marinated belly' and began to drool. He then stood up and without hesitation he inserted the BBQ covered man in his mouth and began to swallow him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OH MY GOD, HE'S EATING JERRY!!!!' A man shouted, as all the men began to panic running towards the door. Homer finished swallowing the man that was apparently called Jerry and turned to the others who were desperately trying to escape, Homer laughed deeply 'yeah known of you are going anywhere, except in my belly!' Homer said and charged at them all, grabbing two guys and stuffing them in his mouth and swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer ate man after man as his belly increased in girth, his clothes finally giving up after the fourth. The ginormous naked Homer engulfed them all in no time at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay there with a big grin on his face, looking at the size of himself. He let out a huge belch and began to rub his belly, 'man...what a meal that was. Sorry fellas but rest assured you have done my belly a great service in making it enormous' Homer said, he began to shake his belly, he kissed it and soon found himself making love to it. This was everything Homer had every wanted, to be a blob of fat with a huge belly that he could make love to and make it bigger whenever he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the start of a new life for Homer. </span></div></div>",

He ran back and inside and continued to rub his belly. He closed his eyes and enjoyed every electrifying sensation. Continuing his rubbing, Homer heard another nose a slight stretching sound, and he noticed that his fingers were sinking into his belly. He opened his eyes to see that he was getting fatter at an extremely alarming rate, well alarming to most people, Homer found this incredibly exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly pushed further out, so much so Homer could no longer see his toes. His love handles and ass grew exponentially as well! He was getting more ball like. His briefs grew tighter causing his belly to look even bigger and soon gravity started taking an effect as his roundness took a sudden plunge down, giving him a overhang. Homer stayed this shape from that point on but kept increasing in circumference, he arched his back to try accommodate this increase in weight but ended up falling over onto his back, his belly towering up above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen suddenly  </span></div></div>",

Without hesitation he walked over to Homer and placed his hands on the sphere of fat, 'then lets make some room to fit the rest of it in' Jerry said as he began to move his hands in circles all over Homer's belly.

And like I said then, its pretty hot that you are forcing yourself to grow this monster' Jerry said smacking Homer's belly. 'Hehe yeah, it is pretty hot...It makes me wonder how big I am going to get, all I know is I want to grow Jerry! I don't think I will ever be fat enough!'

Half his weight, he'd said over 500 but by how much? Homer knew he was 239 but if he was as much as 550 Homer would need to put on close to 40 pounds in half as many days. Still, Homer wanted it, and a whole lot more, maybe even getting up to the blubberous proportions of the geek in front of him or bigger still. It was with with the picture in his minds' eye of himself massively fattened and needing two barstools that made him agree to the challenge. While chugging down several more pitchers with his newfound friend Homer considered how he might get those 40 pounds on as fast as possible.    </span></div></div>",

Walking to his car he'd been stuck parking down the street a bit he saw Krusty Burger and came up with an idea. He still had the house which was paid off... what if he mortgaged it again and bought out the Krusty Burger franchise in town? He'd have free food and a steady income of what profits he wasn't eating not to mention he knew Comic Book Guy was a regular customer so he'd be getting a profit from his rival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about a week but Homer was able to arrange the financing and even called in a favor with Krusty who owed Bart for the countless times he'd saved the klown's butt to endorse the deal. Homer's new restaurant was given instruction to keep any returned or mistaken orders which Homer would come by and eat every couple of hours through the day on top of his \"meals\". Finding the milkshakes could be enhanced to get him even fatter the \"lard drains\" of the grill were now collected and the fatty slop contents mixed into the newly patented \"Homer Shakes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weeks rolled by and Homer grew steadily adding new fat day after day. He knew Comic Book Guy would regularly show up during only certain times of the day such as the lunch hour when he closed his comic shop, within a few minutes of closing the store and often for a third late night run of junk food and had made sure to avoid any interactions until he was at a comparable, preferably noticeably bigger weight than Comic Book Guy. and made a point to avoid him. However one fateful day while Homer sat in the manager's office, a small desk space he was rapidly starting to fill to capacity he heard the voice of his nemesis and decided to come out and reintroduce himself.

Realizing his belly wasn't going to hit the floor on its own he poured himself another 50-50 lard milkshake and gulped down another half gallon of the fattening mix while coming up with his next order from the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day rolled by while Homer ate and ate, not getting up from his chair once until the late afternoon when he heard the voice of the Comic Book Guy loudly asking to see the manager. Cramming the uneaten half of his deep fried Krusty Burger, he topped off his lardshake with more liquid fat and struggled to his feet. After squeezing out of the increasingly tighter doorway to his office Homer came around to the front counter of the store and was shocked by what he saw! Not only was Comic Book Guy there, but his cousin Homer had met once before, Comic Book Gay was too. Homer remembered that his nemesis had said he was gaining weight along with his cousin but never mentioned how much BIGGER his cousin had gotten than him. For how similar they looked Homer imagined it was a roadmap for the Comic Book Guy of how he'd appear if he put on at least 200 more pounds. Every part of the man was bloated to a point that made Homer envious, his paunch was a wide overhanging bag of fat not governed by any muscle so it hefted freely with every breath the man struggled to take, a point accentuated by the tube of oxygen plugged into his nose which he also seemed to be steadying himself on as he wheeled a canister of it around with him. The man's shirt was clearly outgrown by a good bit making Homer wonder if he had reached the end of shirt sizes altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was surprised earlier by your appearance earlier, as someone who enjoys the dramatic touch when executed right.\" The Comic Book Guy started to say. \"However your comments, they reminded me a lot of my cousin here and your gusto for gluttony has proved me wrong, which I'd like to say sorry for my comments earlier this year.\" He continued seeming rather genuine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be sorry, if you hadn't pushed me I would have never bought this place!\" Homer replied. \"I love my new life and let's call it career... sure beats sector 7-G of the Nuclear plant.\" Noticing that Comic Book Gay seemed to be wobbling from the exhaustion of standing up at all with his weight, \"Hey let's get you both a seat\". Pointing to a nearby table with pull out chairs, \"I'll be right back with something I think you two will love.\" Homer said trying to turn a new leaf. He went back to his office and poured them both a lardshake and grabbed every burger off the already prepped shelf telling his lackeys just to make more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelivering the bounty to the table Homer let the two dig in while he sipped his own shake. Once most of the food was gone Comic Book Gay finally spoke up. \"Hay this is pretty good, what else is in this shake making it have that meaty taste? I don't see any bacon bits\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's a bit more direct than that, I pour the grease from the grill straight in them. I call them lardshakes, make myself a few gallons of them a day, think it's helped put on a good chunk of this\" Homer said patting his belly. Both of his guests seemed lustful watching his massive sack of a gut wobble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I came out tonight sweetie, little Jeff here came home after he closed shop stunned with the revelation of your gaining. He'd heard that the new owner of Krusty Burger was some huge guy but didn't know it was you\" Comic Book Gay continued while unwrapping a double Krusty Burger. \"I wanted to meet you, and see if you might be interested in an opportunity you hadn't considered.\" He said taking a bite out of the burger. \"I'm presuming you spend most of the day in your office eating right?\" *munch munch munch* \"Tiny little cramped space you almost fill yourself?\" *uUrp* *munch* \"If we put a camera in there you could sell subscriptions to watching you feast like we do.\" Comic Book Gay said popping the last of the burger in. \"It's a big thing in a few eastern countries, they like watching people eat and big Americans like us command a certain segment of that market.\" Gulping down more lardshake he grunted contentedly, \"It'd make you an extra couple hundred, or even thousand a month after you build a big fanbase\". \"They call me 'jibang gei ma' which is Korean for Fat Sexy Walrus\" he said chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer gulped his milkshake while he thought about it. Having people pay to watch him eat sounded amazing, he could post the Krusty Burger menu and have people pay for him to eat specific items. He'd get the items at cost, and pocket all the money himself. Without realizing it Homer was daydreaming while gulping the entire half gallon pressing his legs together to stimulate his buried cock. Thinking about how he'd be as wide as his narrow office walls in no time had Homer quite excited as he realized he had poured the entire shake down his throat already and was licking an empty cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly you're a fan of the idea.\" Comic Book Gay smirked as he said, \"Why don't you come back to our place and we can 'work out the details' in a more intimate setting\" Sizing Homer up again, \"When was the last time you weighed in? I'd love to compare bellies\"</span></div></div>",

He called the Krusty Burger main office and asked if he could run a unique promotional product called \"The Baconing Burger\", they heard him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a specialty cheeseburger consisting of two 1/3lb patties with individual slices of cheese and two of a little \"snack\" he'd been ordering his employees to make him which consisted of four strips of bacon pressed together closely on the grill and a slice of cheese melted on top to keep it together, all stacked together with bacon ranch dressing. He suggested making an additional over the top deluxe \"The Ultimate Baconing Burger\" with 4 patties and bacon stacks as well. Homer had his employees make him two of each while he was on the phone so he could really sell them which he quickly ate while the group of people who came together for an impromptu meeting to discuss his concept on the other end of the phone deliberated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Krusty Burger office loved the idea enough to carry it across all of their stores and better yet, pay Homer $0.25 for every burger sold. Excited with how well his idea was being picked up he asked for an extra stipulation of getting to have the lard contents of the company-owned stores as well as any interested franchisees shipped back to him in refrigerated trucks for what he lied and claimed was another business idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with the idea of Homer handling the disposal of an expensive specialty waste product they were paying extra for removing anyway Krusty Burger agreed and sent a notary around later that week when they had the contract written up and even had the graphics Homer requested made and ready for being put up. Homer called in an octuple order of his stores regular quantity of bacon to match what he expected in demand both from Springfield and himself. Pouring a fresh lard shake Homer looked down at his massive gut and started fantasizing about when it'd be rubbing on the walls he was already inches away from in his cramped office</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a big month for Homer in many ways, for starters his \"The Baconing\" burgers launch was a tremendous success and had been some of their best selling items every week since. Two weeks afterwards they started selling at other Krusty Burgers at an equal pace and with his creator's fee applied he was making around $25 a day per restaurant just for having the idea. With thousands of Krusty Burgers operating across the United States, it was astonishingly lucrative for the hungry morbidly obese blob who just wanted an excuse to eat more bacon and its fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer had made enough to pay off his purchase of Krusty Burger within only a few days and had started amassing quite a personal fortune as his wealth's expansion exceeded even his waistline's. Speaking of, the gluttonous Homer thought the best news of all was his unprecedented weight gain. Already expanding at an incredible rate when he was trying to outgrow the comic book guy Homer's crash diet of fat was having quite the effect. There was no doubt about it, while printing him money, The Baconing burgers were generating an average of a gallon of lard an hour at his restaurant and Homer was drinking every drop of it. Pouring a quart of pure liquid fat from the pork and beef into his new 64oz Extra Large cups Homer would fill the rest with Milkshake from his office's private hose connected to the machine in the store and chug them down with the trayfulls of food his staff had started delivering every 15 minutes on the dot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punctual deliveries had forced Homer into becoming something of a eating machine. He had to stuff himself almost constantly to ensure he'd be done before the next tray was dropped off. Yesterday in just one hour Homer tallied he had eaten no less than 8 Ultimate Baconing Burgers, 3 Deep Fried Krusty Burgers, 4 Super-Choker Burritos with Macho Sauce with extra meat and sauce which Homer was quite proud he could fit the entire diameter of the burrito in his mouth at a time, two buckets of Twisty Lard which they fill the rest of the bucket's space with whipped cream, and 12 large fries with gravy scrapems poured on top. Not even counting the lardshakes that was 47,000 shocking calories, Homer lustfully girded his loins when he finished figuring out how much it had been . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven he had spent 10 hours at Krusty Burger eating like that it wasn't hard for Homer to believe the scale when it told him he had put on 6 pounds in a single day after he finished emptying himself of the remains of his daily conquest. The day before the promotion had started Homer weighed in at a comfortable 611 pounds, only 30 days and he was now a titanic 735 pounds. Standing in front of the mirror after weighing in Homer admired how the sweeping curve of his belly was met by the thick bottom of his gut's overhanging fold where it laped over his sides. Hanging free from being tucked into his 12XL shirts, it was only a matter of inches from being at knee level. When Homer walked he let the gravity of his gut pulling him forwards do the work for him as he swung his hefty legs as best as he could while keeping his balance. Homer's face had been bloating out quite severly, his thick neck fat roll made his head look like a melting ice cube which fought with his thick chest fat, giving the appearance his head was being sucked into the fat at the bottom. He proudly got dressed and made his way to the Krusty Burger for another day of eating.</span></div></div>",

Realizing the problem was only going to get worse before it got better Homer resolved to think over his housing issues while eating enough calories to feed roughly 200 people, the thought of his gluttonous extent excited Homer. These sorts of feelings had become a regular occurrence for Homer more and more the feeling of stuffing himself with food through the pain of his stuffed gut had been enough to get him hard in a long unreachable place. Another problem Homer would have to consider he realized as he wedged his sweeping hillside of a body into his car, the wheel pinned by his gut it made him a very slow turner while driving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at Krusty Burger, Homer sat in his car for a moment looking at the empty lot adjacent to his restaurant. It would take a while but Homer could do big things with his newfound money and the 55 gallons a day of lard he was receiving as a perk he was currently dumping into a 10,000 gallon tank he was able to quickly procure. He made his way inside where his staff already had \"breakfast\" waiting for him. A selection of buckets of the leftover breakfast items such as biscuits, hash browns, sausage, bacon, and eggs from when the store finished their morning menu, all filled to the brim with country gravy and stirred until it was broken up enough so that Homer could be lazy and drink the contents straight out of the buckets. Finishing off four of them Homer patted his gut, enjoying the heavy contents sitting in his belly. He looked up the phone number of Red Blazer Realty, the property manager of the lot and inquired what the status of the land was. It was good news, it could be developed commercially and was for sale for cheaper than Homer would have expected. He told them he could pay in cash this afternoon if they could get the ink to dry on the paperwork fast enough and drop it off. He began making other calls, inquiring with contractors for building portions of the lot including Homer's plan for in-ground storage tanks, a major cement foundation, solar panel system, pump system, drainage, and more in between gulping down gallons of lardshakes. He would apply for permits and claim it was a \"processing facility\" for the fatty byproducts of nearby Krusty Burgers, a not inaccurate description of what he was planning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the new owner of the lot before the day was over, Homer celebrated by having nothing but Super-Choker Burritos dropped off as fast as he could swallow them. At first trying to see if he could swallow one whole Homer found himself needing to bite down around 2/3s through. However on his 4th one, he managed to push the entire item down his throat whole! \u201c...Mmmm\u2026 so much easier than chewing\u201d. Homer spent the next 30 minutes pushing one burrito down his throat after another. His employees couldn\u2019t believe the rate or the capacity their massive boss had. Some 17 1.5lb burritos later and Homer was completely stuffed and satisfied, a visible and firm dome bulging out of the thick sheet of soft fat under the skin of his bloated stomach. Chugging a 64oz lardshake to fill in any open space left in there, he looked up more contractors for estimates and by the end of the day\u2019s quarter million calorie intake had settled on several builders to start applying for permits for his \u201cLard Processing Facility\u201d. The construction would take a few more months, in the meantime he had an office he was nearing having his fat ass rubbing each wall while sitting to keep growing towards, and so much more eating to do!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having a TV installed as well Homer started staying there all day every day, after finding himself settled he had the real estate company put 742 Evergreen Terrace on the market. He had outgrown that part of his life and there was no looking back as far as Homer was concerned... his head was too fat! He hired a new manager, Bart's fellow transfer student Uter's father Mr. Z\u00f6rker to keep the store running 24/7 so Homer could eat and sleep with no pause in-between, all hours of the day... every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer noted the day he last stood up, with any luck he wouldn't have to walk again until it was to get to his new home next door... his real dream would be never to have to walk again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days rolled by with Homer semi-unsure of whether it was day or night, his windowless home didn't give him any indication and after his gut had started rolled a few feet onto the floor and blocking the door from opening he had a slot cut on the wall to hand him trays to rest on his table-like paunch. Two months without moving an inch beyond stuffing himself every minute he was awake had caused Homer to put on at least 10 pounds of fat a day! Well past 1400 pounds Homer felt utterly immense as he had almost filled his office to capacity. His massive waterbed of a belly spread from where Homer was pressed up against the back wall the full 8 feet to the opposite wall, and the full 5 feet width of the space too. The few words he uttered in a day were what he'd like 20 of in a batch. Such a massive quantity just saved time before he'd want something else that'd be quite demanding. He was drinking 40 gallons of lardshakes a day and had taken to shoving a hose from the lard trap down his throat while he slept to keep him full at every moment. Homer thought his life was paradise, a neverending meal of the most fattening quantity. He had long surpassed his previous \"King Size\" weight, long past him rival the Comic Book Guy's virginal quarter tonnage he felt mighty in his enormity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in what felt like a long while Homer heard the door knock. Knowing he couldn't move an inch to let the door open Homer opened the slot to it's highest capacity and said to talk to him through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meister Homer, your new facility is ready. The first tank is currently at capacity and the second tank is nearly too with the lard and the third tank is completely full of milkshake. You are welcome to enter whenever you are ready.\" Mr. Z\u00f6rker told him in his thick German accent. Homer could see through the slot he had put on a bit of weight in the recent months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... *urp* glad to... *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* hear *uUrph* ...it\" Homer managed to say. He wasn't sure how he'd get out of his predicament. His massive body had no way out of the space he filled.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Realizing that the most direct way to get from the office he was stuck in to the overhead door that would be his way into the warehouse would be to remove the exterior wall he was pressed into on one side. Homer called one of the primary contractors and explained what he would need done, first in removing the wall and its immediate replacement and also in something to help Homer with the walk across the parking lot to his warehouse. Given his massive gut rested for several feet on the floor in front of him he would need a platform to rest it on with omnidirectional wheels to push it across the ground smoothly. They made plans to get him out late at night to minimize the chance of making a scene and impacting the drive thru's business. A few days passed while the contractor built his belly board and got the replacement drywall and needed saws to cut out the wall quickly. Homer spent most of the time stuffing himself with everything he loved to eat. He'd be switching off of solid foods permanently after this and wanted a goodbye tour which took him through the equivalent of two cows and one full sized pig's worth of meat a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fateful night arrived and Homer was ready, he abstained from eating once they started working on the wall so he wouldn't feel too bloated to move. They cut through most of the exterior once they got to the level where Homer's massive fleshly rolls filled the room wanting not to cut him in the process. Thankfully the pressure of his more than half ton flesh against the remaining drywall was enough to press it outwards making it easy to pull off. The contractor handed Homer a set of handles attached to steel cables mounted onto a truck which with some determination helped him onto his feet. As he stood up his flabby gut shifted onto a tarp the contractor employees laid out and between four of them, they lifted Homer's gelatinous paunch onto his belly board. Quite smartly they had made it out of an iron frame for sturdiness and welded handlebars from the far end of the platform for Homer to keep himself steady while waddling as well as direct his own movement easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer used every bit of strength he had to push himself forwards. The walk to his end position was only 60 feet but with Homer's mass it felt like 6 miles. His body was so massive it fought him in every way from the ground up. His feet were so bloated they would look like loaves of bread if they were visible, however his calves were so massive they folded over themselves and blanketed the top half of his feet. The only way to know that he had knees was that his leg rolls looked so puffy the Michelin man would be jealous in where they folded over each other. His hips rippled with every movement and fought against each other across the four feet of his inner thighs and where it lead to his ass, a hill of flesh itself with a crack that was over a yard long. His backside however had nothing on his gut, a sack of fat that hung onto his belly board and filling it's full four foot length and piled several feet high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10 foot wide overhead door was already open, Homer figured if there were any need for him to leave it would make it pretty easy to do so. That said he wasn't planning on going anywhere after his short saunter. The building was quite plain, a 50' by 25' warehouse with three rooms. There was an office space for Mr. Z\u00f6rker who had agreed to be his legal representative in exchange for being made the full manager of Krusty Burger and part owner in Homer's businesses, both the restaurant and the bonuses the company paid him for the lard disposal that the building was a front for. His office had access from the street side, a door into the warehouse and a ladder through the ceiling to the storage space up there where several air conditioners had been installed. The second room facilitated in Homer's new diet and the massive supply of lard it would need. Trucks could come by and dump their full tank of cooked fat from the Krusty Burgers in three surrounding states and the company was considering expanding that reach even. They would have a roll up door with a gate code to use, several pump valves were accessible to a half dozen 10,000 gallon tanks that were stored underground. To facilitate their use several electric pumps and permanent battery storage were also installed behind a gate. On the roof of the building every square inch was covered in solar panels to minimize any cost of operation. Homer however was only concerned with the one room he'd ever be in; the warehouse space. The space not taken up by the two rooms left Homer with a 21.5' long by 24.5' wide space. The floor was made out of a converted truck scale with a 45 ton capacity Homer had found online from a supplier of truck stop scales. In the center of the space there was a low backed bench that would leave Homer in a propped up but resting seated position and in the middle was a double wide tub bidet that would take care of his sanitary needs. A special tube from inside the tub would be pushed into Homer's fat mound of a crotch and suction onto his buried member to handle his other waste. Homer finally settled down in the chair and reached for the tube which hung from the ceiling while the generously tipped contractor owner personally hooked up his cleaning apparatus as a courtesy to the man who had paid him so well for such complicated work. He handed Homer a remote control and told him about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The arrows on here control the pump rate, it measures it in gallons per hour and goes up in increments of .25 which will show up on the TV display\" He pointed to the screens hanging from a movable mount, one of which was for the satellite service he had for entertainment and the other displayed more personal items. The screen showed a rotating selection of camera angles from front back and each side changing every minute. It displayed Homer's weight down to the tenth of a pound, the pumps flow rate as the contractor had mentioned, how many gallons he would have had in that day and an estimate of how many calories that would have added up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rest of his introduction to the feeding room done Homer put in the lardshake tube that hung from the ceiling, put on a movie channel and looked at his weight... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrent Weight: 1393 LBS <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer put the pump on two gallons an hour and watched as the numbers ticked up. Cresting 1400 by the time the movie was over Homer took pride knowing that his weight would stay over that number in fat permanently very soon. </span></div></div>",

Usually he found it easiest to sit back, watch a movie or TV show and drink the liquid fattener he'd come to love.  He tried going back to solid foods but he decided those were best kept for when he really wanted something tasty rather than just fattening.  The liquid fat he was chugging was good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he had blimped himself from 1400 pounds to 1500 in that week's time.  Lazily laying/sitting in his warehouse, Homer hit a button to pause the flow, suckling down the last of the dribbles as to not waste anything.  He was looking at his screen and noticed something interesting.  He had received an email from someone and decided to check and see what it could possibly be that was interrupting his feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his remote, he switched his screen to his email and found a link in the most recent message.  Using the link took him to a page with what looked to be a live stream of some sort.  In the video, he saw some familiar faces feeding each other food from his very restaurant.  It was Comic Book Guy and Comic Book Gay looking to be bigger than ever.  Their clothes were strained and stained and they had piles of bags and wrappers around them.  Homer grinned as his rod stiffened at the sight.  With a happy sigh he settled in to start watching the video while resuming his chugging.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still fatter than they were but they were definitely getting up there.

The tens of thousands of calories he put away every hour adding more blubber to his already immense frame. When he woke up, Homer groaned in pain, he'd never had so much so fast and it felt fantastic. The daily calorie count was unbelievable, he had eaten over 800,000 calories in his 11 hour nap. The scale read 1544 and Homer knew as lard filled as his stomach was, so much was going to stay around permanently. He slowed the flow down again to a gentle sip while his stomach recovered from nearly tearing open under the 33 gallon deluge he had treated it to. He rubbed his gut and wondered when the Comic Book cousins would pay him a visit and how much he could gain in the meantime. After only a few minutes Homer could feel some of his stomach free up and even rumble with a desire for more. Homer cranked his lard shake flow back up to a three gallon an hour rate and decided every day from here on our was going to be a two million calorie day. The thought of such unbelievable gluttony stiffened Homer up and without having to move an inch he let his waste tube's suction feature pleasure him into another long sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer pumped himself two million calories of his favorite lard and meat scraps with desperation every day, he didn't just want to be bigger than either than them, he needed to be bigger than both of them!

It had been one problem after another but he had been able to keep his staff in order with his commanding personality. As he happily unwrapped his Baconing burger and headed in for his first bite the phone at his desk rang. Feeling the need to get whatever had interrupted his meal out of the way he picked up the phone,<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" He said impatiently. <br>\r\n\"uh... Hi Mr. Z\u00f6rker there are a couple of people here to see the old owner but I told them he doesn't stay around here anymore and then they said I should talk to the manager so I'm calling...\" Mr. Z\u00f6rker recognized the pimpled teen he kept at the register by his cracking voice and turning to the blob he was the caretaker for in the room over and his specific instructions when someone came looking for him.<br>\r\n\"Ah! Yes! I'll meet them in a moment, give them whatever they'd like on the house.\"<br>\r\n\"uhh.. but sir, they've already ordered and-\" Mr. Z\u00f6rker cut off the teen.<br>\r\n\"I said give them whatever they want!\" He yelled back<br>\r\n\"Will do sir\" he meekly replied.<br>\r\nMr. Z\u00f6rker picked up his burger and walked into Homer's room munching on it, he figured he should give Homer some notice his guests had arrived and wake him up. Homer was blissfully asleep dreaming about filling the warehouse with his fat, the walls beginning to give way to his endless appetite as he pressed into it on all sides. He felt one part of the wall by his front get poked in harder than the rest, as it repeatedly happened Homer began to wake up and realize it was his friend getting his attention. Mr. Z\u00f6rker let Homer know to expect guests soon and Homer gave him a thumbs up in acknowledgement, one because he wanted to chug every last drop he could before they arrived and second as Mr. Z\u00f6rker walked off of his platform scale and it returned to his own weight of 2,104 pounds Homer had to admit that his ability to lift his arms had gone away entirely. <br>\r\nKrusty Burger had seen it's share of large guests since Homer had taken over the business but today was unlike any other. As he walked back into the place Mr. Z\u00f6rker had expected to see some large men, a sight he had come to find enchanting but never like this... Jeff Albertson and his cousin had barely made it into the store. Their girth was astounding and they each appeared larger than Homer had been on his last walk into the warehouse, given his friend as a reference Mr. Z\u00f6rker expected they had to be nearly a ton a piece. Massive cloth sweatpants draped across yards of spherical backsides and hips bigger than several men across. Pinned up by suspenders that had to be clipped on in 6 places both of the Comic Book geeks let their sagging guts rest on belly-wheels reminiscent of the one Homer had used, with sturdy handrails they were clearly helping keep the enormous men on their feet. Mr. Z\u00f6rker was glad to see that Homer\u2019s guests were also men of extreme appetites and walked up to them. <br>\r\n\u201cComik-book meisters! Welcome to Krusty Burger\u2026 I hope my employees have shown you our best hospitality.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but enjoy the two men\u2019s porcine appearance and only after shoving a double baconing burger in his mouth, wide cheeks bulging with fat already bloated out like a chipmunk while he ate the whole thing in mere seconds did Jeff Albertson the Comic book guy reply.<br>\r\n*wheeze* \u201currrp.. yes your employees were able to keep up with our requests though where is Homer?\u201d Jeff began swallowing a series of super choker burritos in a row faster than Homer ever had and afterwards moaned and Mr. Z\u00f6rker could swear his belly expanded now allowing some of his gut to show. Mr. Z\u00f6rker brushed off the notion and asked the pimply teen to deliver the two men\u2019s combined order home to his son Uter with instructions to be done with it before Mr. Z\u00f6rker got home. He then invited the two giants to follow him back to the neighboring warehouse. He and a surprised patron held the extra wide double doors while the two comic book geeks slowly waddled out of the restaurant. In the parking lot it was easy to notice that the two enormous men resembled the size of some small cars in the lot. They both grunted and groaned with every step they took; they had enjoyed quite an interesting few weeks and had decided to share a surprise with their friendly rival in extreme obesity. Mr. Z\u00f6rker waited for the men to make the 80-foot trek from the street entrance to the warehouse\u2019s which faced the opposite side of the building. He beamed happily at the two men, sweat and grease soaked from what had to be a rare experience on their feet their appearance was in disarray but that made them all the more handsome to Mr. Z\u00f6rker. <br>\r\n\u201cComik-book meisters I am happy to reintroduce you to your host and please let me know if I can be of any assistance.\u201d He entered the door code and the motorized door began to roll up. There the two men gawked jealously at Homer. Homer was unaccustomed to the sunlight after a month inside the building and tried to roll over as a response. His over a ton body lay flaccid as he could do nothing more than meekly jiggle from all of his strength though his sucking on the lard hose had increased further. Watching Homer wobble completely immobile and clearly bigger than either of them after the treatment they knew he\u2019s love their surprise. The pair of them basked in the refrigerated room slowly waddling in and got settled by removing their bellywheels and dragging their paunches until they both sat down pressing their floorbound guts into Homers while Mr. Z\u00f6rker brought the roll-up door back down, climbed onto Homer and assisted with pausing and then removing the feeding hose from Homer and walked back to his office to give them privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men had to catch their breath from the exhaustion of their respective tasks, Homer just from moving his head had brought his breathing up to gasping for air. Comic book gay had already begun enthusiastically thrusting his gut into Homers and moaning from excitement, <br>\r\n\"Oh we're so glad to see you Homer! it's been too long\" Comic Book Gay said. \"I've got to say, it's nice to meet the fattest man ever\" Jeff said before continuing, \"but we have a surprise for you, we spent all of our savings on funding the local scientist Dr. Frink's research and I think you can tell we've benefited from the results and we'd like to share it with you\". Homer was intrigued and in love with the feeling of what the scale read as 5723 combined pounds between the three men. He meekly pointed the monitor which was reading out their combined weight before asking how they got to his size without his extreme tactics. <br>\r\n\"Dr. Frink gave us a gene therapy that causes your existing fat cells to multiply.\" Jeff said, \"We spent a few weeks on a crash diet that resembles what you're eating there to get up to 800 pounds each and then began treatment... it only lasted about a month but between that and a lot of delivery food we're each around 1,800 but you're already more than a ton and it's supposed to be more effective the fatter you are at the start.\"<br>\r\nHomer </span></div></div>",

Realizing if their secret fattening technique really worked he\u2019d be the size of all three men before too long Homer lost control and his buried cock sprayed for what felt like minutes, his release and the shaking of his massive gut and sounds of pleasure sent the nearly ton cousins over their thresholds as well. Homer typed out some instructions to Mr Z\u00f6rker before the three of them began to lazily doze off after such a pleasurable overload and the two men weren\u2019t even aware that they were hooked up to a lardshake hose each and would get the same treatment that had make Homer so enormous with hundreds of thousands of calories pumped in every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Frink had been incredibly helpful when Homer had called him and asked about the Comic Book Cousins\u2019 treatment. He mentioned his own determination towards gaining and the mad scientist explained how the drug worked. It would recode fat cells to divide and multiply and the higher the starting amount of fat in a body, the more likely the new cells would also have to divide and multiply themselves. The Comic Book Cousins had done a little more than double but Dr. Frink thought that was the minimum effect and it could triple or quadruple Homer\u2019s weight, and if he gained, would guarantee that was certainly four or five times instead. <br>\r\nHomer knew what he wanted and the Comic Book Cousins agreed to stay around to \u201cwork\u201d at Homer\u2019s lard disposal warehouse and cheer him on to prepare. Dr. Frink said he\u2019d come by when he needed a sample of Homer\u2019s DNA for the treatment in a few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer was being pushed now by a three man team who wanted to see him grow.

The Comic Book cousins each took turns rubbing the swelling glutton or drinking shakes themselves. It was a near constant orgy of calories and lusty blubber as all three of them took pride in a scale that ticked up their combined weights at a faster and faster rate every day, they estimated Homer was growing 22 pounds a day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rest being filled with the near identical looking comic book cousins who had taken to the offer of a permanent sedentary lifestyle as a dream come true and were losing their mobility with each passing day. The gluttons kept at least one employee running back and forth between the store and warehouse during their waking hours, still hooked on the solid food Homer had given up for greater gains. Mr Z\u00f6rker, ever careful of tracking the tanks fill levels had been delighted to offer their lard disposal services to the several states with Krusty Burgers surrounding Springfield. The demand by the three men far exceeded their supply and any more he could get within the state and would add more profit to their enterprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumped full of lard and meat scraps at breakneck pace Homer's orblike face stayed in an expression of sheer bliss, his goatee had turned into an oblong circle framing the tube that hadn't been removed since he finished the phone call with Dr. Frink. Homer had already been gaining alarmingly fast but the dozen plus gallons an hour rate left his already enormous form looking almost inhuman in its formless piles of various folds, rolls, and creases and endlessly shook with every heavy breath he made. His growth past a ton was hardly noticed, now not even half a month later Mr Z\u00f6rker estimated he was probably getting closer to 3000 than that milestone. The cousins more concerned with keeping Homer going and satisfying their desires with their newfound lard-mountain of a nemesis had not gained as rapidly, Mr Z\u00f6rker had guessed they had probably just cracked a ton apiece. The treatment combined with some grab bars Mr Z\u00f6rker installed hanging from the steel beams that framed the warehouse ceiling allowed Jeff and his cousin to get to their feet, the smooth polished concrete allowed them to push their floor sagging guts around and into their host. They had joined Homer in abandoning clothing as they settled in, the only thing they wore were sandals with high grip bottoms strapped on by Mr Z\u00f6rker to help them with not slipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of more than three tons of manhood was quite imposing when Dr. Frink finally arrived. He knew his first subjects were a success at what he thought was already an impressive weight but to see Homer in the flesh was something else. While Homer blissfully slept pumped full of lardshakes Dr. Frink set to work taking measurements of the blob he was starting with. Mr Z\u00f6rker assisted the scientist in the effort to find Homer's 29' waistline measurement accurately, getting his chest measurement was even more challenging, they agreed on which folds to qualify and both climbed partially onto the fat man to get the tape measure up, Homer woke up to the news of his 21' chest, 29' Waist, and more than nearly 6' arms. Turning on his simulator Homer feebly typed out a greeting and asked the mad scientist to see what could be done to bring him as close to 10,000 pounds as possible. Dr. Frink began to explain how the drug worked which Homer gave little attention to besides hearing that with his bodyfat content and the treatment course they would run he estimated a 80% chance of hitting five to six times his weight, and 20% chance it'd do that and maybe more to him. Homer begged for him to start immediately and as soon as Mr Z\u00f6rker provided the check for nearly the entire sale price of 742 Evergreen Terrace to Frink he pulled out the dose he had prepared and injected Homer. He felt disappointment that it wasn't an immediate effect, the Comic Book cousins had taken several treatments before the effects were apparent so Homer would have to wait at least a few days. The cousins both thanked the Doctor for his help again and Mr Z\u00f6rker provided him with a key and an alarm code to the building for the frequency he'd need to be in and out of the building.</span></div></div>",

By day three he'd already doubled his intake and their lard disposal network was expanded to the entire network of Krusty Burgers nationwide to keep up with the demand. By the end of the first week the Comic Book Cousins needed \"rescue\" from being trapped under the blanketing belly folds of their host whose backside outweighed them by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second week Homer saw his growing mountain for a body completely take up his view, his monitor now just cycled the various cameras posted throughout the warehouse showing him from several perspectives. Deep underneath nearly ten thousand pounds of fat, little unbeknownst to Homer his body was growing more than fat, his height would have been closer to 10 feet than his former 6 and while he was aware it was stiff at every moment little Homer was now the size of a baseball bat. The high protein and calcium content of his lard milkshakes not being lost. Still it was what Homer could see that he enjoyed, the appearance of his belly constantly sloshing from the lustful Comic Book Cousins girding their ton bodies against Homers causing him to lose it day after day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks in, the trio celebrated their first day of the scale climbing a full 2000 pounds in a mere 24 hours. The cousins were fitted with harnesses and lifted via overhead crane onto parts of Homer for their own safety as Homer now pressed against every wall in the warehouse. The massive men barely rivaled the size of Homer's moobs which helped provide scale. Homer knew it wasnt enough though and pushed himself further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month had passed since he started Dr. Frinks treatment. Only a month and Homer had grown to literally fill a building. Being the sole recipient of more than 1,500 gallons of lardshakes a day meant he was bigger than Frink's wildest estimate. With the two Ton-plus Cousins sitting on the scale with him it read 45118 pounds but it was clear Homer was king. He was almost 30 feet tall, the bottoms of his feet now pressed against the walls of the building. The growth had allowed him to maintain a super bloated but not totally inhuman face, though big enough to support a second hose they had added. Homer cradled his blob buddies against him and used his strength to jiggle the enormous men. His diet had allowed him and Z\u00f6rker to begin making a small fortune with his becoming a human lardfill. As the gains slowed down one day from 2,900 pounds to only 250 the next Homer could barely swallow a quarter of his previous. The treatment had run its course.</span></div></div>",

The costs however of his continuous meal combined with the additional needs for the Comic Book Geeks had escalated rapidly. It was while Mr Z\u00f6rker explained this that Jeff Albertson attempted to speak through a Triple Baconing buger making a series of piggish snorts.

Jeff and his cousin explained how they made the arrangements and Mr Z\u00f6rker collected their equipment from their previous residence and wired it together with their existing camera setup they had made for Homer. A few email blasts showing the Comic Book Geeks pushing a ton and teasers of Homer's even bigger gut had eager fans paying triple of their previous fee. <br>\r\nHomer's continuous feast became a hit, fans could pay an extra grand to ask a question which either one of the Comic Book Geeks would answer or Mr Z\u00f6rker on Homer's behalf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer spent a month loving his new fame and making money just for eating and getting pleasured day in and day out. He left the one ton milestone in the dust and crested 3,000 by the end of the month. He was getting so buried under his new fat his vision was mostly of his jowels, chest, and belly.

Minute by minute Homer's weight ticked up one pound after another for a combined fourteen hundred and fifty pounds gained which sent every fat man in the room into a sexual frenzy. His fingers stopped bending, each segment of finger now as bulging and round as a donut hole and his cheeks and jowls now practically resembled a beach ball. When he put on about the same weight the next day Homer had to wonder how soon he'd be overflowing the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two weeks of the treatment enhanced megafeeding what was already the fattest man in history shattered every conceivable thought on how enormous a man could get. Twenty four thousand pounds of mega fat Homer now felt his lard silo hips brushing on the walls of his industrial home which had filled his dreams with images of blobdom that burst the confines of the warehouse and even started to exceed the parking lot. For now however he could settle for the wonderful feeling of the two bloblike Comic book geeks resting against the outer crest of his shelf of multi-ton mantits, their lustful girding into Homer a constant sensuous bonus to his tremendous girth's other many pleasures. Homer's gut having still not reached the warehouse doors in front of him made him wonder how many tons he had to go before his belly was able to reach a point 40 feet from where he had sat down originally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Frink made a housecall at 28 days, the expected finishing point of the growth treatment. However the mad scientist was surprised to see what the results were. The truck scale Homer \"sat\" upon thankfully was still giving a readout though no one could really believe what it said, a shocking 53,650 pounds. From what Mr. Z\u00f6rker could tell his gains had actually increased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to my initial projections the subject's ability to produce fat cells should be enhanced by approximately tenfold for less than a week before transitioning to twenty and then thirty over the course of about a week before the efficacy finally starts to diminish\". Dr Frink drew out a couple of quick calculations, \"At this point Mr. Simpson is only a *muh-hey* 15% through his treatment. Something about his slow metabolism and the ambient radiation from working at that death trap of a power plant are changing how the drug affects him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"mmmmMMMmm\" Homer woke up with a moan... his disposal tube had turned on its scheduled pleasurable vibrations, causing Homer's very buried anatomy to perk up and after a few minutes Homer with it. His feeding tube was pumping his endless meal down his throat, he never let it cease... a constant stream of lard and meat chunks mixed with meal suppliments keeping his stomach almost painfully distended every minute of every day. It had been a month since Homer had moved into his new \"warehome\" and Homer had hit the ground and swelled like a ballon. He gained 40 pounds the first day and pushed himself to gain faster almost more every day since. Meaning in that time Homer had almost doubled his weight to 2654 pounds. His gut had taken most of the weight burying Homer's legs in loose hanging fat which in his reclined position now lay past his useless feet. His TV display let him know he was drinking 20 gallons an hour and while he felt full, it wasn't the straining feeling he found so enchanting. He used the remote kept on his right moob roll near his hands resting position to up it to 23. Feeling the rate increase as it poured into him Homer reached his pleasurable threashold and came into his waste tube, his rolling mounds of flesh shook as he gulped down 11,340 calories a minute. Homer  idly watched an old Rainier Wolfcastle movie, watching as the calorie counter tracking what he ate that day climbed over 10 Million before dozing off again after only two hours awake, happy with his retirement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Z\u00f6rker had been a very useful business partner and Homer was pleased to see he also was packing on the pounds. Homer wondered how his obese son was doing when his father was now the co-owner of the town's fast food joint and eating for free, which Homer could attest had great effects on the waistline. The partnership had yeilded an unexpected benefit as well, after seeing Homer hooked up to the machine for the first time he suggested implimenting a design that included a sensor that would measure how full Homer was, ensuring that if it wasn't kept near burstingly full the lard flow rate would increase until he was pumped full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay after day Homer kept the same routine, pumped full of lard at every minute of every day streching his nonstop meal to even greater heights. He could feel how the fat engulfed every bone and muscle under feet of pure adipose, he felt buried in a gelatin paradise that only got better. He slept roughly 20 hours a day and spent the rest of the time enjoying the sensations of feeling himself literally swelling fatter by the moment. Another month passed just as semlessly as the first, Mr Z\u00f6rker installing the customized sensor to Homer's delight had meant he no longer worried about pushing buttons on the remote for anything besides setting the frequency of his waste tubes vibration feature and changing the channel on the TV, and that was mattering less and less to Homer. Months fell off the calendar in the blink of an eye to Homer as billions of calories were pumped in and staying on his body as new folds and rolls several yards wide. Homer was shocked one day when he looked at the calendar on his display and realized it had been a whole 14 months since he had last checked the date, it hadn't mattered nearly as much as the shocking 15 tons he'd gained in that same timespan to him. He kept a closer eye after that, given it was about the only thing he could do anymore, his movement was down to breathing and blinking and the tons kept piling on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SEVERAL YEARS LATER...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff Albertson took in the early morning air and smiled. It was 6:00 in the morning and he was starting on his morning jog to work, he liked doing it this early as there was almost no one on the road at this hour. He ran through the town square and in the mood to lengthen his path to the Android's Dungeon figured he'd run an extra two blocks past and then back around. After years of determined weight gain causing him to balloon to more than 700 pounds, a bad leg infection and some strong intervention by his doctor caused him to start dieting and excising and now he stood at under 200 lbs with a body fat percentage of a regular athlete. Still a fan of his comics and sci-fi he felt glad to have opened a new chapter in his life but on occasion found himself missing the days of his rivalry with that Simpson guy... Homer. No one had seen or heard from Homer in almost a decade, some rumors passed around for a while but everyone assumed he moved away quietly. Jeff made his way past the Krusty Burger, open for the morning breakfast run that Jeff had made many a time before he began actually running like now. Inside he saw who he assumed to be the manager. A tall and very obese man with brown hair and a thick mustache that complimented his thick facial features. Jeff paused for a moment to stretch, watching the owner fill a bag with more than a dozen breakfast sandwiches they had ready to serve into a bag, grabbing a laptop and waddling out of the store. Odd Jeff thought to himself, why would he be leaving so early in the day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystery was quickly explained when the man waddled not to his car but to the unmarked warehouse that had been put up a few years prior. He unlocked the tinted glass door and went in where Jeff couldn't see him anymore. Jeff found the activity odd, what the warehouse could be for was a puzzle he found himself wanting to solve. Jeff began running past the Krusty Burger on his morning and evening return runs for the next week. He noticed how in the evenings tanker trucks would connect a hose from their storage tanks into a roll up door on the side of the building, it seemed like they were pumping something into the warehouse, not out which Jeff found gave little explanation to what was going on in there. the deliveries were 5 out of the 7 days of that week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of that week Jeff resolved to ask this new Krusty Burger owner about Homer, having followed in his footsteps as the owner perhaps they were still in contact he figured. So the next morning Jeff waited for the fat man to leave the store and in the parking lot between the buildings he jogged up to him. The large man spoke with a European accent Jeff found intoxicating, standing there in the lot the man was beginning to pant after only a moment. Knowing the feeling Jeff asked if they could sit somewhere as he had some questions about the former owner of Krusty Burger Homer and the man, Mr Z\u00f6rker was surprised enough by the request he obliged and offered to continue the chat in his office next door where he thought Jeff would get the best answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Z\u00f6rker couldn't help but snack on a few of his breakfast chat while he cough his breath. The comic book guy felt a kinship, while no longer in his condition he could understand how an endless appetite could lead to such behavior and let him eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you vant to see Homer Simpson? *urp* Vhen was the last time you saw em?\" Z\u00f6rker inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was some years ago.\" Jeff said, \"He owned the Krusty Burger and showed off he had put on hundreds of pounds in mere months, I don't know if you have a kid who reads comics but I run The Androids' Dungeon and would have matched bellies with you back then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! Oh I doubt that, you vill love this but when I met Homer around then I looked like you!\" Mr Z\u00f6rker said. \"Meeting Homer Simpson had an effect on my life much like how he seems to have had one on yours. I do have a son... my little \u00dcter Z\u00f6rker is Homer's son's age... now a much larger young man. He lives at home, has to! He's is over half a metric ton now he loves our food here so much I have employees drop off bags when they get off for an extra tip throughout the day for him.\" Z\u00f6rker had finished his bag of breakfast sandwiches and was rubbing his behemoth of a belly Jeff recognized had to be in the double digit XL size. Hearing the mans story had Jeff physically excited, it sounded like a dream he tried to live for a long time himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, greatest story ever!\" Jeff said enthusiastically. \"Sounds like you've been enjoying yourself greatly, but I must ask what happened to Homer? He said he was never going to stop but I never saw him after that last time 6 years ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja, Homer is still in Springfield, he decided to retire from public life to enjoy an endless mahlzeit undisturbed.\" Mr Z\u00f6rker said eyeing the door and window with the shudder down facing the inside of the warehouse. \"I would not share this with you if I did not think he would appericate such a visit...\" Z\u00f6rker hefted himself up with a strained groan and waddled his way to the window. \"After the first year he managed to put on over 10,000 pounds, it was astounding, every year he pushed harder, bigger, we had to start importing grease waste from more sources, expanding our \"grease disposal\" statewide and then even further than that. He put on 20,000 in a year just another year after that, 30,000 two years after that even, which was last year. It's a guess but he's got to be nearing 100 tons by this year or early next. The building we're in, it's his new residence, as he's pumped with 100 gallons an hour of cooked grease, lard, meat chunks and fat. 66% of all fast food restaurants in the state to keep him fed, 25% in every state surrounding us too.\" Jeff's jaw dropped as Z\u00f6rker opened the blinds, the window was literally just a pressed up wall of fat rolls, two visible rolls pressed against every square inch. \"The door vould be useless, he's stacked up above the top of the doorvay\" Z\u00f6rker said amused. \"There's a hatch to the roof of this office in the space but...\" as he patted his enormous belly, \"I haven't been able to fit in years, go up, see if he needs anything\" He said motioning to the hatch and ladder.</span></div></div>",

Stopping in his tracks, he turned around and smacked Homer's belly with quite a force sending making quite the loud clap against the firm sphere. \"I have a thing for fat.\" The manager said, he pushed Homer back up against the wall behind him and lifted up his shirt to get a look at Homer's belly. \"Specifically fat on big balding men like you. Men who don't give a crap about what goes into their body and they just get enormous.\" The manager said rubbing Homer's belly and closing his eyes and moaning slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I care what goes in my body\" Homer replied, \"I care that it's the right stuff to make me fatter!\" he said and slapped his belly causing the manager to moan again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God. That's amazing...I could tell as soon as you walked in. You were a man on a quest...a fat quest...I've wanted to do this for a long time.

Deal?\" the manager said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer thought, was this what he truly wanted? Some guy getting all horny over his fattening body. The more he thought about it though the more horny Homer became, this guy was going to give Homer everything he wanted and more and that was a huge turn on for him. Pushing the manager out of the way, Homer walked over to the rack of burgers and ripped open the first wrapper and began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe manager walked up behind Homer and placed his hands on his belly \"It was too good a deal to pass up eh?\" and then squeezed a bit of Homer's belly. Homer just nodded and ate and ate and ate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna get so fat...I can't wait\" the manager said and began to rub his crotch up against Homer's love handles. Feeling this Homer let out a moan \"like that fatty?\" the manager asked, Homer nodded \"good, now turn around. Your belly needs attention\" the manager said, Homer span around still eating. The manager got onto his knees and began to kiss and lick Homer's belly all over as Homer continued to eat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been 5 months of fattening bliss for Homer, every night after work Homer would go down to Krusty Burger and gobble up as much as his heart desired and more on top of that. He gained relatively quick that first month taking him back up to 315lbs by the end of it. Now after 5 months Homer weighed in at 472lbs. Most of which had gone to his belly much to the delight of the Krusty Burger Manager 'Chris'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis white polo shirt could not contain all that fat, it rested firmly just underneath his moobs. Homer didn't want to give up his white shirt until it burst from his body, his belt snapped back around 320lbs. He had taken to wearing suspenders to help keep his pants up and he loved the feeling of them squeezing his fat but he had taken them off for this evenings feed. His blue pants popped their button fairly soon after Homer started gaining, all the years of torture from Homer stuffing and gaining then losing had finally seen that button explode off at high force. It shot straight through the wall it came off that fast. He just wore them as best he could cause he needed to whilst he was out, at home he either lounged around in his underwear or with his white shirt resting over his moobs and sometimes just naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer's face had fattened up significantly, a huge roll of fat protruded from his neck down to his back, his cheeks were full and puffed out and his chin rounded out into a double chin. His arms and legs fattened also, more so his legs to carry the extra weight. His ass was huge but his belly, that was in a league of its own. It rounded out from underneath his moobs with a roll of soft fat between them, it stuck out so far in front and was so soft to the touch even if by the looks of it that it was firm but pushing your fingers and hands into it caused them to sink in far. His belly button was so deep, he would often tease Chris by shoving things in there for him to dig out, however Homer found this more difficult as his belly grew bigger. His love handles were so huge and wide that it was difficult to tell where they ended and his ass began other than looking for a pants line. His belly hung low and a substantial overhang line creased over his pants. He stopped wearing his pants over his belly and just let it all flood out for Chris to enjoy. Homer was just in pure fat joy, he couldn't keep his hands off his fat (and often found himself super horny sitting at home and would hump into it as he ate more and more. Knowing it would turn into more fat), Chris couldn't keep his hands and his crotch off of Homer's fat either, he had this Goliath of a man growing for him and he would make sure Homer knew that he wouldn't be this fat if it weren't for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mouth wrapped around the nozzle Homer gulped down the contents of the milkshake machine, making noises like 'mmmf...mmmmf....mmmmf' as he swallowed. One hand had a tight hold of the leaver and it was pulling it down hard as the other rested on top of his belly. Every so often to tease Chris, Homer would let a little dribble down onto his belly and rub it into his skin. Chris stood there moaning as he looked at his fat pig guzzling down the fattening liquid but he couldn't take it any longer. He ran over to Homer and rammed into his belly and began to hump his belly button 'thats it you pig, drink it all down. I want to see it all gone and in here' Chris said and slapped Homer's belly sending ripples through it, 'you're getting so god damn big. But you ain't fat enough yet' He said, Homer didn't say anything but his own member was fully standing to attention. Chris humped faster and faster, unable to contain his excitement 'all this fat is mine, I made it happen...Feed it bigger...GET FUCKING HUGE!!!!' Chris said before blowing his load all over Homer. Homer felt his own relief as his belly bounced up and down on his erection. Chris wiped himself down and wiped Homer's belly of his love juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer finished draining the machine but something was different, rather than feeling full from all that liquid he felt hungry...extremely hungry. He placed his hands on the sides of his belly as it began to rumble. Chris laughed 'Sorry Homie, I added a little something this time. Appetite stimulant. Make you real hungry for the surprise I've got for you' Chris said and kissed Homer on the lips, 'Oh Paul...you can come in now' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very muscular man came walking in....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Homer this is Paul' Chris said with a smile on his face, Homer was confused but the rumbling in his belly kept bringing him out of why this man was here and that he was so damn hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn he's absolutely huge!' Paul said and walked up to Homer, he felt his belly and patted it. 'Yeah, 472lbs of prime pig and he ain't done yet' Chris said, 'fuck....that's hot.' Paul said, he leaned in and kissed homer hard and then sat atop his belly shelf, he pushed harder against Homer's mouth and felt his member get hard and poke him between his moobs. Homer sat there with this muscular man on him and couldn't help notice how good he smelt. He smelled like bacon fat, like he was covered in it. Homer licked a bit of Paul's face and confirmed it was true...it tasted so good mixed with the sweat of the muscular stud upon his belly. He felt Paul began to buck into him now, and kiss Homer harder. Homer returned the kiss as hard back but Homer couldn't get that taste out of his mind. Without even realising it Homer pulled Paul tighter and opened his mouth wide. Shoving Paul's head in his mouth. Paul didn't even realise at first but when he did he frantically kicked and tried to pull away but the grease he was covered head to toe in made him slip against the soft surface of Homer's belly. Homer just pulled him in more tasting all that grease and sweat as he traveled further down Homer's throat. Homer moaned loudly. He licked up and down Paul's six pack to get all the grease and then tipped his head back. Without much effort Paul slowly disappeared further and further in as he kicked frantically but it was no use. Homer was too hungry. All that was left was Paul's feet and with one huge gulp they disappeared. Homer's belly bounced up and down and looked so much bigger with Paul now inside it. It shook from side to side, as Paul panicked inside his fat prison. Homer felt his belly and it was so firm and taut but with still enough ample softness to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well that was impressive' Chris said laughing, 'what the hell Chris? You made me eat him!' Homer said in shock at what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I did nothing Homer. I didn't tell you to eat him...you did all that on your own. I just planted the seed, you decided what you did with it. I was happy for him to just ride you and then stuff you together but you couldn't help yourself. The fucking fat bastard you are becoming wanted that hunger to be satisfied. Now look at you, much fatter with that muscular stud shaking your belly from the inside. Now I know you like Vore, I'm going to play on that, fucking get you so fat off other people. That is such a turn on. You gobbling down like a fucking 300lb pig, oh yeah that was be incredible to see.' Chris said smacking and taunting Homer's belly as it shook with Paul inside. </span></div></div>",

Lifting the pitcher up, he placed it at Homer's lips and started tilting it so Homer got all the fattening liquid, 'thats it Homer you pig, chug it, make your belly swell with fat' but before homer could finish, Joey took it off him and placed it on the side, he grabbed the first thing he could and fed it to Homer, then the next and the next and the next, until there was only one thing left, 'just this chocolate gateau left Homer' Joey said, 'uhhhh, can't fit....that in' Homer said with little energy, 'you can and you will Homer' Joey said, he got off Homer's lap, 'your belly is just too stretched but it needs to stretch more, it needs moisturising to help it' Joey said, he grabbed the pitcher and liquid butter and poured it all over the top of Homers belly, it trickled down, all over his belly, into his belly button, over his prominent erection, dripping onto the seat. Joey put the pitcher glass down and began to rub the butter into Homer's belly, causing it to become slippery and smell delicious. Homer couldn't help but moan, as Joey gently caressed his stuffed middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer was in sensitivity overload with all this rubbing, the food had pushed the nerves closer, so every touch was electric to him. Joey began to kiss Homer's butter soft belly, then pushed his finger into Homer's belly button. Homer's eyes widened and he began to make louder moans, Joey kept moving his finger around in there and watched Homer try to reach for his erection, but every time, Joey pushed his hand away. 'Please Joey.....' Homer said with a begging tone, 'Please Joey what?' Joey said playfully, 'You know what!!' Homer said going berserk, Joey leaned in and whispered 'anything for you Homer' he sat on top of Homer's belly shelf, causing a bit of pain for Homer but this was incredible. Joey began to bounce slightly, causing Homer's belly to bounce up and down, his erection hitting his overstuffed belly over and over. Homer, was going berserk, his toes bending, until he hit climax and came all over his underbelly, the hot come splurting all up his front and all over his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer lay there panting, he had never had such amazing sex in his life, even with Marge. 'Well done Homer....now about that Chocolate Gateau' Joey said raising it to Homer's mouth. For some reason, Homer felt hungry again, he just did what he was told and devoured the chocolate treat, then lay back as Joey began to wipe away all the come from his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer looked at Joey and said 'Joey.............'</span></div></div>",

Homer grabbed the manager tightly and pulled him close, 'what are you doing?! Let go of me!!' the manager shouted; Homer didn't, he ripped the clothes off him and without warning thrust the managers head into his mouth and sucked. The manager slowly began to disappear into Homers mouth as he swallowed. The manager kicking frantically trying to get free but Homer grabbed the managers belly and began to squish it into his mouth; tilting his head back the manager slid further in and down into homers belly; that surged forward as his shirt burst unable to take the strain.

He began to breathe heavily and closed his eyes as it felt incredible, all homer could think about was how fat he was going to get, how hot he would look and how he would soon never have to work again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his left hand, he moved his index finger inside his belly button and moved it around. Homer moaned loudly and suddenly shot his load. It hit the underside of his belly and areas around it. Using the wall, homer breathlessly rested his arm against it. He slapped his belly and grabbed a towel from the towel rack in front of him and wiped his love juice off of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to get off the scales, still out of breath and entered the shower. The water covering his fat as it shot out from the shower. As incredible as the sensation he just experienced was, Homer didn't know whether he wanted to continue to take the product or not. Taking it would make him fatter quicker but it would take away the rewarding feeling of a slow gain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer thought to himself, looking down at his belly...</span></div></div>",

The feeling he got from those initial 20lbs was incredible and he wanted that to continue. Each day Homer used one dosage of Obesetopia, he didn't want to exceed this but after the hour was up he became an unstoppable eating machine. They were 4 incredibly fattening days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer grunted as he struggled to get from his bed. The last day had been a very filling day for him and it was evidentially showing for Homer. He smiled and walked into his bathroom in order to see the damage. The scales creaked loudly as Homer stood on them and they began to spin fast as they registered Homers weight. Landing on.....225lbs? 'What? 225?! How could I have lost weight?!!' Homer was concerned that he had lost weight but his belly wasn't smaller. That's when he noticed his huge belly was resting on the towel rack. Lifting his belly and dropping it off, it dropped and bounced for a few moments and came to a stop, the scales corrected themselves to his actual weight.....325lbs!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer couldn't believe it, here he was 10lbs heavier than his previous highest of 315lbs. He had gained 86lbs in total and 66lbs since the other day! In looks, homer looked like his king size self but his belly was further rounded out, a new roll had developed between his belly and moobs, his love handles were slightly bigger and his overhang line was much deeper, as was his belly button which was also slightly bigger in appearance making it look like a dark chasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my god!! 325lbs?! That's incredible. I'm a walking wall of lard....and yet it isn't enough. I want to get and get fatter and I want people to see my epic belly. It's time to....</span></div></div>",

Homer said with pure joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer showered ready for his day at the beach and then walked back into his bedroom and looked in his draw for a pair of speedos. They looked so incredibly small but homer didn't care, he wanted to show off every curve of his bulging belly. Pulling them on, they were so tight and made homer look even bigger due to their tightness. Homer caught himself in the mirror and realised how hot he looked, he felt his member grow but he couldn't play with it now, he wanted to get out to the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering himself in sun cream which took 1 bottle just for his belly. He pulled on a tight tshirt that didn't cover his belly and a tight pair of shorts that only just buttoned. Homer grabbed a towel and his sunglasses then got in his car to drive to the beach, it was a bit of a squeeze but Homer was content and ready to tan his big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the beach, Homer waddled down and placed his towel on the hot sand. Look around, it wasn't too busy, some people walking their dogs and a bunch of jocks around the age of 18 playing volleyball not too far away. Homer whipped off his tshirt and let his fat hang out, he then pulled out down his shorts and revealed his speedos. Homer then lay down on his towel and put his sunglasses on and rested his arms behind his head. Homer was super relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in the distance one of the jocks saw Homer laying there. 'Hey dude. Check out the whale' one jock said to his team mate, 'haha damn what a fatass. Hey guys look at that guy!' The second jock said to the opposing team, the third jock turned 'holy hell! He's wearing a speedo!', 'no way. What the hell?!' The first said again. The fourth jock turned around, but didn't say anything like his friends. He stared and his eyes widened and mouth slightly open. 'HEY FATASS! WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT. WHY DON'T YOU GET LOST AND GO EAT A BUCKET OF FRIED CHICKEN!!' The second jock shouted at Homer, Homer sat up and looked over, 'YEAH, YOU BETTER MOVE BEFORE SOMEONE THROWS YOU BACK IN THE OCEAN!' The first jock said, the two jocks high fived. Homer slightly chuckled but then he saw the one jock staring at him. He didn't say anything or laugh like his friends. Homer smiled at this and then lay back down, wondering why the young jock didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jocks got back down to their game but kept making stupid fat comments at Homers expense. That's when one came up with an idea 'hey guys. Watch this!' He said, he used all his force to serve the ball right at homer. The ball went flying and suddenly hit homer right on top of his belly and rolled off to his side. 'Oooft!!' Homer said, 'YES! What a shot!! Hahahaha' the guy laughed, the 3 jocks laughed and high fived when one said 'dude go and get the ball back' to the fourth jock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jock ran over to Homer who was rubbing his belly where he got hit. This was when Homer got a proper look at him, he had short trimmed black hair, his stomach was flat with a 6 pack and he had defined pectoral muscles under his black tank top. He wore a pair of beige knee length shorts and his arms were fairly muscular. 'Umm I'm sorry about my friends. They can be real jerks...' The jock said, 'that's ok..kind of expected some jokes might happen.' Homer said, 'even so...it wasn't fair just because you are on the larger side', 'hehe yeah I am'  Homer said and chuckled, the Jock smiled 'umm is it ok if I get my ball back' the jock said unable to take his eyes off homers belly. 'Sure go ahead' homer couldn't stop noticing that the jock was checking him out. The jock walked around homer and saw the ball fairly close to him, he bent down and just stared at Homers belly. He couldn't stop looking at it even though his hands were already on the ball. Homer looked at him and smiled 'you know you are completely out of view. Your friends can't see. You can touch it if you want', the jock looked at homer 'seriously?' He said, homer just nodded. The jock reached out and rubbed the side of Homers belly 'it's so big...and so soft' the jock said, 'mhmm yeah. Feels good doesn't it....I'm homer' homer said, the jock smiled 'I'm Josh'. He grabbed his ball and stood up, before he walked away Homer said '742 evergreen terrace' Josh turned and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer knew that Josh's friends would ask him why he took so long, so he packed up and left to drive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yo Josh. What took so long?' The first jock said, 'had a few choice words for that whale. Made him leave' Josh said, 'damn. Nice one Josh! Now let's get back to the game' the second jock said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fairly short drive, Homer arrived home. It wasn't the day at the beach he was expecting but he enjoyed it. Homer walked into the kitchen and grabbed a cold beer from the fridge to cool him down. He chugged it in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock comes at the door. Homer waddles over and opens it to see....</span></div></div>",

Good to see ya, buddy, come inside!\" Homer gave the jock a pat on the back as he ushered him in. \"I've got some Duffs in the fridge if you want one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded and Home grabbed him a bottle, which Josh sipped on casually. \"So,\" Josh said, \"About today at the beach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Homer grinned stupidly, his hand absentmindedly squeezing at his squishy underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what I should say about it. Like... thanks, I guess?\" His eyes locked back onto where Homer was touching his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I could tell you liked what you saw, and I appreciate that!\" Homer lifted his shirt up. \"You can touch it again if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's jaw dropped slightly and his mouth watered. He nodded and reached over, arm shaking, and rested his hand on homer's stomach. He sunk in his fingers, kneading the soft flab. He began to play with Homer's belly with both hands. \"Fuck...\" He murmured under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"325lbs.\" Homer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I weigh 325lbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fffuck!\" Josh bit his lip and scooted closer to Homer to reach both sides of his belly. \"I'm sorry, I've never really been with a guy like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really aren't like those other losers, huh?\" Homer leaned back and closed his eyes, letting Josh massage his rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those guys? No, they're all about girls. They know I'm into guys, but I'd never tell them about this.\" Josh sighed. \"How'd you get this huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer told Josh about how he started gaining, how he lost the weight, how he started again about about Obesetopia. \"I've gained over 80lbs in a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"80lbs?!?\" Josh nearly creamed his pants as he heard that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and I'm not done yet.\" Homer gave Josh a sly wink. Josh responded by leaning and planting a kiss on Homer's lips. Homer was a bit surprised at first, but quickly began to enjoy himself. Even if the boy had never been with a larger man before, he certainly knew how to kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was in pure bliss as his hands wandered about Homer's obese body. Every place he touched his hands sunk into wobbling blubber. Josh flexed his biceps and heaved Homer onto him. \"Come on, fatass, lemme feel that weight,\" Josh grunted. He pulled Homer in close allowing the man's flab to spread across his chiseled torso. Homer obliged and wiggled about, feeling his body jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirts, shorts and then underwear slipped off as the two horndogs grinded against each other. For Homer, it was quite an experience as he never thought he'd really enjoy the feeling of such muscular perfection against his body. For Josh, he was barely able to contain himself as his pulsing 8\" cock prodded Homer's fat. Josh got on his knees and traced along Homer's bright red stretch marks, of which he had many. He grabbed the man's belly and buried his head into it, moaning as he dripped precum onto the carpet. Josh's head slid down Homer's sweaty belly and he began to lick the head of Homer's cock, which was largely buried by fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was good with his tongue down under as much as he was up above, and he soon had Homer huffing, puffing and moaning. As if his tongue swirling around the tip wasn't enough to get Homer bucking like a horse, Josh's hands were lifting his sensitive underbelly to allow him to press in deeper. Josh was barely able to breathe as his entire face was covered in the fat of Homer's crotch and thighs, but he couldn't have been more aroused. Homer soon shot a thick load down the stud's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then pulled Homer onto the ground where he was kneeling and laid back, stroking his cock. Homer leaned in to lick the throbbing member, but Josh stopped him. \"No, don't. *Huff* All I need, *Huff* if your fat. On me. Now.\" He pulled Homer one more time, allowing the gluttonous butterball to crush him with his weight, specifically with his belly between Josh's legs. Josh spread apart his thighs and wrapped  his legs around Homer to grind into his belly. \"Fuck, you're so fat...\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So fat... So heavy and fat...\" Homer moaned as well, still aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get fatter... I need you fatter....\" Josh's mind was blank to all thoughts except this ball of fat between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to be fatter, yes. 400lbs. 500. 600.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch, that's so hot...\" Josh bucked his hips faster, lubricated by the sweat dripping down his pulsing abs and Homer's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna stop getting fatter! I'll never stop growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-never stop. F-fatter... fatter... fatter... ff-ffaaaaaaahhhh...\" Josh sighed as he sprayed hot cum all over Homer's stomach. Homer rolled over next to Josh and the two closed their eyes, breathing heavily and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so good...\" Josh smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best I've ever had.\" Homer smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean it?\" Josh asked, still staring at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mean what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About never stopping getting fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. I don't know how fat is enough, so I'll just keep growing forever I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick, bro...\" Josh lifted up a fist to pound, but lazily put it down. \"'Cause I'm thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

To bulk up faster, you need to try and hit a wider range, stuff with a lot more grease and fats than sugar.

Has lots of calories, and can cause even the thinnest guy to bloat up quick.\" Looking across at Homer, Mac got a small idea. \"I just thought of something. How about I write up a rough meal plan for you. Just some ideas for each meal and every snack. Meal times, you want to focus on the fat heavy foods. Stuff like Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, Burgers, Pizza, Fondue, Greasy Meats like Bacon and Sausage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about in between meals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you see, that's when you have your candy and chocolate. You always want something to hand that you can mindlessly snack on when watching TV, or whatever. it won't fill you up, but that's the point. You never really want to stuff yourself to the point of illness. You want to be at least sated all day, and only really at meals do you want to really fill up on all the calorie dense foods. Breads, Meats, Dairy and Sweets are your friends in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me, guess I better get started!\" Homer exclaimed, matching over too the fridge, pulling out a heap of ingredients. Setting them on the side, he turned back to Mac. \"By the end of October, I'm going to be a big fat dynamo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit Homer. I'd better get going, I've got to be back on shift in 20 minutes or so. Don't worry, you've got a little over a month to submit that picture. If you can put on 20 lbs without my help, I'm sure you can easily put that much on in only a fraction of the time\". With that, Mac excused himself, going out the door, heading back to his car. </span></div></div>",
