            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an average day at the Membrane family household. Which for Gaz meant that she was holed up in her room, sitting at her computer and logged into one of her online game accounts. She was completely oblivious to the world around her, focus entirely on the screen in front of her face as she guided her avatar through wave after wave of demons, zombies and other monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, c'mon, almost there,\" she muttered to herself, approaching a large set of doors at the end of the corridor she was in, \"Just a little further, and the Golden Egg of Supremeness is mine. Now all I have to do is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the power suddenly went out, the computer screen going dead. Gaz froze, staring at the blackened screen in disbelief at what had just happened, not comprehending it. After a moment, however, her eye started to twitch, as the only possible explanation occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIB!\" she yelled. Getting up, she practically tore her door off its hinges and stomped out of her room, crossing the hall to kick open the door to her brother's room. To her total lack of surprise, he was seated at his desk, looking at a device with a large variety of cables running from it into every socket in the room. He jumped at her entrance, and looked at her with surprise that quickly morphed into fear at the sight of her visible anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just blew all the power to the rest of the house!\" she snarled at him, \"I was just about to beat the newest expansion to <i>World of Blarghcraft</i> - do you have any idea how many hours I've put into that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Gaz, this is important!\" Dib protested, holding up his hands defensively, \"I found a way to recharge my spelldrives with conventional power sources instead of magic. Don't you get what this means? I can use all the spells in here to finally defeat Zim for good! I mean, look, there's a teleportation spell right here I can use to get into his base and subdue him before he even knows what hit him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care,\" Gaz said firmly, still advancing on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would if you could focus on anything other than your stupid games,\" Dib muttered, only to wince as he realized what he'd just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid?!\" Gaz snapped. Losing any remaining self-restraint, she lunged at Dib, who jumped out of his chair to avoid her. Shooting past him, Gaz slammed into his desk, and as she braced herself against it, one of her hands slapped down onto the activation button on the spelldrive. Before she could react, the device hummed to life, and a purplish aura of energy emerged from the drive to completely surround her. And then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>ZAP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-with a flash of light and a sound of whooshing air, Gaz vanished from sight. Dib blinked in surprise at that, and then grinned widely as he realized what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked! Now I have a working teleportation spell! This is awe...some...\" Dib trailed off as he suddenly noticed something piled on the floor at the spot where Gaz had been standing - namely, the clothes she had been wearing. Apparently, they hadn't been teleported with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh, she is going to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Gaz arrived at a new destination, now totally naked. But where had she been teleported to?</span></div></div>",

As it stopped and her eyes cleared, she looked around in confusion. She wasn't in Dib's room anymore, but standing in what she quickly identified as the local video game store at the City Mall, the one she always made use of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so that idiot was right for once about something. Guess that's kinda cool,\" Gaz muttered as she absently put her hands on her hips... and froze, as she noticed the distinct lack of feeling fabric when she did so. And, she realized belatedly, why could she feel the floor on her bare feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, her eyes widened and her face went bright red as she saw that she was completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH! Where are my clothes?!\" she screamed, wrapping her arms around her bare body protectively and jumped behind a stack of boxes for further cover. Looking around in a panic, she saw that the store was currently closed and empty, which was a minor relief considering that the current lack of witnesses didn't change the fact that she was still naked in a public place, which would fill up rapidly whenever an employee came to open it for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to <i>kill</i> Dib for this,\" she muttered, face still flushing as she imagined the humiliation potentially facing her, \"Come on, think! How do I get out of here without anyone seeing me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaz frantically wracked her brain, trying to figure out a solution to her problem. However, in her panicked state she couldn't think of anything, and eventually she ran out of a time, as an employee arrived to open the store for the customers lining up outside. And then...</span></div></div>",

Peering around her makeshift cover, she cursed as she saw a store employee walking through the door, being followed by a large group of customers. They hadn't seen her yet, but the store wasn't big enough to avoid that for more than a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaving off the panic just enough to avoid running out through the door and hoping no one recognized her, Gaz instead retreated further into the store. Heart pounding in her chest as she desperately looked for some kind of help, her gaze settled on what she realized was a back door to the store. Figuring wherever it led couldn't be worse than this situation, she quickly ran over to the door, opened it just enough to slip through, and then shut it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around once she was on the other side of the door, Gaz found that it wasn't just a rear exit to the store, but to the Mall as well, as she was now standing in a filthy alleyway behind the building. Spotting some trashcans nearby, she reluctantly grabbed the lids off two of them, holding one in front of her and one behind, giving her at least some basic cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, this isn't good, but it's better,\" Gaz muttered to herself, \"There's no one here, I have some cover, I can work with this. I just need to figure out what to do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of standing there, Gaz finally decided on...</span></div></div>",

However, most of them revolve around the title character and his nemesis Dib. Only rarely does Dib's scary sister get her time to shine, and I think it's about time that that should change. So, contained here within this interactive will be a collection of prompts for stories focused on Gaz ending up in all kinds of wacky situations. Everyone feel free to make use of one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few ground rules first, however:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* NO SEXUAL STUFF. Gaz's canon age isn't clear, but it's definitely preteen, so that's just not right. Now, should she somehow be aged up to 18+, <i>maybe</i> I'd allow it. That's negotiable.<br>\r\n* Just to be clear, Gaz is meant to be the main character of these stories, but still feel free to include any other IZ characters as necessary.<br>\r\n* OCs are fully welcomed.<br>\r\n* Try not to end any stories. Keep them going as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I think that covers everything. Let's get this thing started!</td>",
