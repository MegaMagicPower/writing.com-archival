It was designed to be a childless cruise and have many high energy activities on the ship. There were singles clubs, nudist lounges, multi-deck games of laser tag and even a zombie outbreak event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt currently had two thousand people on board, including passengers and crew. Even though it was aimed at younger passengers there were still a few people who were young in spirit, with a few cougars in their 40s being the oldest passengers. The oldest crew member however was the captain, who was in his early 50s, while the oldest person on board was the CEO of the cruise line who was just shy of sixty. He had brought his two daughters, who were in their early twenties and his thirty-five year old son on board as well. Most of the other crew were under the age of thirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship had left from Los Angeles and was sailing down the cost of Baja California. It was sailing to Costa Rica, stopping by Mexico along the way. Then it would head straight back to the US.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship would never make it that far, as a massive storm struck a day or so into the cruise, catching everyone unaware. The ocean was so strong, it pulled the ship into an extremely fast current, taking the ship due south and below the equator. They were now in the middle of the Southern Pacific Ocean in a place the ocean currents usually go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship was dead in the water, though the seas around them, while a terrifying dark blue, remained unusually calm. Given their location, the crew thought it best that they did not abandon ship as the life boats wouldn't be able to reach safety before they ran out of supplies and a cruise ship would be easier to spot by their rescuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the crew did not tell their passengers though, was their communications had been damaged by the storm, they could receive but could not transmit. Rescue was not coming and they were too far out at sea to find safety. They were lost at sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the bridge crew knew that last part however and they were going to keep everyone calm for as long as possible. Though strange things already began to occur and things were only going to get weirder from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does this story begin?</span></div></div>",

That changes in the blink of an eye as a loud clap of thunder shakes the ship. The people on the top deck look up and watch as the cloudless sky begins to swirl like a vortex and black clouds form out of nowhere. Red and purple lightning flashes in the sky as the ocean roars to life, with a force that threatens to capsize the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy dark rain begins to pour from the sky, so heavy it's like liquid hail.

That was mostly due to the locker space, where you would put your clothes and ship pass while at the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian looked at the line and examined some of the women, hoping he'd get a chance to see them naked, unfortunately there were just as much men waiting to get in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the door, he saw a sign with the rules for the area. It included things like no photos, no masturbating, no touching and no unwanted attention. It also mentioned how you could be kicked out at any time and permanently banned from the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up to the end of the line and made it into the single locker room. He tried not to stare as a bunch of women got undressed in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry hun,\" a cougar said standing next to him as she took off her bra. She had a few wrinkles but was still rather pretty looking, though she did have a scar from childbirth. \"They don't care too much about erections, just so long as you don't touch it,\" she said with a wink, before finishing getting undressed and going into the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian slowly got undressed and put his things in the locker, he gave it a simple and easy to remember code and entered the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the cougar as soon as he stepped out and she gave him a smile and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, mum what are you doing here?!\" He saw a younger woman say to the cougar. It wasn't the best thing her to yell out as all eyes were on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a free ship Darling,\" the cougar showed no signs of embarrassment as she walked further into the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter on the other hand was mortified and went to leave. When a large clap of thunder shook the entire ship, she almost fell to her feet but Adrian managed to grab her and stopped her from falling over.</span></div></div>",

She was almost a splitting image of her mum, though rather than brown hair she had straight golden blonde hair. Her body was a little more toned than her mothers and she was a bit shorter. Still Adrian couldn't possibly imagine the embarrassment of finding a parent in the nudist lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let go of the woman and let her go to leave when he heard people screaming as everyone began to run inside away from the dark rain. It seemed to hit them hard as some people had red marks on their skin and a few people were holding their groins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning the ship suddenly surged forward, sending everyone backwards. Adrian landed on his back and the poor woman he helped landed right on top of him. Her ass, ass landing right on top of his genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth, groaning in pain, which just got her hair in his mouth. He instinctively reached for his groin and because she was on top, he accidentally touched hers instead. He quickly moved his hands, as soon as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People over board!\" A voice cried among the noise of the situation. The surge sent some poor souls flying over the back of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian laid their in pain, until the ship finally stopped and all the lights went out as it did.

His mouth had vanished and fused with the back of her head. while her ass had fused with his hips. He could still see but it was mostly the top of her. Her back had also fused into his torso. He still had control over some of his arms but her shoulders had connected with his biceps. Their legs had also fused together and now her heels were just about his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian tried to talk but couldn't though the simple act made the woman reach to the back of her head, causing his own arms to move and she touched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed as she tried to stand up. Though her legs were shorter than Adrian's. Though she did have the ability to crawl, which put Adrian on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian didn't even know this woman's name and now he was stuck to her in the most awkward way possible.

It would appear that those two were the only ones stuck like this but others in the nudist lounge had changed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria?\" Adrian heard the Cougar say as she eyed off her daughter. She was outside when the rain hit and now had impressions in her skin, not only that but her breasts had warped to an odd shape and she no longer that any genitals. \"Get off my daughter you creep!\" She screamed at Adrian as she tried to get him off. \"Oh my god Maria, he's stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on mum?\" Maria cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" her mother replied.</span></div></div>",

Some days I even find myself back on the morning after the storm, I'm in my cabin but rather than being me I'm what I've been transformed into a couple of days later. Some people know what's going on, some people. Like you, don't. You know I saw two people turned into mice while they were fucking, they didn't even seem to notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael felt a chill go up her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh it's happening again, I wonder how we'll change this time.\"</span></div></div>",

She examined her detached nose. \"Fascinating...\" her voice sounded like she would if she had a cold or her nose was blocked. She put her nose on the desk and then grabbed her lips. With another pull she was left mouthless and no way to talk or breathe. However her chest continued to rise and she didn't feel like she was suffocating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael opened up her detached mouth and saw her tongue and teeth. Where her mouth was on her head, she felt nothing, It's like the whole area was filled in with flesh and tissue. She touched her former mouth and found it soft to the touch. She then placed her nose inside her mouth and closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed and begged inside her head as she picked up her detached genitals and gave them another look. She aimed the smooth side towards her face and pressed it against her head. Instantly she gained the felling in them again as they reattached in the wrong spot.

Curious he picked them up and opened them, discovering it had teeth and a tongue inside, though that shouldn't have been possible. He also found a loose nose in the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" he said as he dropped them in shock. \"What the fuck?!\" He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror again, though now he looked rather different. his skin had gone a weird shade of brown, his eye looked like an insect at he had a giant antenna growing from his head. He turned to face the mirror once more, and noticed his hands hand gone and he began to grow an exoskeleton. His clothes tore as he grew two giant wings and an extra pare of insect legs sprouted from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few moments was agony for him as he began to shrink and he changed even more. Before he knew it, he was a cockroach on the floor. Helpless and confused he slid under the door, and tried to look for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't the only rodent though and most of them seemed to be as confused as he was. He saw a crew member walking down the hallway and he approached her for help, not giving a second thought. For his efforts she lifted up her shoe and it came crashing down, squishing him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samuel woke up next he found himself sitting in a cold room, surrounded by apples.

All their friends were invited to join them on the cruise and most of them had accepted. The ship was made for them to enjoy, though like anything their father did for them, it was something he could make money off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were so identical in appearances that people often joked that Charles Benson had cloned them in a lab. They had the same facial features, same body shape and same hair and clothing style. There were a few things that could tell them apart, like Jasmine's scar on her right arm, or the difference in their freckles. Notably a couple of distinct ones on Opal's breasts. There was also the way they acted, while Identical in appearance, they carried themselves differently. Jasmine was more outspoken, wild and playful while Opal was more conniving and reserved, she still liked partying though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so bored...\" Jasmine moaned. \"There's nothing to do in here, the TV won't even turn on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal was sunbathing on their private balcony while wearing her bikini. \"That's because the power to the ship is out Jasmine. The ship isn't moving.\" Opal pointed to the other chair. \"Come join me in soaking up the rays, I'm sure daddy will have the ship fixed shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine rolled her eyes. \"Okay fine..\" she wanted to go out and do stuff but sunbathing was nice alternative. She took her top off and dropped her skirt on the floor of their room, revealing she had the same colour bikini as her sister. She hopped on the chair, laid back and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal, felt a sudden jolt in her head, causing her to sit up rapidly. She was now in the chair Jasmine was in and she saw her body relaxing with her eyes closed. \"Holy crap we just swapped bodies!\" Opal, exclaimed. She looked down at her new body and tried to feel the difference. Nothing did though, just that she was in a different spot than before, and the body next to her had her freckle pattern on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Her sister asked. \"Swapped bodies? That's a good one. It's not like anyone could tell us apart anyway.\" Her sister dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sitting on that chair a second ago, now I'm on this one!\" Opal explained. She then looked at her arm and found Jasmine's scar. \"See look at this,\" she showed her sister proof that they really swapped.</span></div></div>",

We've swapped bodies and we don't know how,\" Opal got up off the chair and brought her sister back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People can't tell us apart half the time, so it's not really that big of a deal,\" Jasmine pointed out. \"I mean, I didn't believe you, until you showed me my scar.\" Jasmine examined her body a bit, to see if anything felt different. \"Wow I really can't tell the difference at all, maybe if you were fatter or had shorter hair but I had no idea how identical we were until just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal scoffed. \"Please, if anyone is the fatter one, it'd be you. You eat way more junk than I do. And why would I want shorter hair, I like my hair like this,\" Opal ran her hands through her current hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that proves my point!\" Jasmine pointed at Opal. \"You said you like your hair like that and touched mine. So it doesn't matter. I mean there's some people that could tell us apart but it's not like we haven't pretended to be each other before and it's not like we can't act like each other. Oh, we could swap boyfriends for the rest of the cruise!\" It was something they had done in the past, just to see how much their boyfriends really knew them or if they were just with them based on their appearances. If they weren't able to figure it out, they'd usually dump them. Of course Jasmine also did this without Opal knowing sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I really like Scott and he loves me,\" Opal rejected the idea. Jasmine nodded in agreement. Scott was one of the ones that figured out it was Jasmine, though not until after they were both naked. That could be bad if Opal pretended to be herself, as he'd recognize Jasmine's body and have a go at her for trying it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boyfriend has seen me naked, he knows about my scar and where my freckles are. I'm not going to convince him that I'm not you,\" Jasmine tried to discourage keeping their current boyfriends, not so she could be with Scott but so Opal didn't find out what Jasmine did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just cover up any distinguishing marks when we're with them,\" Opal suggested. \"That way we keep our own boyfriends. If necessary then we tell them the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine shook her head. \"Like you... or I could cover up these.\" Jasmine pushed up her current breasts. \"We're on holiday, I don't think either of us even has a top that covers our cleavage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal rolled her eyes, Jasmine had a point, the top of their breasts was the biggest thing that told them apart. That's why they never liked men they didn't like the looks of being able to tell them apart straight away. \"Okay, but nothing physical. I'll allow making out and hand holding, that's all.\" Opal looked out onto the ocean. It was eerily quiet, the seas were calm and there was no marine life. \"That is until we swap back and if we stay on the ship where we're able to enjoy ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I forgot the ship was broken. Also I'm sure it won't matter if we stay like this. It could be so much worse...\" Jasmine begun to say.</span></div></div>",

She was one of the others that had fallen overboard with him though she had been pulled out sooner. Her eyes seemed shallow by she also seemed to be in good spirits. Zachary turned to her and she pointed to a guy that was unconscious with a bandage wrapped around his head. Zach watched as the guy turned into a woman before his very eyes. \"Pretty cool huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Zachary asked, the voices in his head grew louder, demanding a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know, you've been touched too...\" the girl informs him. \"Go ahead try it, it makes the voices go quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZachary did know. Somehow everyone that ended up in that water had been touched by the darkness and now they could manipulate reality. Though was Zachary really going to use this power. \"I really shouldn't...\" Zachary says looking at the former man. The voices in his head screamed when he said that, causing him physical pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? She's unconscious, she's an easy target,\" the woman gave a devilish smile. \"No one is going to notice but you and me.\" Zachary focused on the woman and tried to turn her back into a man but that not only caused him pain but the woman as well. \"I guess you can't undo what I did...\" she says giving him an annoyed glare. \"Also don't be so nice, have some fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZachary nods and focused once again, he...</span></div></div>",

It was made of metal and wires with solar panels and other bits and pieces, it was completely flat and the metal had fused together in weird ways. Several country flags could be seen in the twisted metal, this was made up of more than one satellite and it should not have been floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice distraction from the doom the Exotic Adventure would meet, as the island shouldn't have been a source of salvation though something changed all that</span></div></div>",

It is now impossibly off course as all navigational tools seem to indicate the ship is near point Nemo (the furthest place from land in the ocean).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm and their co-ordinates are the least of their worries though, as strange happenings begin to occur on the ship with every day bringing some new kind of change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\nDeath of any of the characters are fine. Though that doesn't mean the story has to end, new victims can be discovered and death can be reversed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dealing with characters under the age of 18, be mindful how you treat them, I will not tolerate any nudity or sex and these chapters will be deleted. I'd rather not have anyone under age but that does remove the ability for age regression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe mindful of other people when writing, leaving as many options available as possible. If you can only add two paths I'd rather you do 'more options' as the second choice allowing for others to add their own ideas. On that note be careful how long you make your chapters, they shouldn't be too short however they should also leave room for choice. So don't write too many transformations or actions in a single chapter where another choice was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am impulsive and do change my mind often so do except to see the occasional change in the structure of the interactive or some of my additions being edited. I will try not to delete chapters and if an idea I thought of gets taken I will use the more options or edit the choices so both out ideas for that choice can be expressed. (On that note, if anyone wanted to add to a particular option that was taken feel free to repeat that choice with your own idea).</td>",
