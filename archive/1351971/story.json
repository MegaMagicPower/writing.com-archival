Others - if they'd known his thoughts on the matter, and been brave enough to speak out - would have disagreed, for although the large meal did indeed make the king's belly look much more rotund than normal, in fact his belly was visual proof that his weight had been rising slowly for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the early days, much of the gain had been in muscle mass - the amount of time he was spending on his paws had risen dramatically since he's returned - which had seen his form expand, from the slender gangliness of a rogue, to the powerful stockiness of a king. As the Pridelands were becoming bountiful once again though, the amount of exercise he was getting was starting to plateau, and thus, so was the development of his musculature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba wasn't aware of this though, as indeed he'd hardly been aware of any growth in the first place, and so made no move to curtail the amount he ate. None of the lionesses had shown any concern over how much the king ate either, and certainly none of them him a greedy or gluttonous lion by any means, but given the number of successful hunts and the amount the lionesses were bringing back each time, the volume of meat he was consuming these days was slightly more than was his busy yet measured lifestyle was allowing him to shed. Some of the excess was just starting to become a thin blanket beneath his pelt, softening his muscular appearance very slightly, but a good portion of was finding its way to his abdomen, resulting in his now starting to carry a small, yet portentous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the lionesses had yet to notice Simba's new belly against the background of his general muscular expansion, nor had his friends Timon and Pumbaa, and if his aides Zazu and Rafiki had noticed it, they'd kept it to themselves.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nSlightly less than an hour after he'd finished eating, Simba was awoken from his engorged slumber by a noise nearby. Partially awoken anyway, it took a little time, and some persistence on the part of Zazu before he was fully awake enough to sigh at the situation, \"you couldn't have left it a bit longer could you Zazu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that I could sire,\" Zazu replied, though he didn't seem regretful in the least as far as Simba could tell, \"but you should know by now that the life of a king is not meant to be easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba glared at Zazu for a moment, but the hornbill only stared right back, not seeming the least bit afraid, though he did flinch a little when one of the lionesses asked tiredly, \"how much trouble would it be to replace him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than I'd like,\" Simba replied, then yawned widely, before arising with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really need to go,\" Nala asked, shooting Zazu a black look, \"can't it wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wish it could Simba replied, bending down to share a nuzzle, \" but Zazu's right, I'm a king, so I have certain duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just as long as you remember you have duties back here as well,\" Nala smiled, \"good luck out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Simba replied, then stretched, and groaned, \"uurgh, that'll teach me not to each big meals when I know I'm not going to get hours to digest it.\" With a last sigh, he said, \"I'll try not to be too long, but I can't make promises,\" then started to pad down towards the savannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's mood didn't improve as he left Pride Rock behind, not only was the afternoon heat stifling, but his engorged stomach vibrated slightly with each step, which was just nauseating enough to feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately his day wasn't about to improve any time soon as...</span></div></div>",

However, when he reached the apex of his leap, he was surprised to see the rabbit suddenly dodge out of his immediate grasp. Simba landed peacefully on the ground, but spun and growled at his target, who... seemed to fade away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Simba couldn't believe his eyes. The rabbit seems to disintegrate into thin air, with only a few small particles of dust seeming to remain. The wind catches the dust, and throws it into Simba's face. Simba coughs and sneezes a few times, feeling congested at first and then becoming confused and disoriented. Suddenly, a high pitched, evil voice sounds in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, King Lion. I am, what you call, the Spirit of the Jungle. Had you left me be, I'd have given you the best luck and life imaginable, in thanks for your kindness. However, despite your very successful current life where you lacked not for food, you still decided to attack an animal with nothing to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're hungry, huh? Want to eat some more right now? Well, I'm going to make it so you never want to eat again. Honestly, you may never do so. Kumlai durhena!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, the voice disappears.

Slowly, his mind was thinking increasingly of food, and his stomach suddenly began to growl. \"Hoo, boy,\" he said to himself, \"better get something to eat, I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion quickly ran to the nearest patch of rainforest he could find, desperate for a stream, in whose swampland he could find some bugs. He was too hungry to stand taking down a zebra; Nala usually took care of that stuff anyway, and he didn't trust what'd happen if he screwed up. As he overturned a log, he knew he'd made the right decision. The downed tree was hiding a two-foot deep pit teeming with insects he'd never seen before. They were all different colors, no two colored the same. Simba picked one up to investigate it. It was about half an inch thick, and squishy, too. He popped it in his mouth; it was a fruity sensation he had never tasted before and couldn't get enough of. The lion laid down next to the trough, sticking his face right into the trough to bite into a mouthful. It was the best thing he'd ever tasted. Timon and Pumbaa would be so jealous. As he took another bite, then another, Simba began to feel ecstacy, the taste of the bugs spreading through his body, creating a tingling sensation. This only left the lion to chew away harder and faster, eager to get more of his fix. After another few minutes, the lion sat back, in awe of the bliss. Sighing, he put his paws on his stomach... which was a lot bigger than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba took a moment to think, then opened his eyes. Yep, that was definitely his tummy, and yep, it was about four inches larger in every direction. He turned off his back, taken aback at the extra difficulty that action asked of him. Padding over to the stream, he checked his reflection. His cheeks had rounded out a bit, while his chin had began to acquire a second one. Checking out his body, he saw he had definitely gained weight, at least a hundred pounds. As the bugs' drug-like effect wore off, the lion felt sudden pangs he couldn't comprehend. If he had just gained a hundred pounds, making him a pretty large lion, he shouldn't want to eat more bugs... but their juicy allure was starting to make his mouth water.</span></div></div>",

Perfection. The perfect flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion slowly drifted into a trance-like state as the bugs' mild venom, meant to slow and relax the body's nervous system, slowly seeped into his skin. \"You know, man... this is nice,\" Simba said to himself between bites. \"Just a nice, peaceful little vacation.\" Though he was loathe to care, Simba's body began again to thicken, his belly's growth outward slowly matched by his legs, down to his paws, then up to his face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before he had a chance to let things get even further out of control, Simba came to his senses and immediately ran to Timon and Pumbaa. In passing, they'd mentioned some ridiculous stories here and there about eating a hundred-foot-long worm, and being hypnotized by snakes, and working to become elephants, and gained huge amounts of magic weight in the process. Though his speed was slowed somewhat by his extra padding, Simba was able to track them down in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timon, Pumbaa, I need your help,\" Simba panted as he sat down next to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Simba! We were just discussing...\" Timon welcomed his friend for a minute until he noticed the big change that had just occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, Simba, you sure do look different. Is it weird that I see myself in you a little bit right now?\", Pumbaa blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheepishly, Simba gave a small grin and explained everything to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have a magic spell on you that makes you get fat, and you found a bunch of magic bugs,\" Timon said. \"That's about right,\" Simba replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you haven't brought us to it yet... why?\" the meerkat sarcastically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he couldn't help but think it was a bad idea, Simba agreed to show his friends the treasure trove he had uncovered. Timon and Pumbaa stared agape at the massive swarm of bugs, grubs and other insects right before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the call of the curse began to hit Simba harder. His stomach suddenly felt like he hadn't eaten in days, and almost reflexively the lion grabbed a flying bug and shoved it into his mouth. Then another, and another. After a few seconds the lion had his face in the pit again, shoveling the bugs into his mouth using his paws. Timon and Pumbaa could only watch at first as the curse appeared to come true - their friend was slowly but surely expanding outward, his initial hundred pounds marching upward at a muted pace.</span></div></div>",

This was not an unusual occurrence, even in this sparsely-inhabited corner of the kingdom, there were always a few predators who hung on out here for one reason or another, more as scavengers than predators. None of them had been involved here though, for the carcass was unmarked by either tooth or claw, and indeed there wasn't even the scent of another animal around. This in itself was unusual, even if nothing on the ground spotted a kill, surely a vulture should have spotted this? Stranger still was how the poor beast had died, there were no marks or trauma, yet the carcass was all but surrounded by an air of terror and exhaustion, as though the animal had been running from something and pushed itself too hard, yet what was there out here to run <i>from</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Simba didn't notice his growing hunger, but soon enough he couldn't ignore it, his stomach growling loudly enough to scare off small animals. The king had by now forgotten his earlier encounter with the 'spirit', and so didn't consider that there was anything unusual about the feeling of emptiness except perhaps its intensity, which was soon so overpowering that he couldn't help but dig into the carcass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Simba devoured the carcass, the hunger didn't seem to abate at all, indeed as his stomach expanded it only seemed to grow. Soon enough, the king's stomach had expanded to its natural limit, beyond which he was in danger of serious injury, but his hunger was by now so intense that even considering slowing down was all but unthinkable, and indeed as he continued to gorge his stomach seemed not to be troubled by its eve-increasing burden, expanding in a way that should not have been possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger only finally dropped to a manageable level when Simba was cleaning the last of the flesh from the bones. He wasn't sure precisely how much he'd eaten, but he knew it was much more than he should have, and indeed a fair bit more than he should have been <i>able</i> to. He was by now lying down, his fore-quarters almost upright, but his hind-quarters off to the side to allow his unnaturally engorged belly enough space to not cause too much discomfort, at least physically. The king was very worried, not only had his hunger been quite unnatural he now knew, but the amount he'd consumed had been similarly impossible, or should have been. This in itself presented a problem though, since he had no idea who to tell, the lionesses surely wouldn't be able to do anything, and neither would his friends Timon and Pumbaa, nor Zazu, which left only Rafiki, yes, the old mandrill would be able to help him surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his course decided, Simba was faced with another problem, for the impala had been a well-sized male, and so he'd have to struggle with his stomach, almost twice as big as it should be and twinging painfully simply to get up. Of course, he didn't let that put him off, and so gritted his teeth and started to experiment. After several minutes...</span></div></div>",

Of course, things didn't get much easier once he was upright, his belly was so large that it got him in the way of his hind-legs, forcing him to adopt a something of a waddle simply to avoid poking his knees painfully into his engorged stomach. Still, there was nothing he could about it, Rafiki was the only one who could help him now, and the sooner he set off the sooner he'd arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba realised soon enough that he'd be lucky to reach Rafiki's baobab home by nightfall, so slow was his progress, but he was determined to keep on, at least until he caught the scent of water on the breeze, which brought back to him how thirsty he was, and so he debated whether to delay his journey for a time, before his thirst, which had appeared almost as quickly and was almost as strong as his hunger had been all but drove him towards the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waterhole was small, and seemed to be little-used, but that suited Simba fine, it would be embarrassing to appear to his subject like this in any case. At first he tried to drink standing up, but this proved, with the weight in his gut, and the slope of the bank to be almost impossible, and so he lay down as he had at the carcass, craned his neck forward until he could reach the water and began to drink. He'd not intended to drink much, but as with his meal, an unnatural gluttony overtook him and so he drank until his stomach fairly sloshed, drinking as much as he'd eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his thirst faded and he was able to take stock of his situation, Simba was dismayed to say the least, the contents of his stomach weighed almost a half of what he did, and he was now so engorged that trying to continue his journey would be impossible, and so he gave up and lay on his side, wondering what was happening, and if there was any way of solving it. As he lay there under the warm sun, with his impossibly bloated stomach starting to work over its incredible meal, he soon began to feel drowsy, and it only increased minute by minute until staying awake was virtually impossible.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nSimba awoke...</span></div></div>",

Realising there wasn't a moment to lose, he struggled upright - a manoeuvre that was a little more difficult than he'd expected it to be despite his still descended belly, and set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times on his journey Simba tried running, but for some reason never seemed to be able to get up the speed he'd expected to, despite having accounted for his still somewhat distended gut. In this thought at least he was correct, his belly wasn't the sole cause of his loss of speed, indeed no part of his body was solely responsible, because the loss was the result of the cumulative effect each part played. What the king's self-examination hadn't noticed was that although his belly had shrunken, the mass of it - or rather, <i>within</i> it - hadn't simply disappeared, a portion of it had been 'redistributed', to the effect that he now weighed several dozen pounds more than he had before his recent meal, though the difference in any one place was subtle almost to the point of being unnoticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his gain though, Simba made good progress on his journey, until he heard a commotion off to his left. At first he thought nothing of it, until he heard a distinctive giggling that could only have been produced by a hyena. He felt his hackles rise at that, the dirty scavengers were still coming if after dark were they, well he'd have to teach them a lesson so that they wouldn't do it again. Loping off towards the sound, the scene he came across made him angrier than even the simple thought of those mangy beast simply being here, five of the beasts had treed a pregnant leopard and were now feasting on its undoubtedly hard-won kill, this wouldn't do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyenas looked up when Simba roared and retreated quickly when he charged, or at least four did, the fifth wasn't quite fast enough, and was knocked off its feet by a mighty blow, though was able to scramble upright and beat a hasty retreat before the king was able to drag his turgid body around to pin it, following its friends out into the darkness. With the fight over, he stood there, panting slightly for a moment, before remembering the totality of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Simba, the now somewhat denuded gazelle looked quite scrumptious, but he held off for a time, because he could feel the leopardess's piercing but fearful gaze on him.

He paused a moment as he stood over the carcass, some semblance of self-control still fighting, but the hunger quickly swallowed even that as, a moment later, Simba himself began to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle was quite a bit smaller than the impala, and so Simba didn't feel nearly as full when he'd finished it. He did feel guilty though, the carcass should have been the leopardess's, and yet he'd let his hunger get the better of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopardess glared, half in fear, half in anger, as the lion quickly retreated, That kill had been hers by right, but now it had been taken from her...<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nWith the weight of the meat in his gut, Simba was moving slower now than before, and slower still for his self degradation, what had gotten into him of late, was he now so gluttonous that he simply couldn't refuse any titbit that came his way?

For a moment, the king thought of waiting until full daylight, but he quickly discounted it, he really needed help now, and so called out, lowly, \"Rafiki, Rafiki are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am here,\" the mandrill replied wearily, \"who speaks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Simba,\" he replied, \"I need your help, and quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" mandrill replied, then sighed, \"very well sire, what avails you?\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"Hm, a small dark creature with long ears and glowing eyes you say,\" Rafiki asked.

At first, he doubted how much the brew would help, within a few minutes he was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting until Simba was fast asleep, Rafiki once again climbed his tree, this time to commune with the spirits, and hopefully persuade the Black Leporid to agree to some sort of deal.

For a few moments he hoped the events of the past day or so might have been a dream, but a quick look back over his expanded frame dashed them. Where once he'd been merely stocky - as any royal lion tended to get after a time - he was now out-and-out rotund, his once defined musculature now less so as a layer of excess flesh softened his appearance, with plenty left over to turn his once tight belly into a round, heavy one. Grimacing at his expansion, Simba nevertheless knew he couldn't wallow in self-pity forever, and so, arose, the action just a little more difficult than he was used to, and made his way over to Rafiki's baobab to see if the mandrill had made any progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my king, I see you're awake,\" Rafiki said, before Simba had even made it to the foot of the baobab, \"and how are you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry,\" Simba replied, \"and worried, I've put on a fair amount of weight already, and if this continues...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be tricky,\" Rafiki replied, \"however, I have talked to the spirit, and he is willing to offer you a chance to as he calls it 'repent'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will,\" Simba asked, \"and what do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must fast, that is, not eat,\" Rafiki explained, \"and you must do it for a period of two days for each animal you have consumed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two days, by two animals,</i> Simba calculated quickly, \"that's four days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a trying period,\" Rafiki sighed, \"and he also say that if you do eat anything else it will add <i>another</i> two days for each animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, that's not going to be easy,\" Simba replied concernedly, no, that was going to be difficult indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and he also says that during that period that you much continue on with your normal way of life, including sleeping with the lionesses,\" Rafiki replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe I could talk the lionesses into eating their kills away from Pride Rock,\" Simba replied, \"but there's bound to be some carcasses there now, which means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A struggle indeed,\" Rafiki replied gravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba looked thoughtful a moment, then thought of an idea, if he were to deliberately concede the kingdom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A tricky thought,</i> came a voice in his head, <i>but if you give it up now, you'll never get it back, you'll never again be king of these lands, never see your child, and of course any new king will kill the old king's cubs.</i> Simba shivered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a problem my king,\" Rafiki asked, noticing Simba's momentarily pre-occupied look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, was just thinking of something,\" Simba replied, \"but I don't think it would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pity,\" Rafiki said, \"well, I wish you luck my king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Simba replied, then deciding he couldn't wait any long, said, \"I'll see you later,\" and left.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nThinking ahead on how he was going to deal with any leftover meat from the lionesses' recent kills, Simba wasn't paying as much attention as perhaps he should have been to his immediate surroundings, and so some way into his journey suddenly blundered across a pack of wild dogs, and a half-eaten kudu carcass. Although the king knew he himself was no longer as limber as he once had been, the pack wasn't numerous, comprising only perhaps ten dogs, all of them in a torpid state from having gorged heavily, and so he could see but one outcome if he couldn't stop his hunger getting the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thoughts had obviously worked their way into the minds of the dogs who all moved away to give the lion room, all but one male who stood between Simba and the carcass, and asked, \"who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm king Simba,\" he replied through gritted teeth as he tried to control his rising hunger, \"and I would like to ask you a favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what favour would that be,\" the dog asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like you to go to Pride Rock now and tell my mate Nala to meet me at the waterhole,\" Simba replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do my best to carry out that wish then, sire,\" the dog said, \"I will tell her you wish to meet her at that waterhole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Simba replied, and then turned his attention back to the carcass of the Kudu, or rather, getting away from it, though this proved to be less than easy as his hunger had continued to grow during the short conversation until it was now...</span></div></div>",

Finally he was standing over the carcass, and despite one last supreme effort to avoid his obvious fate, he started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the dogs' own meal earlier, there was still enough meat on the carcass for at least three normal lions to stuff themselves solid, which unfortunately for Simba meant simply a longer, larger meal. At first, the dogs standing on the sidelines saw nothing unusual about the king's eating, yet as time went on they began to get concerned, both for themselves, but perhaps more-so for him, for his stomach continue to swell larger and larger. The king himself was also worried, the impala the day before had been bad enough, yet there was at least half as much meat again here as there had been on the impala, so surely he'd do himself an injury if he tried to eat it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all concerns though, Simba continued to gorge rapidly as he surpassed first his own previous natural limits, and then the limits to which the impala had taken him, and all of this without the smallest sign of any permanent damage. Eventually, the colossal size of the meal began to put pressure not merely on his flesh, but also on his skeleton, his now burgeoning gut forcing his hips to spread wider apart than should have been possible as more and more space was sought to expand into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after more than an hour, Simba's hunger finally abated, every last bit of flesh having been consumed, and immediately the lion's movements reduced to twitches. This time there was no chance of getting up as there bad been with the impala, not only was his belly so painfully tight that the slightest motion startled a guttural groan from the bloated lion, but even if he had been able to get upright, the immense size of his bloated stomach would have prevented both hind-paws touching the ground at the same time.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nIt was night when Simba awoke again, though he couldn't tell if it was the same night, the next, or the second one after gorging. Well, he thought, there was going to be no denying now that he was fat, although looking down at himself he quickly decided that 'fat' might not be the right word, it would be the same as calling a giraffe 'tall' or an elephant 'big'. His belly was obviously larger of course, but then so was his chest from what he could see, perhaps even more so for it appeared to have 'risen' to be almost as round as his belly, giving his torso at least the appearance of a particularly large grub. Nor was his torso the only part of his anatomy to expand, his legs had also grown thicker, with slight wrinkles developing at the joints so as to allow his legs to bend properly. Even his tail felt heavier, though the king soon found it impossible to bend sufficiently to see it properly, the excessive flesh doing more than simply increasing his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nalmost swimming in self-disgust, Simba nevertheless knew he'd have to move eventually, and so set about getting up, which proved slightly easier than he'd expected it to, but still somewhat more difficult than it had even after he'd left Rafiki's the last time. He was on his feet soon enough though, and a quick scan of his surroundings told him...</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, he continued to clench his jaws desperately searching for a way - any way - to fight back. No matter how much he struggled though he couldn't turn away, and if he couldn't turn he couldn't escape. Or could he? Suddenly, an idea began to worm its way into his thoughts, and since he'd no other options he considered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore moments passed as the idea grew within Simba's mind, and then slowly, the lion began to prepare for what would surely be one of the most difficult tasks he'd ever faced. It seemed to take an age, but after just a few hunger-addled moments, he finally managed to get enough of his mind onto one thought so begin acting upon it, bringing himself, inch by inch into a sitting position, and then once that was over, crouching down. Finally he was ready, and after a few moments, made the jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nooo,</i> said the voice, as Simba sailed over the carcass of the wildebeest, taking one step away from the carcass on landing as his momentum carried him forward, <i>no, you couldn't have.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I.

This might have been acceptable if the carcass were that of a gazelle, but the wildebeest was in fact larger than he himself, so the direct transference was going to see him ending up a lot heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was at first most noticeable on Simba's belly, with the tuck up behind his ribs, not large in any case, quickly disappearing entirely. The 'centre' of expansion moved forward soon enough so that his whole torso began to resemble a balloon slowly being inflated, which was in fact more-or-less the case. His torso wasn't the only place to change though, for as he ate more and more, his limbs began to get thick, followed soon after by his tail, which soon looked worse for the way it expanded, not gradually along its length but abruptly, like a worm pushing down a too-small tube. The only parts that didn't appear to change noticeably were his neck and head, but even here the expansion eventually began to have an effect, the rolls building up on his neck, although invisible beneath his mane, started to restrict his ability to turn his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these changes remained unnoticed though, as Simba, his mind almost catatonic with revulsion of his gluttony, simply had no time to process what was going on. Finally though, there was not a scrap of meat left on the carcass, in his hunger the lion had even crushed the skull in order to clean it back to bare bone. Finally in control of himself once again, the lion finally had the time to take stock of the changes, and the revulsion he's felt for his gluttony returned, redoubled.

He couldn't blame them either he thought ruefully, he was in a rather sorry state, fat, lazy, weak-willed and gluttonous.

Oh it was no use thinking that now he thought mournfully as he pushed against his rounded gut with a paw, and watched as the flesh welled up around it, fat, lazy, weak-willed, and gluttonous, perfect words to describe him. And he couldn't change it, that was the most annoying thing, oh he'd tried before, but his friends had always dissuaded him from it as being 'too much work for too little', and he'd always agreed with them after a few days, because, well, they were his friends, and he was, he had to admit, always ready to take the easy way. He had been anyway, but then Kamili had come, and she had been accommodating of his failings, and his rather errant ways, and things might have been joyous, but for the rogue who had been following her, a rogue as strong and fast as he was weak and slow, and the promise of happiness had been broken...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba glanced over at his friends to check they were still asleep, and rose quietly, and moved off into the jungle, seeking solace.

At first the snake's swaying was simply that, but after a time it seemed to grow more meaningful. The snake watched as the lion's struggles stopped and his eyes seemed to glaze over, then said, \"tell me your troublesss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a mate, and a cub,\" Simba replied, his voice flat and unemotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yess,\" the snake said, \"the life of a rogue issn't very ssatissfying.\" It paused a moment, then said, \"but you sseem not to have had much ssuccesss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have not,\" Simba replied in the same flat, dull tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what iss the causse of thisss,\" The snake hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fat, lazy, weak-willed and disgusting,\" Simba replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did you gain thesse traitss,\" the snake asked, \"ssurely not from your parentss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, from my friends,\" Simba replied, \"they raised me in their ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssome friendss,\" the snake said, \"sshow me thesse sso-called friendsss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will show you my friends,\" Simba replied, rising as the snakes coils dropped away.

As he stood over them, his eyes began to tear up for what he knew he was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, do it now,\" the snake said, \"let their deathss unlock your true potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba resisted for just a moment more, then struck. Timon was first, his tiny body offered no resistance to the lion's powerful jaws, and then with one toss of his head the big cat turned him around in his mouth, and he was gone, forming, just for a moment, a bulge in his former friends oesophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumbaa quickly followed his tiny friend into death, for one swipe from Simba was all it took to open his jugular, though he survived just long enough to awaken, look up and murmur, \"wha' Simba wh-\" before life left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point Simba's tears were flowing freely, his sorrow too much for even the snake's control over him to quash, but this display bothered the serpent little, even revelled in it, as this emotion weakened the lion's defences, \"good, good, now, eat, let your friend'ss flesh become your own, let hiss blood ssusstain you.\" This time there was no hesitation, the big cat's head lowered, and began to tear chunks out of his former friend's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed as Simba slowly reduced his former friend to bare bones. Of course, Pumbaa was not a small warthog, and comparatively heavily built, so the lion shouldn't have been able to finish a half of the carcass, yet he did somehow, though he quickly had to from a crouching position to half lying down to accommodate his ever-growing stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the meal Simba's stomach was so large that had there not been a complete skeleton, an observer might have wondered if the warthog had not been swallowed whole. Filled well beyond its natural limit, the organ pushed up under his rib-cage, compressing his lungs so that he could only breath in short pants, while at the other extreme it forced his upper hind-leg out awkwardly so that the paw stuck up almost vertical, the only part of his anatomy to rise higher than his impossibly-bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" the snake hissed encouragingly, \"very good, now, ssleep, let it digesst, let your friend'ss flesh become your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Simba panted, \"yes, I will rest,\" and with that rolled over entirely onto his side, let his head drop to the ground, and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe snake watched as Simba's breaths slowed down, and became regular before sliding away, the first part of his plan had worked almost perfectly.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nSimba could tell something was up as soon as he awoke, though for a moment he couldn't figure out what. Blearily, he opened his eyes, though all this told him that the sun was well up now, though this tickled him, normally he was up much earlier than his friends, so it was odd that this wasn't the case now, and odder than his friends hadn't come to wake him. Maybe they were off bug-hunting he thought, yawning and rolling himself upright, then noticing the skeleton. This immediately worried him, he'd never killed anything, and never eaten real meat since he'd left the Pridelands, so where... \"Guys,\" he called out, rising now, \"guys, are you there?\" The forest remained quiet however, so he turned back to the skeleton, and with a sort of morbid interest, rolled it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Simba didn't recognise the skeleton, his former friend's face had been much rounder than the narrow skull the lion saw now, but the tusks were unmistakable. No, he thought, terror overtaking him, no, he couldn't have, no, surely. Tears began to form in his eyes as he tried to deny his action, but this proved impossible, so he turned and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's flight was soon at an end though, as he quickly discovered that his once-friend had left another legacy besides a picked-clean skeleton. Most lions would not have been troubled with running some hundreds of metres at a dead sprint, but Simba wasn't like other lions, he'd never had to hunt for his meals, nor had he ever really had the inclination to race his friends, so running was hard enough for him, and now his weight was markedly higher thanks to his recent, unnaturally large meal. These handicaps showed markedly as within a few paces he'd dropped from the closest approximation of a run he could manage, to a heavy, rather clumsy lope, and then lower still to a walk, by the end of which his chest was heaving and his heart racing, so unused was he to such exertions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba wandered aimlessly for a time, lost in his sorrows, before be tripped over a root, and thumped to the ground. In a strange way, this minor fall was enough to galvanise the grieving lion into a course of action, for even as he picked himself up, he decided to...</span></div></div>",

He tried again, and then a third time, but each time the snake's head dropped too fast for him to get a grip on it, so, by now determined to consume the whole of the snake, or die trying, he lay down and grabbed the snake's body near its head and turning it upwards so that finally he was able to get it deep enough into his gullet for his throat muscles to grab it and begin the long slow process of dragging the serpent's great length to a final end in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a short time, Simba remained lying down, but as he took in the snakes coils resting immediately next to him, he felt the resistance increase, and so rose and moved closer to the pile that constituted the main body of the snake, tossing his head periodically to keep the thick serpentine form from beneath his paws. This ultimately proved to be a mistake, as he was just about to settle down, when a final toss upset the coiled pile of the snake's main body, sending a loop sliding down the back of the pile, and into the water with a gentle splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Simba paid this event no mind, it didn't matter if the snake's body was in the water, he'd simply swallow it regardless. However, this proved not to be quite so easy as he imagined, for as he tossed his head again, to try and give himself a little more slack, another coil slid down, this one heavy enough to begin a slow cascade that dragged the rest of the snake's length into the water. The lion's eyes opened wide as he saw what was happening, then dashed forward to try to keep some of the snake's length on the rock, but its slick scales slid through his paw, faster and faster, until he realised it was hopeless, but by then it was too late, his footing too insecure to prevent him from being dragged over the edge along with his intended meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was underwater for only a few moments before breaking the surface, but he knew it wouldn't last, the snake's weight seemed less in the water, but he could only keep his head up by constant swimming, and he knew he'd be unable to keep it up for more than a few minutes, so he quickly cast around for some way to save himself, luckily spotting a rock barely a body-length to his left. Swimming proved harder than merely staying afloat though, for at every stroke the weight of the snake dragged his head down and back, so that he had to stop every couple of strokes to tread water to get his breath back, a process not aided by the way the snake's breadth made breathing at all a real challenge. Finally though, the lion's determination paid off and he reached the rock, resting his forequarters on it to keep his head safely above the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecure now in his position, Simba relaxed a little, allowing his throat muscles to begin again their work of drawing in the immense serpent. Time passed as the snake disappeared, inches at a time down the gullet of the lion. It wasn't an easy passage by any means, for the closer he got to the middle of the snake, the wider its body became, stretching his throat, and even at its widest, stressing his jaw, but he continued. Even once he's got past the snake's widest though, he struggled, the great coiled mass stretching his stomach tighter and tighter, yet somehow it held, even well beyond its theoretical limit. It wasn't just his stomach under stress either, for as his stomach grew larger, it began to push his hind-legs outwards and upwards until as the last of the snake disappeared between his jaws, his high-legs were almost horizontal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his gargantuan meal brought Simba little pride, not because he was dissatistfied, but simply because one coil of the snake was bulging up under his ribcage, exerting a dangerous pressure on his lungs, making him feel sluggish and sleepy, so much so that he could just barely keep his hold on the stone.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nSimba yawned widely as he awoke, lying on his side on the bank of the waterhole. He could tell immediately that something was up, yet couldn't figure out what it was at the moment. \"Guys, are you there,\" he asked blearily, \"guys?\" There was no answered though, so he assumed they'd gone off the find something else to eat, and so decided to see where they'd gone. This proved rather harder than he'd expected though, as he seemed to have gained a lot of weight all of a sudden. Just as he got to his paws, the lion's mind was awash with memories of the recent past, and the emotions they brought, longing, sorrow, anger, grim determination. Finally though, the wash faded, and he was overcome with...</span></div></div>",

The serpent had been right about one thing he knew, to gain the lifestyle he wanted he'd have had to leave his friends behind, and well he no longer had any friends did he, so why not make the best of their absence? Some doubt entered his mind as he took a few steps and found himself waddling, his recently increased weight swelling his gut out so much that walking normally was out of the question, but that just fed into his determination, so what if it took him a year to get into shape, he had all the time in the world now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Simba was, not less confident in his eventual success, but more aware of just how far he had to go. A life of ease to the present had left him comparatively weak, combined with the massive amount of extra weight, he'd acquired over the past few days meant that any movement above a slow, waddling lope was more-or-less out of the question, and even that he could hold for barely more than a few moments. Nevertheless, he knew he could, no, he <i>would</i> do it, sooner or later, he'd lose this extra flesh.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nTears ran down Simba's face as he lay back, tears of sorrow for his lost friends, of rage at the memory of the serpent, and of fear for his future. His determination to take advantage of his newfound freedom was in tatter, torn to pieces by a new, unbounded gluttony. His overly-engorged stomach made less of an impact on his now unnaturally large belly, but he knew in his own mind that he couldn't, or at rather <i>shouldn't</i> have been able to eat anything like as much as he had. Or was this the new normal for him, after all, he'd swallowed that damnable serpent hadn't he, and it was much larger than this present meal, so maybe that somehow had stretched his stomach out. This thought cheered him up not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now though, a tiny fraction of his determination remained, unwilling to admit there was absolutely no chance. The problem with the jungle was that he was simply too good at finding food here, out on the savannah he'd surely have much more trouble, and so much more success at losing weight. The savannah was also where most lions lived, so he'd be reminded of his eventual goals much more often, maybe. That would have to wait for later though, for now there was little to do but lay back and wait for his current meal to digest.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nSimba stood and stared out across the savannah. He was right on the edge now, almost ready to leave the jungle that had kept him so well for so long. Some of his determination was returning, even though he'd had a second colossal bug meal since swallowing the serpent, causing his belly to hang just that little bit lower still. From now on though, such feasts would be few and far between, he'd have to work hard for every scrap, and for a time would very likely go hungry, but that was okay, the less he ate the more he'd lose. Finally prepared, in his own mind at least, he stepped out from under the green trees of his former home, and waddled towards a new, better future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first when he'd started out, the savannah had looked desolate, but this proved not to be the case, for soon enough he met...</span></div></div>",

Although Simba had thought he'd be ready for the hunger, the sheer intensity of it was this tine even more overwhelming than the last time, to the point that he was utterly unable to prevent his body moving forward, one slow, faltering step at a time. By some supreme effort, he was able to pause for a few moments as he stood over the carcass, before the voice, once again more felt than heard, spoke, <i>very good, but it's too little too late, you've lost,</i> and with that the lion felt any last shreds of self control drop away, preventing him from even attempting to hinder his unimaginable hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the eland was very much larger than the wildebeest had been, and so should have taken <i>much</i> longer to eat, except that it didn't. Of course, Simba was eating furiously, but even this couldn't account for the speed at which the meat was disappearing, and indeed a closer observation might have noticed that right around the are where he was eating, the meat was evaporating, apparently turning into a sort of red-violet smoke than wafted over his head, especially into his nose and what bits of his mouth that momentarily weren't full of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, this meal bypassed Simba's stomach, ending up directly on his body, only with much greater speed. Already larger than any lion should have been, he quickly became larger still. As before, his torso once again took the lead, almost seeming to explode as his body sought somewhere to store the immense intake. It was not <i>just</i> his belly that took on more weight of course, for even as his growing gut forced his legs into an ever more splaying stance, so his shoulders flanks, and hips inflated too, soon forming a uniform wall from his also ever-growing neck rolls back to his tail-head, and from the top of his now indistinguishable shoulder blades down to below his elbows and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Simba - or at least the tiny part of his mind that wasn't preoccupied with an overwhelming feeling of revulsion at his now undoubted gluttony - began no notice that movement was becoming almost impossible as his by now colossal torso forced his stance to spay so much that not all of his legs could touch the ground at any one time, a fact which wasn't helped in the slightest by the fact that his neck-rolls were by now so numerous and so large as to be holding his head just about fixed. Nevertheless, the hunger was insatiable, and so giving up on attempting to move, the lion instead abandoned his by now futile attempts to try to move from one part of the carcass to another, and instead tried to use his ever less flexible forelegs to try to draw the carcass to him. This should have been impossible, for although the carcass was denuded of a good portion of its flesh, it should still have been too heavy for him to manoeuvre. This proved not to be the case, however, and so the feast continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Simba was a grotesque parody of his former self, looking from afar not unlike the sort of grub he'd once dined on so many years ago in his youth. This didn't stop him though as he continued to gorge, oblivious to anything but the meal before him. The meal couldn't last forever though, and finally there was no meat left on the carcass, at which point the unnatural hunger left him. For a moment he wondered whether to bother trying to take stock of his condition, but then decided he might as well. His head seemed to be the least encumbered, for he found he could open his jaws a little over half-way before running into the flesh of his neck, and his ears still retained some freedom as well, though his hearing was dulled when they pressed too heavily against the rolls pushing forward from his neck over the top of his skull. From there on though, things got steadily worse, his neck was so behung with rolls of flesh as to allow him only a few degrees of flexibility side-to-side and up-and-down, and even then their great weight made holding even the extremes of those limits a struggle. His legs were a little better, for he found he could his could, albeit with great difficulty, move them at least a bit within their fleshy cocoons, his fore-legs, more than his hind ones, and extend the claws on all four paws, though it was obvious that they'd never be useful against any creature that wasn't actively trying to commit suicide. Finally, his tail proved even worse than his neck, so thick and heavy with fat, that what meagre muscles it still contained struggled to produce more than a nearly imperceptible twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was in despair now, why had he been so foolish as to challenge this spirit? It had proved once before that it was much more than he, and yet he'd still allowed his pride and bravado to get the better of him. Truly, he realised, he was not cut out to be a king, he was too impatient, too-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a voice from behind him said, \"you seem to be having a bit of trouble there sire.\" It was a voice that was all too familiar, yet now...</span></div></div>",

Still he couldn't lie here all day, and so he arose to see if Rafiki had a solution to his suddenly increased hunger. That had been his intention anyway, but as soon as he moved he realised something was amiss, and looking down, was horrified to find out why. the first part of his anatomy that came clearly into view was his forelegs, now no longer with golden-furred or powerfully muscled, but instead, dappled grey, and rather spindly. Further afield, he no longer had a thick mane nor a long, golden leonine body, but instead a rather shorter, hunch-backed frame with scruffy, dappled grey-brown fur. So the dream had been more than a dream after all he thought, as he stared in a mix of horror, disgust and fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he caught sight of movement, and turned to see with just enough time to see and feel the lump of wood fall painfully on his shoulder. Yelping he arose and turned to face Rafiki, \"what, what are you doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting rid of some rubbish,\" the mandrill replied threateningly, brandishing his staff again, go on, get out of here you filthy beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba stood dumbfounded for a moment, but then a whisper in his head said <i>he doesn't recognise you, to him you are now but another hyena.</i> This only increased his confusion, surely his old friends should recog- No, evidently not he realised as he just barely dodged a second blow. Still, he was loathe to leave until a third blow was struck, only glancing this time, but still leaving a painful bruise. That was the last straw for the new hyena, and with just a moments more hesitation, he took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Simba slowed down and stopped atop a small rise, giving him a good view back over the Pridelands, his former home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is your home no longer, beast</i> came a voice suddenly in his head, <i>in fact, it now never was except when Scar was king.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Are you going to torture me for the rest of my life,</i> Simba thought savagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now now, no need to take that tone with me,</i> the voice said, <i>And yes I will be with you for the rest of your life, if only to see you have a life beyond a few days.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And what's that supposed to mean,</i> Simba though coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are ill-trained in the ways of the hyena,</i> the voice replied, <i>I can help you with that, but I will only help you if you're willing to accept my help.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba thought this over hard.

This thought wasn't particularly worrying at first, for few things would dare to try to attack him, even if he were in such a state, and those few that would didn't usually come to the desert border. Soon though, another threat made itself known, and this one couldn't be fought off with teeth and claws. As he lay there in the blazing sun, the king felt himself getting hotter and hotter. It wasn't bad at first, merely feeling warm, but soon became uncomfortable, persuading him to try again to get up. Unfortunately, this attempt was even less successful, thanks to the sun having made him feel weak and dizzy, and so he could do little but lay back and take it, awaiting his ultimate fate...<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nIt was well after dark when Simba came to, having finally cooled down. His time in the sun had left its mark though, for his mouth was painfully dry from panting, and he was still feeling quite weak. Fortunately, as he looked down he noted his stomach looked very much smaller, perhaps small enough to allow him to get up. He managed to do so, though after a few false starts, as his ordeal had left him weak and slightly dizzy, and immediately cast around for a water-hole, for right now a drink was his most pressing need, even more so that trying to find out why, and even <i>how</i> he'd managed to clean an impala carcass. Fortunately he knew of one nearby, not big, but enough for his needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, wanting to get a drink and actually getting one proved to be quite different, as Simba soon found out that weak legs and a dizzy sense of balance made for a slow journey thanks to having to pick himself up repeatedly after various stumbles. Finally though, he was able to reach the waterhole, but instead of simply trying to drink from it, actually walked into it, letting his weak frame sink into the cool water even as he gulped the liquid down his parched throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with his hunger with the impala, so Simba's thirst with the waterhole seemed to know no bonds as he gulped greedily, not content to simply drink his fill, he simply swallowed mouthful after mouthful until his stomach reached its natural limit, and then beyond. By the time he finished drinking, the king's stomach was almost as bloated as, or perhaps even more so than it had been with the impala, which with his weakened legs, made leaving the waterhole impossible, and so he lay there the night, weak body and bloated stomach cradled gently in a liquid embrace.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nThe next morning, Simba awoke to find...</span></div></div>",

His attempts to get comfortable were not made any easier by the slightly larger than was really comfortable weight in his stomach, he'd really have to try to curb his appetite. Curb it even further anyway, he was already eating a lot less now after a moon here than he had in the first days after the reunification. Back then, it was only a little better than even odds that he wouldn't end any meal with stomach cramps. He'd not alone in suffering like that either, he knew, just about every one of the former Outlanders had had at least one painful lesson in the perils of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu didn't have much time to get comfortable though as very soon princess Kiara extracted herself from the melee that was the feast on a by now rather denuded wildebeest carcass, and came and lay beside him, then lent against him, which was just a bit to close for comfort, \"oof, not so heavy on my haunch, hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara smiled as she looked up at him, \"still making a glutton of ourselves are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I did eat a bit more than I should have,\" Kovu admitted, a touch begrudgingly, still finding it hard to overcome what had once been a survival skill, \"but I'm getting better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are,\" Kiara replied, then added, \"and more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More comfortable,\" Kovu asked curiously, \"what d'you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're no longer skin and bone are you,\" Kiara asked, \"or hadn't you noticed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'd noticed,\" Kovu said quickly, though it was only half true. He'd noticed that he didn't bruise up so easily these days, and nor did he feel too achy after lying on hard rock, but he hadn't really known why, until now, \"are you saying I'm getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly,\" Kiara chuffed, \"you were half-starved before, now you're looking properly healthy, like a prince of royal blood, instead of some dirty old rogue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Kovu said, the lowered his head to whisper in her ear, \"but need I remind you, that prince though I am, it's your blood that's royal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And aren't you glad it is,\" Kiara whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I am,\" Kovu whispered, \"I'm so very very glad.\" Then his mind came back to his current situation, \"now, could you shift off just a little, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly I could,\" Kiara smiled cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu sighed, but happily, Kiara did so enjoy teasing him, \"would you please lie a bit less heavily on my haunch Kiara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once sire,\" Kiara said, and moved to shuffle her lower half around so as not to be resting so much on her love's stomach. At the same Time, Kovu moved to extricate his foreleg from underneath the princess, which her then rested across her chest, startling a tiny gasp from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter,\" Kovu asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it just took me by surprise,\" Kiara replied, then deciding she like the sensation of being embraced in such a way, moved her shoulders back hard into his chest, \"it feels nice though, so keep it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to be of service,\" Kovu replied, tightening his grip.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nAs time flowed by, Kovu grew more and more used to the slow rhythm of the Pridelands lifestyle.

He was hardly sedentary of course, as well as beginning to learn from Simba of the duties of a king, he spend as much time as he could helping Kiara to refine her hunting strategies, but these weren't quite rigorous enough to deal with the number of calories he was still taking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu was hardly aware of the fact that though the increase in his girth had slowed somewhat, it was still happening, there always seemed to be some distraction or crisis taking up most of his waking moments. Despite his own ignorance though, the changes didn't go unnoticed, indeed there was hardly a lioness in the pride who wasn't by now aware of the prince's gains, though not quite all of them yet had realised that though many of the former Outlanders had put on healthy volumes of flesh themselves in the moons since the reunification of the pride, none had gained quite as much comparatively as the prince had, the tuck up behind his ribs was now virtually non-existent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some debate over these developments. Some of the lionesses (mostly former Outlanders) felt that the prince's gain was unbecoming, and only verified their own thoughts that though Zira had been wrong about the Pridelanders', that they were lazy and fat. Many of the others though, felt that Kovu's gain was not only quite acceptable, but indeed desirable, making him look more regal and less roguish. There were a few others still that found that their opinions lay somewhere between the two groups, happy to accept that Kovu did indeed look like a proper royal lion now, but that things were starting to go a bit too far. For all the debate though, none of them ever mentioned it to the young, dark lion, at least directly.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourselves there, lovebirds,\" Vitani asked, as she approached the rock ledge, not far from Pride Rock where Kiara and Kovu were basking, happily alone until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we were in fact,\" Kovu said, \"what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anything have to be up for me to come and visit my brother and his mate,\" Vitani asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kovu said, \"but it's the only time you ever do come to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moments' silence, then Vitani asked, slightly irritably, \"you haven't seen Kipaku or Chekua around at all have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kovu replied, \"why, they've gone missing again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Vitani replied, through clenched teeth, \"I know some of the others are okay with their not turning up to hunts very often, but I can't stand that sort of thing, as I'm sure you well know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu nodded, \"I'm quite aware of your, dedication Vitani,\" Kovu said, a slight smile playing across his lips, \"you've never quite figured out how to relax and let time pass by have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitani frown, \"let time go by, you mean, waste time, deliberately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite,\" Kovu said, \"and if I see either of those two around I'll let them know you're not happy with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Vitani said, \"well I'm off then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good luck then,\" Kovu said, \"I hope you enjoy yourself out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I'll enjoy it bro',\" Vitani said, \"as much as you enjoy the results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu was to surprised for a moment to make a reply, and by the time he'd got his thoughts together, Vitani had gone. Puzzled, he turned to Kiara, \"did that make any sense to you, I think she was taunting me, but I can't figure out why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure it was nothing,\" Kiara said breezily, \"just forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure,\" Kovu said, and tried to force it to the back of his mind, but it kept threatening to spring back, and so to distract himself, he asked, \"so what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Kiara said, \"wha-oh, um, why don't we...\"</span></div></div>",

Not that he was complaining either way though, oh certainly she seemed to enjoy a life of adventure, but he did sometimes worry that she might one day try something even she couldn't handle. He didn't dare express his concerns though, instead saying, \"let's go then shall we?\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nDespite his attempts to put his sister's words out of his mind, they never quite went away, and as confusing as they had been at first, after some time of nibbling away at it, the meaning seemed, at least to be him, to be quite clear, Vitani considered him a glutton. This wouldn't have been so bad in itself, but his sister was far from the only former Outlander, and if she thought that, how many of the others did? Well he wouldn't be able to find that out now until after the hunt was over, but he would find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter love,\" Kiara asked, noting that Kovu seemed unusually preoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking back to what Vitani said...\" Kovu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why,\" Kiara asked, \"we both know she's just jealous right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't think she said that just because she was jealous,\" Kovu said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did she say it then,\" Kiara asked, her tone a little more sharp than Kovu was used to hearing from her, leading him to wonder if the princess too didn't sometimes get a bit jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she was trying to tell me, something,\" Kovu replied, still a little uncertain of the exact point himself, \"something about my eating, or maybe my weight-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like she's a good one to talk,\" Kiara replied tartly. Yes, definitely a bit of jealousy there Kovu thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have put on quite a bit since I first arrived-\" Kovu began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu, you were practically starving when you first arrived,\" Kiara replied assuredly, \"everything you've put on since is just healthy flesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Kovu said, still not quite certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do, I do,\" Kiara said, \"and I've a mind to tell that sister of your to butt out of your life once and for all, stick to her hunting and leave your welfare to me.\" If he'd been at all uncertain about her jealousy before, Kovu thought, that last statement put it too rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Kovu said, eager to quell Kiara's feelings, \"I guess there are a few bits of my past I still need to leave behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say so,\" Kiara said, \"but come on, this is all depressing stuff and we're supposed to be enjoying ourselves here, not arguing.\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"Enjoy yourselves out there lovebirds,\" Nala asked, when Kovu and Kiara finally returned to Pride Rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We certainly did,\" Kiara replied happily, then sniffed, \"smells like lunch is up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" Nala replied, \"it's zebra today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so we're due a good big feed then,\" Kiara smiled, \"come on Kovu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-oh, right,\" Kovu said, and followed Kiara towards the carcasses, trying to judge, as the lionesses pulled away, which ones were being willingly submissive, and which were only submitting because it was expected of them. He stopped worrying about it though, as the smell of blood suddenly hit him, causing his stomach to churn eagerly, that was a problem that could wait for later, right now his lunch outweighed virtually everything else.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nBelching quietly as he lay back, Kovu watched as the lionesses began to tuck into the zebras, now that he'd had his fill. Slightly more than his fill actually he thought, his belly just a little uncomfortable with his large meal, bring back to the fore of his mind, his sister's recent comments. Shifting his belly a little to try and find a slightly more comfortable position, he decided he needed to get the business sorted out once and for all. The problem - one of them anyway - was that Kiara seemed either not to notice how much weight he'd put on, or to actually like it, so he'd have to find a way to get away from her for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu tossed ideas around in his head, before finally deciding that the best person to ask would be...</span></div></div>",

This was a new sensation for him, being able to gorge to his heart's content, previously he'd always regulated his meals for fear of how his brother would react if he took too much, but now the paler lion was dead - a satisfied smile brief crossed his face - he could do whatever he wanted to. The king frowned though, as he examined himself, for all that the meal had been satisfying, the appearance of his nearly overburdened stomach contrasted badly with his almost gaunt frame. Still, that was a temporary issue, enough meals like this one and his frame would fill out, giving him the appearance of a <i>proper</i> king, not a half-starved rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, a slender physique wasn't the only thing left over from his his so recently cast-off time as a near outcast, he'd also retained something of an anti-social streak. This meant that while he was prepared to tolerate the lionesses' company for the sake of a meal, now that he'd eaten he'd prefer to be alone with his thoughts, and so he stood up - wincing very slightly as his overfull stomach twinged at the sudden shift - and began to make his way down Pride Rock into the savannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi was the first to realise Scar was moving, and so swallowed quickly, and asked, \"where are you going sire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it's any business of yours Sarabi,\" Scar replied, a touch coolly, \"but I wish to be alone for a while, farewell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Sarabi thought of protesting, but then decided against it, quickly realising that the friendship they'd once shared had died long before. Instead she contented herself with watching his retreating form, noting with a little distaste how his engorged belly swung pendulously with each step, overfull on a kill he'd contributed nothing to, and had not even thanked them for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnorant of Sarabi's scrutinising gaze, Scar continued on his way, pausing a moment at the bottom of Pride Rock, trying to decide where would be the best place to lie up to let his large meal digest.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything about Simba sickened Scar. Watching every animal in the pridelands cheer for him, as if he was the king already\u2026 it was enough to make him sick! Here Scar was, having already proven that he\u2019d be a more than capable ruler\u2026 and yet everybody is heralding some stupid cub as the heir to the throne. When he heard that Mufasa would be having a son, he feared just this situation\u2026 but he didn\u2019t know it would be this bad! Simba was spoiled rotten, insolent, and didn\u2019t even seem to recognize the gravity of the throne\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar definitely needed this problem out of his mane. For the good of the Pridelands! If this little brat is allowed to take power, he shudders to think what will become of this kingdom. No doubt the hyenas would move in and conquer the place! And then the whole food chain would be reversed\u2026 throwing everything out of its natural order! But speaking of the food chain, it seems there\u2019s been quite a new worldview being assumed on the ol\u2019 \u201ccircle of life\u201d...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time ago, the Pridelands was stumbled upon by an unidentified young lion. This was obviously quite scandalous, as any male lion outside of Mufasa\u2019s own family would be a threat to his power. So, he took the lion off somewhere private\u2026 and curious, Scar couldn\u2019t help but eavesdrop, only to be shocked by what he witnessed! Mufasa simply swallowed the cub whole! Wrapped his jaws around him and disappeared him in a single gulp, leaving only the most modest, squirming bulge in that fluffy belly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bastard! It was too genius, he was almost impressed with his brother. A perfect way to ensure that his authority would remain intact, while also easily boosting his own frame, making him heavier and more capable in battle, all while leaving in no evidence. The more he pondered this, the more he realized just what a great strategy it was. But his thoughts grew even more devious, once he realized he could do even better\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, well, his first plan, just eating the hyenas, failed miserably. But now he has an even better plan! One that will knock out a few of his problems at once. See, he\u2019s been stockpiling half of each of his daily meals somewhere safe\u2026 which, sadly, has been causing him to lose weight slowly, but it was a worthy investment. For soon, he had a massive surplus of meat stored away in a cave somewhere, just ready to be chowed upon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about this, Uncle Scar?\u201d A curious Simba asked Scar as the much larger lion led him far into the most remote regions of the Pridelands. Like many his age, Simba had been longing to just grow up immediately and skip the whole younger years, and Scar had promised he knew a secret to doing just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as sure about this as I am sure that the sun rises,\u201d Scar chuckled, trying to speak in a soothing tone, patting the cub on the head. \u201cThis will make you as big and strong as your father in no time at all. Just you wait!\u201d Eventually, Scar moved a rock that was hiding his secret cave\u2026 and when he entered, Simba was immediately in awe! A massive pile of meat of all sorts, delicious in every way, was stored here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhooa! That\u2019s a long of food\u2026!\u201d Simba blinked, completely stunned. \u201cAm I supposed to eat all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar pat him on the back, gesturing him forward. \u201cWell, of course! After all, when I was your age, I had to eat seven elephants in order to get as large as I am today!\u201d Simba seemed uncertain\u2026 but when Scar took a slab of nice giraffe meat, Simba just licked his lips cutely! \u201cListen, why don\u2019t we start off small? Maybe some nice giraffe?\u201d Scar snuggled him close, feeding him the steak by paw, letting him take big chunks of it happily until it was all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelicious, hmm?\u201d Scar asked, patting Simba\u2019s belly, and Simba, indeed, nodded enthusiastically! Before that meal had any time to settle, though, Scar was already bringing more meat to his lips!\u201cNow that we\u2019ve whet your appetite, care to go for some cassowary\u2026?\u201d Simba was hesitant about eating again so soon, but Scar seemed pretty insistent, so Simba hesitantly chomped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus was the pattern of the whole experience. Scar holding Simba close and feeding him all sorts of things, bringing something new up to his lips the moment he finished off his last, always encouraging him to eat faster. The food was really delicious\u2026 but it was getting to be a lil much! Especially when his stomach started to grow big and round, bulging out with all the food he was eating and pressing against the ground, straining to keep it all in! \u201cHuff, huf\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know if I can eat all this\u2026\u201d He pants, his belly churning and glorping with every movement. \u201cI - uuuurrppp - I already feel so full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense! We can\u2019t have a future king be defeated by some roasted snacks, can we?\u201d Scar chuckles, interrupting Simba\u2019s complaining by shoving some ostrich meat in that maw! \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room, I assure you. Trust me, stomachs are roomier than you realize\u2026\u201d He laughed at his own bit of dark humor, and from then on, made sure that Simba was getting so much food sliding down his gullet he had no time to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all of Simba\u2019s features were starting to look more than a little rounded, as that belly gurgled and churned incredibly quickly! Soon, it was like Simba was hardly recognizable after the relentless meal! His cheeks were now all rounded and soft, his neck was nowhere to be seen, and Scar could curiously knead that huge, round tummy, which was now bigger than Simba\u2019s entire body used to be, back when he was skinnier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rump, too, had grown incredibly pudgy, with layered of softness adorning those two big, round cheeks. At the sight of all that pudge, Scar couldn\u2019t help but lick his lips, unnoticed. \u201cOh my\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever say this, but\u2026 Simba was genuinely looking like the most delicious snack in the pridelands! With every pound Simba gains, he was looking less like a political lion, and more like a big, nice, filling meal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScaarr\u2026\u201d Simba complained, using the extra time while Scar was distracted to pant out some more words. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so stuffed\u2026 I can\u2019t eat\u2026 another bite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you simply can\u2019t stop now! You\u2019ll ruin the whole process! You want to be king, right?\u201d Scar chuckled, leaning forward and wrapping his arms around his back, if only to knead that huge, round, sloshing tummy with his paws. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave until you finish your whole meal. Now, please\u2026 why not enjoy some nice zebra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba huffed, unsure anymore. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 getting strong\u2026 just\u2026 really fat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Scar just shoved more food into his gullet! \u201cMm, sure, you might be on the softer side for a while\u2026\u201d He reassured him. \u201cBut when it all\u2026 metabolizes\u2026 you\u2019ll be as strong and sizeable as your heart desires. Patience is a vital attribute for a ruler, I must remind you.\u201d Almost too fat to move, Simba could just lie there as he was stuffed further and further, getting pudgier and pudgier with every gurgle...</span></div></div>",

Though there is an oddly well paved dirt path. Before he could take another step forward, something sharp hits him in the neck! He looks around and hears something approach but at the same time he also feels unusually drowsy and finds his eyelids growing heavy. The last thing he sees before passing out are several shadowy figures surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the next week ends up being absolute hell. Stuffed into a wooden cube, Simba is unable to break free of his prison and unable to determine where he is. He can feel his container being occasionally moved which happens to knock him around several times. After the first day he submits and chooses to rest until his captors finally free him. The only way he could pass the time was to listen to whatever was going on outside and wait for the creatures to bring him slabs of meat that tasted like nothing he has eaten before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part might have been the stench. On the hottest of days, Simba's golden fur would be slick with sweat and he'd be lying in a puddle of his own perspiration. His B.O. worked over time and with few air holes the mighty king found himself being hotboxxed by his own odors. By the third day he managed to grow accustomed to his aroma, though his captors couldn't say the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the week, the lion is finally freed from his prison. His captors poke and prod at him forcing Simba to his feet and out of the crate into a dark room with oddly polished, hardened floors. A strange leather bound object is strapped to his mouth and rope slipped around his neck. The creatures remind him of Rafiki with their bipedal movement but with far less hair and being much taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approach a bright entrance much like the mouth to a cave but with iron bars. One of the captors does something and manages to part the bars before shoving Simba out into the open. The sunlight disorients the great king long enough for the creatures to remove his bindings and return where they came from, sealing him outside. As his eyes adjust, Simba gazes at his unusual surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrounded by large stone walls, he appears to be in some sort of enclosure with flaura similar to his kingdom yet something feels off. Theres a small watering hole  that garners his attention. He rushes over and laps up as much water as he can get. The refreshing liquid quenches his thirst but then he hears series of clicks. Looking up, he notices more of the bipedal creatures gazing down at him. They come in different sizes and shapes wearing covering their bodies in strange cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You up there! Where am I? What is this place?\" Simba calls out to his audience. They respond with a roar of chattering and cheering, to Simba's confusion. Some even fling objects at Simba, to which he tries to avoid at first. Then he notices that they aren't rocks, which he thought at first, but strange items in clear that have a peculiar smell to them. He tentatively licks what looks like a shiny stick but not only is it soft, it's the sweetest delicacy he's ever tasted. He scarfs down sugary stick and lers out a small burp. The creatures cheer on but he ignores them, seeing as they won't give him an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he has some food and water in him, Simba considers his options and what he should do. He could explore his new surroundings and try to escape, or he could try and obtain more food from his suspicious audience. Or perhaps he should find a place to hide until the creatures leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Sure enough, he managed to eat it all, but it had taken and entire day... and he felt completely different afterwards! He went from being slim and muscular to being huge and fat, with a massive, round gut that sloshed beneath him as he walked and dragged against the ground. He had to wait for all that meat to digest a bit before he could even move again, and all that digestion had just caused him to be extremely gassy. He let out a big urrrrrppppp as he walked back towards the Pride Lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered when he heard Simba trotting up to him, assuming the little lion cub would laugh at him. Instead, though, Simba's eyes opened up wide, and he smiled in awe! \"Whoa!

It's a... lovely sight, I must admit~\" She smiled, moving up and nuzzling his flabby neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen suddenly... a huge brraaapppp filled the cave, as a massive fart exploded from his butt! Mufasa was blushing more than ever... but Simba just laughed, and poked those two, big, fat, round cheeks of Mufasa's now huge, gassy butt! \"Whoa! That was the biggest fart ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm~\" Meanwhile, Sarabi seemed to enjoy the stench, giving Mufasa a kick on the cheek. \"I think I could get used to this~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed both Simba and Sarabi wanted to play with all his flab... but who'd go first?</span></div></div>",

I really should've settled down in this place a LONNNG time ago~!\" Exclaims the lazy drongo bird, laying quite peacefully on his back after goring himself in the middle of the bug-infested rainforest. Indeed, this was quite the life. No more stealing, or scavenging, or tricking other animals... Heck, there wasn't even any need to intimate the voices of other animals to get what he wanted! -save for the odd, lazy singing that happened every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd pretty much been living life like this for a single week or so, and one thing was for sure, it really was starting to take a toll on his waistline. Not that the drongo minded, of course~. If anything, having a belly that bulged outwards like this as he laid down just... oooh~... made things so much comfier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PhHHRRT-!!!* Moaning, Tamaa merely giggles as his sudden, but foul, display of flatulence. Another great feature of this rainforest... no one around to complain about the smell- let alone manners...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder what turn in life this lazy drongo shall take next?</span></div></div>",
