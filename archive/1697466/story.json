The end is where we start from.\"- T.S Eliot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah ran though the dark woods as fast as her legs would go. Her breathing was getting heavier and her footfalls were like stomps on the ground. She wanted to rest but she couldn't, she knew she couldn't stop. Not here, not ever. If she stopped for even a moment that thing would kill her. The thing that's been chasing her through the woods ever since she woke up here. Did she wake here? She couldn't remember, she just remembered running and that voice that kept mocking her every time she slowed down. The woods just never ended no matter how far she ran. Their was barely any light at all in these woods. In fact, Sarah only knew it was a forest because she felt grass and dirt on the ground when she fell before. The only light came from the full moon above her but that barely gave her any light to see. The thing behind her growled, a loud and fierce roar that shook Sarah's bones. It sounded close, Sarah tried to pick up speed but her body wouldn't allow it. She looked behind her hoping not to see a row of giant teeth about to rip her head off. Nothing was there, it was pitch black just like it is ahead of her. As she turned her head back she collided into something very hard. The wind was knocked out of her and pain flared through her body. Falling onto her back she half-opened one tear-filled eye to see the dark silhouette of a tall tower, a tree. The thing was almost near her now she could hear it's heavy footfalls, she could hear it's breathing. Sarah knew this was her last stand so she used her right hand and put it into her right pocket, gripping something cold inside. It was her switchblade, the blade she always carried in her right pocket, the blade she named Kate. The monster was over her, it breathed heavily on her face Sarah pulled out her knife and stabbed it into the monster. \"You know I only care about your well-being, Sarah.\" Sarah heard her dad say before her vision went completely black.<br>\r\nSarah awoke on the ground shivering a bit from the morning chill. She noticed she was in a forest, perhaps the same forest from her dream, she thought. The trees around her were all dead with no leaves or color on them at all. Sarah tried to get up but as soon as she tried her head started throbbing. \"Maybe it wasn't a dream after all?\" Sarah said out loud. Pressing through the pain in her head Sarah sat up and looked around. Most of her surroundings were tall dead tree's but in front of her was a dirt path. Sarah crawled over to the path, the dirt and wet grass rubbed smoothly against her hands and knees. The dirt path itself was covered in fallen leaves most of which had little color left on them. Brushing some leaves aside Sarah noticed two shoe prints in the dirt. Sarah couldn't believe it, somebody else must be in these woods, she thought. Looking around one more time, looking for somebody, Sarah got up off the ground. The throbbing in her head blinded her for a few seconds but soon she was able to see straight again. <br>\r\nThe path looked like the best way to go but as Sarah looked further into the woods she started to doubt herself a little. Who knows what might lurk in there, she thought. The monster from her nightmare or maybe even just some sicko rapist. Sarah reached into her pocket and held onto Kate, she did have protection. Suddenly Sarah heard something, it sounded like moaning. The moaning get louder and louder and it seemed to be coming from all directions. Sarah turned her head this way and that trying to find whoever was making that sound when, just as suddenly as it started it stopped. Sarah calmed herself a little bit when she heard a loud car horn which made her jump in fright. Looking to the right of the path she was on she saw a cars headlights in the distance. The morning fog covered up the car so she couldn't see what kind of car it was or who was in it. <br>\r\nSarah had to make a choice here on where to go...         </span></div></div>",

She had Kate, she could defend herself against anything. Walking down the path, Sarah gripped the switchblade hard in her hand. After a few minutes Sarah was surrounded by dead trees and could barely see any daylight in the forest. It wasn't pitch black however, Sarah did have the openings in the tree branches above her but even those were becoming less and less. Sarah knew that at this rate soon she would be walking blindly, anything could attack her then. Soon Sarah couldn't see anything ahead of her, the last of the light was behind her now. Sarah couldn't tell whether or not to turn back or keep going, or even if she was on the path anymore. \"Sarah?\" Sarah heard out of nowhere. The voice made her jump, pulling out her switchblade just in case. \"Sarah, don't you think four piercings is enough?\" The voice asked. Sarah began to calm down a little. The voice was her mother's and in fact, she had this very same conversation with her.<br>\r\nSarah walked on, still holding out her switchblade in case whatever made that voice comes out to play. My mom can't be here, right? Sarah thought. It was still pitch black like when you close your eyes to dream. \"Sarah.\" The voice whispered, barely heard by Sarah. \"Sarah.\" It repeated getting a little louder. \"Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah!\" Sarah looked around her living room. She must have spaced out for a second there. The room itself is painted a kind of bright yellow that her mom says is supposed to bring out every ones happy mood. Sarah sat on the couch facing directly towards the television. The television, she thought. I probably stared at it for to long and spaced out, imagining I was in a dark forest. Sarah saw her mom sitting in the rocking chair next to her with a look of disgust on her face. What were we talking about again? She thought. <br>\r\nAnswering her question Sarah's mom stood up letting the rocking chair sway slightly. \"Well, Sarah. Whens the limit? When your body is covered in holes?\" her mother asked. Sarah remembered now, they were talking about her piercings. \"It's my body, mom.\" Sarah snapped back, surprising her mother a little. Her mother than began pacing from the door leading outside back to the rocking chair and back again. After a little bit of time she stopped and looked at Sarah again. \"Why are you doing all this Sarah?\" She asked. \"After your father left you've been acting strange. Wearing odd make-up, going out past midnight and now this.\" She said, pointing a finger at Sarah's ear. \"I think that girl, Kate is having a very bad influence on you sweetie. I want you to stop hanging out with her.\" Sarah started to get a little mad at this. Kate was her best friend after all. She's been there with her since the very beginning, she loved her like a sister. \"You can't tell me what to do.\" Sarah said, raising her voice a little bit. Her mom gave her a cold stare but Sarah returned it with a cold stare of her own. \"Did you hear me young lady?\" Her mother asked. \"You are not allowed to see Kate again!\"<br>\r\nSarah looked at her mother and said, \"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She opened her eyes and saw she was back in the forest again, lying on the ground. She got up and used her arm to wipe dirt from her face. She noticed her face was wet, had she been crying? She put her hands under her eyes and felt a steady stream of tears. Great, she thought, just thinking about my mother is making me cry. She quickly wiped her eyes with the back of her hands, I'm no baby, she told herself.<br>\r\nThis was when she noticed something really odd. The tree's in front of her were glowing orange. It wasn't sunlight she knew, the tree's above her blocked out the moon and sun. The temperature started rising and Sarah suddenly figured out what was going on. She turned around and saw the forest was on fire. Tree's were falling down and the fire was spreading quickly. Sarah started running away from the fire.She kept running but no matter how much she ran she still felt it's warm embrace close behind her. Sarah thought back to when the monster chased her down. No matter how far she ran in her dream it still caught up with her, it still killed her. Sarah reached into her pocket, the one carrying Kate. Please, she said to herself, Please Kate save me. <br>\r\nSarah pushed herself as hard as she could but, she knew, she couldn't keep running for much longer. Soon she had to stop. She ran up to a tree and put her arm against it as she caught her breath. She looked toward the fire while she breathed heavily. The fire was still closing in on her fast. Sarah couldn't keep up this running much longer, she was going to die. Sarah looked around quickly, there must be some way out of here, she thought. That was when she saw an opening in the tree's close by to where she was. But what was more important was she could see sunlight. Sarah grinned to herself and was about to run towards the opening when she heard a noise. It was a scream and it was coming from the fire. Sarah glanced towards the fire and saw a little girl on the ground crying. The little girl was dressed in a pink dress that Sarah felt like she had seen before.<br>\r\n\"Mommy.\" The little girl cried. \"Mommy, I'm scared. Where did you go Mommy?\" The little girl put her head in her lap and started crying again. Sarah had to make a choice here. Saving the girl could be suicide and besides, she looked like a big mommy's girl. Sarah didn't want to die here and freedom is so close by. Sarah...     </span></div></div>",

The fire was closing in from all around her, if she stopped for even a second it will consume her. She was almost twenty feet away from the exit when a wall of fire came up in front of her. Sarah kept running straight towards the wall of fire and jumped right through it. Even though she jumped straight through fire it felt cold to her. In fact, in that split second she was in the fire she felt a chill throughout her body. Sarah landed outside of the forest on her stomach. She quickly turned to her side, she wanted to see what happened to the little girl. When she saw the girl Sarah wished she just walked away instead. The girl was on fire. She was rolling on the ground screaming an ear-piercing scream. Her hair was burning off her head and her skin was literally turning black. Her cute little pink dress that she wore was being burnt right off her. The girl kept screaming and Sarah noticed the girl was still crying. <br>\r\nSarah couldn't watch this anymore. She was about to walk away from this horrible sight when she saw someone else walk out from behind a tree. Sarah was pretty far away from this person but she could see it was a man. He stood over the little girl watching her burn and roll around. What was odd was that the little girl wasn't reaching out towards the man or calling him for help. It was as if she couldn't see him even though the man was looking down at the little girl,watching her die. <br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" Sarah screamed. \"Help her, she's dying.\" The man looked directly towards Sarah and grinned at her. His smile made Sarah's heart skip a beat, it was the most scariest thing she had ever seen and yet, somehow, it looked familiar to her. The man turned towards Sarah. That's when she noticed he was carrying a box of matches, he started the fire, she thought. The man started to sprint towards Sarah which took her by surprise. The fire seemed to part for this man as he ran towards her and Sarah knew he would be where she was in a few seconds. Sarah turned around and started sprinting away from the woods towards an open field ahead of her. <br>\r\nEven though Sarah was exhausted from before, seeing that man run at her with such speed really gave Sarah a second wind. Sarah ran into the opening and kept running forwards. It was still dark out and Sarah really couldn't see to far ahead of herself. She couldn't hear the mans footsteps behind her, maybe she lost him? She turned around,breathing heavily and saw nothing there. Just darkness. She turned back around and saw her mom walking ahead of her. \"Are you coming?\" She called to Sarah. Wondering why her mother was here she ran towards her. As she got closer she noticed the sun was coming up and there were other people in the field to. Some walking dogs, others jogging, others holding hands. Also now there were tree's and bushes surrounding Sarah as she caught up to her mom and grabbed her awaiting hand.<br>\r\nSarah's hand was smaller then her mom's hand which was weird since Sarah is usually taller then her. Sarah also noticed that her mother was taller then her and that Sarah was wearing a dress, a pink dress. \"Come on Sarah, it's getting late.\" Her mother told her and pulled Sarah along by the hand. Sarah walked with her mother down the path, she wanted to say something, anything, but her mouth wouldn't move. Instead they just walked in silence through the park. A park, Sarah remembered her mom used to always bring her to the park as a child.<br>\r\nThey kept walking, Sarah's mom pulling her along a little bit as they went. That's when something moved in a bush nearby. Sarah thought it must have been her eyes playing tricks on her. But as they got closer to the bush, it moved again. \"Mommy, whose that in the bush?\" Sarah asked her mom, finally able to say something. Her mom looked over to where Sarah was staring and quickly looked away. Her mom started to walk faster and was practically dragging Sarah along by the hand. Sarah looked behind her and saw a dark silhouette of a man walk out from behind the bush. The man was grinning as he started to follow them down the path. Who is this guy, Sarah thought, a stalker for mom? \"Mommy, a man is following us.\" Sarah told her mother. Her mom looked back, her eyes widen a little and when she turned back around she started walking so fast it felt like they were running. They walked/ran to an opening under a stone bridge. Sarah looked up at her mom's face and saw she was breathing heavily. Her mom looked down, closed her eyes and screamed, \"Just leave us alone, Justin!\"<br>\r\nSarah opened her eyes and looked around. It was dark outside again and in the distance she could see the forest, it was burning bright in the darkness around her. She turned around and saw the same stone bridge from before. Sarah looked under the bridge for a few seconds and saw something moving. Whatever this thing was it hadn't seen Sarah yet. Maybe I can get the jump on it, she thought to herself as she started to approach the opening. Sarah reached into her pocket and grabbed her pocketknife, Kate. Sarah went inside and saw... </span></div></div>",

She tried to silence her footsteps so the officers wouldn't notice her. There were three officers in front of Sarah, each of them had their backs turned. They were talking with each other so their voices blocked out Sarah's footsteps but one loud footstep could alert them of Sarah's presence. Sarah quickly put her pocketknife away. The last thing she needed was for the police to find her sneaking behind them with a knife out. As Sarah moved closer she thought to herself, maybe these guys can get me out of this forest. This thought almost convinced Sarah to call out to these men, the sooner I'm out of here, she thought, the better. <br>\r\nAs Sarah walked forward about to tap the closest one on the shoulder he started to speak, making Sarah jump. \"That girl Sarah has to pass by here eventually.\" He said, turning his head to the guy next to him. This statement made Sarah freeze up, their waiting for me?  Almost as if he heard her, the middle cop spoke up. \"It's been hours, how long can this girl stay hiding from us?\" Sarah was confused, are the police looking for her? Is she reported missing or something back home? Sarah began to put her hand out, these men, their here to rescue her. \"She can hide.\" The last officer spoke up, \"Sooner or later though we will find her. It's not everyday we get to arrest a teenage murderer.\" Sarah's hand froze in midair. Did she just hear what she thought she heard? Did they just call her a murderer? <br>\r\nSarah's head suddenly started to burn up. She felt like she was catching a really bad flu. She looked around and saw the bridge around her was melting. Sarah started to cry out but the officers didn't hear her. Sarah reached out to the officer in front of her, she needed help. When she grabbed the officers shoulder he disappeared, all three of them did. Sarah closed her eyes and grabbed her head with both hands. Her head was still on fire and she felt like she was going to pass out. As suddenly as her headache appeared, it disappeared. She opened her eyes and looked around. Sarah was no longer in the underpass, she was in her house again. Sarah started to walk around her house, this can't be real, she thought to herself. I'm not falling for this again.<br>\r\nSarah began to walk towards the living room, she was intent to find her mother and find out what was going on. Sarah walked into the living room and saw that man from before. The man from the park, Justin. He was sitting on the couch with his feet on the coffee table. He looked like he was asleep but as Sarah got closer his eye's quickly opened. He looked at her and gave her that creepy grin, she really hated that grin. \"What the Hell are you doing here?\" She asked him with anger. He sat up, never taking his eyes off of Sarah's eyes. He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a cigarette, put it to his mouth, lit it, and started smoking. He blew out some smoke, \"Just thought I'd pay your mother a visit.\" He said, just before he started laughing. \"After all\" he continued, \"I love her so much.\" He started laughing again. Sarah didn't know this man, but the fact that he was in her house acting like he owned the place or something really annoyed her. <br>\r\nThe man saw the anger in her eyes and grinned at her again. He opened his mouth to say something when all of a sudden he froze. His body just sat there as if somebody pressed the pause button on a remote for a movie. Then he fell back into the couch with both his hands spread out, the hand holding the cigarette dropped it on the floor. Smoke started to come up from the spot where the cigarette fell but Sarah didn't notice, her eyes were glued on the man. Justin eye's closed then opened several times, his pupils turning darker and darker after every blink. Soon his eyes were black as night and he stopped blinking, he looked directly at Sarah and grinned. \"Sarah\" he started, his voice was much heavier then before. \"You want to know why your in this nightmare don't you?\" He asked her. Sarah was shocked, whatever this thing controlling Justin was, it had answers that Sarah wanted. A small fire started where the cigarette was dropped. \"If you know anything then tell me.\" Sarah commanded. \"I can only tell you this, if you want to escape your past you must first correct it.\" <br>\r\nAfter saying this Justin shoved into Sarah, knocking her onto her back. He started to run to the front door as Sarah started to get up. \"Wait!\" She called to him, \"what do you mean, how do I correct my past?\" The small fire that started in the corner was spreading like wildfire and was already consuming part of the living room and most of upstairs. Sarah got to her feet and looked towards the door, Justin was already gone but he couldn't have gotten far. As Sarah ran to the front door she heard her mother scream from upstairs, the fire was already consuming most of the house by now. Sarah looked back for a second, if I go upstairs and help her I'll lose the man and never get my answers, she thought. Sarah ran out the door and started running on her porch, ignoring her mother's screams behind her. <br>\r\nSarah closed her eyes for a second. When she opened them she was back in the open field at night again. She looked behind her towards the bridge and saw the officers were gone. Instead, written on the bridge in huge bright red letters, was the word 'NORTH'. Sarah had a feeling this was where the man, Justin went. Sarah started to walk in the direction she assumed was North. After what felt like hours of walking on that field Sarah saw something in the distance. As she got closer she identified it as</span></div></div>",

The path she was walking down was surrounded by trees but at least she could see sunlight. The dirt felt like mud on her shoe's and every so often she would feel drops of water fall on her from leaves above her. Sarah knew taking this path was the right thing to do. She knew that the forest was probably filled with dangerous monsters. Like the monster from her dream, she thought. Sarah continued walking but what was really odd to her was no matter how much she walked the tree's always looked the same. It was almost as if she was walking around in a circle. <br>\r\nSarah knew that this idea was crazy but she still couldn't stop thinking it. Sarah decided to test this theory of hers. She reached into her pocket and pulled out Kate. Then she walked up to the closest tree and carved into it 'Help Me'. Putting the knife back into her pocket Sarah walked on, hoping beyond hope that the tree would not show up again. \"Sarah.\" Sarah heard her fathers voice say. \"You've got to learn to stand up for yourself. Their won't always be someone there to protect you.\" Sarah remembered her father told her that when she was ten. The mean girl on her block was beating up Sarah harder then she usually did. The girl kept punching Sarah in the gut until she was near coughing up blood. On that day the bully girls mom died and her father was already drinking heavily. The bully needed to let out some anger and that's when she saw Sarah the Coward walking down the street. Each punch made Sarah cry out in pain and she thought that today this bully was gonna go to far and kill her. If Sarah's father showed up even a minute later Sarah probably would have been dead. He didn't however, and the second he saw what was happening he ran to the girls to break up the fight. Her father grabbed the bullies shoulder and tried to pull her off Sarah. \"Sarah.\" He said while pulling this girl off her. \"You've got to learn to stand up for yourself.\" The bully broke free from him and moved her arm back to punch Sarah again. Sarah saw the fist coming right towards her face. In an instant her vision turned black and she felt searing pain all over her face. \"Their won't always be someone there to protect you.\"<br>\r\nSarah opened her eyes. She was back in the forest again. When she looked in front of her, her heart sank. The tree where she carved 'Help Me' was right in front of her. She was walking around in circles. All this was to much for Sarah and she sprinted off the dirt path into the trees. She needed to get out of here, she needed to find help. After awhile she stopped running, she was really tired. She bent down and put her hands on her knees, breathing heavily. Something behind her started moving, it sounded like footsteps. Sarah was worried that this thing in the bushes could be the monster from her dream. She could keep running away but she was already tired as it is.<br>\r\nSarah decides to...     </span></div></div>",
