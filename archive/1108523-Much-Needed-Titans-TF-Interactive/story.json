I shall prepare the meal, then!\" she says as she does just as she said she would, quickly preparing a meal that looks like a mix between the food of her world and regular earth food.

It was only made to look like it so you would not be repulsed by it as I have witnessed in the past. It was in fact Glorthrax. One on the most delicous and filling foods on all of Tameran\" Said the orange girl with a wide smile now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel full. I feel like I could eat a t-bone the size of the tower.\" Said Raven in her normal monotone voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien girl put her hand under her chin thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not understand. Glorthrax is the most filling food a Tameranian can ingest. Any one of my people who consumes the amount I made for each of us would keep them from the hunger for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for non-Tamerianian's?\" Said Raven this time with a hint of desperation sneaking into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien girl's eye's bulged horribly.

Looking away from her two friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When other species consume Glorthrax they are instead overcome with an uncontrollable hunger that will not go away until the glorthrax has been expelld from their system. No matter how much they eat during that time, they will not be rid of the hunger until the gorthrax is gone and given how much we have eaten I would say that will take a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up two see the two girls no longer seated but instead had moved over to the fridge were she heard sounds of chewing and gulping from the two bloated titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7 days to go</span></div></div>",

Within a moment, the three girls were no longer in the tower but instead, outside in the air. Raven landed safely on Starfires immense back, while Terra wasn't so luck, grabbing hold of her friends rear just to keep from falling. They were too high in the air  for Terra to call up some Earth from below. Unfortunately for her, as soon as Starfire felt the pressure of the walls leave her body, she immedately began letting loose a series of loud and smelly farts right into her friends face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven couldn't help but feel a bit of her own prankster side come up, small as it was. After all, how often was it that she could mess with both Star and Terra so easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Terra pulled herself further up Starfire's ass, Raven let loose a simple spell, which pushed Terra's face flying directly into Starfire's buttcheeks, mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed next was both hilarious, and slightly arousing for the three of them, a side effect of the gas they all had within them. Terra's head disappeared up Star's crack, trapped and now growing as Starfire unleashed some of her most powerful farts yet, all of which forced down Terra's throat. Terra's body blimped immediately, growing very quickly to match Starfires size and beyond. Her arms and legs stuck out and fattened up, her squished face puffed out within the confines of her friend, and her body seemed to envelope her limbs, next moving on to the now rounding out hands and feet, the latter of which beginning to burst out of their much too small shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStars body was no slouch either, moving from hot air balloon very quickly onto Zeppelin sizes as her rate of farting just grew and grew. She couldn't help but moan slightly as the feeling of something so far wedged between her butt cheeks. Terra had already gone from being angry to being completely blissful as she just allowed herself to blow up, firing off some pretty incredible farts of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven watched this, smelling the rancid air and starting to think her little 'prank' had been an excellent idea...

One measured Terras heels, another was tracing Stars arches, and another had climbed up and was fiddling with the girls toes.

She loved her room, comfy, dark, and full of arcane knowledge.  Calling on her powers of levitation, Raven floated to the top of her bookshelf for that is where she stuffed most of her new books she had not gotten around to reading just yet.  There were several titles at her disposal, each one with a uniquely powerful name that conjured images of great power and sorcery.  However, none of these tomes caught her eye.  Instead, a small pinkish white book caught her attention.  It was a simple and plain cover with not even so much as a title.  Pulling the book out, Raven began to flip through the pages reading spell after spell as she floated down and sat down on her bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to read through the text, Raven grew more and more curious with each passing moment.  The language of the book was foreign and yet familiar to her yet each spell she passed lead to another with even more power.  Finally, Raven's fingers landed on a small spell about mid-way through the book that she recognized... kind of.  It was an ancient spell, she could tell that much, but she could not tell what it did.  Consumed by curiousity, Raven began to slowly sound out the phrase, \"Ono... e`nauk tul... amantshe.\"  Upon reading the spell, there was a quick flash.  Raven had unknowingly cast the spell, not knowing the book used the reader's innate magical ability to cast the spells inside as opposed to the caster choosing to cast the spell.

The delicious smell of pizza and their hungry stomachs distracted Raven from noticing how her feet barely grazed the floor while Starfire's feet though able to touch where probably just a few minutes away from dangling as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So friend Terra,\" began Starfire between mouthfuls of pizza, \"What did you decide to do on this day of rest and vacation?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond did not answer immediately as she first had to finish the pizza slice in her hand... and the two on her plate.  \"Oh, just some basic training.  Trying to get more control over my powers.  After that I took a nice long shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed,\" remarked the Red-haired girl.  \"Your hair has a very clean and happy scent.  Quite nice indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed as well,\" commented Raven in one of her harsher tones, \"when I stepped on a pile of mud someone left in the second level's shower room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right sorry about that,\" answered Terra with a mild blush, her hand scratching the back of her head as if to help her pick and excuse from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra friend,\" came Starfire's voice, \"I do not wish to... \"get on your case,\" but I too have stumbled across the iky dirt and mud you leave in the shower.  Please try harder in remembering to clean up your mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" smiled Terra, \"I get it.  I'm just absentminded about that stuff.  I promise I will try harder to make sure the shower is clean after I use it.\"  Terra then gave a salute as if to seal the promise, but it was followed by an odd thud.  Looking around, all three girls wondered what had made the sound.  Was it a villain come to wreck his vengeance, were it stalkers trying to get creepy pictures, or was it some other threat?  Glancing under the table, Terra soon found the cause.  \"Sorry guys, looks like my shoe fell off,\" said Terra as she raised up her left foot revealing a soft, crew length white socked foot.  Placing it on the table, as proof Terra soon garnered odd looks from her friends.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not going to put it back on Friend Terra?\" asked Starfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,why should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because as part of Robin's rules, we must be ready to act at a moment's notice,\" answered Raven this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Robin's not here.  What's the harm in kicking back one day, on our day off in fact.\"  As if to enforce her statement, Terra's right leg quickly kicked forward her loose shoe flying across the room and falling into the wall before sliding to the floor.  Her right foot then joined her left atop the table, though Terra shifted her left so as one foot was on either side of her pizza.  Raven was about to object to Terra's crude manners when she heard a giggle and two thuds.  With a inaudible groan, Raven looked to see that Starfire had joined in the relaxing as she too discard her shoes revealing a pair of pink knee socks, no doubt a gift from Robin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come friend Raven, join us in our relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a glare, Raven was about to refuse when her shoes decided for her.  With two quick thuds, Raven sudden felt a breeze against her feet.  Looking down she saw her shoes discarded on the ground and two black ankle socked feet seemingly smiling at her.  \"Hurray for friend Raven.  Let us continue with more cheesy pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already there,\" answered Terra not noticing that the slices seemed slightly bigger than they were just a few moments ago.  Unable to go back now, Raven leaned back in her chair and continued to eat her pizza, unaware of what would happen next.</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to deplete her friend's pizza supplies, Terra decided she would bring over another pizza just for her.  Getting off from the chair Terra walked over to the kitchen countertop where a few more pizzas were stacked.  Too distracted by the enticing smell of pizza, Terra did not notice that the countertop seemed slightly more elevated than usual.  What did strike her as unusual was that the stack of pizzas must have grown or something as she was now forced to reach for the top box.  Stranding on her socked tiptoes and stretching out the rest of her form, Terra was able to grasp the top most box and pulled it into her waiting arms.  Terra then spun around back towards the table, took one step, then tripped over something causing her to face plant right into her beloved pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the crash behind them, Starfire and Raven turned to see Terra faceplanted into the pizza.  Getting up, Starfire went over to the fallen Terra and helped her out of the pizza.  \"Friend Terra are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond-haired girl answered as she spat out a small sausage worth of pepperoni and meat, \"Yeah, I'm fine Star.  Thanks for asking.  But, what the heck did I trip on?\"  Looking both girls were surprised to find Terra's brown shorts down around her ankles, the obvious culprit.  Lifting her leg, Terra watched as her shorts slid down her leg back to her white panties.  \"Okay, that's just weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is friend Terra?\" asked Starfire, as she helped her pantless friend back to her socked feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I put these shorts on today, they were actually pretty tight.  Now, they're like at least an inch if not two too big for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe all your gorging,\" came Raven's voice, \"Stretched out your pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, I do not gorge,\" retorted Terra as she threw her overly large shorts away and stomped over to Terra, her T-shirt reaching down just enough to cover he panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to the five to seven pizza boxes over there.\"  Raven then motioned to a stack of pizza boxes that Terra had discarded, their lids open as if they were carcasses left over from some demon's organ feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I admit I eat alot, but I do not gorge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven just stared blankly at her, unsure if the girl was trying to defend herself or hide the truth from herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her tactic was failing, Terra turned the subject away from her appetite.  \"Well, at least even with all my eat it, I still look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever... gorger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed by how Raven was pointing out her flaws, Terra turned to Raven and thought of a plan.  \"Raven look there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven, thinking more on reaction than anything else, quickly spun around and prepared for anything that might be thrown at her.  However, what she wasn't expecting was for Terra to run up from behind and pull Raven's cape over her face, unzip her leotard which quickly fell down to Raven's ankles, and push her.  Terra then planted foot between Raven's breasts as if claiming victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for!\" shouted Raven as she shrugged Terra off and stood to her feet, her cape covering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For calling me a gorger.  Now we're even.\"  Raven was about to retort when both girls sudden saw a pink skirt fly between them.  Looking, they saw Starfire pulling off her top reducing herself to knee high pink socks, a pair of pink panties, and a pink bra.  As she removed her top, Starfire spoke saying, \"Friends, friends, let us not fight.  This is our day of relaxation, we should enjoy it.  Not spend it fighting.  I say we should grab take the remnants of the pizza and move to a position on the couch so we may watch a movie on the television.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case Star.  Why are you taking off your clothes?\" pondered Raven as she unconsciously adjusted her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just following both of your examples.  Besides, the boys are away.  What harm could there be if we reduce ourselves to our undergarments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding logic in this, Terra quickly yanked off her oversized T-shirt revealing a white sport bra.  This left Terra with a bra, white panties, and white crew socks.  \"Good point Star,\" said Terra as she jokingly threw her shirt by Raven's head.  \"Come on Raven.  Strip a little.  Join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot  sure what to think of the two half-naked girls in front of her, Raven finally sighed and unclasped her blue cape revealing her black bra, panties, and ankle socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurray for friend Raven,\" shouted Starfire ash she hugged her gray friend.  Raven was about to protest when Terra joined in the hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys,\" said Terra, \"Let's see what's on the tube.\"  Terra then grabbed the last pizza and charged towards the TV.  Starfire and Raven followed shortly after, unaware what was happening to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

If you were to count you'd find that each girl had already consumed 50 pies. Not a lot compared to last time Mae eye had her eyes on them but the fact was that they had eaten that amount in only 5 minutes! Thats 1 pie every 10 seconds with no end in sight. That means each girl hap gained fifty pounds in just 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the three Raven look the neatest but that was because  her leotard was naturally strecthy and make her look less likly explode of of her cloths. Her legs were now laden with cellulite and dimpled all over. Her shoes had torn and ripped as her fat feet swelled up. The belt hanging around her waist was scattered around the room in several pieces. Her chest had gone up by several sizes to about a f cup and her gut would soon reach the table section of the previously mention 'ENORMOUS' high chair. She now had three chins that were laying against her chest as her mouth was open just barley as if by some surge of will power to keep pies out which the pies just seemed to morph and shrink so it would fit easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire was much worse since her wardrobe was the Tamaranian equivelelent to leather and when it came to it's weaers growth it would  barley move. Let's just say that Starfire was not well dressed as when she first sat down. She looked pretty much the same as Raven since they were just about the same height and weight originally and started eating at the same time. The only differance was she appeared to be getting slightly more fat in the chest than the rest of her body making her a g cup. Not a lot but enough to notice. Like Raven her predictament prevented her from opening her mouth to much but the pies just changed andpoured itself in like a pie milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra unfortunatly had the misfortune to be growiing particularly in the rear. Which considering her tight and unflexable khaki shorts was proving to be quite painful until she heard them ssplit down the seams. She had grown in the chest less than eithr girl but was still big a an e cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one of the three girls showed any sign past there almost closed mouths of wanting to stop. Not that Mae eye had any intention of stpping. She needed these girls to fat to even move if she wanted to make her famous 'three p' pie'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr for those that don't know. 'Pretty. Powered. Piggy' pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMae eye looked on at her handiwork with a slight frown. At the rate they were going they'd be a ton and a half at hours end instead of the 8000 pounds (4 tons) she needed from all of them in time for her to make her pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only choice was to speed up production. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped the side of the oven with her magic spoon and pushed the production to it's limit. Almost immediatly pies began to flood out of the machine much faster than before. Each one bigger and more fattening than the first batch. She could have made them bigger but then the magic would have ruined the flavour of the pies and as evil as she might be she was a cook and 'NOTHING' would make her ruin food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides it would ruin The girls flavour later on if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now the Titan girls were going from 50 pounds in 5 minutes to 130 or so every 5 minutes.</span></div></div>",

Hands and feet had disipeared as the fat on their arms and legs grew past them and swallowed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is interesting to not that their undergarments were now the only thing seperating them from indecency as if by magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThier breast were now many times heavier than the metal man cyborg was and as big as an overstuffed beanbag chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conveyer belt had adjusted itself to drop the pies over the blobs since their head had long since followed thier hands and feet and were swallowed by their blubber also. They now only had enough space to breath and catch the pies in their awaiting horribly bloated mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls once pretty faces now looked like they had been stung thousands of times. The fat had covered not only thir cheeks but their entire faces and actually prevented the girls from opening their eyes under the weight even for starfires super strengh. They now hand so many chins that it put you in mind of the old phonebook joke and made you seriously think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had already filled the chairs. Thier guts pushing out and actually starting to spill over them. Surprisingly the floor not creaking under the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll they could think about now was the pie. Their every other sense besides taste was blunted by the fat surrounding them. Hering gone because their ear's were surrounded by fat. their noses pressed shut by fat on either side. Sight already explained. Touch they still had in a sense but it was lost on anything past the feeling of sinking in a pool full of pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother looked at the girls proudly. The hour was up so it was finally time to stop feeding her sweety's. After all it was bad manners to for mother to eat before she'd filled up her baby's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe halts the pie production.

The pie itself looked just like any ordinary piece of apple pie in terms of texture and shape, but the filling was a eep shade of purple. Raven, Starfire and Terra snarfed down their pies in a heartbeat. \"Mother, that was delicious, but why is it called bloatberry pie?\" Terra said dreamily. \"I thought you' like it dearies, I made it special just for you. As for the name, well it's a surprise.\" \"Oh, we like surprises Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then the changes began, slowly at first then faster and faster. The three female titans were inflating!

They were getting fuller and fuller with each passing moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Starfire, Raven and Terra had completely filled out into huge round balls about the size of the blueberry girl.

She hadn't meant to do that. \"I'm going to my room to meditate.\" she called back.

The real Raven's body mimicked the doll's and low and behold the Teen Titans living room had a brand new Raven rug. Raven could only gaze up at the ceiling as the doors opened to let Starfire in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Starfire flew into the room, Raven tried to scream. But the combination of having her body and lung twisted up and then flattened under her giant head made breathing difficult. In all truth she would have been dead by now had it not been for one small side effect of Jinx's Voodoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nThe Voodoo victim is invincible.<br>\r\nOf course that doesn't mean that they don't feel the mind numbing agony of say being twisted, stretched, and flattened. It's just that while all this is happening the victim can not be physically injured. No broken bones, torn ligaments, or brain damage. The damage to a person's psyche however just might be irreversible.<br>\r\nJinx thought it was a fair trade off.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire flew quitely into the room. She thought she had seen Raven come in here earlier. She flew up and over the couch when she suddenly got the strongest urge to land. It was as if someone had whispered the order into her ear and she couldn't help but obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire landed hard with her steel toed boots digging deep into the rug. Starfire then found herself running in place. This was followed by jumping jacks. Then just regular jumping. Finally she began to run laps around the edge of the rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven the rug felt it all. The pounding made Raven even flatter than she was earlier. After a while though she became as flat as she was going to get. It began to feel less like Starfire stomping on her and more like Starfire poking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven began to wonder what was happening to her and Starfire for that matter. Starfire was not one to just spontaniously begin working out. Something must be making her. Or someone. Or someones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire stopped suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the camera room Blackfire had control of the doll now. She brought the doll's ear to her mouth and wispered an order.</span></div></div>",

Blackfire grinned as she ordered Starfire once more. \"How about a little workout?\" Starfire set a finger on her chin. She suddenly felt like exercising. Unknowingly, she set her smelly feet on Raven's flattened face and flexed her arms. She got down on the ground, digging her toes into Raven's face, and did some push-ups. The smell of the tamaranian's feet made Raven want to gag. Raven felt herself stretch out further as Starfire exercised on her, growing even flatter than before. Raven could do nothing as Star's orange soles sunk into her face once again. The stench was unbearable. Raven was helpless as she absorbed Starfire's sweat and stink. Just when Raven though she would pass out, Starfire lifted her feet off of her flattened face. She shut her eyes in relief. Maybe now she could figure out what was going on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Raven could think about anything, she opened her eyes and saw Starfire's butt descending towards her. Her eyes widened in shock as she was smothered by Star's ample behind and purple skirt. \"Ahh..\" Starfire moaned as she reached for her toes. Raven wanted to scream as her face slowly enveloped around the orange girl's round cheeks. In a few minutes, Starfire stood up and wiped her forehead. Her lips puckered as she felt a sensation on her behind. She turned around, seeing the rug sticking to her cheeks. \"Oh! Teehee..\" She brushed the rug off and floated to the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's her turn!\" Kitten shouted evilly. Blackfire nodded, a devilish grin on her face. She reached for the Starfire doll before being stopped by Jinx. \"Wait! How can we be sure Raven isn't taken care of yet?\" Jinx interrupted, taking the flattened doll. Blackfire rolled her eyes. \"Ugh, fine. But you better be quick.\" Jinx smiled, having an idea.</span></div></div>",

ROCK and stuff.\" She grumbled to herself before picking up the Terra doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the tower, Terra was chilling out on the couch. After taking down Dr. Light with the others, she needed some time to relax. \"How many times do you have to deal with that guy, anyway?\" She asked, blowing hair from in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he were much of a threat, I'd actually get tired of him,\" Raven said before turning her attention back to her book. The blonde went back to her hair, shortly before shutting her eyes for a well deserved nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GROOAAAAAAAAN*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shot open. She clutched her stomach, moaning uncomfortablly, rolling off of the couch. With a gasp, Starfire and Raven leaped over to their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend Terra!\" Starfire said, picking her friend off the floor, \"Are you okay? Do you require assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I don't know...\" Her stomach groaned loudly. \"Oh man, I think I need to...\" She stumbled up and rushed to the bathroom door, pounding on it. \"HURRY UP! Hnnng...\" The desperate blonde let loose a loud fart. She grunted and moaned, bringing her hands to her rear, pushing her cheeks together. \"Hurry up, hurry uuup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, PRICELESS,\" Blackfire snickered to herself, watching the poor girl from the crystal ball. \"A bit juvenile, but it gets the job done.\" Jinx chuckled to herself, pouring laxatives into the small doll's mouthslot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, I could to better than that...\" Kitten pouted to herself, \"That's not even CLEVER...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra couldn't hold it much longer. The poor blonde was pacing back and forth, blasting gas loudly into the air. With a grimace, she groaned, banging on tha door. \"WHO'S IN THERE ANYWAY?!\" She screamed. \"I... I don't think I can make it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Terra do?</span></div></div>",

Terra nodded assuring Star it wasn't that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three bad girls were busting a gut. They enjoyed the dolls like a four year old girl playing with Barbies. \"Perhaps Terra's a bit more hungry?\" Blackfire said. Kitten and Jinx pretty much had a good idea what Blackfire was thinking. \"DOWN THE HATCH!\" Jinx shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinx then grabbed both the Raven and Starfire dolls, and shoved them into the Terra doll's mouth slot. Raven and Star were suddenly being pulled with no willpower to stop near Terra's mouth. Star's head flew into Terra's mouth first, slightly making the blonde's  head bloated out. Star slowly went in closer, and down the throat, finally with an accidental swallow, Terra gulped Starfire whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...crap,\" Terra said. Raven's eyes shot wide open seeing she couldn't control herself from heading into Terra. Terra tried to run away, but she was trapped in the corner of the room, also with no will to keep her mouth shut. Raven's ass flew into her mouth first, slowly being swallowed. Terra's stomach was nearly bloated like a beach ball, both with Starfire and Raven much alive in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackfire laughed wickedly to see her sister be eaten by her own best friend. Jinx couldn't help but think that was the coolest thing she's ever seen. \"Hey I got an idea,\" Jinx said. \"So do I !\" Kitten replied.</span></div></div>",

The real girls had a tight squeeze in Terra's now bloated up head. \"Now for the coup de grace,'' Jinx said, making her hands move the mouth of the Terra doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra slowly moved her mouth up and down, chewing up Starfire and Raven. As spit gathered, the two girls bodies were becoming churned and sticky. Slowly their bodies fused together in color of skin and clothing, with their eyes still in tact. The three wicked girls giggled at such a sight on the TV. \"Make her swallow them again!\" Blackfire somewhat ordered. Jinx smiled and pushed the Terra doll's head down, making the other two dolls go back into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra's body was bloated yet again, but now with the girls churned into one gummy blob. \"Hey, why not blow some bubbles with em,\" Kitten asked. \"Great idea,\" Jinx said. \"Hehe, but which end should they come from?</span></div></div>",
