I looked over to see my beautiful girlfriend, Auroa Nakamura, stir and wake up. She wrapped her hands around me, as if to calm me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Kaido...? What's the matter, honey?\" Auroa said as she stared in to my purple eyes, she'd always described was like the moon, with her own warm, beautiful sky blue colored eyes. She let go of me to have a better view into my eyes. \"You look like your in massive pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"...Fine. I'm fine. Sorry to wake you.\" I said putting on my smile, which was none-the-less fake, as I put my hand on her silky brown hair to pat it. I hated to lie and it was against my morals but I could find the courage to tell her and get her anymore worried than she is already. In my mind, all I could think of tomorrow is that it'll be a another full moon. I will have to find a comfortable place to go tonight, so I can change, since I am a werewolf. It isn't like I have a choice in the matter, I never got to feel...in touch with my true side, as a wolf. I was taken away from my family, when I was born, so I never had a \"normal\" life like my family. My instincts are the only thing that drive me and not the good kind either. I haven't told Auroa all this, except I am a werewolf, the only thing I said instead was I needed to go enjoy it to the fullest and she needed to tend to her, more like our, shop. After all we share it, and her mom who was an excellent cook gave it to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why...why won't you tell me the truth, it's been 2 weeks. I hate to see you in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was just another nightmare of the same thing. I don't know why I see it, but don't worry, ok?\" I told her but she just looked away, a bit hurt, so I did what my gut wanted me to do, I licked her forehead. She looked back at me, blushing redder than a tomato. \"Hey, I'll make it up tomorrow, since it is your 19th birthday, so don't worry about me!\" I told her with pure happiness and enthusiasm and a smile, I felt I lost. As I heard her chuckle, I felt her warmth. Grabbing her, I placed her in the bed, with her on my chest, as she fell asleep. Before I could sleep, I smelled that familiar cinnamon, sunshine like scent of hers. \"I won't let anyone harm you, Auroa.\" I promised her silently as I dosed off to sleep again.</span></div></div>",

Come out!\" I said as I got to a place out of the town and far away from humans, and in a forest, but for some reason I couldn't lose this one. As for being, human, I doubt it but it isn't anything I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Heh. So you've been aware to my presence. Although, you shouldn't be afraid of me.\" Out of the bushes came a man in a cloak, he didn't have any hostile aura, in fact all he had was a friendly aura around him. I let down my guard, knowing the cloaked figure. He was a rare kind of shapeshifter, in fact he was my older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell me what's the occasion? What brings the Dark Knight, Cloud, to me?\" I said turning to see my brother, who was putting the head of his cloak back, to reveal his short spiky hair, much like mine, except mine's longer and his forest green and purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You must go back, go back to town, you don't have much time. While I was following you, although I would've done this by myself, I was attacked and they put this,\" He said showing his muscular arm with a small black thing in it, \"a magical device, or other, into me. Until tomorrow, I will be unable to change or use magic or fight them. However you can, since you have pure werewolf blood. So, if given a choice to risk her life to save her or let her die, what will you do?\" As my brother told me all this, I remember the words that echoed through my mind. I knew that it had to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"....I won't let her die or get harmed!! I refuse to sit back even if I change...I will save her.\" I told him as I ran back to town, behind me I could've swore he was smiling at me. I ran as fast as I could, it becoming harder and harder with the change happening soon, but I won't let even that stop me!</span></div></div>",

They were quick, even tricked me to get away from my weapon stash and get me here. I could only think of two things while I stared into the murderous eyes that could make anyone cringe in fear of my attackers, my boyfriend and if I live, I'm gonna make sure I'm prepared if anything like this ever happens again. If I could only fight unarmed well, I could make sure I lived until help came. I didn't care who helped as long as I got to be with Kaido, I don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Too easy. You weren't even fun enough to last. Well time to clean up the trash!!\" They said as they rose their weapons in the air ready to land the final strike. I closed my eyes as I waited for the weapons to make contact since I knew having enough strength to fight, was out of the question. As I closed my eyes, I heard a deep growl and something BIG land in front of me. Time seemed to go fast while I finding any more strength to move. I opened my eyes to see blood, everywhere, and a giant wolf just turning his head. That's when I saw his eyes, deep, dark purple eyes stare at me, it felt much like Kaido's, which was confirmed after I saw his necklace. He stood there, seeing me as prey but using the remaining strength, I walked toward him, limping there and now. I could see in his eyes that he was holding himself back, and he was crying thinking things I would not know. I caressed the big wolf's neck, hugging him as I could feel him sniffing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks...honey.\" Was the last thing I said before I fell unconscious to the world.</span></div></div>",

That was until I felt a big soft, wet, kind of sticky thing cross my face. I opened my eyes just barely to see the face of a black furry wolf staring at me with eyes that said, <i>I'm sorry.</i> if not anything. I could see anger and that same 'prey' look he gave me earlier, though it felt kind of protective, than what it's suppose to feel like. That's when I saw the doctor and my best friend since we were kids somewhat near-ish when we were born, Sora, he was more of a brother if you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"'Morning Sleeping Beauty. I had a strange night so far, first your boyfriend goes to my house to get me and I find what he's truly like and then I find you near-death on his back, dying. What the fuck!? DO YOU GUYS LIKE MESSING WITH ME? I was scared to DEATH!! I may not act much like a vampire, but this...this is too much!\" Sora may have said this to me, but it was only because he treated us like family and had a big protective side. He normally would freak out more, this was the much more calmer side. Why wouldn't he be like this? His sister, me, appears on my knight who was all wild, Kaido, all bloody, dying slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"...so...rry...\" I replied weakily, shivering a bit. Which only stirred Kaido, to bring his giant body on top of mine, making sure I was compfy, warm, and can still breathe. Sora just nodded and started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Get some rest. I'm gonna go get some medical supplies. I'll be back.\" He told me as I felt myself sleep, I heard him before he left, \"I'm just glad your alive, sis.\"</span></div></div>",

In fact, more than half of this town is either werewolf or vampire, and even some half-werewolf/half-vampires live here. It wasn't hard to live here and feel as if everyone or at least some are family even if not blood-related. I have my medical equipment now, so all I have to do is get back.....<i>safely</i>. \"WATCH OUT!!! THERE'S BARRELS ON THE LOOSE!!!\" I turned to the up-hill where the voice was, to notice about 10 barrels coming my way. I crouched down preparing myself to jump when I felt the ground beneath me make my feet...sink!? Looking down I saw I found my foot in a deep puddle of super glue, that poured on my foot. I cryed silently to myself thinking, <i>I hate my luck...</i>. At least it will hit my most strongest part of my body, my side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK \"Ow.\" <i>1...</i> CRACK \"Ow.\" <i>2...</i> CRACK \"Ow.\"<i>3...</i> CRACK \"Oww...\" <i>4...</i> CRACK \"Ow.\" <i>5...</i> CRACK \"Ow.\" <i>6...</i> CRACK \"Ow.\" <i>7...</i> CRACK \"Ow.\" <i>8...</i> CRACK \"Ow.\" <i>9...</i> CRACK \"OW!\" <i>10...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Didn't see that coming! Owww~ my head it hurts~. So what is it THIS time? HMMM??\" I said mainly to myself as I finally freed myself from the glue, I looked down to see a coin in a crack in the cement standing up. \"Figures...\" I kept a nice pace, slow as it may be, my head hurt too much to go my wanted speed. It felt like ages but I could see Auroa's house in my view. I was so close I could taste--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SMACK thump</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Huh? Did...did I hit someone? OH MY--- I'm soooo sorry Doctor Hayashi!\" A wolf with snow white fur said as he got out seeing me on the ground in massive pain. That wolf also happened to be my main source for my unlucky-ness, Yuna Hayashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't...worry 'bout...it. Can you...help me...with...Auroa...I'm in so much pain....\" She just nodded as she helped me get up and go to Auroa's home.</span></div></div>",

I will tell you what I know and have learned. First of all, it all began when he has 2 years of age, dad and mom were watching us and nothing I knew would've left their eye sight. The people who might've had something to do with today, a group I still yet to figure out who it is, used these powerful magic spells to weaken our senses, magic uses, and if we weren't in our real form, sealed it. I tried to protect my family as best as I could since my brother and I couldn't have our magic or anything 'sealed'. That didn't last very long, they knocked me unconscious and used me as bait to steal him.\" She tried to say some more but she just hung her head. \"If only I had protected him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You probably did your best.\" I told her as I walked to her side, putting a hand on her shoulder. Arms wrapped around my body, as she silently let out a wave of tears. It lasted for a while until she let go staring me in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"After we found him, they've messed with his body, altering his minds, with their evil experiments. They weren't just split his minds leaving the wolf side with normal instincts...no...they locked some of his 'good' instincts inside his brain, while leaving the hunting and killing kind there. Dad did manage to fix him even just a bit, and he could tell family from targets....or prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The best thing is though...there is a way to fix him completely since they could never finish what they started.\" A voice came from the front door, we turned to see Cloud, no not Cloud Strife, although...if he was a handsome black furred &amp; haired, muscular, different colored eyed wolf right now that would totally would be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And your method of doing this?\" I said raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell them to go to Pleasant Death INC. or now known as Happy End Industries. There they will find an answer to things. I know the answers there but I can't make the trip...not yet. They might be lucky enough to find out their goals. If I find anymore information I will tell you 4. Oh and one last thing...you guys will have to go too, if you wish for even one of them to make it out alive. Good luck.\" He told us as he waved his hand, as he walked away. We looked at each other, before Yuna pulled out a coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Heads, the safest way is sneaking in. Tails, the safest way is fighting our way through. Middle, we will have no choice but to do both for us all to escape.\" Yuna told me as she spun the coin in the air, as it began it's decent and we tried to grab it, it seemed to teleport to the ground right into a crack, making it stand. \"Didn't see that coming, did you?\" She asked in shock. Only to realize I how disappointed I was. <i>Curse you Lady Luck!! WWWHHHHHYYYYYYYY????</i></span></div></div>",
