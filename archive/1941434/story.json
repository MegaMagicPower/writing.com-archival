We did since something magical about this school.\" The tour went on for full two minutes as we were headed for the lunch room. Sunset Shimmer was very kind to show us the whole school, now I needed a map for this place. \"Theres the sciene lab, band class is over there.\" I was amazed on how well every one of the students in this school were good friend then Shimmer told us \"Oh we're having a musical show case the week. Since your all new here, mabey you can sign up for it.\" I was intersted about that, then I asked \"Are you in a band, and can I join it?\" Sunset Shimmer anwered with a double yes then I took notice on the necklaces that Adagio and her friends were wearing. \"Hey, those necklaces they look good on you were did you..\" As soon as reached over too touch the ruby necklace, Adagio grabbed my arm and then...</span></div></div>",

Especially since I found my sisters.\" You don't know why but as your talking to sunset your starting to feel \"something\". You say goodbye to Sunset and head towards the Lunchroom. Your feeling warm in your heart and you don't know why. You hear singing coming from the Cafeteria and you poke your head in to see your sisters singing and everyone getting angrier and angrier. However you notice that 5 girls including Sunset are not getting angry. You want to know how they're not being infected but you already told your sisters you wanted to go alone. So you close the door as silently as you can. What you didn't know was that the girls saw you poking your head out and closing the door. \"Who was that?\" Asked Rainbow Dash. \"His name's *insertnamehere* and he's a new student along with those three girls.\" \"That necklace on him looked just like the one's those girls are wearing.\" \"Oh yeah I forgot to mention that *insertnamehere* is a brother to them.\" \"HUH?!?\" \"I get it but I think he knows what's going on with our friends. I think we should get him alone and make him tell us what's going on.\" They all agreed at that idea. Everyone was looking all over the school for you. Pinkie spotted you on the Bleachers of the Football Field. She called her friends and also you heard it. You ran as fast as you could but unfortunately you were caught by Rainbow Dash. \"Okay here now we saw you looking at your \"sisters\" in the Cafeteria. Mind telling us what they were doing to our friends?\" \"I'm never gonna tell you.\" They actually expected this to happen so they told Pinkie to give you a tickle torture until you told them everything. After a couple of minutes you finally cracked. You told them that you and your sisters were from Equestria and were planning to take over the school. As Rainbow was about to punch you Sunset stopped her. \"Why'd you do that?\" \"Because maybe he can help us.\" \"Uh why would HE help us? HE'S ONE OF THEM!!!\" \"I know that but he can still help us by telling us how to break the spell.\" However you didn't know how to break the spell. So Sunset got the idea that they should ask Princess Twilight. Sunset wrote in the book what happened and all about the new girls and you.</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless, you wandered around the halls thinking about one person, Sunset Shimmer. When you first met her, she was bullying and intimidating the other students and you didn't take to kindly to it. She then started teasing you, but you know that you can't let her taunts get to you, even though she was making your life complicating. However, you'd had noticed her sudden change of heart after the Battle of the Bands with her performing with the Rainbooms. Part of you really believed that Sunset has changed for the better, but another part of you thinks that she didn't and wants you to hate her. But you can't find it in yourself to hate her, no matter how much she'd harmed you emotionally. Afterwards though, you had seemed to be very distant from any area that involves her being there. You don't really know why, but you don't want to be away from her. It's like you want to be sitting next to her. You shook that part off and went somewhere that she can't be at. You go to the cafeteria and sit in the empty table you normally sit at. You figured that being alone is less complicated when you think about as you eat your lunch.

You cleared your throat and Sunset, along with Applejack and Rarity, turned to see you. Sunset was surprised that your right in front of her instead of hiding and you try to find the right words to say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Hey, *insert name*.\" Sunset said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sunset.\" You said also nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it been, partner?\" Applejack asked stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going good, Applejack. Good to see you. You too, Rarity.\" You said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you too, my friend.\" Rarity said nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at the two before looking at Sunset and can see a tiny bit of sadness in her eyes. It's obvious to you why because of you distance from her. You decided to take up what you and Rainbow Dash talked about before. Before you can say anything, Sunset beat you to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls? Can you two leaves us for a moment?\" Sunset asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Dear. Come along, Applejack. Let's give them their \"privacy\".\" Rarity said while winking at Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. See you two later.\" Applejack said before she and Rarity left you two alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sunset looked away from each other for a bit before you two make eye contact. You believed that this maybe is a bad idea, but it's now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are you?\" You asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You?\" Sunset wondered with the same feeling of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, *insert name*. I know you probably hate me after all of the things I did to you and everyone else here. That's why you've been avoiding me and I understand. I don't really expect any kind of forgiveness from you, anyways. I mean, who can?\" Sunset said feeling too sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was gonna say that, but you can't just let her feel this way. So, you took your hand and placed it on her shoulder. Sunset looks at you as you go try to say something to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't hate you, Sunset.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sunset asked a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know that what you did with you being a she-demon was pretty much unforgivable, but I can never hate you. The only hide myself from you because I wanted to see if you really do wanted to change like you say you do. Turns out that you did and proved me right.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset feels tears coming down her face as she jumps up and wraps her arms around you to hug you tight. She started sobbing on your shoulder as you took your hand and, gently, pats her back while she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*insert name*! You're so forgiving! Thank you so much!\" Sunset sobs while still hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Now, come on. Stop crying. You'll ruined those pretty eyes of yours.\" You said before eye-widening on what you just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was surprised when you said that and she felt touched in her heart. No boy has ever told her that since she dated Flash. But you, hearing you saying that lifted her spirits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that my eyes are pretty?\" Sunset asked while drying the tears off of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuummm. Well. You see.\" You stuttered before sighing in defeat because it looks like the cat's out of the bag. \"Yes, Sunset. The hair looks cool too.\" You commented her nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I don't know what to say. Thank you.\" Sunset said as she starts to smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Anyway, I wanted to come here to see if you want to hang out after school. You know, just the two of us.\" You said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*insert full name\". Are you asking me on a date?\" Sunset wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanted it to be?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. I'll go out with you.\" Sunset said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe that she said yes to you. Looks like things are getting better from here on out. That's when the final bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time for our last class for the day.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it is.
