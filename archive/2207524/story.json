There were plenty of exciting things on offer, from food stalls to clothing to garden essentials and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to have a look?\" Alice heard a voice croaking from just out of view. Turning to see where the voice came from, Alice noticed a decrepit old lady standing behind the counter of an all black stall. She was staring deeply at Alice, holding what looked like a necklace decorated with cheap looking gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come look!\" The old lady invited Alice \"I bet this one would look perfect on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice wasn't particularly interested in buying the necklace, so she tried to let down the old lady in the same way that she would any other stall owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'm in a bit of a hurry.\" Alice told the old lady before turning away and continuing her way through the market. The old lady scowled at Alice as she walked away, furious that her necklace was brushed off by the much younger woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph! That little minx thinks she's so much better than me! She thinks she's so pretty and important, well I'll show her!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady slammed the necklace down on the counter before quickly turning around to grab a small jar containing some sort of ointment. She then dipped the tip of her finger into the jar before drawing it back out and pointing an ointment covered fingernail in the direction of Alice. With a flick of said finger, a droplet of the ointment was sent flying across the market like a speeding bullet until it splash landed on the back of Alice's ________.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph! We'll see how pretty you are once my magic ointment sets in!\" The old lady cackled at her handiwork.</span></div></div>",

It started off as just a dull pain, a bit like a light headache, but as the day went on it became more acute and created a burning sensation in her spine near the base of her neck. She assumed that she must have pulled a muscle at some point, so she decided to do some neck exercises to help ease the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sat down on her sofa and began rotating her neck, first clockwise then anti-clockwise. As she started to loosen up a bit, she turned her neck left then right. Left then right. The pain was slowly fading so she looked up then down. Up then down. It was at this point where Alice could no longer feel the burning in her neck but instead a tingling numbness that quickly spread across her entire body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice looked up once more, but as she looked down again her head slipped right off of her neck! It bounced from her lap before hitting the floor and rolling across the room. Alice was confused. Everything happened so fast that she didn't know how she ended up on the floor. She quickly came to the assumption that she had collapsed somehow, but she couldn't understand why. She noticed that her body was now completely numb below the neck and she began to panic that she had been paralysed somehow. Alice didn't realise that her fate was far stranger than she could have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's attention soon came back to the sofa where she was shocked to see her own headless body still sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! That's me!!\" Alice screamed. \"Where is my head!? What happened to my head!?\" She questioned as her mind frantically tried to make sense of what she was seeing. In that moment of panic and confusion, Alice failed to understand that she was perceiving all of this from her head's perspective. Her eyes darted around the room until she caught a glimpse of something in the corner. There in the mirror she saw the reflection of her own severed head on the floor. Alice shrieked in absolute terror, the reflection mimicked her perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 minutes on the floor, Alice began to calm down after realising that her life wasn't at any immediate risk in spite of her surprise decapitation. Having had some time to think, she managed to piece together a rough timeline of what happened: She had a pain in her neck, she started doing some neck exercises to ease the pain, during those exercises her head fell off somehow and now she was a severed head on the floor with no connection to her body. Alice tried to come up with a plan to fix this, but the best she could realistically come up with all involved waiting for someone to find her.</span></div></div>",

She made attempts to call out to it in hopes that somehow she would regain control or it respond somehow. But even then she knew it was pointless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I even alive right now? Shouldn't I be dead? There's no blood on my neck, it's just skin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the waiting and the existential crisis. she began to think how this could've happened. She remembered the feeling the numbness as soon as she got home from the market, but nothing came to her mind as to what could've caused this in her own home. Then she thought that perhaps it something at the market. But all she could remember doing was sprawling around the kiosks and shops that were open. \"Maybe it was something I touched or come into contact with? Or maybe...\" Alice then began to remember that old woman she saw last, and although she didn't see her for long, something did feel a little off from her. \"Ugh who am I kidding, I'm in no condition to look for answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass as she keeps thinking to herself about her condition and eventually falls asleep. It's now, 9:30pm. Alice is then abruptly woken as she hear's a knocking at her door followed by a familiar voice.</span></div></div>",

I'm right here!\" Alice called to her body from across the room. Surprisingly, that actually worked as Alice's body somehow heard the cries from her head.

Alice watched as her body pick her up her head, sit it down on the floor in front of her. While her body laid back, slightly upright and continued playing with her breasts in one hand and stroking her crotch with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, never have taken any serious liking to girls in general, couldn't help but notice how nice her breasts looked and how hot it looked to see her hands down on her own pussy from her new perspective. \"Ugh can you please...stop seriously\" She didn't want to admit that she was enjoying this, as she tried to divert her eyes from her body and hide herself from moaning underneath her breath. Suddenly, Alice hear's a knocking at the door. She recognizes the voice as her one of her close friends from work, Michelle. \"Alice you in there? You were supposed to give me a ride to work today?*Knock* *knock* Hello??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get her body stop and cover up her situation so she could answer the door, her body continued to sit their and masturbate. Alice's head, at the mercy of her own body found it harder to turn her gaze away from her hands could do nothing but sit their and watch as her body kept rubbing her own pussy faster and faster, inserting a few fingers at time to increase the pleasure. \"Body please stop! Please put some clothes on and...more...importantly put me back on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding it difficult to find a response, Michelle goes around back to check if Alice is home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice found it harder and harder for her to get her body to pay attention to her now. And although she didn't want to admit it, but she was extremely turned on at this point, despite not feeling any of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body continues to masturbate faster and faster, Michelle makes her way to the back and looks through a window only to see inside what is unfolding between Alice's disembodied head and her headless body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD! ALICE? WHAT THE FUCK?\" Michelle gasps from outside the window at the sight of Alice's condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's eyes jut towards the window to see her friend staring in awe, while her body also turns her neck towards the window witnessing Michelle's reaction, but still continues to play with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit (under her breath). Michelle...Michelle!\" All Michelle could do was look at Alice's body masturbate while grasping her breasts. \"Michelle please just look at me. I know this is really fucking freaky, but I need help.\" Michelle continued to stand there as Alice's body knelt up, trying to catch Michelle's gaze and continued to put on a show for Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I swear I have no control over any of this.

Please!!\" Her plea snapped her body out of it's trance for the first time since it left her on the floor.

It's the same for me, and I don't blame you for wanting to explore your independence or the sensations of not having a head. But we can't stay like this! We need to stay together &amp; find a way to reverse this.\" Alice tried to convince her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body slowly approached her head, kneeling down infront of it. Alice's head stared up from the floor at her body towering over her. Her exposed breasts hanging just inches from her face. She thought about how she had never seen them from this perspective before. She imagined that this must be what her previous partners saw whenever they had sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of her daydream, Alice focused on her body's neck stump. The area she had been attached to just minutes ago and that she would like to return to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work with me, body. Please, we can fix this together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body reached out, picking her head from the floor and holding it at arms length. Alice's head felt her right thumb lightly stroke her cheek as her former hands cradled her. Then without warning, Alice's body brought her head in close for a hug, thrusting her between her breasts. Alice struggled to breath as her face was completely smothered by her former chest. In spite of this, Alice secretly enjoyed the sensation of her squishy glands engulfing most of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's body would eventually retract her head from her chest before it suffocated. It then carried her over to the couch where it layed out a cushion for her head to rest on. Alice's head was relieved not only to be off the floor, but that her body was finally acknowledging her again. They could finally get to work on solving their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's faith in her body was unfortunately ill-placed however as the body would soon grab the house keys from the table and head for the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where are you going!?\" Panic began to set in for Alice's head. With her body no longer in sight, she relied on her hearing to paint the rest of the picture. Alice was filled with dredd as she heard the rattling of keys followed by the sound on the front door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!! You can't go out there! You're still naked!! Come back!! You can't just leave me here!!!\" Alice screamed from the couch, but once again her body ignored her cries. As Alice's body began wandering down the street, her head began to wonder if her body had understood anything that she had previously said.</span></div></div>",

But, since it was such a lovely day out, she decided that the home she went back to didn't necessarily have to be the tiny little one window apartment she begrudgingly called home.  Instead, she texted her good, and significantly more affluent, friend Julia.  Julia was some sort of architect, though the exact nature of her work was so far above Alice's head that she'd stopped trying to understand it a long time ago, and had built herself a lovely house with a large patio perfect for lounging around and sunbathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hey, I'm bored and in dire need of a tan.  Cool if I drop by to hang in your backyard?</i>\"  Alice texted, knowing her friend well enough that when she made it back to her car she'd already started driving to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes of driving later, and about halfway to Julia's house, Alice got a reply.  \"<i>Sure but you'll have to provide your own rope</i>\"  Alice rolled her eyes at Julia's dark joke.  Alice continued her drive, and while she noticed a slight ache in the small of her back she didn't put much thought into it.  Her car's seats were all decrepit old crap with more lumps and hard spots than the surface of the moon, and while she could usually ignore it there were definitely times when they made her back hurt.  She simply assumed that this was one of those times, and continued driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up to the beautiful two story house in the suburbs that Julia had designed herself, Alice saw her friend standing on the balcony over her front door and waving jovially.  \"So, which tree are you planning to hang from?  The apple's got thicker branches, but I think the peach tree may be a little taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure yet, I'll have to sleep on it.  Preferably while sleeping on your patio.\"  Alice answered, walking around the side of her friend's house to her back yard rather than going through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya mooch!\"  Julia called with an uncharacteristic New Jersey accent (a state she wasn't from and had never been to) as Alice disappeared around the side of her house, a long running joke from their college days  that everyone in their friend circle threw around when they did one another a favor.  Disappearing into her home, Julia changed out of her pajamas (she worked almost entirely from home, so pajamas constituted 80% of her wardrobe) and into a cute little bikini to join her friend in sunbathing.  While Julia skin was naturally more tanned than Alice's due to her Hispanic heritage, she had been cooped up for a little too long working on her projects and could certainly use some bronzing.  Looking herself over in the mirror, she also realized she should probably start jogging again, as her hips had plumped up and a little pot belly had sprouted from her abdomen despite Julia's very light eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off her negative thoughts, Julia pulled on a pair of flip flops and made her way to her back yard, where her paler and lither friend was already stretched out on a fully reclined lounge chair wearing a comically large pair of black sunglasses.  \"What, you get a job with the Men in Black now?\"  Julia teased, lightly slapping the side of thigh with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, though I did meet an alien today.\"  Alice said, lazily trying to swat her friend's hand away even after she'd stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, white girl, I'm third generation American!\"  Julia said, laying herself on the seat beside her friend and reclining the back until it was almost flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant at the market.\"  Alice said, rolling her eyes behind her glasses.  \"I was out shopping, and there was this tiny old lady, like, 'had more wrinkles than face' old.  Anyway, old lady was selling handmade jewelry at a stall that I had never seen before and I'm 99% sure wasn't even supposed to be there.  The jewelry was really chintzy stuff, with like fake gems and weird made up symbols carved into it and stuff, and you know I'm not Ms. Rockefeller like you so I didn't feel like spending some of my slave wages on her crap.  I tried to let her down easy, but granny wasn't having it.  As I'm walking away, this old coot slams down the necklace and starts muttering to herself, like she's trying to invoke the dark lord Satan or something to come up and smite me.  Super weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds more like a witch than an Alien.\"  Julia said, closing her eyes as the sun's rays bore down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.  Whatever it was, it was weird.\"  Alice said, closing her eyes.  She smiled, the warmth of the sun against her skin easing the pain in her back.  \"You know, most hosts would've offered their guests a drink when they arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia chuckled.  \"You know, most friends wouldn't show up at someone else's home unannounced and then start demanding things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I announced!\"  Alice replied, vaguely motioning in the direction of her phone which neither woman could see with their eyes closed.  \"And I'm not demanding anything.  Just saying that a drink would be nice, and that since we live in a society you're kind of socially obligated to provide one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya mooch!\"  Julia responded, making a grand show pressing her butt as firmly into her chair as was humanly possible before sighing deeply and pretending to be asleep.  Alice and Julia sat in silence for a long while, and while Julia only pretended to doze off for the sake of her joke, Alice really did fall into a pleasant nap.  After fifteen minutes, Julia realized that \"Dammit, I actually am a little thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, she went back into her house and started rummaging around in her refrigerator, trying to pick a weather appropriate drink.  She settled on a nice cold glass of lemonade, spiked with a little vodka, and prepared a glass for Alice in case she woke up.  Returning to the patio, Julia saw...</span></div></div>",

I swear, my car seats must be stuffed with gravel and wood chips or something, it has jacked me up!  I have got to get it replaced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a hearty glug of her own spiked lemonade, Julia set the drinks down on the table between her and Alice's seat and sat down beside her friend.  \"Wow, first you demand drinks and now you're trying to guilt me into paying for car repairs?  Sometimes it feels like you're only friends with me for the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia, you know I wasn't suggesting that.\"  Alice said, rolling her eyes even though they couldn't be seen.  \"Besides, I like you for so much more than your money!  You give great backrubs, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christo, you really are the worst friend ever!\"  Julia said, laughing as Alice wiggled her lower back and butt at her.  Despite never giving anyone a back rub before at any point, Julia leaned over and began rubbing her hands into her friend's lower back, jokes mattering more than sense or reason in their social circle.  She dug her fingers deeply into her friend's flesh, trying her best to make the massage as unpleasant as possible to tease her whinging friend.  Alice responded in kind by producing some over the top and overly sexual moans, arching her back and squeezing her butt cheeks together as she did so.  Julia and Alice both laughed, Alice a light and rapid chuckle and Julia a snorting wheeze more befitting a teenaged stoner boy than a grown businesswoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed, right up until Julia's fingers slipped through the surface of Alice's skin.  Both women abruptly stopped, a silence thick enough to touch hanging in the air.  When Alice peered over her shoulder, and Julia dared to look down, the two women saw that the tips of Julia's fingers were, indeed, embedded inside Alice's skin.  What's more, a thin white line was stretching around the circumference of Alice's waist, a ridge forming in her flesh.  Julia withdrew her hand, and Alice tried to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sound of tape getting yanked off a wall, Alice's body split in half at the navel, her torso collapsing onto the lounge chair while her legs toppled backwards and tumbled onto the patio.  \"WHAT THE FUCK?!\"  Julia screamed, clasping a hand to her mouth as she watched her friend come apart.  \"...what the fuck?\"  She whispered, noticing that Alice's bisection was completely bloodless, and in fact the surface where her two halves had once connected was covered in a layer of skin, like any other part of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping herself onto her back, Alice stared down at her abbreviated body horror.  Feeling her stump, shock switched to confusion as she learned the same thing that Julia had already noticed.  Looking over the foot of the lounge chair at her severed lower half, Alice realized that...</span></div></div>",

Along with her best friend's perky ass and legs having detached from her torso, Julia's hands were still grasping the plushy asscheeks of said ass.  Worse, Julia currently had her hands up to her face in horror.  Or, rather, she held her bloodless, skin covered stumps up to her mouth.  She was at a loss for words, unable to parse what was happening, unable to accept this freakshow in what she had assumed was her mundane suburban life.  She was snapped back to reality by a noise.  A shriek, and then a moan.  Julia turned to look at her friend, the top half of her anyway, as she bit her lip and her eyes shot daggers at Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop doing that!\" Alice hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing wh- Oh my god, what the hell am I doing!\" Julia gasped as she looked back the butt.  She could feel it, the smoothness, the heat, the wet insides of her friends ass and pussy as her detached hands dug into and diddled the separated bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-i-it's not me Alice!  I'm not doing that!  <i>Carajo!</i> H-how is this even happening anyways!\" she said as a blush lit up face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moan.  \"I don't know, but if you don't stop finger banging me I'm gonna -<i>gasps</i>- I'm gonna lose my mind!\"  Alice said, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her friend's best interests in mind, Julia putt aside her horrific condition and made to grab the hands with her stumps.  Suddenly, Alice's legs reared back and leapt off the chair!  The y landed with surprising grace and began to run in a random direction.  \"Alice, bring your legs back here!\" Julia shouted as she rose from her seat to begin chase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I!  I can't control them!\" she wailed as the legs slammed into the wooden fence that surround the yard.  \"Ooohh, \" she moaned, \"Julia you gotta catch, them, I mean me.  Your hands are going deep-<i>ah</i>!\" she gasped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was already about to pounce on the legs when they ducked under her and bolted in another direction.  They were heading for the gate this time.  Julia pushed off the gate with her stumps and dashed after the curvy legs.  The left leg's toes had just about undone the latch when made a mad dive for the legs and tackled them to the ground.  They kicked and thrashed, but Julia's upper body strength was enough to hold of vice grip around Alice's knees.  The position was awkward, with Alice's detached legs bum shoved in her face, and not to mention she could feel her hand on her face and in Alice moving around.  never the less she managed to wrestle the struggling lower half over to the garage and kick open the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Alice, help me out!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what?  I have no legs!\" came her retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have no fucking hand <i>chica</i>, now <i>vamonos</i>!\" she said as she entered the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nON shaky hands, and with no other options, Alice pushed herself up in the chair on her arms.  She found that she was surprisingly light like this, although it quickly made sense since more than half her body weight was now in her best friend's arms.  The constant stimulation of her nethers wasn't helping, but she managed to construct a sort of fall/hop/walk that got her upper half over and into the garage.  Julia was on the ground, pinning down Alice's rouge legs.  She motioned with her head for Alice to grab the pile of bungee cords in a box next to her.  Alice reached up and locked the door, which was thankfully a turn lock and probably not too easy to open with toes.  She hopped over to the bungee cords and began to tie up her legs.  Once she wrapped what had to be at least twenty or so cords in varying methods around her struggling legs, the girls set about retrieving the horny hands from Alice's rouge rear.</span></div></div>",

She pulled and the one in her ass came out easily enough, but the one in her snatch was a fighter.  Julia's right hand first tried to wriggle itself deeper into Alice's snatch, then it tugged on her short hairs causing Alice to cry out in pain.  In a last ditch attempt the right hand firmly gripped her bikini and yanked it off as Alice finally pulled the offending digits away form her lower half.  She flung the hands into a clear plastic box nearby and quickly slammed the lib over it.  The hands scrambled aimlessly around the box like fleshy spiders, searching for escape, but the lid was more than secure.  With the hands dealt with and the legs tied up, the two breathed a sigh of relief and visibly relaxed, or at least as relaxed as someone could be in such a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Julia, you have to tell me what the hell is going on here...\" Alice said, not without a hint of accusation in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  I don't know what the hell is going on!\", Julia replied indignantly.  \"This is some <i>magia</i> shit or something...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, you didn't do it?  You were the one massaging my ass when this happened.  Who's to say you didn't use some magic or whatever bullshit to pop it off?  And, and!  Not to mention your hands immediately went to fondling me!\"  she said with a fierce blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was taken aback, but tried her best to soothe her friend's misguided anger.  \"Alice, listen.  When I have I ever shown you any occult crap?  Or done a magic trick?  You've known me practically your whole life.  And besides, why on earth would I remove my own hands and decide the best thing to do diddle you with them?\"  <i>Not that it didn't seem like you hated it, nor did I for that matter...</i>, she thought to herself.  She pointed the stump of her right wrist to the clear box, which was very slowly shuffling around the garage as the hands continued to look for a way out.  \"I'm not doing any of that.  I can feel everything, but that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice grimaced, \"Ugh, you're right.  I'm sorry, that was fucked up of me to say, especially when I at least still have my hands and all.\"  She placed a hand on her writhing legs and sighed, \"Now that you mention it too, I really can't control my legs at all, it's like they have a mind of their own.\"  She pulled the askew bikini panties up back over her drooling crotch, \"And, it, uh, seems like my pussy is going haywire too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia coughed nervously, \"So.  I think there's only really one thing we can do right now.\"  Alice nodded and hand walked around her legs so that the flat expanse of the bottom of her torso lined up with the flat top of her hips and pressed.  There was a soft sucking feeling, like a vacuum tugging at your skin, and she watched as the two halves of her melded into one again.  ALice let out a shaky sigh of relief as she found herself in control of her legs again.  She began to undo the straps around her legs when Julia stopped her by placing a stump on her shoulder.  \"Wait,  how do we know your legs won't just come off again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice felt a chill run down her spin at the though, but pushed it to the back of her mind for the time being.  \"W-well, I think if I dont't push or pull my legs I should be ok.  See. I can make my legs move, I am in control.\" she said as she wiggled her toes.  Julia gave her a look but shrugged and let Alice continue to take off the bungee cords.  She stood up, still a little unsure as it felt that at any moment she would taken in whatever direction her legs felt like running.  But they didn't and they obeyed her commands like they always did.  She then walked over to the box with hands in it, more confident than she was just a moment ago.  She quickly lifted the corner of the lid and pulled out the right hand.  \"Ew, you're gonna have to really wash these after we're done.  You still have <i>me</i> on you,,\" she said averting her eyes from the lewd fingers wriggling in her grasp.  Julia dutifully held up her stump and Alice placed the struggling hand on the bare wrist.  Just like Alice the skin seemed to fuse on contact.  Immediately the hand stopped fidgeting as Julia regained control of it.  The other hand was next and soon Julia was whole once more.  Sheepishly she washed her hands in the sink in the corner of the garage, then returned to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that was weird as hell,\" she said, not quite looking at Alice as her eyes kept wandering back to her hands, more than a little worried that they might start acting on their own again.  \"You want to stay the night and get drunk as hell while we try to puzzle out what happened?\"  Alice just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night wore on, the two ended up passed out on the couch while \"Are you still watching?\" Netflix popup was displayed on the TV.  Alice had fallen asleep on Julia's lap with a blanket covering her body.  There was movement.  A light kick.  A rustling.  A sock covered foot peeked out form underneath the blanket like a snake.  Her legs soon followed and was then met by her other leg joining it outside the comfort of the blanked.  there was a soft tearing sound, like tape being peeled off o plastic as her legs went completely horizontal to her torso.  Silently, carefully, Alice's lower half slipped out from under the blanket and crept around the room.  They crept around, still fairly unaware of their environment, but smart enough to know to keep quite.  or pretend to be under their previous owner's control long enough to escape.  The half tip-toed across the floor, freezing anytime they came into contact with a table leg or rouge shoe on the floor.  Eventually they hit a wall and instead of slamming into it, followed the wall until it's hips hit door knob.  The hips rubbed against it, seemingly feeling it out and then the right leg lifted and pushed down on the knob.  It turned and door slowly swung open, eliciting a low creek.  The legs froze, feeling the vibration of the sound on its skin.  When nothing seemed to happen, the legs slipped out and began to run down the street towards the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the two awoke to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They purposefully gave her stall a wide berth, averted their gaze when the old woman tried to speak to them, and after a few minutes of no one giving her the time of day, the old woman slumped down on her stool in defeat.  Alice sighed, realizing that she'd been probably been the only person who'd even spoken a word to the old woman all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice checked her wallet, and with another heavy sigh she approached the old woman and her stall again.  Putting on her friendliest face and most chipper voice, Alice waved to the old lady and said \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you.  What do you want?\"  The old woman said, her voice bitter but her eyes strangely self satisfied.  As though she were clued in on a funny joke that Alice was completely oblivious to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about earlier, I didn't mean to seem rude or anything. I double checked, and it turns out I actually do have a few minutes to browse, and I'd like to see some of the jewelry you have for sale.\"  Alice said, sticking to her previous story.  Shuffling the scant handful of bills in her wallet, Alice asked \"Do you have anything for twenty five dollars or less?  I haven't done my grocery shopping yet, and I can't spend more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman looked at Alice, puzzled and a little guilty.  Sure, she had definitely lied earlier about being busy, and going out of her way to explain her buying limit without being asked to made her seem a bit self righteous and smug, but she had still come back, and was still offering to buy some merchandise.  \"I... uh... yes, I have some things in that price range.\"  The woman said, taking some necklaces and a few pairs of earrings from the shelf behind her and setting them out for Alice to observe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Alice said, looking over the handmade jewelry.  \"They're very pretty.\"  She lied, though her smile was genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

But what if she bought something cheap?  Her scowl grew more wrinkled and she had to turn away lest the girl see her grimacing.  The witch honored good behavior as much as anything, but in equal measure she loathed cheapskates.  And her magical curios were already bargain bin prices!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the witch struggled with her own moral failings and obligations, Alice perused the collection of weird and apparently arcane trinkets and curios.

It was a singular earring with a oddly shaped purple stone with several very small runes etched into it,  embedded in the front, mounted on a silver band. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is that one?\" Alice asked, genuinely interested in the item. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch looked at the earring, and tamped down her look of disappointment so it wouldn't show.

Alice pulled into the parking lot of her apartment complex, a new building in the downtown area and very popular for people her age.  As she got out of the car she nearly tripped.  Ever since she had left the market her legs had been feeling funny, tingly and slow to respond.  She passed it off as nothing more than fatigue from walking around so much and pushed the thought to the back of her mind.  Walking to the elevator was something of a challenge with Alice walking as if she had just finished a marathon, legs limply plopping along as she nearly dragged herself to the call button for the door.  She punched it and waited, back slumped against the wall to prevent her from falling on her unsteady legs.  <i>Geez, did I really walk that much?</i>, she thought, <i>Guess I'll run a bath once I get home, maybe that'll help relieve the fatigue in my legs.</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rode the elevator in relative silence, reading some news articles off her phone as she waited for the doors to open on her floor.  There was a ding and soon she was off toward her apartment.  On the way there she nearly fell twice, once slamming into the wall and another time grasping a door handle to steady herself.  Finally she reached her door and fumbled for the keys.  The door opened and she all but fell into her apartment.  She couldn't believe how tired her legs had become, they were almost unresponsive.  Quickly she closed the door, not bothering to lock it since since she trusted her neighbors.  She hobbled over to the bathroom and began to quickly strip as she let the water run until how.  The tub was nearly halfway full by the time she had finished undressing, so Alice slumped down next to the tub and began to fiddle with the earring to take it off too.  \"Huh?\" she gasped softly, \"It won't come off?\"  Try as she might she couldn't seem to get the earring loose.  \"Hmm, must be busted.  Glad I didn't spend too much to make that old lady happy.\"  She looked at the filled tub of hot water, ready for her to soak in.  \"I can deal with this thing later...,\" she said as she pulled herself into the bathtub.  She let out a contended sigh of relief as the warmth enveloped her.  It seemed to be doing the trick, as a couple of minutes later her legs begin to feel better as well and the tingling had stopped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice lay back in the tub, her head propped up by a towel as she enjoyed the sensation of the water.  She closed her eyes, almost feeling like she could take a nap right there, when she heard a splashing sound.  She opened her eyes and saw the strangest thing;  her feet were kicking in the tub.  Not that that in itself was strange, but what struck her as odd was that she wasn't consciously doing it.  Her legs were moving all on their own.  \"What th-?\" she began to say, but was cut off as her mouth dipped underwater.  She had sunk into the water by several inches, which was accompanied by a slight sensation of falling.  She pushed up on the sides of the tub, not quite registering why it felt easier than usual, and brought her chin back above the water line.  Her legs had finished playfully splashing and were now rocking from side to side.  Suddenly, her legs, and in fact he retire lower half rolled over so that her butt was facing the ceiling.  But the upper half of Alice stayed as she was.  Alice felt a scream rising in her throat as her confusion and terror began to intersect.  The legs, her legs, pushed on the floor and got to their knees.  As her hips and butt crested the water Alice could see that, somehow, she had been split in half.  Rather than blood and guts, where there should have been a grotesque cross section of Alice's organs was a very fresh looking patch of unblemished skin.  And, it most certainly was her lower half.  The little heart cluster of hearts tattooed on the left of her crotch confirmed that.  \"Oh my god!  What the- w-what the hell!\" she screamed as the legs stood all the way up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alice's legs jumped out of the tub, wet and buck naked, and made a b-line for the bathroom door.  Alice shrieked in confusion and lunged at her rogue legs...</span></div></div>",

The curse doesn't take effect until hours later, at which point her affected body part/parts magically detach from the rest of her body. Her separated parts remain alive. She loses all feeling and control of her detached parts as they gain their own sentience.<br>\r\nThe now sentient body parts having lost connection to the head that commands them soon become beings driven by pure instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Once a part has been detached, Alice can no longer feel or control it.<br>\r\n- All detached parts gain sentience eventually, but it doesn't need to be immediate.<br>\r\n- The Old Witch or others like her can undo the curse if they please, though they may choose not to.<br>\r\n- Though all detached parts are sentient, their ability to think for themselves will be limited. They will rely more on raw instinct.<br>\r\n</td>",
