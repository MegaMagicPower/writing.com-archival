After her meeting with the mysterious cloaked man and hearing of the turmoil in the Realm of Light, she sought to return in order to aid Sora and save her dear friends, as well as the other worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time and effort, the man helped her to construct a raft, hoping that she might sail to a doorway and return to save him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sometime adrift, she did indeed come to an island, one secluded and far away. In this realm of Darkness, Aqua wondered what would be inside. All the young keyblade master could do was trust the light within her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she entered, she saw a number of keyblades, all of them sheathed within pedestals. To each keyblade, there was a corresponding door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua marvelled at the place, wondering what it was. Perhaps it was a remnant of the keyblade war.<br>\r\nBefore long, she found an inscription upon the walls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018You who have sailed here, drifting upon the sea, seeking the path home,<br>\r\nYour destination lies ahead, though your voyage be long,<br>\r\nMany are the paths that lead ahead, many are the trials you face,<br>\r\nA chosen course is a chosen change, though will it change your heart within?<br>\r\nMany who are lost have allowed themselves to flow through this place like water.<br>\r\nWater, pure and reflective of the sun's light,<br>\r\nor water, tainted and murky as dark depths,<br>\r\nAdvance forth, your destiny chosen,<br>\r\nThough how you arrive is yours to decide,<br>\r\nYou who have arrived from a far shore, welcome to the Vault of Forbidden Keys.<br>\r\nChoose your door, choose your path\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little choice, Aqua looked about the hall at the collection of weapons. It seemed to stretch on forever in either direction, and she had no idea if other corridors or paths existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Aqua began to speak to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich Keyblade will I choose?\u201d</div></span></div></div>",
