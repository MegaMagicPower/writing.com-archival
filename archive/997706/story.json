The pilot miraculously dodged the giant peaple and guided the plane successfully onto the coffe table beetween a bowl of cocktail souseges and a bowl of crisps. The tiny terrified passengers crowded round the plane and were shocked when they did the calculations.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the the situation sunk into the doctor, he started to assume his grumpiness and cockiness. He was a person not a plaything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please put me down!\" yelled the doctor. He was too good for such treatment especially by a mere teenager. Who did she think she was? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" spoke the huge beautiful lips about double the size as the doctor as they formed an evil grin. He could feel the wind of the breath blow him back him forth as he was absorbed into her cheery breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is almost too easy, thought the doctor, but before he could figure out what was going on, he felt himself being carried away from the plane and shoe box to the edge of the sofa that they stood on. He looked down to what looked like the edge of a cliff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down you go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" he tried to insist, but it was too late. He was dropped for what seemed like forever, a drop of about 400 feet from his perspective, and landed onto the soft but firm carpet. He tried to get up but realized that both his legs were broken by impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for, you bitch?!\" He shouted, not realizing his place quite yet. \"Help me up now. I can't move.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and looked over at the woman towering above him. He could see the toes that were each about as big of him and attached to them two feet each the size of a house. He continued to look up and saw the trunks of her ankles and legs, which would have made a redwood at Yosemite seem small. He saw a waist, which seemed like a mile above, and continued to look up to see her stomach and giant melons, each bigger than a mansion. Then he had to cringe his neck to make out the giant face that was just so near, now seemed a long ways away, and that evil grin beaming down at him. He stood in fear, completing regretting swearing at her like he just did. He was scared out his wits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she said, feigning pleasantness. \"I'll help you up. Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe effortlessly lifted up her massive foot and put it on top of him. With his broken legs, he was unable to run away. She grabbed one of his broken legs with her big toes and hoisted him into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" he screamed in agony as his entire body weight was supported by his already broken leg. She paid no attention to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and saw that he was like 50 feet off the ground, from his perspective, maybe only a foot or two from hers. Then the grip on his toe was loosened, causing him to slip. He screamed as he fell back down to the ground and landed head first on the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry. I must have let go by accident!\" she innocently exclaims letting out a playful giggle. \"Here let me try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped my by accident, my ass, the doctor thought. He wanted to say that to the girl but was far to afraid. He tried to shout, \"No, you don't need to try to pick me up,\" but with his face being smashed into the carpet, it was muffled and never came out. It was doubtful that she would have listened to him anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, he felt her foot come on top of him as he was picked up. This time it was by the face, which gave him less pain than being picked up by his broken legs, but he couldn't see and could barely breath as his face was compressed into her big toe. Even though he could barely breath, he was perfectly able to take in the stench of her foot, almost making him want to puke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, after she had picked him up to a good height, she \"accidentally\" let go and dropped him onto the carpet. This time he landed on his broken legs and felt like the few bones in his leg that didn't brake after his first fall were surely broken now. This was repeated several times to the delight of the teenage girl until the doctor could barely breath. Each time he was picked up either by his broken legs or his head. Each had their share of discomforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he shouted up to her. \"I don't think you'll be able to pick me up. Thanks anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, I'm so sorry. I thought I could. Well I tried,\" she replied. So all I had to do was ask her and she'll stop, the doctor thought, well this was too easy. He was suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess if you can't be helped up. You have no chance of survival.You must be put out of your misery.\" She pretended to sound sympathetic. She winked with her pretty, large eyes down at him and then smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! That's not what I meant,\" the doctor protested, but she wasn't listening. He saw her foot loom above him and lower on top of him. She put pressure on him, causing considerable pain. He shouted \"Stop! Stop! Please!\" But she didn't. She slowly increased the pressure until it felt like his organs were about to explode. Then suddenly she released the pressure. Her foot was still directly above him, just not pushing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do this,\" she said as if she wasn't enjoying it. \"I'm too much of a wimp to do what needs to be done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't then!\" the doctor replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know. I don't want to kill you,\" she answered pretending that he was pleading for her to kill him. \"But for you sake I just go to suck it up and do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to shout back, but her foot started to put pressure on him again, and he could barely breathe. Like before she kept on increasing pressure, but then right before his body exploded, she released him and state that she can't go through with this, and then \"try again\" to kill him in just another moment. She repeated this again and again. She was having so much fun toying with her plaything, much to his discomfort as he was smashed over and over again until he felt like his body couldn't take much anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after what seemed like hours of such torture, he couldn't take it anymore. He realized that he wasn't going to make it alive anyways, so he might as well just end it here. As she took one of her I-can't-do-it breaks, he said, \"Okay. Just get it over with!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face, which was just pretending to be sad and regretful instantly turned happy as if the confirmation she had been waiting for all along had just come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay. I just realized that I didn't need to kill you just because of a broken leg and that you'd probably survive the pain, but if you want put out of your misery.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could respond, her foot came charging down on him, and he was no more than a stain on her carpet and foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at the plane full of terrified plane passengers who had just watched the entire ordeal. She reached her hand into the plane. There was utter panic in the plane. She heard screams of fear and saw the desperate passengers trying to hide from her clawing fingers. Their attempts mostly failed, and she easily clasped her hands around four more captors. She hoisted them to her face and smiled as she saw their terrified expressions. </span></div></div>",

Loretta laughed. \"Do I scare you?\" she asked kindly. \"Oh my. Maybe this can cheer you up\" Loretta left the field of view and seconds later she was back again. Suddenly there was the giant plane. It was the greatest plane that the humankind ever build and she could hold it with one hand. \"Isn't it nice?\", she asked. \"It seems a little broken, but I think I can fix it\" She smiled again at the little people. Then the plane dissapeared again. Seconds later the cardbox started to move. \"So, come on babies\" The box tilted to the side and all the people fell out more or less unhurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey where lying on a hard brown surface. To their left was a giant column rising into the sky and a platform blocked out the sight to the ceiling. It was a table, but so big... to their right was a fluffy Mountain. It was a couch. A little more to the right where two gigantic brown columns at the sofa. Two monstrous feet held them. One foot was almost as big as the plane. It was unbelievable how big she was.

Then Lisa, one of the white girls, suggested to play some beach volleyball. they agreed and headed for a spot near them. There was a little garbage there, but nothing to worry about. Very little pieces of cloth or something like that and other small stuff. There was also a broken plane dug into the sand. They knew what happened and that there are some tiny people running around on the ground around the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey Stacie, shall we put the micros aside?

Jennifer is Asian, and Tasha is white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa you do not have 'petite' feet,\" laughed Stacie. \"Your feet are HUGE girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see what the micros think,\" she giggled and trod on some of the scurrying creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown at ground level, all hell broke loose when the gigantic one and a half kilometer tall blonde tossed the plane aside killing everyone on board. The paralysed fear which had held everyone still since the arrival of these terrifying beings broke and people began to run, screaming and shouting as her building sized foot settled next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy grabbed his girfriend's arm and pulled her with him as they ran full pelt away from the killer giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" she kept repeating, \"There were PEOPLE in there, Andy! People!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Andy and Emily ran across the dunes, the sound of huge voices came down from above like thunder. The going was difficult on the rough pebbly sand dunes and the fleeing crowds were becomming spread out. Andy barely stopped his panicking girl from falling several times, until he himself fell, tumbling head over heels down the dune they'd just crested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting dust, he looked up and saw a group of five just ahead. He recognised, a cabin girl from the flight who'd served him a vaguely warm can of beer. She was thin and quite attractive when she smiled genuinely rather than automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened in an instant and nobody saw it coming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a blast of wind, the sky was blotted out and then something like a white building slammed down on them. The force made Andy see stars and he heard a familiar voice scream his name as he seemed to find himself on the same ground but in a space with pale walls left and right, filling his vision. The earth was writhing and he was sliding. Pebbles and rocks collapsed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily screamed as the immense bare foot landed on them. It simply buried the rest, but Andy was between two huge toes and as the dune collapsed beneath her she saw the foot sink into the sand, the dune she was on flowed into the gaps between the toes burying her boyfriend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was so big she had covered the distance to them before they could react. They had been between two of them; running from one, straight towards another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          ********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood, one foot planted firmly on the tiny 'mants', as she thought of them, enjoying the feel of the soft sand between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa!\" yelled Jennifer, still holding her bucket, \"Why did you do that? We were still talking about them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long limbed brunette turned to look down at the smaller girl, her slender toes bulldozing through the sand, heedless of Andy and Emily or the dozens of other tiny people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just showing you all you need to know about them. You and Alisha are new here, but after you've been here a while you'll be more interested in volleyball too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" chipped in Stacie, \"They started turning up here when we were little kids. There's loads of 'em. I guess it might be interesting to you people but if you grow up with something you just kinda accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisha was squatting over hers now. \"I read about it, but I didn't really believe it,\" she said. \"They really look just like little people.\" The speck sized people were scrambling across the sand away from her big brown feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't just kill them!\" protested Jennifer, \"I was reading that they might be people from some other dimension!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO CARES!\" scowled Lisa, \"Fuck off! Volleyball time. Ash, chuck us the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at Alisha, but the other new girl in town shrugged and took her position for the game, ignoring the tiny people she almost crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn, sulkily scooped up some sand with micros and dumped it in her bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Totaly at easy she placed the cage on the ground in front of the group, making sure to squash 2 guys who had made it this far already beneath it. She opened it and rose up to her full height again - watching the microterrans for a couple of seconds. They where still trying to get away. Some tried to run around her boots standing in the way. Others tried to use the only unblocked exit in her back. \"Stop\" she said in a calm voice and brought her two feet closer together a little bit by lifting them up a little and setting them down onto the brave ones who tried to surround her boot. \"Please don't run away folks. I don't want to kill you guys. Just go into that cage I have prepared for you and none of you has to die no more.\" The people looked up, but all they could see where her beautiful collumn sized legs which ended in a thin piece of cloth beneath her skirt. After seeing the horrible death of their comrades they where like paralyzed. \"Hurry up\", she said in a playful way and crushed out a little girl farest away from the cage beneath the tip of her shoe. Still everybody was paralyzed with shock and unable to move. \"You guys really start pissing me off!\", she said angryly. Again she lifted her boot and let it hover over the group of people. There where two wet spots where the sand remaind stuck on the plain silver sole. Slowly she lowered her foot onto the group. \"You better run now!\", she said. The group didn't needed more motivation. As fast as they could they ran towards the cage. A few tried to run in different directions and flee. just three or four unlucky people where still paralyzed and stared at the bottom of her boot. They screamed until the cold, sliver material - unknown to anyone of them - touched their faces and forced them to the ground. Then, an instant before they where pressed into the sand the ground beneath them became solid almost in the same instant their bodies popped and splattered beneath her feet. With three small steps she crushed the people trying to flee and watched the rest of the group enter the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the last few people could enter she closed it with a device and picked it up. \"Sorry guys, but you where too slow\", she simply said and stepped on them while walking back to the Parking lot</span></div></div>",

No-one knew where they were. At this point no-one cared. It was enough that they were alive. Of course that view would soon change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alley was dark and none of the girls noticed the stricken vehicle in their path. Stacey's size ten (UK) platform sandal swung through the air and slammed into the plane full of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of her leg actually lifted the plane slightly into the air and sent it skittering across the alley almost to the back door of the club. It shattered the reinforced safety windows and  severely dented the fusalage. One wing snapped almost entirely off and the casualties on board the plane rocketted. All those near the point of impact with the clear platform of Stacey's  mule were simply smashed to pieces. As people had been preparing to evacuate, belts were no longer being worn and people were sent bouncing off of the walls and ceiling. When the screaming began to die down, a kick from a pretty woman had killed and injured far more people than the original crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Brittany.</span></div></div>",

Towering legs like mountains. Three women who attracted him, but terrified him out of his mind with their size. It couldn't be real. The plane was a flattened field of crushed debris. Nothing there lived. There had been 600 hundred people on board.

The vast plain surrounded by two endless cliffs that extended and rised themselves into every direction so far and so high that it seemed to take place of the entire sky and horizon but in his mind he could identify this scenario as a mere alley like any other in any big city.<br>\r\nHe identified dumpsters as big as the plateaus of monument valley, surrounded with some metal trash baskets the size of city blocks and garbage bags as big as hills. Like the one that smoothed the impact of the plane when they landed. Was it all real? The terrorizing image of ship sized female feet tearing the airplane apart and turning it into a ball of fire and wrecked metal, with all those people aboard, hit his mind once again\u2026.

It was frightening. They where so small, but so real. They are as tiny as bugs but still they are so fragile. A couple of them died as the girls divided them just because some stupid actions. They where laughing and extremly excited as Stacy witnessed the ones falling to the floor hundreds of feet below. Some where squished by the girls fingers as they formed the groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy felt sorry for the little fellas - away from home surrounded by an gigantic envoirenment. But what should she do? She was thinking about Brittany and the idea of the website - this was the chance to get popular beyond demands! But still these where real people. REAL PEOPLE. But she could really use the money from her site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and went to her fridge. She got out a box of maggots she shortly bought at a petshop. Even this vermin was bigger than those people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell - neverthless they can't stay in the box the whole time. Stacy went into her bedroom and looked for the old terrarium. A leftover from one of her lovers. The former owner was a tarantula. She placed it on the small table next to her couch and filled some flower dirt into it then patted half of the terrain flat with her hand so it would become a sturdy surface. On this surface she emptied the box carefully into the terrarium. More than a hundred pairs of eyes stared at her through the glass. She could hear them cry. It was a more of a chirping that came out of the way too big prison for the people. She sat back on the couch and stared at the people. As she looked longer she could make out individual faces and started too see the what these people where doing. They where holding each other. Others scouted their new terraine and some of them gathered around single ones, listening to him. These are real people. She tried to get that back into her mind as she again thought about a new series on her website which could bring her a lot of fans in the community. But what should she do with these mini people. The others warned her to go to the authorities and she guessed they where right - So she would keep them in this terrarium... as pets? These where real people but she couldn't just free them because they where too small too survive outside so what to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up again as the alarmclock rang. She went back into the kitchen where the box of maggots was standing on the table. A few steps ahead was her \"Studio\". A chair where she sat down after she activated all three cameras with her laptop. She has put on some gloves and places the box on a small table next to the chair where she got out 3 of these still slowly moving pests with the spoon and dumped them on her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do to you If you would be a real human? I don't know. Maybe I should look after you and make sure you are safe as my little pets - but this means that I have too look after you and I am very busy.\" She played with her hair as she was acting a thoughtful face. \"But I think that would be much too cruel. I am not good with pets and so I think that it would be better for you to die a quick death now instead of a long suffering life in my room. By the way little fella - I hate everything crawling around on the floor and as long as it fits under my foot it is as good as dead.\" With that she let the little insects fall to the ground knowing that her last sentence was true and that she has had made up her decision. As her bare foot smashed the pests to pulp her mind raced again back to the people in her terrarium. </span></div></div>",

Without a word she placed him onto the floor between her pumps and slowly stood up to full height. The monitor of her laptop showed the floorview camera. the man was simply lying there, holding his arms wrapped around his legs and crying. What a pitiful sight she thought. He just looked like a small speck from her point of view. Ok - Action. She closed her eyes and thought about maggots. The same maggots she crushed earlier this evening. She slowly brought down her foot and waited until she touched the ground again. She hasn't even felt him. Had she missed? She lifted her foot to the side and looked at the little red splat on the ground. She sat back down and inspekted the plain but dirty sole of her pumps. She couldn't find the corpse inbetween the grime of her sole but that guy is certainly dead. Really. With her stockings she cleaned away the red splat from the floor and stopped the record.

He crackled a little bit like a bug but it was a sligthly different sound. As her foot lifted up the corpse was torn apart completly partly stuck to the shoe and to the ground in a wet, flashy mess. This was no fx clip - she just really crushed a full grown but shrunken men like nothing. She had seen the video about a hundred times until she really believed what she had done and to think about her feelings about this. She took her time and came to the conclusion that she had felt nothing. Nothing at all. No Remorse, no guilt not even a bad conciouns. It was like nothing for her to kill these poor people. She looked over to the green box in which they where stored and new that they all had been sentenced dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could make a lot of money out of this if she thought this through. But she had to try one thing before she slept over the whole Idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the box and opened the lid. The people where screaming and shouting at her but she could not understand anything so she simply picked one out of the crowd and closed the lid again. It was a women more a girl. She didn't wasted no time and placed her onto the floor which made her fall flat onto her belly. Immediatly she jumped up and ran. Amused Stacey watched the dot run as fast as it could in sheer terror but an ant could have outrunned her. Stacy took her time to take off her shoes and her nylons then she slowly walked past the girl who immediatly turned and run into the other direction. Within the next step the giantess placed her heel right behind the girl casting the shadow of her foot over her. She lowered it slowly like a falling ceiling. The little girl had no chance. Before she managed to even get to the ball of her foot she was already forced to the ground. \"They even are to weak to wiggle even a little\" stacy thought with a slight amount of dissapointment before she pressed her foot down crushing the life out of the person beneath it. \"A lot of liquid\", she thought as she felt the crumbled bodys juices weted her sole. She took a look at it and placed the foot on the lifeless corpse again and twisted it into the ground before walking towards the camera to switch it off</span></div></div>",

Brittany responds \"Damnit bitches, you know I'm trying to quit\".  She playfully knocks the Marlboro Light out of Stacy's mouth.  \"You're an ass Brit--that was my last smoke!\" responds Stacy.  \"Fuck it, I'm picking that bad boy up off the dirty alley and lightin it up anyways\".  Stacy kneels down and uses the lighter to see better.  Suddenly she forgot to look for her cig.  \"Wow guys....check out this toy plane I found.  I should take it home and give it to my son Dakota\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy had no idea that to the 375 men, 200 women, and 25 children on board the flight she was an incredibly titanic giantess, measuring in at just over 1000 feet tall.  She also had no idea that she was about to pick-up 600 people in her hands, the tallest of which would be just over 1 cm and well under 1/2 inch tall.  She lifted the plane up using just 1 hand, and although it was heavier than she expected, the tiny travellers and their aircraft were totally at her mercy.  Stacy had beautiful red nails that were long even to her, checking in at about 3 cm long, but the men at her club seemed to like them and they made her feel sexy and less like the mother she was at home. Unfortunately she was a bit clumsy with them, and her 18 foot long thumbnail hacked off one of the wings already fragile from the crash.  \"Oops\" she said flippantly.  Little did she know holding the lighter that close to the jumbo jet almost incited a catastrophic explosion as well, but fortunately the miniature passengers' lives would be spared, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the plane inside and set it down on her dressing table.  The area was much better lit, and while she was changing she noticed something odd about the plane.  It seemed much too realistic.  She started fantasizing that the tiny pilots and men aboard were simply in awe of her mountainous breasts, the best money could buy.  Little did she know they WERE watching her every move.  In fact a group of the braver guys were considering opening the door and waving to get the hot woman's attention.  I mean after all they were not just midgets, they were unbelievably tiny.  They would never succeed in this world without help, I mean how would they get food or repair their plane when they were smaller than some ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would the little people do?</span></div></div>",

After all, he would be going off to serve in the military in another month, so she wanted to make sure he wouldn't forget her while he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden their foreplay was interrupted by an odd noise coming through the window.  The lights were out though, and the room was lit only by the TV.  \"Don't worry sweetie, it was nothing\" Jeff attempted to reassure.  Melissa wanted to believe that, so she allowed Jeff to slip off her panties and she sank her wet tunnel completely around his stiff love muscle.  But Melissa just had this sense she was being watched, so a few minutes later to put her at ease Jeff reached for the lamp, even though she was stark naked and he was wearing only his t-shirt.  They both didn't see anything at first, then Melissa looked down on the floor and gasped.  She saw a miniature jumbo-jet airplane covered partially by her pink lace panties, and 2 naughty pilots with tiny red faces pretending to be checking out the plane.  \"Honey, look Carribeans!\" she exclaimed to Jeff.  Everyone in their community hoped to find more of the legendary inch tall people, ever since a boy found a tiny plane and the dead bodies of 2 little men in pilots uniforms in his backyard in the late 1950s.  Jeff knew that Melissa, standing at only 5 foot 2 inches tall in their world, had always dreamed of getting to being a giantess to these tiny adventurers, but he was still rock hard inside her and he wanted his release.  \"I have half a mind to crush you, you little pervs\" he scolded the pilots.  Melissa smiled at them though and said \"Don't mind him...it's not your fault you crashed, but if you'll excuse me for a few minutes I'd like to finish making love to my boyfriend.  She reached for the blanket on the top of the sofa and gently covered up the plane and peeping tom pilots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments Melissa came like never before.  She had spent much time fantasizing about this day.  She even knew how tall she would seem to the men she would soon be playing with, 372 feet to be exact.  Jeff enjoyed himself too, knowing full well he had nothing to be jealous of.  Sure Melissa would be fascinated by the little guys, but they could never satisfy her the way he was right now.  Melissa put her bra on, but had to remove the blanket first to get to her panties.  She took extra long to slip back into them, making sure to entertain her audience.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did her best to avoid toppling any of the rafts but the sheer magnitude of their smallness meant that even the tiny waves she created were enough to spill over a few more. The riders flailed in the steaming ocean of bathwater as her other leg made its entrance. A few were pulled under the surface as another series of waves made their debut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood in the bath, Betty looked at the countless boats that littered her tub. Her butt was too wide to simply slip in; it was sure to create even larger waves and crush a few of the life-rafts. Pushing aside her worries, she decided to take a seat. It wasn't her fault they were there, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for the survivors, most of the rafts had responded to the giant woman's arrival and had piloted to the other side of the bath. Unfortunately, one of the vessels found itself stranded. It's rudder had been broken by a previous wave and there was nothing it or its riders could do as Betty's plump behind made contact, dragging the poor thing under the water. It went down, down, down into the steaming depths before it was crushed utterly between the pearly white porcelain and the soft fat of Betty's behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the crushing as her butt came to a rest. Sighing, she glanced down and was greeted by a red mist pool from her back end. Twenty people had been snuffed out by her. She had no way of knowing it, but nearly a hundred people had died so far from rouge waves and her carelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, these guys are worse than ants,\" she whined to no one in particular. \"Even ants have a survival instinct. They die by the dozen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was harsh, but true. Now in the bath, Betty closed her eyes and resolved to ignore the beings as much as possible.

A wave of excitement rushed through her naked body as she realized she was totally in control and she could make those tiny people, especially the men fear her.   Men had always manipulated her and used her just for her body.   That wouldn't happen now as these guys were so small and so helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty found her best bikini from the bedroom closet, the sexy itsy-bitsy black one with extra padding in the cup.   Full size guys would always comment on what a big rack she had, how huge would her boobs seem now to mere bugs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the life rafts floated hopelessly in the tub and the scared tiny people decided they needed to formulate a plan.  They knew they would be totally at the mercy of this woman.  After all, the sides of the tub towered over them, and the slick porcelain would be impossible to climb.  They had to hope she would be kind and rescue them.  Ten of the bravest guys reasoned a woman that age would love to be flattered.  When she returned they would paddle to the middle, yell to get her attention, and then compliment her like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty hummed a happy tune as she returned to the bathroom to wow her little ones.  She stopped at the sink and applied her hot red lipstick and flaunted her tight booty far above the tub in plain vew of the life rafts.  The men's jaws dropped.  This woman was colossal yet HOT.   Finally she turned her attention to the tub and noticed a bunch of guys waving nad whistling.  She grinned from ear to ear as she reached down one of her nicely tanned and french manicured hands into the soapy water and easily picked up the life raft and its precious cargo.  \"You look amazing my goddess!\" yelled a tiny shirtless hunk with a miniature washboard stomach.  \"Sweet lips honey!\"  yelled a businessman in a suit.  \"Beautiful nails!\"  gulped the tallest of the men....he had noticed her thumbnail was the same size as he was!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty blushed again....she was amazed at these guys boldness!   As a result, Betty decided to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not like you could ever satisfy a woman like this.   I mean look at you pathetic things...I can hold all of you guys and your tiny boat with 1 hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the bravest men shouted,  \"Common Betty...give me a chance.  My name is Steve and I'm the perfect size to give that special place of yours some personal attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty was about to threaten him when suddenly tinges of excitement flooded Betty's whole body at the thought of this little man working on her clitoris.  \"Hmmm, it has been a while since a man was more focused on me than himself.\"    She set the boat down on her nightstand and held out her long french manicured thumbnail and said to the fearless dude \"OK, you're on...climb on dude!\"  Betty giggled as Steve struggled onto her huge thumb.  \"Gosh, you're so small and fragile...I'll try not to hurt you.\"   With her free hand she took down her bikini bottoms and lie down on the bed.   She slid him off her nail in front of her warm wet pussy.  \"All right, go to work!\"  she ordered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the guys back in the boat stood wide-eyed with amazement.  Some of them started to whistle, as they had a \"big screen\" porno flick going on right in front of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty became annoyed and look over at them....\"Hey, this ain't no peep show!\", she growled.  All of a sudden she got a big grin as she grabbed the bottoms of her swimsuit and placed it strategically over the boat.  \"Shows over boys!\".   She imagined them taking in her aroma, which would be their only air to breathe.  She soon became aware of Steve's full body attempt at giving her pleasure.  \"ooooh\" she cooed \"not bad for an insect-sized man!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they both heard someone coming in through the front door downstairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
