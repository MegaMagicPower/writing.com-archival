Tea nodded, eager to hear her prediction. \"I predict you will laugh if I touch you here\". Mai said as she lightly scratched tea's sides, getting a small giggle fit out of her. \"Hehehe how'd you know I was ticklish\"? Mai simply smirked. \"Like I said, prediction is my specialty and i'm never wrong\". Mai scratched her sides again getting a laugh out of her junior. \"Hahahahahaha quhihihit it\". Mai kept that playful smile on her face. \"And if I don't\"? She attacked tea's armpits. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOT THERE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai's smile grew and she continued her playful assault.

She was having fun although it tickled like mad. She couldn't recall the last time she laughed so hard.

Laughing her head off with no care in the world, she loved this. Minutes later, she couldn't take it anymore and finally fought off her laughter long enough to beg her to stop:for real this time.

Mai asked the hysterical duelist. Tea couldn't even talk anymore and she could barely managed a nod. Tears streamed down her face and she couldn't care less. Her armpits, being her worst spot would keep her laughing for hours but she didn't mind. She enjoyed being tickled by her friends and mai was no exception. Minutes passed and she had completely succumbed to silent laughter. She had fallen backwards onto mai lap, crying from laughter. Mai had a playful smile on her face as she drove the younger girl to tears.

Akiza could barley tell her when she lost balance and slammed into a poor waiter who happened to be carrying smoothies and nachos to another table. The food flew off the tray right into the poor dude's face. She then tried to help the waiter out only to fall on the customers table and her face ended up cover in both smoothie and nacho cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still remembered hearing the twins dying from laughing so hard and even using trying to suppress a few chuckles. With those words out both akiza and carly were in tears from laughing. \"Hahahahahah yohohohou rehehally dhihd thahat\" \"Sahadly it was embarrassing but now it is kinda funny. He tried to help me up but he lost his grip from the smoothie and I ended up pulling him on down with me and he fell *snort* face first into the guy's nachos\". Both girls fell into another laughing fit that lasted a good minute. \"Guess your date with yusei didn't go so well huh\"? Akiza turned red upon digesting her words. Stammering and embarrassed she tried to explain that it wasn't a date but all she could do was put her face in her hand turning redder every second. Carly snickered at her and poked akiza in the side, getting a ticklish squeak out of her. \"It totally was a date. You like him don't you? \" carly said and poked her again getting another squeak. \"Stohop thahat tihickles\" Akiza covered her mouth, regretting what she just said but carly just smirked at her. \"Ticklish huh?\" Akiza looked away, trying to deny it. Carly then ran her fingers across akiza's stomach generating laughs from the physic duelist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahahahahaaha stohohohohp thahahahat Carly's smirk grew and she attacked hr stomach and sides getting laughing fits from the black rose. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA CAHAHAHAHAHAHRLY STOHOHOHOHOP \"Just admit it was a date and that you do like him and maybe I will\". Akiza couldn't respond since she was laughing too hard. She fell back on carly's lap, laughing like a little girl.  Her face was turning red from her hysterics but she refused to say anything. Tears started streaming down her face as carly drove her crazy. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH IT HAHAHAHAHAH WASN'T A DAHAHAHAHAHAHATE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA STOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOP Akiza couldn't stop laughing nor could she control herself. Her legs kicked out widely and she could barely defend herself from carly's playful torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just shook her head smiling. \"Wrong answer\" Akiza was crying from laughing so hard but a part of her was having fun. She didn't get too many chances to let loose and laugh like this. Her smile was wide and genuine and laughter rang out nonstop but she felt like a kid again. She never got to experience this before and a part of her wanted it to continue. Finally, she couldn't take it anymore. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA OHOHOHOHOK I DOHOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHHOHO With that carly stopped and let her breathe. Akiza's face was beet red from laughing and her having to admit her feelings. \"It's ok. I won't say anything\" Carly reassured. Akiza smiled and thanked her. Akiza snickered to herself. \"What's so funny\"? \"Hehehe I just realized. Aren't you the one crazy about jack\"? Now it was carly's turn to turn red. Akiza covered her mouth, laughing at the now embarrassed reporter. Carly growled and started tickling akiza again. HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA OHOHOHOHOHOHK OHOHOHOHOHOHOHK IHIHIHIHIHM SOHOHOHOHOHORY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA STOHOHOHOHP \"No way. This is payback for that smart remark\". Akiza was dying from laughing so hard but a part of her kinda wanted this. So for the next few minutes, akiza was turned into a laughing little kid.

Carly's eyes snapped over to her in anticipation. \"What do I do?\" Carly asked. \"It's simple, raise your arms\". Carly did so, still not catching onto her scheme. Akiza then smirked and tickled her armpits, ribs and belly. Within a second, carly's eyes widened, then a giant dumb grin appeared, then finally she burst out laughing. GAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA- WHAHAHAHAHAHAT ARE YOHOHOHOHU DOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOING, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAHAHAHAHAHAHA TIHIHIHIHIHICKLES TOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO MUHUHUHUHUHUCH Akiza had a playful smile as she tortured poor carly. \"Yep, this  is what I learned to help you out. I think you could use a laugh after everything\". Carly was laughing endlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears formed as she howled hysterically but she hadn't put her arms down. \"Oh man, how'd she know I was ticklish. But this is kinda fun, I guess I needed this\". Carly thought to herself through her hysterics. Tears flowed down her face as she laughed herself crazy but she was feeling better. She fell back on the couch, hugging herself in a vain attempt to guard herself from the playful assault. Minutes later and carly was a mess. Tears wouldn't stop falling. Her hair stuck to her face and her glasses had fallen off. She didn't have the energy to kick or flail her arms so she was simply lying there, taking the torture but she was enjoying herself. She knew she looked a mess but she didn't care. She hadn't felt this happy in a while so she really wanted to enjoy it just a little longer. Finally akiza stopped and let carly get herself together. After a few minutes, carly was back to her old self but that smile never left her face. \"I guess I needed that. Thanks akiza.\" Akiza smiled and carly smiled back only there was something playful about that look. Soon-</span></div></div>",

She noticed that as akiza was laying there, laughing, like a little kid, she never put her arms down to defend herself. Akiza's armpits were her most sensitive spot but despite her increasing laughter, she never put them down. She was honestly having a lot of fun.\"Who knew being tickled like this was so much fun. I really have to thank those kids.\" Akiza thought to herself among her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed but akiza was in her own slice of heaven. Tears were freely flowing down her face as she laughed herself silly but she loved the feeling. She couldn't help but feel like a kid again. Carly had pinned her hands over her head as she tortured her armpits and belly. The black rose had fallen victim to silent laughter. It was a bit of torture for her-she couldn't get enough. This was the most fun she's had in years. Carly soon stopped and let akiza breathe. She then got off her and helped akiza up as well. \"Enjoy your payback?\" akiza asked with a smile. Carly couldn't suppress a chuckle and simply nodded. \"I had to get you back. Besides, maybe a new paper is on order. The Black Rose:ticklish?. What a riveting story, don't you think\"? Carly asked teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza lunged forward and tickled her armpits getting loud laughter out of carly. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HEHEHEHEHEHEY IHIHIHIHIHIM JUST JOHOHOHOHOHOKING Carly doubled over cackling as her upper body was tortured. Despite her hysterics, she never tried to escape or defend herself. Turns out carly enjoyed being tickled as well. Although she was more sensitive then her. She was already starting to cry from laughing so hard. Akiza then scratched her nails on her belly, causing her to fall to the floor in silent laughter. \"Guess I found her tickle spot\" akiza thought. Carly was in tears and her laughter was non stop. Her legs kicked out aimlessly and she couldn't stop squirming. Suddenly she accidentally kicked akiza off her. While akiza rubbed her chest, carly was calming down from her laughing fit. She then became aware of what she did and frantically apologized. The two girls just laughed it off as an accident. Guess they both needed a laugh.</span></div></div>",

They played a few games, watched some good and bad movies, and even had a few dozen duels. After a while, the twins still had some energy left while akiza grew tired. She decided to take a nap on the couch. Leo and luna decided to sit next to her sleeping form to keep her company. \"She looks so peaceful when she's like this\" Luna said. \"Yea, it almost makes you forget how scary she can be\". Leo said. \"That's cause of you, you know\". Luna teased. Leo looked away grumbling. Minutes later, both twins were sitting next to each other as akiza slept. Leo then looked over at akiza who was still fast asleep. \"Man, she's out cold. Guess we really tuckered her out huh\"? Leo thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous smile then over took him and he poked akiza's side out of mischief and slight boredom. Luna then saw her brother. \"Leo, what are you doing? You'll disturb her\". \"No i'm not, look at her. She's completely out\". The black rose was lying on her stomach, her head resting on her arms. Leo the poked her side a few more times. \"See, nothing\". Leo said. Luna then got curious and poked near her armpit, getting seemingly no response. \"Whoa, he's right\". Luna thought. Akiza then shifted in her sleep, a smile hidden on her face. The twins couldn't help themselves and kept poking her for no real reason other then boredom. Unbeknownst to them, akiza had woken up when leo first poked her side. She had kept her eyes closed, hiding giggles. She put her face directly on the couch, muffling her giggles, enjoying the tickly pokes. Both kids were genuinely amused by this stupid antic of leo's. Akiza was no different. She was pretending to be asleep, muffling her giggling. Luna smirked and poked her armpits a few times. Akiza was now muffling whole laughing fits, kinda hoping they wouldn't stop. \"Oh man, it tickles\". Akiza thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she's really out of it\". Leo said. He then joined his sister, poking her underarms as well. Akiza felt herself tear up with muffled laughter and was slightly shuffling but keeping her weak spot unguarded. After luna got bold and wiggled her finger in her armpit:that was it.(heh,rhyme) Akiza lifted her head back on her hands, fully laughing, startling the kids. The kids jumped back, wondering whether they should run or not. Although they stopped, akiza couldn't stop laughing for a bit. When she finally got control of herself, she opened her eyes, looking at the slightly scared kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for? That really tickled\". Akiza said, unable to wipe that smile of her face. \"It was leo's idea\". Luna blurt out of fear. Leo looked at her betrayed, even tho it was true. She then got up and approached the trembling kids. \"guess I need to tell you kids what happens when i'm woken up\". The twins hugged each other out of fear. Then much to their surprise they found themselves laughing as she started tickling their bellies. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-HEHEHEHEHEY CUT IHIHIT OUT Both kids burst into hysterics as their shared weak spot was tortured. Akiza held a playful smile as she drove the kids crazy with laughter. Both fell to the floor, laughing harder every second. Leo rolled side to side while luna curled into a ball, crying with laughter. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OHOHOHOHOK  WERE SHAHAHAHAHAHARY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA PLEHEHEHEHHEHEASE WERE SOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHORY Akiza stopped and let the kids breathe. \"I forgive you kids, just don't do that again\".

Leo thought to himself over his sister's cackling. She and akiza had decided to have another armpit tickle challenge tomorrow so she asked leo to help her build some resistance. It did help that the twins loved having their armpits tickled but they could only take so much. Luna was crying with laughter but she was having fun, even though in her melting mind she was training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually put her arms down, unable to take anymore.

Luna said tired but determined. Leo had a*seriously* look on his face. As much as he enjoyed making his sister laugh, but this was odd. \"Something wrong, Leo\"?

Leo said. \"It's kinda strange I admit but it was kinda fun the last time we did this. *Smirks* Plus you can't deny this is kinda fun\".

Luna nodded in understanding. \"By the way, where did you hide power tool dragon\"? Leo asked. Luna flinched as she forgot about that detail. Leo leered at her. \"Luna, where is it\"? Leo said growing annoyed. Luna held a sheepish smile. \"I may have forgotten where it was.But i'll help you look for it. Please, big brother.\" She said, giving him her pleading eyes. Normally, hose big, doe eyes would get him,heck even jack fell victim to them, but this time was different. Leo got a small evil yet playful and tickled her stomach. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LEHEHEHEHEO PLEHEHEHEHEHEHEHASE IHIHIHIHIHIHI MEAN IT I'LL HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHELP HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA STAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHP Luna laughed up a storm,which didn't surprise leo. He knew she could be tickled for a while and still have energy left to laugh. He then stopped as he realized she was being genuine. \"I'm serious, i'll help look.\" Luna said. Leo smiled and the two of them began to search the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile:HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA AKIZA STAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAP PLEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEASE Carly wasn't so lucky.  </span></div></div>",

After a tornado of death itself dispersed, leo was still standing but something was wrong. His eyes were dull and he wasn't breathing. With a thud, he fell to the ground, dead. Jack looked down at the kid with wide eyes.\"LEO!!!\" Luna couldn't look away from him. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\" With that scream, everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna woke up with a scream and looked around panting, realizing that it was just a nightmare. Still, it felt too real, especially when that really did happen. Suddenly she heard footsteps and her door swung open,threatening to slam into the wall. \"Luna. I heard you scream from down the hall. Are you oka-\" He didn't even get the chance to finish as luna ran from her bed and hugged him tightly. He felt his shoulder getting wet and hard her sobbing. \"Did you have a bad dream sis?\"Leo asked, although he had a feeling what the answer was. \"*sniffle* W-we were d-dueling aporia. H-he killed you*sniffle* but this time you*sniffle* you wouldn't\"- Luna couldn't even finish as she burst into tears one again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo hugged his sister tightly, comforting her as best he could. After 5 minutes of sobbing, he led her to her bed and they both sat down, although luna couldn't stop crying. Seeing her brother die shook her to her core. While he came back thanks to his signer powers awakening, she sill couldn't bear losing him. \"Luna,look at me. I'm ok, we're ok. I'm not going to leave you. I will always protect you. You know that right?\" Leo said. Luna nodded. Tears slowing down but still falling nonetheless. \"I'm not going anywhere. That's a promise\". Leo said and luna finally began to calm down. After a few minutes, luna finally stopped crying, but a sniffle or two still escaped her. \"Thanks leo\" luna said with a watery smile. Leo wasn't convinced that she was better and tickled her sides, finally getting a genuine smile from her. hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe heehehehehehehehet sthohohohohohohohohop nohohoohohohohohohohot nohohohohow She said that but didn't need. She squirmed in his grasp, giggling happily. \"no. I don't think you're actually cheered up\". leo said before tickling her stomach.

Minutes of laughing later, leo stopped and let his sister breathe. Luna hugged him. \"Thank you\". Leo just smiled and wished her a good night. But before he could leave, he felt her tug on his clothes. \"C-could you sleep here tonight\" She asked, slightly embarrassed? Leo nodded and lied down next to her. With content smiles, they went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Luna got pale as she had forgotten where it was.(It was under his pillow. Idiot) \"Akiza, you promised me an interview with jack\". Akiza gulped as she realized she really couldn't get jack to interview with her to save her life. When the two remained silent, leo and carly put two and two together:they lied. The two seemed to radiate anger at this point. \"You mean, you used us for something as stupid as this\". Leo and carly said in perfect unison. Akiza and luna were now getting scared. They knew they weren't going to listen to them so they decided to make a run for it.

Leo on luna's belly and carly on akiza's armpits. With their weak spots being tortured, they would surrender eventually. Both girls were roaring loudly but couldn't escape. They were both too tired from their contest and they were still sensitive from earlier so they could barely get a word out. Despite their hysterics they both were thinking one thing:Worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and carly held semi-evil smiles as they drove the two crazy. This would teach them to lie to them about these kinds of things. After a while the two finally stopped and let the two breathe. The two had red,tear-stained faces, could barely breathe and were too tired to move. \"Carly, i-i'll try to get jack to interview\". Carly smiled satisfied. \"Leo, I put p-power tool dragon under your pillow\". Leo ha d a wry smirk but was hiding embarrassment at not checking there. As carly left and leo ran to his room, the two signers lied on the floor attempting to breathe. Soon they had the energy to raise their heads and look at each other. \"Rematch\"? Akiza challenged. \"One day. But first, don't you have to convince jack to do an interview\"? Luna teased. Akiza's eyes widened. \"Oh no.\" Akiza groaned as luna couldn't help but laugh at her.</span></div></div>",

Carly looked at her, cooing at how adorable that sounded. Misty looked away crossing her arms, her face getting slightly redder. Carly just did it again, with the same result.

Carly then used both hands, one torturing her belly and the other her bellybutton. Finally misty uncovered her mouth hugging herself in full unrestrained hysterics. Tears flowed down her face as her worst spot was tortured but she was having fun. She felt like a little kid again, laughing as her friend tickled her. Finally carly stopped and let misty breathe.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA NOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Carly held a devilish smile as she drove the waitress nuts with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me to stop, just admit that jack was thinking about me\" Carly said. Despite her laughter, stephanie couldn't help feeling happy. She ended flashing back to her childhood when her parents would tickle her ribs whenever she tried to hide from them when they were playing. She loved the feeling every time. It seems that hasn't changed as she never submitted to carly's demand. \"Well, you can only take so much right?\" Carly thought to herself. Minutes passed and she still never said anything. Her smile and laughter became genuine and she felt, like a kid again, laughing without a care in the world. \"Dang it give in already!\" Carly eventually shouted frustrated. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA MOHOHOHOHOHORE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AGAINHAHAHHAAN Stephanie then covered her mouth in shock and embarrassment as carly stopped also shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of awkward silence, Stephanie spoke up. \"I guess i'm in no position to call you a child anymore. I was tickled all the time by my parents when I was a kid. They'd always get my ribs of all places whenever we played together. I-I always did enjoy it when they tickle me.\" Stephanie said with a red face. Carly knew she had no room to talk. She had spent some time with akiza and the kids, having some fun tickling each other so she had no room to judge. \"I won't tell anyone. You're secret's safe with me.\" Carly reassured. Stephanie smiled gratefully but ended up laughing again as carly tortured her ribs again. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAHAHHATS TIHIHIHIHIS FOHOHOHOHOR \"Well, you did want me to. Besides you still need to admit jack was thinking about me\" Carly said playfully. The coffee spent the next few minutes laughing like a little girl. She couldn't get enough.</span></div></div>",

Mina's smile finally broke through and she couldn't hold back her giggles. \"hehehehehehehehehe-pfft-heheheh st-stop hehehehehehehehe\" Mina sat there giggling like a little girl, but a part of her wanted them to keep going. Carly and stephanie the dug their fingers into her sides a bit more. \"Pfft-Hahahahahahahahahahahaha-cut it out-hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\" Mina burst out laughing as her sides were prodded more intensely. Hugging herself, she tried to protect her sides from further torment but to no avail, tho she wasn't trying very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she kept telling them to stop, she partially didn't want them too.

HAHAHAHAH OK OK HAHAHAHA STAHAHAHAHAP HAHAHAHA I CAHAHAHAN'T BREHEHEHEATHE Despite her happy tone, the twins knew she meant it and they stopped. Patty had to take nearly 15 minutes to get her sanity back. She wiped away her tears, took several deep breaths and tried to push down any more giggles that threatened to surface. The twins helped her get up but were surprised when she got a sudden burst of energy from seemingly out of nowhere. \"Hahaha that was so much fun. No wonder you two do that.\" Patty said ecstatic. The twins were surprised but happy that she had fun. Both then burst out giggling as she lightly tickled their ribs. \"Next time, i'm getting you both back, you especially luna.\" hehehehehe ok ok hehehe She then stopped and smiled at them, excited to come over again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks later patty went over to visit the twins again. Leo wasn't home however, he was out with yusei and crow. That fact was fine with them. Hopefully they wouldn't be interrupted this time. Luna knew full well why patty visited and patty was giggly from the moment she stepped inside. Since she found out she loved being tickled too, she couldn't help but feel this way around them. \"Oh great leo, we turned her into a tickle lover.\" Luna thought to herself, unable to keep a slightly amused smile off her face. Since that day, she felt giggly and playfully kept on guard around them expecting them to sneak attack her. By the time school ended, she almost felt disappointed until she felt luna prod her sides,getting crippling giggles from her. Afterwords,, she invited patty over to which the blonde quickly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter heading to the living room, luna pulled out her deck and put it on the table. Patty looked confused. \"I have a game I think you'll enjoy. You have to predict what card i'm holding. If you guess right, you get to tickle me wherever you want, since you wanted to get me back.\" Luna said. Patty nodded, feeling excited by the games premise so far. \"But if you guess wrong, I tickle you wherever I want.\" Luna finished. Patty had a completely excited smile on her face and was eager to get started. Luna was surprised at her friend's eagerness but tried not to show it. \"Let's get started then. I draw. It's a monster card. What is it?\"Luna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty thought for a minute, realizing she didn't remember every card in her deck. \"I think Jerry beans man.\" Patty guessed. Luna revealed the card and it was the tuner monster-nettles. Patty pretended to be disappointed by her guess. \"With that said ,i'll get your sides.\" Luna said. \"My weak spot already? Alright then.\" Patty said and leaned back on her hands. Luna then tickled her sides sending patty into ticklish bliss. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHOHOHOHOH NOHOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHEHEHERE A minute later, she stopped and drew her next card while patty got over her giggle fit. \"Another monster, what do you think?\" Luna challenged. Patty thought for a bit before making her choice. \"Spore\"patty guessed. Luna revealed that it was in fact spore. Patty smirked and selected luna's armpits. \"Guess you get some payback for last time At least she picked my favorite spot, if she got my belly, i'd probably kick over my deck by accident.\"Luna thought. She then raised her arms behind her head and patty quickly went to town. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-PFFT-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH A OHOHOHOHK YOU HAHAHAHD YOUR FUHUHUHUN HAHAHA Patty then stopped giggling to herself. She couldn't help herself, this was fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls got there fair share of laughter between them. The next 10 cards were a mix of spells, traps and monsters. Patty got at least 4 of them right meaning she got to see where else her friend was ticklish. She got her belly, ribs, sides and neck. Suffice to say luna was a wreck as her weak spots(Belly and ribs) were tickled. Meanwhile patty ended finding out how ticklish she was on her armpits, belly, ribs and feet. Patty ended finding out she loved having her ribs tickled but ended up a hysterical sobbing mess when she found out how ticklish her feet were.\"Oh man, I had no idea I was that ticklish. When you got my feet, I thought I was gonna die laughing\" Patty said. Luna agreed as she held her stomach, which was sore from laughing so much. \"Well, I got to go. I promised mom i'd be home soon.\" Patty said waving. Luna waved goodbye and decided to rest. \"Man, even with leo I don't laugh this much\"Luna thought. Luna despite her soreness smiled. Something told her she was going to enjoy this.</span></div></div>",

Patty still had that excited smile as she and luna thought of another game for them. After heading into luna's room, they discussed what it was. \"I get it. It's basically who can take it longer.\"Patty said. \"Pretty much but there's a catch. We take being tickled on our favorite spot.\" Luna said surprising her friend. \"I see. Since we both like being tickled on a certain spot, who can take it there more.\" Patty said, squirming in excitement. A round of rock, paper scissors, and patty was going first. She leaned back on her hands, leaving her ribs open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then pulled out a timer and started it. With that, luna sent her friend into hysterics. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA THIS IHIHIHIHIS HAHAHA NOHOHOHOHTHING AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Patty threw her head back laughing happily as her ribs were prodded nonstop. Despite her hysterics, patty looked so happy. She never being tickled like this could be so much fun. \"She's really enjoying herself. Still, she can only take so much\" Luna thought to herself.  Minutes later, patty was tearing up from laughing so much. She had to fight the urge to protect herself out of reflex but otherwise kept herself unguarded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she couldn't stand it and finally slapped luna's hands away. HAHAHA OKOK THAHHATS IHIHIT HAHAHA NO MOHOHORE Luna stopped the timer and saw she lasted 6 minutes. Luna gave patty the timer and put her arms behind her head, leaving her armpits open. Patty started the timer and got to work making her friend laugh her heart out. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Luna couldn't help but admit, she's been having a lot of fun with patty. She liked being tickled by her brother but it was nice doing this with one of her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna laughed loudly. Sometimes, she forgot how ticklish her armpits were. After a while, tears formed at the corner of her eyes but she refused to give up. She was quickly finding it difficult to keep them up. She noticed she was laughing harder than usual. \"Did I get more sensitive doing all this with her?\" Luna wondered. With that thought lowering her guard, patty jammed her hands into her armpits, getting luna to shriek and finally put them down. As she caught her breath, patty was surprised to see she also lasted 6 minutes. Luna looked surprised. Normally, she could take it more but she didn't give it much thought. \"Guess we ended in a draw this time.\" Patty said. Luna caught her breath and nodded in agreement. Patty then said goodbye to luna and left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Patty didn't really give an answer right away but explained that she felt like a failure for losing to the others so easily. \"You're not a failure. You're an incredible duelist.\" Luna reassured. Patty looked away but luna noticed something. She leaned back on her hands and her shoulder were slightly shaking from holding back laughter. She wanted luna to tickle her. \"I think our habit rubbed off on you too much\" Luna thought but nonetheless went through with patty's request. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH THAHAHAHAHAHAHAHANK I NEHEHEHEHEHED THHIHIHIS  Patty laughed endlessly as her favorite spot was tickled mercilessly. The blonde was already starting to forgot why she was upset in the first place as she howled hysterically.  \"My best friend's a tickle lover. I don't know how to feel about this.\" Luna thought with a sweat drop. Minutes later patty's eyes were flooding with tears of joy. Her mind was melting under luna's playful assault. The fact that she couldn't help but ask for her not to stop probably didn't help with patty's uncontrollable laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde never felt so happy before. Since she found out she loved being tickled by them, she couldn't help but try to initiate tickle games or fights between them. She mainly let luna win cause she was enjoying it too much. Luna noticed this but didn't say anything cause she was happy her friend was having fun. A few minutes later, luna finally stopped and let her breathe. Her face was stained with tears and her pigtails came undone allowing her fair to fall past her shoulders but that smile never went away.

Keeping her hands tucked behind her head, patty continue to howl hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her hysterics, all that could be seen on patty's face was pure joy. She felt nothing but genuine happiness as her friend gave her the tickling of her life. She roared with laughter, she felt her face turn red, she felt her stomach slowly become sore from her mirth, she didn't want her to stop. After what felt like hours pass, patty finally dropped her arms and fell to the floor weak from laughing. While she tried to regain her sanity, luna looked at the timer and saw that she lasted 11 minutes. \"Whoa, that beats my time by a long shot. She more ticklish but she can take it more then me and leo combined.\" luna thought. After patty got herself together, luna tucked her arms behind her head. Patty then started the timer and went to town on luna's favorite spot. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-PFFT-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Luna burst into laughter as her challenge began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was a little glad patty liked this too so at least they were both having fun. The blue haired signer laughed herself to the point of tears and even then she couldn't stop. Patty then smirked and sped up her efforts like luna did to her and luna was instantly tearing up from laughing so hard. Minutes passed and luna hadn't stopped laughing for even a second. Her stomach was starting to hurt from her laughter and her cheeks were bright red. \"Oh man, I don't think even leo made me laugh this hard\". Luna thought to herself. Her mind was melting under her assault and luna was actually having a great time. Nothing but laughter left her mouth and her eyes were flooding with tears. As much as she loved being tickled, she was reaching her limit and soon her arms flew down to protect herself. It took luna a few minutes to stop laughing. As luna winded down from her hysterics, patty stopped the timer and saw that luna had also lasted 11 minutes. \"I guess we're evenly matched in this but I know something I can beat you in.\" Luna said as she got her duel disks. Both girls smiled and raced outside for a friendly duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, patty continued coming over to have some laughs with her friend. Patty couldn't have been happier with luna.</span></div></div>",

Luna ended up laughing her sorrows away for about an hour. The was a wreck by the time she finally asked him to stop but she couldn't have felt better. Speaking of which, patty noticed luna was completely sobbing from laughing so hard. \"She's more ticklish here then I thought.\" Patty thought surprised. Finally patty topped and allowed her friend to breathe. Luna spent a good 5 minutes catching her breathe and wiping away any tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Patty asked. Luna simply nodded, unable to wipe a smile off her face. \"Will you be?\" Luna thought to herself as she tickled patty's belly. Hehehehehehey heheheheheheheheheheheh Hahahahahahahahahahahaha nohohohohoho fahahahahahahahahir Patty leaned back on her hands allowing her belly to be prodded. Unlike the twins, patty's belly was her favorite tickle spot. Patty threw her head back and laughed in delight, enjoying the feeling. Patty started tearing up slightly from her laughter and luna barely started. \"In a way, she's almost as ticklish as me.\" Luna thought. For the next few minutes the girls seemed to abandon their joke and just had fun making each other laugh.</span></div></div>",
