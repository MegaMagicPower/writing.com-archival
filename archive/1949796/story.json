Mai said as she lightly scratched tea's sides, getting a small giggle fit out of her. \"Hehehe how'd you know I was ticklish\"? Mai simply smirked. \"Like I said, prediction is my specialty and i'm never wrong\". Mai scratched her sides again getting a laugh out of her junior. \"Hahahahahaha quhihihit it\".

Laughing her head off with no care in the world, she loved this. Minutes later, she couldn't take it anymore and finally fought off her laughter long enough to beg her to stop:for real this time.

Mai asked the hysterical duelist. Tea couldn't even talk anymore and she could barely managed a nod. Tears streamed down her face and she couldn't care less. Her armpits, being her worst spot would keep her laughing for hours but she didn't mind. She enjoyed being tickled by her friends and mai was no exception.

Akiza could barley tell her when she lost balance and slammed into a poor waiter who happened to be carrying smoothies and nachos to another table. The food flew off the tray right into the poor dude's face. She then tried to help the waiter out only to fall on the customers table and her face ended up cover in both smoothie and nacho cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still remembered hearing the twins dying from laughing so hard and even using trying to suppress a few chuckles. With those words out both akiza and carly were in tears from laughing. \"Hahahahahah yohohohou rehehally dhihd thahat\" \"Sahadly it was embarrassing but now it is kinda funny. He tried to help me up but he lost his grip from the smoothie and I ended up pulling him on down with me and he fell *snort* face first into the guy's nachos\". Both girls fell into another laughing fit that lasted a good minute. \"Guess your date with yusei didn't go so well huh\"? Akiza turned red upon digesting her words. Stammering and embarrassed she tried to explain that it wasn't a date but all she could do was put her face in her hand turning redder every second. Carly snickered at her and poked akiza in the side, getting a ticklish squeak out of her. \"It totally was a date. You like him don't you? \" carly said and poked her again getting another squeak. \"Stohop thahat tihickles\" Akiza covered her mouth, regretting what she just said but carly just smirked at her. \"Ticklish huh?\" Akiza looked away, trying to deny it. Carly then ran her fingers across akiza's stomach generating laughs from the physic duelist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahahahahaaha stohohohohp thahahahat Carly's smirk grew and she attacked hr stomach and sides getting laughing fits from the black rose. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA CAHAHAHAHAHAHRLY STOHOHOHOHOP \"Just admit it was a date and that you do like him and maybe I will\". Akiza couldn't respond since she was laughing too hard. She fell back on carly's lap, laughing like a little girl.  Her face was turning red from her hysterics but she refused to say anything. Tears started streaming down her face as carly drove her crazy. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH IT HAHAHAHAHAH WASN'T A DAHAHAHAHAHAHATE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA STOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOP Akiza couldn't stop laughing nor could she control herself. Her legs kicked out widely and she could barely defend herself from carly's playful torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly just shook her head smiling. \"Wrong answer\" Akiza was crying from laughing so hard but a part of her was having fun. She didn't get too many chances to let loose and laugh like this. Her smile was wide and genuine and laughter rang out nonstop but she felt like a kid again. She never got to experience this before and a part of her wanted it to continue. Finally, she couldn't take it anymore. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA OHOHOHOHOK I DOHOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHHOHO With that carly stopped and let her breathe. Akiza's face was beet red from laughing and her having to admit her feelings. \"It's ok. I won't say anything\" Carly reassured. Akiza smiled and thanked her. Akiza snickered to herself. \"What's so funny\"? \"Hehehe I just realized. Aren't you the one crazy about jack\"? Now it was carly's turn to turn red. Akiza covered her mouth, laughing at the now embarrassed reporter. Carly growled and started tickling akiza again.

Heck, I was apparently a dark signer but I can't remember anything\". Akiza flinched back at her dramatics. \"She really needs to relax\" Akiza thought to herself. Suddenly, she had an idea. She remembered what luna told her what she and leo did to cheer each other up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza sat down next to her while she was calming down from her freak out session. \"You know, I learned a trick that might help you snap out of your funk\". Carly's eyes snapped over to her in anticipation. \"What do I do?\" Carly asked. \"It's simple, raise your arms\". Carly did so, still not catching onto her scheme.

But this is kinda fun, I guess I needed this\". Carly thought to herself through her hysterics. Tears flowed down her face as she laughed herself crazy but she was feeling better. She fell back on the couch, hugging herself in a vain attempt to guard herself from the playful assault. Minutes later and carly was a mess. Tears wouldn't stop falling. Her hair stuck to her face and her glasses had fallen off. She didn't have the energy to kick or flail her arms so she was simply lying there, taking the torture but she was enjoying herself. She knew she looked a mess but she didn't care. She hadn't felt this happy in a while so she really wanted to enjoy it just a little longer. Finally akiza stopped and let carly get herself together. After a few minutes, carly was back to her old self but that smile never left her face. \"I guess I needed that.

Akiza then scratched her nails on her belly, causing her to fall to the floor in silent laughter. \"Guess I found her tickle spot\" akiza thought. Carly was in tears and her laughter was non stop. Her legs kicked out aimlessly and she couldn't stop squirming. Suddenly she accidentally kicked akiza off her. While akiza rubbed her chest, carly was calming down from her laughing fit. She then became aware of what she did and frantically apologized. The two girls just laughed it off as an accident. Guess they both needed a laugh.</span></div></div>",

Akiza then shifted in her sleep, a smile hidden on her face. The twins couldn't help themselves and kept poking her for no real reason other then boredom. Unbeknownst to them, akiza had woken up when leo first poked her side. She had kept her eyes closed, hiding giggles. She put her face directly on the couch, muffling her giggles, enjoying the tickly pokes. Both kids were genuinely amused by this stupid antic of leo's. Akiza was no different. She was pretending to be asleep, muffling her giggling. Luna smirked and poked her armpits a few times. Akiza was now muffling whole laughing fits, kinda hoping they wouldn't stop. \"Oh man, it tickles\". Akiza thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she's really out of it\". Leo said. He then joined his sister, poking her underarms as well. Akiza felt herself tear up with muffled laughter and was slightly shuffling but keeping her weak spot unguarded. After luna got bold and wiggled her finger in her armpit:that was it.(heh,rhyme) Akiza lifted her head back on her hands, fully laughing, startling the kids. The kids jumped back, wondering whether they should run or not. Although they stopped, akiza couldn't stop laughing for a bit. When she finally got control of herself, she opened her eyes, looking at the slightly scared kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for? That really tickled\". Akiza said, unable to wipe that smile of her face. \"It was leo's idea\". Luna blurt out of fear. Leo looked at her betrayed, even tho it was true. She then got up and approached the trembling kids. \"guess I need to tell you kids what happens when i'm woken up\". The twins hugged each other out of fear. Then much to their surprise they found themselves laughing as she started tickling their bellies. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-HEHEHEHEHEY CUT IHIHIT OUT Both kids burst into hysterics as their shared weak spot was tortured. Akiza held a playful smile as she drove the kids crazy with laughter. Both fell to the floor, laughing harder every second. Leo rolled side to side while luna curled into a ball, crying with laughter. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OHOHOHOHOK  WERE SHAHAHAHAHAHARY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA PLEHEHEHEHHEHEASE WERE SOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHORY Akiza stopped and let the kids breathe. \"I forgive you kids, just don't do that again\".

Leo looked at his stopwatch and saw that she had lasted 9 minutes of nonstop tickling. \"It's been 9 minutes luna.\"Leo said, keeping his sister laughing. \"Still can't believe this is happening\". Leo thought to himself over his sister's cackling. She and akiza had decided to have another armpit tickle challenge tomorrow so she asked leo to help her build some resistance. It did help that the twins loved having their armpits tickled but they could only take so much. Luna was crying with laughter but she was having fun, even though in her melting mind she was training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually put her arms down, unable to take anymore.

Luna said tired but determined. Leo had a*seriously* look on his face. As much as he enjoyed making his sister laugh, but this was odd. \"Something wrong, Leo\"? Luna asked. \"I'm fine, it's just I can't believe this is happening\". Leo said. \"It's kinda strange I admit but it was kinda fun the last time we did this. *Smirks* Plus you can't deny this is kinda fun\".

If I can handle my stomach being tortured like that, I can handle whatever she throws out\". Luna said. She then smirked and surprise-attacked leo. \"And for the record, it' s our weak spot Leo\".

She was enjoying the sensation but because they felt more sensitive, she was having a harder time. Minutes of her hysteria and she was fully crying from laughing so hard. Tears streamed down her face as akiza didn't let up for even a second. Poor luna seemed to laugh louder every second, feeling more ticklish with every laugh that left her.

Leo got slightly red \"W-w-well not right away\" He looks away muttering to himself. Luna covered her mouth, giggling at her embarrassed brother. Leo then got a playful smile. \"Oh, that's funny to you huh\"? Without warning, he jammed his hands into luna's armpits, tickling her mercilessly. PFFT-BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH LEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEOHOHOHO QUHIHIHIHIHIT IHIHIHIHIHHIT Luna dropped her book and starting squirming on the couch as her brother tortured her. \"Still think it's funny\" Leo asked teasingly. HAHAHAHAHAHA MAHAHAHAHAHAYBE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Through her hysterics, she put her arms around her brothers neck, leaving her underarms exposed. The twins did this to each other when they felt like being tickled, luna more so then leo. Leo was tickle her whenever she teased him or when she wanted him too but she liked being tickled by him, especially on her armpits. She didn't know why but she liked being tickled there the most. Minutes later she was crying from laughing so hard but while she didn't say it, she was loving the ticklish attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo knew she was having fun, otherwise she would have told him to stop. \"Still not gonna apologize\"? Luna couldn't answer due to her laughter but she managed to shake her head in defiance. Leo smirked and dug in her armpits harder causing her to go into silent laughter. Her shoulders were shaking with mirth, tears streamed down her face. She was in heaven.*gasps* AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOK OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHK IM SOHOHOHOHOHOHORY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA With that leo stopped and let his sister breathe. She spent a good few minutes catching her breath. \"Ok maybe you can impress jack, but I don't see you beating him. Not yet at least\". Leo seemed satisfied with her words and smiled. \"Thanks sis. I'll show you I can be a heck of a duelist\". He proudly proclaimed. Luna then grew a playful smile. She quickly swiped Power tool dragon right of his hands. \"You might need this\" Leo and luna smiled at each other. Luna started running as her brother got up to get his dragon back. \"hahahaha gehet back her luna\" Luna just laughed as her brother playfully chased her.

Luna decided to get to know akiza while leo went with yusei.  This surprised them both as she thought he would go with jack to try and take him down. The two female duelist sat for a while and talked about their lives, how they're handling the dark signer aftermath and any new duel strategies. They eve couldn't help but flash back to their roller skating outing with yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea, I remember that. *snort* You hehehe sorry, I don't mean to laugh but hehehehe it was kinda funny\" Luna said. Akiza was less then amused. Suddenly she grew an evil smirk, similar to the one she would get when she lost control of herself. This got luna's attention and she got nervous. \"Uh*gulp* a-a-akiza, what's with that face\"? \"I just remembered, weren't you and leo laughing the whole time I needed help\". Akiza slowly inched towards the younger signer who in response stepped back, slightly scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we said we were sorry. That m-ma-makes it fine, right\"? Akiza raised her hands. \"I think you still need a lesson kid\". With those words she darted her hands into luna stomach tickling her mercilessly. Luna eyes went wide before a big dumb grin appeared on her face and she couldn't stop herself from laughing. HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEY STOHOHOHOHOHOP, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA IHIHIHIHIHIM TIHIHIHIHIHIHICKLISH Akiza dropped her whole black rose act and smiled playfully. \"Is that so? Isn't that a shame? Well you liked laughing then, so how about now\". Luna fell to the floor laughing hysterically. Curling into a ball as her worst spot was tortured, she was nearly crying from laughing so hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't say anything but despite the torture, she was enjoying herself. Both kids liked being tickled. Their armpits were their favorite tickle spot while their bellies were their worst. Akiza then moved to her armpits, that smile never leaving her face and luna laughing uncontrollably the whole time.What surprised akiza was when she hit her armpits, luna stopped resisting and just laid there enjoying it. Akiza stopped once she saw that. \"Luna, are you enjoying this\"? Eventually luna got control of herself. \"I-I am. Me and leo would do this to cheer each other up. Our armpits are our favorite for some reason\". She then turned red. \"I;m sorry for laughing at you that day. We should've helped you. Don't tell the others. Who knows what they might dohohohohohohoh-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Akiza couldn't help herself and started up again. \"Don't worry, I won't. And thank you for that. But i'm still teaching you a lesson for it\" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAHAHAHAHAHAHANKS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA With that said the room echoed with luna's laughter.

Still, there's only so much she can take right?\" Carly thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed and misty doubled over laughing herself to insanity. Tears fell endlessly and she was hugging herself, howling like a wolf. Thankfully for carly, her patience paid off. Misty was reaching her limit to how much she could take and her enjoyment was turning into to slight agony. With that misty finally broke.

After a small conversation the two decided to let bygones be bygones and misty had forgiven her, now that she knew the truth. As misty had hugged her, akiza accidentally brush her fingers along her stomach, getting audible snickers out of her.

Misty was laughing loudly, not caring hat she looks or sounds like. It's been to long since she felt this happy and she wanted to enjoy this for a little bit. Akiza then stopped and couldn't hold her question any longer. \"Misty, are you enjoying this?\" Misty slightly blushed and nodded. She explained that she loved having her stomach tickled after a bad day or to cheer her up. Her brother did it to her all the time and this just brought her back to those times. Before she could continue, akiza resumed her playful torment, sending misty back into hysterics. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-KKKKGEHEHEHEHE-HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AHAHAHAHAHA Akiza had to hide a smile at how something like this turned her into a child. Misty was hugging her tightly, laughing like a little girl but she was loving this. She hadn't laughed like this in months. Tears stained akiza's shoulders but akiza didn't mind. She was glad her new friend was laughing again. It was deserved after days of stress and fear.  Akiza soon stopped and allowed her to breathe.

Stephanie looked at the wannabe journalist annoyed and argued back that he was thinking of her instead. Knowing this was gonna go on for a while, carly got an idea. \"Maybe i've been hanging with those kids too much\" carly said and tickled her sides. Stephanie eyes widened before she burst out giggling. Hehehehehehehehe sthohoohhohop hehehehehehehehe yohohoho little heheheheheheheheheh hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe Her giggle fits proved to be too strong and she succumbed. Out of reflex she tried to slapped her hands away and guard herself but carly dodge and stepped behind her and switched to her ribs.

She ended flashing back to her childhood when her parents would tickle her ribs whenever she tried to hide from them when they were playing. She loved the feeling every time. It seems that hasn't changed as she never submitted to carly's demand. \"Well, you can only take so much right?\" Carly thought to herself. Minutes passed and she still never said anything.

I was tickled all the time by my parents when I was a kid. They'd always get my ribs of all places whenever we played together. I-I always did enjoy it when they tickle me.\" Stephanie said with a red face. Carly knew she had no room to talk. She had spent some time with akiza and the kids, having some fun tickling each other so she had no room to judge. \"I won't tell anyone. You're secret's safe with me.\" Carly reassured. Stephanie smiled gratefully but ended up laughing again as carly tortured her ribs again. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAHAHHATS TIHIHIHIHIS FOHOHOHOHOR \"Well, you did want me to.

She quickly found out that their armpits and belly were their tickle spots but they discovered her sides were her weak spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her laughing fits she still continued with their small joke. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FIHIHIHIHGHT HEHEHER CONTROL LUHUHUHUHNA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA IHIHIHIHT REHEHEHEALLY TIHIHIHICKLES Luna couldn't hold back a laugh. Her friend's mirth was contagious. \"I'm trying but it's hehe too strong\" luna said. Patty squirmed as her worst spot was tortured. Luna knew she was enjoying this. She couldn't control herself as well as the twins so she couldn't help but try to push her off here and there but she lost the strength to do so quickly. Minutes later, patty was starting to beg for her to stop. She may have liked it but she didn't have the twins endurance. Unlike them, she couldn't only take it for maybe 3 minutes before reaching her limit. Luna then stopped and allowed her to breathe, still holding a playful smile. Soon-</span></div></div>",

Leo flinched back but apologized nonetheless. \"Sorry, I just heard loud laughing and wondered what was going on.\" Leo said sheepishly. \"It's not a huge deal like you thought leo. I was just tickling her, hehe, she sounds like you whenever she screams.\" Luna teased. Leo gawked. \"I don't scream!\" Leo retaliated. The girls giggled at the flustered boy. \"I don't know. Luna told me whenever she gets your ribs, you scream like a girl. Patty said giggling. Leo turned slightly red while the girls couldn't help but laugh. He held back an evil grin and walked toward the laughing girls and tickled their belly(luna) and sides(Patty). The two fell back now cackling uncontrollably. \"You two think that was funny huh?\" Leo said over their howling. Luna leaned back on her hands laughing loudly while patty fell back on the bed hugging herself cracking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LEHEHEHEHEEHEHEO HAHAHAHAHAH QUIT IT HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LEHEHEHHEEAVE MY SIHIHIHIHIHIDES ALOHOHOHOHOHOHOHONE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ITS TOHOHOHOHOHO MUHUHUHUHUHUCH Luna was enjoying herself despite her howls while patty was reaching her limit unable to keep herself from trying to escape. Hoping to get on leo's good side, patty started tickling luna's sides, making the female twin laugh slightly harder. HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA PAHAHAHATTY HAHAHA YOU TRATIOR HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA Patty's plan thankfully work as leo now focused on luna who was now curled up trying to protect herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was now being doubled team by her friend and brother. The combined assault drove her mad with laughter as she could do nothing but howl. As much as she was having fun, her mind was melting under the team-up. Her eyes were flooding with tears of mirth, her face was becoming red and she was slowing losing her voice from laughing too hard. Feeling bad for his sister, who was quickly losing her mind, he switched back to patty's sides again. The girl in question instantly burst out laughing and doubled over. Luna attempted to recover from being tickled to near-death while watching her friend laugh herself silly. Once she caught her breath, she crawled on the bed behind her and hooked her arms in a full nelson. Leo stopped out of surprised. \"You know, she was the one who said you scream like a girl.\" Luna said with an evil look. Patty grew scared as she knew what was happening and the look on the twin's faces only confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo,wait please, I was just joking. Y-y-you wouldn't do this would you?\" Patty said out of desperation. Leo just gave the same evil grin his sister had. Without a word, leo plunged his hands into her sides. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-GAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA PLEHEHEHEHEHEHEASE NOHOHOHOHOHOHO MOHOHOHOOHHOHOHORE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I CAHAHAHAHAHAN'T TAHAHAHAHAKE IT Patty was in complete hysterics as her weak spot was tortured worse then before. The blonde was in tears and thrashed as she tried to get free but luna was stronger then she looked. Minutes later, she didn't have the energy to resist anymore and just sat there laughing endlessly. Her face became red and tears were forming in her eyes. Patty then realized that her laughter had become genuine and she was actually having fun. It tickled more then anything yet much to her surprise she was loving it. \"So this is why they do this.\" Patty thought to herself. Luna let go of patty to stretch her arms but was surprised when patty didn't try to escape. Instead she put her arms behind her head and leaned back against luna, laughing hysterically. Leo saw this as well and both twins looked at their laughing friend. She looked genuinely happy being tickled like this. \"Looks like someone's enjoying herself\" The twins thought. Luna soon joined double teaming her sides. Patty then succumbed to silent laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty was a broken laughing mess. Tears stained her face, she couldn't talk,and she couldn't make a sound. She was in a small paradise. She hasn't done anything that made her laugh this much. \"Maybe I should do this again. I never had this much fun before.\" Patty thought. After a while, she finally couldn't take it. She slapped at both pairs of hands, pleading for them to stop. HAHAHAHAH OK OK HAHAHAHA STAHAHAHAHAP HAHAHAHA I CAHAHAHAN'T BREHEHEHEATHE Despite her happy tone, the twins knew she meant it and they stopped. Patty had to take nearly 15 minutes to get her sanity back. She wiped away her tears, took several deep breaths and tried to push down any more giggles that threatened to surface. The twins helped her get up but were surprised when she got a sudden burst of energy from seemingly out of nowhere. \"Hahaha that was so much fun. No wonder you two do that.\" Patty said ecstatic. The twins were surprised but happy that she had fun. Both then burst out giggling as she lightly tickled their ribs. \"Next time, i'm getting you both back, you especially luna.\" hehehehehe ok ok hehehe She then stopped and smiled at them, excited to come over again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks later patty went over to visit the twins again. Leo wasn't home however, he was out with yusei and crow. That fact was fine with them. Hopefully they wouldn't be interrupted this time. Luna knew full well why patty visited and patty was giggly from the moment she stepped inside. Since she found out she loved being tickled too, she couldn't help but feel this way around them. \"Oh great leo, we turned her into a tickle lover.\" Luna thought to herself, unable to keep a slightly amused smile off her face. Since that day, she felt giggly and playfully kept on guard around them expecting them to sneak attack her. By the time school ended, she almost felt disappointed until she felt luna prod her sides,getting crippling giggles from her. Afterwords,, she invited patty over to which the blonde quickly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter heading to the living room, luna pulled out her deck and put it on the table. Patty looked confused. \"I have a game I think you'll enjoy. You have to predict what card i'm holding. If you guess right, you get to tickle me wherever you want, since you wanted to get me back.\" Luna said. Patty nodded, feeling excited by the games premise so far. \"But if you guess wrong, I tickle you wherever I want.\" Luna finished. Patty had a completely excited smile on her face and was eager to get started. Luna was surprised at her friend's eagerness but tried not to show it. \"Let's get started then. I draw. It's a monster card. What is it?\"Luna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty thought for a minute, realizing she didn't remember every card in her deck. \"I think Jerry beans man.\" Patty guessed. Luna revealed the card and it was the tuner monster-nettles. Patty pretended to be disappointed by her guess. \"With that said ,i'll get your sides.\" Luna said. \"My weak spot already? Alright then.\" Patty said and leaned back on her hands. Luna then tickled her sides sending patty into ticklish bliss. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHOHOHOHOH NOHOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHEHEHERE A minute later, she stopped and drew her next card while patty got over her giggle fit. \"Another monster, what do you think?\" Luna challenged. Patty thought for a bit before making her choice. \"Spore\"patty guessed. Luna revealed that it was in fact spore. Patty smirked and selected luna's armpits. \"Guess you get some payback for last time At least she picked my favorite spot, if she got my belly, i'd probably kick over my deck by accident.\"Luna thought. She then raised her arms behind her head and patty quickly went to town. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-PFFT-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH A OHOHOHOHK YOU HAHAHAHD YOUR FUHUHUHUN HAHAHA Patty then stopped giggling to herself. She couldn't help herself, this was fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls got there fair share of laughter between them. The next 10 cards were a mix of spells, traps and monsters. Patty got at least 4 of them right meaning she got to see where else her friend was ticklish. She got her belly, ribs, sides and neck. Suffice to say luna was a wreck as her weak spots(Belly and ribs) were tickled. Meanwhile patty ended finding out how ticklish she was on her armpits, belly, ribs and feet. Patty ended finding out she loved having her ribs tickled but ended up a hysterical sobbing mess when she found out how ticklish her feet were.\"Oh man, I had no idea I was that ticklish. When you got my feet, I thought I was gonna die laughing\" Patty said. Luna agreed as she held her stomach, which was sore from laughing so much. \"Well, I got to go. I promised mom i'd be home soon.\" Patty said waving. Luna waved goodbye and decided to rest. \"Man, even with leo I don't laugh this much\"Luna thought. Luna despite her soreness smiled. Something told her she was going to enjoy this.</span></div></div>",

Patty still had that excited smile as she and luna thought of another game for them. After heading into luna's room, they discussed what it was. \"I get it. It's basically who can take it longer.\"Patty said. \"Pretty much but there's a catch. We take being tickled on our favorite spot.\" Luna said surprising her friend. \"I see. Since we both like being tickled on a certain spot, who can take it there more.\" Patty said, squirming in excitement. A round of rock, paper scissors, and patty was going first. She leaned back on her hands, leaving her ribs open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then pulled out a timer and started it. With that, luna sent her friend into hysterics. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA THIS IHIHIHIHIS HAHAHA NOHOHOHOHTHING AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Patty threw her head back laughing happily as her ribs were prodded nonstop. Despite her hysterics, patty looked so happy. She never being tickled like this could be so much fun. \"She's really enjoying herself. Still, she can only take so much\" Luna thought to herself.  Minutes later, patty was tearing up from laughing so much. She had to fight the urge to protect herself out of reflex but otherwise kept herself unguarded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she couldn't stand it and finally slapped luna's hands away. HAHAHA OKOK THAHHATS IHIHIT HAHAHA NO MOHOHORE Luna stopped the timer and saw she lasted 6 minutes. Luna gave patty the timer and put her arms behind her head, leaving her armpits open. Patty started the timer and got to work making her friend laugh her heart out. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Luna couldn't help but admit, she's been having a lot of fun with patty. She liked being tickled by her brother but it was nice doing this with one of her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna laughed loudly. Sometimes, she forgot how ticklish her armpits were. After a while, tears formed at the corner of her eyes but she refused to give up. She was quickly finding it difficult to keep them up. She noticed she was laughing harder than usual. \"Did I get more sensitive doing all this with her?\" Luna wondered. With that thought lowering her guard, patty jammed her hands into her armpits, getting luna to shriek and finally put them down. As she caught her breath, patty was surprised to see she also lasted 6 minutes. Luna looked surprised. Normally, she could take it more but she didn't give it much thought. \"Guess we ended in a draw this time.\" Patty said. Luna caught her breath and nodded in agreement. Patty then said goodbye to luna and left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Patty looked away but luna noticed something. She leaned back on her hands and her shoulder were slightly shaking from holding back laughter. She wanted luna to tickle her. \"I think our habit rubbed off on you too much\" Luna thought but nonetheless went through with patty's request. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH THAHAHAHAHAHAHAHANK I NEHEHEHEHEHED THHIHIHIS  Patty laughed endlessly as her favorite spot was tickled mercilessly. The blonde was already starting to forgot why she was upset in the first place as she howled hysterically.  \"My best friend's a tickle lover. I don't know how to feel about this.\" Luna thought with a sweat drop. Minutes later patty's eyes were flooding with tears of joy. Her mind was melting under luna's playful assault. The fact that she couldn't help but ask for her not to stop probably didn't help with patty's uncontrollable laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde never felt so happy before.

Her face was stained with tears and her pigtails came undone allowing her fair to fall past her shoulders but that smile never went away.

Since this was her favorite spot, she knew she wasn't exactly torturing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna kept her hands tucked behind her head laughing in delight. Both girls were having a lot of fun together. Minutes passed and patty hasn't let up and luna couldn't stop laughing. She clamped her arms down out of reflex. She squirmed under her friend but couldn't escape. Her face was red from laughing so hard, yet that smile was completely genuine. Patty then moved down and sat on her legs and tickled her belly. Luna screamed before she burst into hysterics. Luna didn't have the energy to squirm so she just lied there howling like a wolf. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHOHOHT THEHEHEHEHERE HAHAHAHAHAHA ANYWHERE BUHUHUHUT THEHEHEHEHEHEHERE Patty giggled at her friend's pleads. She ignored them, wanting to enjoy this for a bit. And she knew luna did too. Minutes later, she was sobbing from laughing so hard. Tears streamed down her face as she  howled endlessly. Finally patty stopped and let luna get her sanity back. A few minutes later, luna was back to normal. Patty suggested a friendly duel but noticed a playful smile on luna's face. She then found herself laughing as luna got some payback. Their duel could wait for a few minutes. </span></div></div>",

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA LUNA HAHAHAHA YOU TRAHAHATIOR HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Patty looked up to see luna driving the black rose crazy, tickling her weak spot with vigor. The older teen kicked her feet and clamped her arms down, laughing loudly. Patty then joined in and with surprising strength, lifted akiza's arms over her head. She then pinned her hands under her and tickled her underarms as well. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHOHOHO HAHAHA THATS TOO MUHUHUHUHCH HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids held playful smiles as they drove the older girls to tears. 5 minutes quickly turned into 10 and akiza hadn't stopped roaring the entire time. Tears stained her red cheeks, her hairband had fell off, allowing her bangs to cover her eyes,yet she could do nothing but laugh. For most this would be torture but akiza was having a lot of fun regardless. Finally the girls stopped and got off of her. She spent a few minutes catching her breath and fixing her hair. Luna couldn't help but smirk at her, almost smugly. \"And that's why you lost the tickle contest we had last time akiza\" Luna bragged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza rolled her eyes while patty looked at her friend surprised. \"You guys had a tickling contest.\" Patty asked curious. Luna and akiza nodded and explained everything. How they barely convinced leo and carly to join in, who won, and what the contest was. They kept out what had happened afterwords. After hearing everything, she had the most excited looking smile luna had ever seen. Already having a feeling what that meant luna looked at her friend. \"You want to have a contest too, don't you?\" luna asked. Patty nodded, that smile still never leaving her face. Luna thought for a second and then shrugged in acceptance. \"Alright. I'm up or another one. But maybe next time. I'm still trying to breathe.\" Luna said. Akiza decided to head out. \"Well, i'm going to see how yusei and the others are doing. Good luck on your contest you two.\" Akiza said waving goodbye. Patty also decided to head out as well, greatly looking forward to next time.</span></div></div>",

Patty and luna were going to do the same challenge luna did with akiza a while back. Just the thought alone got the blonde excited. They walked into the living room and luna got out a timer. After explaining that they would see who could take having their armpits tickled the longest, patty immediately put her arms behind her head, giggling. The girl's heart was racing with excitement, she couldn't wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna just chuckled to herself at her friend's joy. Luna then started the timer and tickled her friend's armpits with vigor. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OH MAHAHAHAN THAT TIHIHCKLES HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Patty was quickly driven to hysterical laughter as her favorite spot was tormented. Luna couldn't help but smile. Her friend's mirth was contagious. The blond girl was in heaven. Unable to speak properly, all she could do was laugh loudly. She shook her head as she howled, her hair accidentally hitting luna. \"Quit haha shaking your head, you're hairs hitting me.\" Luna complained.  HAHAHAHAHAHAH SOHOHOHORY I CAHAHANT HEHEHELP IHIHIT HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Just for that luna sped up her efforts, getting loud gales of laughter from her tickle loving friend. Keeping her hands tucked behind her head, patty continue to howl hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her hysterics, all that could be seen on patty's face was pure joy. She felt nothing but genuine happiness as her friend gave her the tickling of her life. She roared with laughter, she felt her face turn red, she felt her stomach slowly become sore from her mirth, she didn't want her to stop. After what felt like hours pass, patty finally dropped her arms and fell to the floor weak from laughing. While she tried to regain her sanity, luna looked at the timer and saw that she lasted 11 minutes. \"Whoa, that beats my time by a long shot. She more ticklish but she can take it more then me and leo combined.\" luna thought. After patty got herself together, luna tucked her arms behind her head. Patty then started the timer and went to town on luna's favorite spot. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-PFFT-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Luna burst into laughter as her challenge began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was a little glad patty liked this too so at least they were both having fun. The blue haired signer laughed herself to the point of tears and even then she couldn't stop. Patty then smirked and sped up her efforts like luna did to her and luna was instantly tearing up from laughing so hard. Minutes passed and luna hadn't stopped laughing for even a second. Her stomach was starting to hurt from her laughter and her cheeks were bright red. \"Oh man, I don't think even leo made me laugh this hard\". Luna thought to herself. Her mind was melting under her assault and luna was actually having a great time. Nothing but laughter left her mouth and her eyes were flooding with tears. As much as she loved being tickled, she was reaching her limit and soon her arms flew down to protect herself. It took luna a few minutes to stop laughing. As luna winded down from her hysterics, patty stopped the timer and saw that luna had also lasted 11 minutes. \"I guess we're evenly matched in this but I know something I can beat you in.\" Luna said as she got her duel disks. Both girls smiled and raced outside for a friendly duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, patty continued coming over to have some laughs with her friend. Patty couldn't have been happier with luna.</span></div></div>",

Suffice to say, murphey's law screwed with her. After hearing about it, patty knew exactly what luna needed. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAHAHAHAHAHANKS PAHAHHAATTY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA Luna laughed endlessly as her weak spots were tortured non stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty held a playful grin as she drove her friend mad with laughter. Minutes later, luna was hugging herself crying with laughter as her feet were tickled as well. The twins never tickled each others feet before so they were surprisingly sensitive. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-GAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA Luna cackled up a storm but never pulled away, keeping her feet in patty's lap. Luna eyes were flooded with tears, her throat was starting to hurt from laughing so much, her feet were feeling ,more sensitive every second and yet she couldn't get enough. \"Leo, we have to do this one day.\" Luna thought to herself.

She was standing behind luna so the blue haired girl couldn't tell where she'd strike next. Patty's fingers were pinned in her armpits making her favorite spot even more sensitive. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH-GAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna laughed herself to tears yet she was having fun with her friend. It was becoming more difficult to not guard herself but she managed to resist. Doing this with patty for several days, luna had seemed to get more ticklish overtime, yet she didn't seem to mind. Tears were streaming down her face as she howled with laughter. It was intense, it was near torture, she couldn't stop laughing and she loved every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, patty managed to free her fingers and gave luna a much needed break. After a few minutes and luna getting her giggles under control, patty took a seat. Luna then stepped behind the chair and dug into her friend's ribs. BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OHOHHOHOHO NO NOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHERE Patty falsely pleaded through her hysterics. Luna knew sh was enjoying herself. While luna loved being tickled on her armpits, patty loved being tickled on her ribs. Patty leaned back on the chair laughing herself silly, loving every moment of her near torture. Luna still couldn't believe her friend loved being tickled as much as her and her brother. Not that she was complaining, she liked doing this with her. Minutes passed and patty was crying from laughing so hard. Her arms stayed on the armrest as she laughed uncontrollably yet she was loving this. She never thought she'd have this much fun with her friend. She'd probably have to thank leo for this. After a while, patty got a break. After a while they-</span></div></div>",

Patty asked. \"HAHAH PRHEHEHETTY HAHAHA CREATIVE HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" Akiza answered, roaring as patty got her armpits and hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, akiza was crying from laughing so hard. Patty really figured out how ticklish her pits were. Patty used a single finger in each one, driving the black rose to tears. Leo's laughter went silent as his sister poked his ribs and sipped her finger in his bellybutton. It helped that both twins knew each others tickle spots like the back of their hand. Leo was loving the torture while akiza was still getting use to this but she was starting to enjoy herself more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the two stopped and allowed them to catch their breath. Patty got akiza some water which she downed in a single gulp while luna helped her brother calm down from his laughing fits. \"How do you kids do this?

Both twins were equally ticklish but both of them loved being tickled so they could do this to each other for hours without getting bored.

How else can we do this?\" Luna thought to herself as leo left the room to think of dueling strategies for school tomorrow. Leo soon found her in her room, going through her duel cards, thinking of dueling strategies. Leo smirked as he snuck up behind his sister and tickled her ribs. Luna laughed out loud but never put her cards down to guard herself. In fact she kept looking through them ,laughing hysterically. Luna drew card after card as she laughed herself to tears.

Lying on her stomach she pined her hands under her chin, leaving her underarms exposed. She was barefoot as well. With this in mind, he started with her feet. She had told them that apparently they were just as ticklish as their armpits so they had to try it out. She remembered how she drove her brother to tears with light strokes. A sudden jolt snapped her out of her thoughts as she felt multiple fingers on her feet causing her to burst out laughing. Leo sat on her legs pinning her feet down, so she couldn't even think about kicking. Luna's light laughter filled the living room as her sensitive feet were tickled by her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to move up, he turned around and got her sides. Her laughter grew slightly louder as another sensitive spot was prodded. Their upper bodies always were their weakness. Leo couldn't help smiling as he listen to his sister laugh. He always enjoyed making her happy, regardless of what he had to do. He moves his hands to her weak spots:Her belly and ribs. Luna's eyes widened before the volume of her laughter spiked. She couldn't help but squirm under him but didn't fight back nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe buried her face in her arms, shoulders shaking with wild laughter. Her arms becoming slightly damp with her tears. Finally he reached her armpits. Tears were now freely flowing down her face as her favorite spot was tormented. Her legs kicked, snorts intertwined with her cackles. She was loving every second of her playful torture. Minutes passed as her torture went on and leo had never seen his sister look so happy. Despite her red, tear-stained face, he had never seen a bigger smile on her face. Both of them were wondering if akiza or carly could handle something like this. They didn't know how ticklish they were. Soon enough, leo felt something hitting his leg. \"HAHAHAHAHA OK HAHAHA OK HAHAHAHAHAH STAHAHAHAHAP IM GOHOHOHOHNA PEHEHEHEHEHEHE.\" With that said, leo stopped while luna ran to the bathroom.

Akiza then burst out laughing as her feet were now tortured by the younger girl. \"So feet and armpits break her. Hope this isn't too much for her.\" She then looked up and saw that akiza looked so happy. Her laughter was completely unrestrained and she had a complete joyful smile.

Akiza held backs barks of laughter and tickled luna's belly. The younger signer's eyes widened before she burst out laughing. She let go of akiza belly and attempted to guard her weak spot but akiza was quicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaved the younger signer into her lap and kept her both her hands pinned in her grasp. Using one free hand, she tortured the girl's weak spot with gusto. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHEHHEHERE Luna howled with laughter but she was enjoying herself. She still attempted to squirm free but akiza kept her hands in a firm grip. She then switched to her underarms. Luna then fell against akiza, no longer squirming but still laughing all the same. \"You squirm when it's your belly but relax when I get your armpits. I learned that much after our last go.\" Akiza said teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna couldn't respond since she was laughing so hard. Testing her theory further, she let go of luna's arms and allowed a smug smirk to appear when luna never put her arms down. Luna was too busy roaring with laughter to notice. It felt like her fingers were everywhere, not a single one letting up. Her face was turning red from laughing so much and yet, she didn't want her to stop. Her tickle fights with patty had made her favorite spot a bit more sensitive then usual and yet she learned she could take it for what felt like hours before needing a break. Nearly 30 minutes passed and luna was loving every minute. She was crying tears of joy, and she couldn't stop herself from begging for more. Akiza was surprised at the girl's endurance. She was going to stop a while ago but luna wanted her to keep going. Akiza knew that if she challenged luna to another tickle contest, she was lose. Finally akiza stopped and allowed luna to regain her sanity. Afterwards-</span></div></div>",

At first luna thought she was challenging her, which she would've accepted, but she was waiting for luna to get payback. Akiza's eyes were closed as she waited. She couldn't help but giggle to herself both nervous and excited. Luna snuck down to her feet and scribbled her fingers over her size 10 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza burst into giggling fits as her newly discovered favorite spot was tickled playfully. Her smile grew wider, showing her pearly whites. Luna smirked and quickly jammed her hands into her armpits. Loud blissful laughter escaped her lips as her weak spot was tortured. Usually she would pull away but she kept her arms still, wanting to enjoy this. Luna sat on one side of her, using one hand to get one foot and her other hand to ticklee her armpit. Akiza's laughter volume spiked as both her favorite and weak spot were tickled by her younger friend. Tears started leaking out as she howled but managed to keep herself unguarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza's mind was melting under luna's playful assault. Minutes of laughter passed and she was nearly crazy. Her hair was covering her red, teary eyes. Her face was stained with tears of joy as her laughter became silent.

She was enjoying herself, but she wanted to get her back but she was laughing too hard to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza then let her feet go and pounced onto her belly.

Finally, luna fell back, completely submitting to her mad laughter. Her arms were spread out to her sides, unable to find the strength to move them. Tears almost making a puddle on the floor.

She stopped torturing luna and hugged herself, trying to squirm away from whoever was tickling her. Luna took the time to wipe her eyes and she saw... \"Leo, you're here.\" Luna said panting. Akiza soon fell onto her side laughing heartily as leo jammed in his in her armpits. While akiza was curled into a ball, luna took the time to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her sanity back luna joined her brother. Akiza roared with laughter as the twins double teamed her. Leo kept up his armpit assault, luna attacked her ribs and belly. Akiza howled with laughter but a part of her was thinking: This was so worth it. Minutes passed as leo helped luna get revenge. Akiza was crying with laughter, still not regretting what she did, and kind of starting to enjoy the torture. Eventually akiza managed to push the twins off her. After catching her breath, she got a playful grin and ran towards luna. Luna couldn't help but giggle and ran away. Running into a nearby room, akiza ended up stopping when leo was there to block her advance. \"Leo, you know how this ends right?\" She asked smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo didn't say anything but akiza could tell he was refusing to move so she did what he kinda expected. She plunged her hands into his armpits. She knew they loved being tickled there but luna had a limit so he did too. Leo burst out laughing but kept his hands out blocking akiza as much as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know luna had gone through the room and appeared behind her. She slowly made her way towards akiza who was busy driving leo mad with laughter. She didn't have to tip-toe that much since leo was laughing so loud. \"Come on leo, just let me through and this stops.\" akiza said, now attack his belly. Leo just shook his head, laughing loudly. He knew where luna was and was more then willing to keep up the act until she struck. \"Hurry up luna. This tickles really bad.\" Leo thought laughing harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if hearing his thoughts akiza burst out laughing as luna struck. Hahahahaha not agahahahain hahahahaha pfft-hahahahaahhaha Akiza doubled over laughing as luna goosed her ribs. Leo took this as his cue to run. Akiza then broke free of luna;s ticklish grasp and tried running after leo but was block by luna. Akiza then did the same thing to luna while leo was sneaking up on akiza. As luna laughed her heart out, akiza couldn't help but smile at their little game. Her smile once again turned into laughter as leo attacked her armpits. Akiza fell to her knees laughing as her weak spot was tormented. Luna then took her turn and ran away giggling. Akiza tickled leo's belly forcing him off her as she tried running after luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes akiza played along with the twins little game. One twin ran away while the other took akiza's tickle torment blocking her off while the other pounced on her. The three were all having a lot of fun, especially akiza. She was actually starting to enjoy it when the twins tickled her. Soon they noticed while the other twin ran away akiza would let the other twin tickle her a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later the three were lying on the floor panting, with smiles on their faces. \"Can we do that again?\" Leo asked. The three looked at each other and grinned. Laughter filled the house as the three continued their game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who else?</span></div></div>",

Carly slightly blushed, sensing where this was going and mentally braced herself. \"Well, yea. I guess you weirdos influenced me.\" Carly said.

Luna decided to explain. \"Me and leo did something like this with akiza. Although this was kinda improvised during a tickle fight we had.  You tickle me and get me to let go.\" Luna said, bracing herself. Carly was surprised at this game. This was a little more creative then the previous games they played.  With that in mind she tickled the girls armpits. Luna nearly doubled over from the force of her laughter but she refrained. From doubling over that is. Luna burst out laughing the moment carly started. Her armpits still sensitive from earlier. Deciding to mess with the younger girl, she scribbled her fingers on her sides and goosed her ribs. Luna simply laughed louder but refused to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to finish it, she got her wrapped her hands around her like a hug and tickled her belly. Luna nearly cried from laughing so hard. Despite the torture she was being put through she was loving this. Despite knowing this was a game, she didn't want her to stop. Minutes of her hysterics later, luna finally conceded. She put her arms down, attempting to protect her weak spot. It did take a while for her to do so since carly didn't let go for a bit, something luna was slightly grateful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon carly let her breathe. While luna got herself together, carly assumed the same position. Pushing her arms against the sides of the door. Luna was quickly on her, attacking her sides. Carly burst into laughter, arms already shaking. \"She found my favorite spot already. Man she's good.\" Carly thought laughing happily. Luna soon noticed that she wasn't even struggling that much. Snickering like a weasel, luna slipped behind her and got her ribs and armpits, hoping to surprise her. It almost worked but she didn't buckle. Carly roared with laughter, enjoying the friendly and competitive tickling. Luna then got her belly, thinking that would end it. Much to her surprise it didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was roaring with laughter but she still never let go. Tears weren't leaking from behind her glasses despite her increasing laughter. Minutes passed and luna finally stopped, her fingers starting to get tired. \"Why'd you stop? haha Keep going\" Carly said, surprising the younger girl. The older girl had an excited and happy grin. She was more then eager for luna to continue. Luna smiled, remembering how they turned patty into a tickle lover as well. \"Guess it was only a matter of time.\" Luna thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes of blissful laughter passed and carly looked like she was on top of the world. Luna kept up her armpit assault, keeping the reporter a laughing fool. Eventually carly dropped her arms hugging herself laughing hysterically. After a few minutes carly finally got herself together.

Carly was nearly doubled over as luna tortured her favorite spot without mercy. Moving onto her armpits, carly's laughter seemed to increase. She almost seemed to get more ticklish as this went on. Carly shook her head as she howled, her hair accidently hitting luna. Just for that, luna attacked her belly. Carly fell to her knees, laughing harder and harder. This was on her weak spot and yet, she was loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly 25 minutes passed and luna decided to give her a break. Carly took a bit to calm herself, as much as she wanted her to keep going. Luna decided to take her turn and carly was on her almost instantly. Luna burst into adorable hysterics as carly attacked her armpits. Carly scribbled her fingers wildly on the younger girl's hollows keeping her laughing. She decided to keep it up here mostly since she was aware luna loved having her armpits tickled. The blue-haired girl appreciated it and simply laughed herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she couldn't keep standing and fell to the floor laughing herself to tears. She barely managed to tuck her hands behind her head, laughing harder every second. Her tickle fights with patty seemed to make her more ticklish but she didn't mind, she loved being tickled. Soon carly stopped for her turn and leaned back on her hands. Playfully looking away, while exposing her belly. Luna snorted amused and complied. Carly threw her head back laughing happily. Carly seemed to laugh louder then usual but didn't move away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass as the two girls take turns being tickled to near insanity.

They spent a few minutes laughing and joking about their duel strategies and other weird moments they saw during school. Eventually things got quiet and patty then started giggling about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Lep asked. Patty stifled another giggle. \"Just remembered seeing luna tickle you and you nearly screamed like a girl\" Patty got out before cracking up. Leo's face flushed red. \"I-I DON'T SCREAM A GIRL!\" Leo shouted, embarrassed and annoyed. Patty stopped herself but couldn't stop grinning. \"You're right. Squealing is more like it\" Patty teased. Leo then pounced on the blond, tickling her. \"I'll show you who's a squealer\" Leo said, tickling patty mercilessly. Patty flailed around on the couch, roaring with laughter. He attacked her ribs and sides, keeping the blond girl hysterical. She couldn't even attempt to tickle him back due to laughing so hard but she didn't really want too. Not yet anyway, this was fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes of hysterical laughter later, leo got off her and sat on the other side of the couch, slightly pouting. Patty panted, with a happy smile on her face. Patty then scooted closer to leo and poked his sides. Leo kept his arms crossed attempting to keep his pouting figure but was barely fighting back giggles. He started to smile more and more as patty kept it up, eventually his withheld giggles became bright laughter. He doubled over, hugging himself, as patty got his ribs as well. Patty smirked to herself as she effortlessly cheered him up. Both him and luna loved being tickled so while he didn't say anything he was welcoming the playful torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and both kids laughed hysterically as they took turns tickling each other.

Patty laughed louder as leo was tickling a more sensitive spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later leo had patty cackling up a storm as he tickled her ribs. Patty laughed out loud as her favorite spot was tormented sending her into her own personal heaven. Her belly was tormented as well, increasing her laughter. 20 more minutes passed and leo stopped the timer, letting her breathe. Patty took a few to get her sanity back. \"I hope we do another round. That was fun. Thank goodness he didn't get my feet.\" Patty thought. Leo took his turn and barely got a minute to brace himself as patty pounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo burst into laughter as patty got his belly and sides. Patty grinned as she had the male twin laughing like a little kid. \"You're squealing.\" Patty teased. \"HHAHAHAHA SHUHUHUT UHUHUHUHUHP\"  Leo yelled out. He couldn't help but feel embarrassed at her little joke but was laughing too hard to say anything else. Patty rolled her eyes knowing she had won that round and knowing that this would cheer him up in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the remaining 10 minutes, patty tortured his armpits, keeping him roaring with laughter. Patty grinned as leo's arms sprawled out to the side as he relished the ticklish feeling his armpits were suffering. \"I knew it. You were hoping for this weren't you?\" Patty thought. Patty knew the twins well enough that tickling their armpits would keep them laughing for hours and they would love every second. The moment they were attacked, the twins would basically accept their ticklish fate. Patty grinned as she saw that it had more then 15 minutes. \"He doesn't need to know, I doubt he would care anyway. Luna wouldn't.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after nearly 30 minutes patty stopped. Leo panted with a completely blissful smile. \" I knew it. He enjoyed that.\" Patty thought smug. Patty decided to leave and waved by to a still tired leo. \"I'll let luna know what happened and i'm sure they'll have some fun when she gets back.\" She thought snickering.</span></div></div>",

Her pigtails had come undone, allowing her hair to cover her eyes blinding her. Her face was red from laughing so hard but she refused to say anything that might stop it or pull away, wanting to relish this feeling for a while. Carly was amazed how how much the kid could take. \"Were the kids holding back on me and akiza during those contests? Well, two can play at that game.\" Carly proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stopped tickling luna, allowing the younger girl to regain her sanity, slightly disappointed that she stopped. She then saw carly sprawled out on the floor, similar to she luna just looked, waiting for luna to tickle her back. She didn't have to wait long. Luna pounced on her belly, getting near hysterical laughter from the reporter. Luna smiled like an imp as she got her playful revenge. Her fingers scribbled over her weak spot at surprising speed, keeping her laughing like a little girl. Carly roared with laughter but kept herself unprotected enjoying her little tickle punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes flew by as carly laughed herself to near tears.

It wasn't until she befriended akiza and the others that she experienced this again. Her eyes starting welling with tears of mirth as luna switched to her sides. Carly fully submitted to her mad laughter, a part of her hoping it wouldn't end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, luna still hadn't stopped tickling her sides.

She was so gonna do this to akiza. Maybe the they could have a proper tickle challenge with the twins. Or at least one of them. After a few more minutes of heaven, luna stopped.

Akiza tickled leo's belly button and goosed his ribs, getting guffaws out the younger boy. Luna screamed as carly squeezed her sides and tickled her armpits.

The older girl sawed her fingers between her toes, keeping her laughing. Leo roared as akiza never let up on his belly button, but also got his feet as well. Their laughter bounced of the walls, nearly making the two older girls think someone would hear them and think something bad was happening. They couldn't help but feel slightly annoyed that they still never broke. Both kids kept themselves unguarded, enjoying every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later, the kids were crying from laughing so hard. The teens tormenting their bellies and ribs to the point they would probably pee but still never gave up. Despite this being a contest, the twins were hoping this wouldn't end. This tickled like mad but they didn't want it to stop. This was the most fun they've had over the past several weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 20 minutes passed and the twins have now lasted an hour of non stop tickling. Both of them succumbed to silent laughter, tears streaming down their faces as they never got a break. Both teens had made the mistake of tickling their armpits for the last several minutes, forgetting they loved it there the most. The kids couldn't talk, they could barely think. All that left them was silent howls of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after another 10 minutes, the twins finally got them to stop. Carly stopped the timer while akiza helped the kids calm down from their laughing fits. They had lasted 70 minutes.

Leo answered the door and saw patty standing there, with a friendly grin and her hands behind her back. Leo let her in and they went back to the couch. \"Is everything ok? I heard laughing and it sounded like someone fell.\" Patty asked curious and concerned. \"Just another tickle fight, patty. We're fine. Just getting leo to admit he screams like a girl.\" Luna explained/teased. \"And i'm getting luna to admit I don't\" Leo snapped back. Both twins suddenly burst into giggle fits as patty tickled their sides simultaneously. \"I don't know. You both sound like you squeal.\" Patty teased. Both twins leaned back on their hands, enjoying the playful tickling. \"We're so getting her back but for now-\" Leo thought. \"Let's just enjoy this.\" Luna finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of enjoying her playful teasing both twins pounced on the blond girl. They double teamed her ribs and sides, getting her laughing loudly. \"We really rubbed off on her. Watch this.\" Luna said as leo watched. Luna lifted a cackling patty's arms onto her head and leo had a slightly agape jaw as patty left them there. \"Wow you weren't kidding.\" Leo said over patty's cackles. Patty left her hands on her head, leaving her upper body exposed. The blond girl laughed herself to tears as the twins got her whole upper body. She ended up squealing with laughter as they double teamed her ribs.  \"HAHAHAHAHAHA MOHOHOHORE GEHEHET MY RIHIHIHBS MOHOHOHOHORE HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\" Luna rolled her eyes smiling while leo was surprised at the sudden outburst. \"Yea, she does that when we get her ribs long enough. It rubbed off on me when she got my armpits a while ago\". Luna explained to a still surprised leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes of hysterical laughter later, the twins stopped and let patty catch her breath. \"That never stops being fun to me.\" Patty thought to herself as she tried to calm down. She looked over and saw the twins, leaning back on their hands, pretending not to see her. Patty could see them try to suppress excited and amused grins. Both twins burst out laughing as she got their bellies. Leo fell back as his belly was the more sensitive of the two while luna remained upright, laughing herself silly. Leo tucked his hands behind his head as patty got his armpits. Patty soon did the same to luna who fell back next to her brother laughing blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours pass as the kids went back and forth, driving each other to tears, they all stopped and took a break.

We see who can take being tickled all over while standing like this. I'll even go first since i'm like this already.\" Carly said, feeling confident and a little excited.

Akiza stepped behind her and raised her finger till they just barely grazed her armpits. Carly lightly squealed as she felt her fingers barely graze her hollows.

Akiza scribbled her fingers in carly's pits while the twins squeezed her sides and poked her belly. Carly burst out laughing the moment they started but kept herself unguarded. Her hands practically clenched her own hips as her body shook with hysterical laughter. She nearly buckled as she felt leo poke her bellybutton, made even worse by luna squeezing her sides. Akiza increased her speed on her armpits, making keeping herself open harder every second. Carly was laughing herself to tears but oddly enjoying the competitive tickling she was receiving. That feeling wasn't helping much as her belly was now being prodded by all three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take too much, she finally fell to her knees covering her weak spot.

Minutes passed and both twins were tearing up, roaring with blissful laughter. Carly could tell that they were enjoying themselves. Both of them no longer squirmed and struggled. Both of them completely submitted to carly's torture, laughing themselves breathless. The kids laughed endlessly, both having fun with the older girl. The past several weeks they've influenced her and akiza with their tickle antics. Previously both her and the black rose probably could've cared less about being tickled, now they couldn't get enough. \"I don't whether to thank them or chew them out. Meh, I'll cross that bridge when I get there.\" Carly thought over the kids mad laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually luna put her arms down, still too sensitized from their tickle fight. With that carly stopped and announced leo as the winner. \"Well to be fair, you were still recovering from your last tickle fight.\" Leo said, as he helped his sister calm down. Luna smiled at him grateful for his help and concern. The twins then decided to head home while carly went to see what  steph and mina were up too..</span></div></div>",

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAHAHAHT ALL YOU GOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOT Carly was at a disadvantage. Patty was super ticklish on her ribs but loved being tickled there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's belly was her weakness and she couldn't take it for very long. Two minutes later carly was flailing, doing anything to get the smaller girl off her. Barley able to concentrate due to her hysterics and her vision clouded by her laughter induced tears. Patty had a playful grin as she drove the older girl crazy. Starting to fell bad for going a little far and starting to feel like being a lee, she allowed carly to catch her breath and sat back waiting for carly to get payback. She didn't have to wait long. Carly instantly pounced on the girls ribs and sides getting crippling laughing fits from the younger girl. Patty remained sitting up, leaning back on her hands laughing without a care as her weak spots were tortured. She may or may not have \"accidentally\" let that info slip. Carly held a wide grin as she drove her tormentor to tears. Patty was roaring with laughter, clearly enjoying the playful payback.

Carly shook her head sighing as she was roped into another one of these. But she couldn't deny the last time she did this was pretty fun. Patty didn't even waste time and practically jumped to her feet and spread her arms out to her sides. \"This one's different. You tickle my whole upper body Whoever last longest gets to tickle the other for 5 minutes but the victim gets to choose. Patty explained. Carly shook her head again barely keeping an amused grin from forming. \"Luna rubbed off on you more then I thought.\" Carly thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly pulled out her phone and started a timer. With that done she plunged her hands into patty's underarms. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAHAHAHAHAHAHATS NOHOHOHOHOHOHTHIHIHIHIHNG Patty insulted her skills through her hysterics. Patty's armpits weren't her worst spot but they were ticklish enough to keep her laughing. Carly then switched to her sides and was rewarded with more loud laughter. She saw patty's arms lower but they went right back up as she laughed her heart out. She tried her belly but was disappointed when her laughter was lowered to soft giggles. She then attacked her ribs bringing her laughter back to full volume. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA MY FAHAHAHAVORITE SPHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Her laughter returned but she still didn't submit. Carly upped the pressure causing her to nearly drop her arms. Her resolve was weakening and her laughter was growing stronger. Eventually she submitted and dropped her arms laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out she had lasted about 10 minutes. Carly knew she had lasted that long before but this was their whole upper bodies this time. She knew once patty got her stomach(her weakness) it was over. She took a deep breath and spread her arms out waiting both nervous and excited. Starting the timer patty started out on her armpits as a bit of payback. PFFTHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-PFT-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Carly's armpits were a bit more sensitive then patty's. Deciding to spite her, patty was tickling her in the same spots in the same order as carly did to her. Moving onto her sides, carly's laughter reduced to hysterical giggling. hehehehehehehehehehe thahahat tiiihihihihiihhickles hehehehehehehehehehe Patty gained an evil grin as she got her belly, causing her to burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFTHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAH NOHOHOHHOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHERE GAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Carly attempted to keep her arms up to no avail. She clamps them down quickly to guard her weak spot. Patty sees that she had lasted about 10 minutes as well so they were tied. Both sat don on the floor where carly was attempting to catch her breath and get her laughter under control. \"Well we tied so how do we do this now?\" Patty asked.

All carly did was offer a kind smile and let her know she'd be fine. \"Give me all you got. I can take it.\" Carly said boasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told she was still kinda nervous but she was feeling pretty playful after that game of theirs. She sat back on her hands, allowing full access Patty was hesitant but soon went through with her request and got started. In an instant her fingers were flying over the reporter's stomach. Carly's body shook with laughter as the younger girl held back nothing. Patty scribbled her fingers everywhere even poking inside her belly button. Carly's eyes were glued shut behind her glasses but tears were starting to leak from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was practically vibrating which only served to tickle her worse. The room shook with her howls but she never tried to guard herself, willing to go through with the 5 minutes. Soon time was almost up and carly was wild with laughter. Her face was red and stained with tears. Her hair stuck to her face as she roared with laughter. Patty finally stopped as time was up. Carly was still giggling hysterically covering her belly. Soon she was able to get herself together. \"Oh man that tickled.\" Carly thought trying to control her breathing. Despite being super ticklish on her belly, she enjoyed being tickled. \"So, now what do you want to do?\" Carly asked, finally recovered. Patty soon assumed the same position carly did. Naturally carly got the message and from a distance all you'd hear is a young girls loud laughter.</span></div></div>",

With a devious grin, she slipped her hands up her shirt tickling her bare skin. Patty's eyes widened before she succumbed to silent laughter. Tears started streaming down her face as she was busy dying from laughter. Carly's hands never left her ribs for even a second. Patty's smile almost seemed to widen as the minutes slowly ticked by. For what felt like forever, she squealed, laughed herself to tears and she loved every second. Finally five minutes was up and carly stopped to let her breathe. For a bit, patty just couldn't stop laughing. She could still feel carly's fingers on her. Finally she was starting to regain her sanity. \"That was awesome. I never knew I was that ticklish.

Tears started falling as luna silently howled as her weak spot was tortured. Patty wasn't worried about her. She knew thanks to leo that she was loving this. It never failed to surprise her how much stamina she had. Leo told patty she once asked him to tickle her to cheer her up after a few bad days. Luna ended up laughing her sorrows away for about an hour. The was a wreck by the time she finally asked him to stop but she couldn't have felt better. Speaking of which, patty noticed luna was completely sobbing from laughing so hard. \"She's more ticklish here then I thought.\" Patty thought surprised. Finally patty topped and allowed her friend to breathe. Luna spent a good 5 minutes catching her breathe and wiping away any tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Patty asked. Luna simply nodded, unable to wipe a smile off her face. \"Will you be?\" Luna thought to herself as she tickled patty's belly. Hehehehehehey heheheheheheheheheheheh Hahahahahahahahahahahaha nohohohohoho fahahahahahahahahir Patty leaned back on her hands allowing her belly to be prodded. Unlike the twins, patty's belly was her favorite tickle spot. Patty threw her head back and laughed in delight, enjoying the feeling. Patty started tearing up slightly from her laughter and luna barely started. \"In a way, she's almost as ticklish as me.\" Luna thought. For the next few minutes the girls seemed to abandon their joke and just had fun making each other laugh.</span></div></div>",
