            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not that long ago in another land far far away, there exists a city named Dreamer's Gate. To call this city \"quite large\" was rather like saying the Himalayas are \"a little tall\" or that the North Pole was \"a bit chilly\". For it was a sprawling metropolis, notable for precisely three things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1; The surroundings ranged from the tallest skyscrapers to the flattest plains, the hottest deserts to the cold tundras and the dullest, most non-descript buildings for which \"absolutely average\" was the sole fitting description to frankly bizarre structures that seemed to have not followed any sort of plan whatsoever when they were constructed (in fact these buildings were often shifting and changing in how they were arranged and sometimes where they were situated, to the point where the people who made the maps pretty much had the worst jobs in the city). It was as if whatever great being who created this place had just decided to throw everything they had available together with little to no planning or foresight at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2; The population of the area was exceptionally diverse. Living alongside ordinary humans were several species of aliens, fairies, elves, dwarves, Hobbits, robots, vampires werewolves, ghosts, humans with magical powers, humans with superpowers, dragons, anthropomorphic animals, along with an assortment of beings far too weird to even begin to describe. While racial tensions were not non-existent, for the most part they were on amiable terms, forming friendships, rivalries, partnerships, romantic relationships and sometimes having children with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd 3; At the centre of the city was the high school known as Crossover High, which along with Ouran Academy (which was the sort of school were, apart from the odd student who did exceptionally well in their schoolwork, only the children of millionaires and billionaires could get in) and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (where the majority of those within the city who where young and had magical abilities learned their craft) was one of the most prominent educational establishments in Dreamer's Gate. This school was noticeable A) because of the incredibly diverse range of subjects and courses it covered and B) because the school courtyard had a fountain with figures of a mermaid, a golem, a phoenix and an angel standing next to each other in the middle of it, each one clutching a sphere in their respective appendages. It was nothing short of eye-catching, and generally one of those things that no one ever forgets. And from one morning onward until the end of their life, the protagonist of our tale will certainly never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha looked around the courtyard, dressed in her uniform (which consisted of a white dress shirt, a dark grey vest with the symbols of earth, wind, water and fire on the left breast, a light grey and blue tie, a dark grey knee-length skirt, white stockings and black dress shoes) with her shoulder-length brown hair kept out of her eyes with two yellow hairclips.  She made her way towards the main building, her brown eyes gazing intently at every aspect of the school.  From the iconic fountain to the bizarre architecture, everything was facineting to the young girl who up until today had spent her life at home.  She couldn't help but smile and be in awe about how different things were going to be from here on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then.....</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hi.  So this is just something I came up with, partly out of sheer boredom but mainly because I wanted to have a go at doing a high school AU.  For a POV character you can chose either one of your favourite characters from one of your favourite fandoms or create your own character of either gender.  Feel free to use your imagination, but please remember these rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1:  While a lot of high school AUs tend to make their setting just like the real world, I think it might be interesting to explore what it would be like if some of the more fantastic elements were kept. So magic, aliens, robots, time travel, vampires, fairies, superpowers, all that sci-fi/fantasy/horror/whatever jazz, is encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:  I don't really care whether or not you play this straight, parody it, deconstruct certain elements or whatever.  But if you intend to start off light hearted and then take it into darker and edgier territory, try to build up to it rather than just have it be abrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3:  If you must swear, then use descretion. A few swear words here and there are ok, but this work will not be improved by having all the characters going off like sailors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand 4:  Regardless of your choice for a POV character, remember not to make your character a Mary Sue.  A good character needs flaws as well as strengths for the story to work.  No one is going to bother with your entries if they are just an excuse for a blatant ego trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all I have to say about that.  Not much else to say apart from just add what you want to add and enjoy.</td>",
