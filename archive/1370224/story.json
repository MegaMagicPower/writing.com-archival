The road between Ingleton and Hawes was mostly snow covered.  Claire saved us from disaster ten minutes into the walk by asking whether I had turned off the car lights - I hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light at the start of the walk was fantastic.  Blue skies above, two inches of snow on the ground and glowering clouds in the distance.  Whernside behind, with the imposing Victorian viaduct and Ingleborough ahead, looking sheer, rocky and white.  Whilst snow is beautiful, it is also hard walking.  The ascent to the ridge was difficult.  Hugely steep, so it would have been challenging anyway, but the snow had covered all rocks, holes and marsh so it all looked one - causing many a slip and disappearing foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't get to the top (third attempt, third failure) because the weather was too severe.  No visibility and hard, bitter snow.  Still, once we made the decision not to go further, Claire got out a bottle of sherry and glasses.  I retrieved paper hats and one of those party blower things and we celebrated Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing down was easier, but at points I was convinced my lips had frost bite.  Of course it was beautiful weather at the bottom.  Again, crisp, clear - the best sort of winter's day.</span></div></div>",

The beginning of the walk skirted a lake on a nature reserve, which has been converted from a redundant colliery.  I was hoping for comical duck-landings as they skidded on the ice, but it wasn't cold enough to have iced over the lake (and there was a lack of ducks, though I did hear laughing mallards at one point).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust past the lake was scrubland on reclaimed spoil heaps and down to our left an alien landscape of a shallow half frozen lake with a pitch black swathe of coal dust leading away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLedsham was worth a visit.  It has the oldest building in West Yorkshire; an Anglo-Saxon church dating from the eighth century.  It was clear from the exterior that there were some ancient parts to it.  The bottom of the tower exuded age, with its low, narrow arched door and tiny windows.  Quite a few bricked up windows immediately above fifteenth century, larger pointed windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside were a group of effigy statues all swept into one corner.  One ornate lord from 1671 with his armour and ruffs holding a skull.  A woman, who I took to be his wife, had lots of cleavage in a pose too sensual for a monument to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stopped at the village pub - The Chequers Inn - for a quick half.  Packed, but pleasant.  Real fires, low ceilings, wooden panelling, a good beer on offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back to the car was muddy; the sun had had long enough to defrost the ground.  A pleasant, if unspectacular, walk.</span></div></div>",

It was icy and hard underfoot at the beginning of the walk.  We followed a small stream downhill to the remains of a lead mining complex - ruined stone arch entrances, fingers of ventilation shafts pointing upwards, eroded valley banks.  The ford at which we were to cross the stream was too deep and the water too fast, so we went a little up stream and made judicious use of rocks.  Claire got half a bootfull of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we hit the Nidderdale Way the walk became populous - until then it had been sunlit solitude.  Down past more mine remnants, then along a clear path with patchwork fields in the distance and through a huge mobile home estate.  (Here we consulted a map and were immediately approached by a man offering incorrect opinions on which way we needed to go.  It is difficult not to take offered wrong advice - you don't want to appear rude).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a fair amount of up and down - good exercise.  Plenty of isolated farmhouses.  We managed to escape the worst of the weather; once back at the car, drinking our thermos of coffee and eating cold beans (which were very tasty!) the snow set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall a highly recommended walk (five and three-quarter miles).</span></div></div>",

Well, success on two of the three aims isn't a bad hit rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little spectacular about the walk.  It was a tromp round a riverside, canal paths, roads and fields with not all that much to look at.  There were some wild rose plants on the canal bit of the walk, which may be worth remembering if I ever make rosehip wine again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoo kept us entertained with the details of her never-to-be-written novel - involving Bayford Caruthers III, an idealistic hero type whose father (a property magnate) met a sticky end involving concrete pillars, and his romantic interest, Kirstie Dalkeith, banished from the home of her father (who now lived in penury but was actually a laird) by her wicked nanny/step-mother and brought up by aged lesbians with three arms between them.  Or something.  It involved macrame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found two brand new Yorkshire Bank Cash Cards, yet to be signed, on a path by a quarry/open cast coal mine belonging to an R. Morrow.  I have brought them home and will hand them in on Tuesday when the banks open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a huge diversion which took us through some of the stickiest clay mud known to man.  Claire insisted on looking at the map here, increasing our chances of being stuck forever, feeding circling vultures.  After getting through this I felt several inches taller and many pounds heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then began to rain - heavily and insistently.  Bah!</span></div></div>",

Wide muddy footpaths had frozen with small sheets of ice covering puddles; satisfying crunches ensued.  The walk consisted of a circle around, up and down tors, all with large boulders rising up like sculptures; natural and beautiful.  One of the tors was an iron age hill fort, but I was only told this sometime after we were on it, when we could see it in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting across a large stream was interesting.  There is that moment where the long stride you know you can do on level ground becomes less certain - where you must continue with what you started because it is too late to do anything else - and then success, the relief of remaining dry.  It only lasts a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany impressive rock formations.  One ancient quarry had a stone jutting up and then over in an inverted 'L'.  In these quarries were individual mill stones; perfectly circular with central holes.  The stones were carved in situ but never collected by the millers.  I wonder if each has its own story.</span></div></div>",

The walk started off with a marvellous view of Harewood House, standing majestically in its grounds.  The grounds were 'designed' by Capability Brown; broad sweeps with copses and individual trees.  I wonder what he actually did; whether he changed or accomodated the landscape.  Anyway, all rather good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path was obvious all the way and boots were not really needed until the end (inevitably) when a patch of wet mud with a hint of slurry almost reached the top of the boots.  There were many signs at intersections saying things like \"Private.  Absolutely No Entry.  We Will Set the Dogs on You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe highlight of the walk was Harewood Church and its churchyard, a little off the path of the walk.  The churchyard was crowded with late eighteenth century and nineteenth century graves.  The earlier ones tended to be more decorative with jolly rhymes about the futility of life.  Many grave stones had several infants apiece, recalling stories of individual tragedies through the years.  All this, and a covering of snow drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside were five magnificent tombs for the local nobles: full size carvings of the lord and lady lying in state, a lion under his feet, a dog under hers.  And all with ancient grafitti carved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a quick mention of Home Farm - a rejuvinated eighteenth century farmstead converted into offices, and a stag in the distance with large antlers looking like a tree stump.</span></div></div>",

They live in a glorious setting; surrounded by lush, steep hills with typical patchwork stone walls.  It being April, many fields were lamb full and concerned ewes, bleating deeply.  I love the sheer joy conveyed by lambs' wagging tails as they feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was pleasant to the extent that my scalp has got a little burnt.  Enough to make it itchy.  The surrounding days to this walk have been grey, cold and rainy, so we were lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe passed an eighteenth century lead mine (in the distance) and the remains of a stone age settlement, which was a set of lumpy mounds and troughs.  There was lots of typical east Pennine scenery; pleasing and unspectacular.  Some of the hills were hard work, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunch time pub (Fox and Hounds - 16 runs) was exactly right, though next time I should be more adventurous than ordering a huge slab of meat.  We then made our way back down a narrow road Tracey and Chris have labelled 'Larder Lane', it containing bilberries, brambles, the tiny oak tree they gather leaves from, raspberry cane and elder trees (though I did not see these).  Wild garlic too.  Back to the house for a first try of Oak Leaf wine.  An unusual tast, completely unexpected, but dry and refreshing.</span></div></div>",

There was much heart-beating and it was a leg-aching endeavour.  I have got out of the habit, and not climbing three storeys of stairs twice daily since September has made a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Christmas weather was milder that last year; a little frost and ice on the top, but the predominant colours were brown, grey and green.  These faded into blues in the distance.  A glance at the horizon would not reveal where the hills stopped and the sky started.  There were odd patches of sunlight, highlighting random areas of field.  The view was long, taking in Whernside, Ingleborough and Pendle Hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were not alone in our walk.  There was one large grouping of several friends and family walking slower than us, with three dogs.  The terrier was named Stanley and could have been our cat's alter-ego.  About the same size, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top (where there is a new stone bench) we drank sherry, ate stilton sandwiches and Helen's wedding-cake.  All this before noon.  But I was at that 'so hungry I'm going to turn grumpy' stage, and the summit was the natural place to have lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn our way down (much easier than going up) we detoured to both Hunt Pot and Hull Pot.  The former was more pituresque, the latter was bigger.  And we walked much of the way back to the car in that blinding sunlight that only appears in midwinter.</span></div></div>",

It was grey throughout with heavy drizzle by the end.  The walk took us round the side of a brick quarry, over the M1 twice, past a landfill site and was mostly next to busy roads.  At one point the book told us of an impressive view of Temple Newsom, but it was impossible to see.  We passed a woman in a car who had the look of one about to abandon a load of household waste by the side of the road.  I'm not sure there was a redeeming feature, apart from the worthiness of having walked in unpleasant weather.  Perhaps the large number of electricity pylons.</span></div></div>",

A f ew steps and I am out of view of any cars that may be passing and become aware of the beauty and accepting vibrations around me. Trees on each side of the path, variety of grasses and wildflowers spalsh colour onto the leaf filtered sunlit track. I breath and reach toward the sky in celebration of freedom and peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little way along and I begin to cotmeplate change in mylife when a sudden movement catches my attention. A baby gartner snake slithers across my path like lightning and I laugh. What was it's message. Change can happen quick! time to shed.  A good omen for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the wind blowing as treetops rustle but I am protected here below as I pass between two swamp areas, dark and mystical. Mosquitos show up  and though they may too have a message , they so irritate me--my nemesis ! Others my pass unaffected but somehow they find me!!  so I ponder we all have distractions in our life that try to take us off track.  I perservere not to let them deter me and turn me back for home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I enter a sun drenched area with a more open vista of marshlands and reeds with stark dead trees standing solitary. I hear a splash and know I have interrupted a beaver or muskrat so it dived to safety. further on , as I have been walking quietyl I spot a tall stately blue heron standing on a log in the swamp. standing so still and tall for so long that I marvel  and try to stay still and quiet in mimciry.  I do ok but for the blasted mosquitos Again!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the heron started to move his body and then scrunch his neck and then stretch is neck and wave his tail end as if swaying . I could have sworn he was dancing the way he moved his body parts. It waas magical as I had never seen a heron do this before.  Awe inspiring.  I wondered if it was a show for  me!  I wondered if he was mimicking the reeds blowing beside him.<br>\r\nafter a time, he scrunched down his neck again and moved a foot as if to stand  down  and then quick as you please he lifted off and flew with wide wingspan across the swamp to a dead tree in the distance.  The screech echoed roudn the woods, unanswered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so inspiring. so it's message. Dance like no one is watching! Do something odd!  See what I would have missed had I let those pecky bugs turn me back.  The potential magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite happy and relaxed I walked back down the trail and quail squawked and flew from bushes into the woods as if I would have even seen them in the undergrowth.  I guess they recall hunters my come this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon back at the road I trekked along the side admiring the wild queen anne's lace, daisies, bullrushes, chickory, trees and clouds racing across the sky. I wonder if the drivers going by even notice. Another heron takes off from the river rocks near the roadway and I whisper a slient farewell for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back into my drive way Iook down and find anew shiny black crow feather--a gift for me. I remember all the mad cawing when I left for my walk and I guess they would not be left out. Crows too bear magic and shapeshifting.  So I am at peace that indeed change is occuring and it is for  me to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in nature today has been magical yet again.  And I opened to listen for it. I know we are one with all that is and begin to think the creatures know more than we think!</span></div></div>",

Tears stung her eyes as she recalled the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting on an outside table of a local caf\u00e9 when the couple passed. They were deep in conversation about the last walk they had just finished and how dangerous it was. Shirley thoughts went back to when she and Dave were on one of their many walks. It was early winter and the nights were closing in. The ground crackled like corn flakes crunching under their feet. The laughed as they crunched along a small path that led to a fissure in the earth that had been carved by an old ravine according to the information that the brochure detailed regarding this walk. There were no warning signs, nothing that would cause the two seasoned walkers to turn back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy frost covering the ground and an eerie dark grey mist clouded the thin cold valley and made a for a spooky atmosphere surrounding them. Dave laughed when he saw his wife's face it was a fright.<br>\r\n\"What are you laughing at? Is something funny?\" she furrowed her brow in a mocking way.<br>\r\n\"You look so terrified as if there were monsters here. Don't be afraid little one.\" He said in a scary mocking voice as he helped her over a large stone in the path. <br>\r\n\"I am not sure about this one Dave and it's alright for you to mock and joke with me. You know I don't like it when it gets misty. Oops\" her foot became unsteady and she almost fell but Dave held her close and steadied her.<br>\r\n\"Ok, honey, I will behave. It's just that I can't help jesting when you look so vulnerable and I... me man.\" He punched his chest like an ape winning a battle.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, men.\" Shirley smiled and walked on alongside her husband of ten years.The couple first met on a group walk in the Lake district. They were in a singles group tour and had been thrown together in the same seat. Well placed they recalled the tour guide remarking. It was only ten months later when they shared their wedding vows. Till death do us part. It was a beautiful sunny day and the couple had many fond memories of those moments. Now ten years later, they were still on their walking expeditions and enjoyed the majority of them. This one was different. Shirley woke up that morning feeling uneasy and couldn't quite put her finger on why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was now a few paces ahead and calling Shirley to hurry as he had spotted something that he wanted to share. She had her eyes on the ground when the scream that she would never forget came from Dave's lips. It was like an animal in a trap before it was slaughtered. <br>\r\nShe looked up and could not see her husband.<br>\r\n\"Dave, this is not funny! Dave! Where are you? I told you to stop this jesting. I want to go back. Dave!<br>\r\nThere was only silence.<br>\r\nAfter searching for her husband and not finding him, Shirley had no choice but to go back and get help. It took most of the day for the rescuers to find Dave's body and brought him back from that old ravine. In daylight the sign, which had been thrown on the ground warning people not to take that route as there had been land slides and it was unsafe and dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirley, Are you alright?\" Her friend Freida was standing over her at the caf\u00e9. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I am late. You've been crying. Are you ok my dear friend?<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess so. I just had a few memories of the day when Dave was killed on that dam ravine.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, I will take you to lunch and we will have a good girlie time, you need cheering up.\" <br>\r\nShirley pulled her chair back at the local caf\u00e9 took a deep breath and walked along side Freida. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",
