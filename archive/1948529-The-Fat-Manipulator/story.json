Although I was undercover, I had been warned that there were other organizations that would spare no effort to turn me to their advantage.  I'd also been indoctrinated to view anyone that contacted me in this way as evil. My country was counting on me to maintain order in the world at any cost.  Killing a few people who were working to subvert our effort was a small price.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's pretty much what I already told you.  I'm offering you an opportunity to use your talent for good instead of evil and make some good money to boot.  How much do they pay you?\"<br>\r\n\"That's classified information.\"  I replied.  I was lying.  I was getting standard government pay at a pretty low level.  Just about enough to pay for my studion apratment and Make payments on a Honda Civic.  The training I received had conditioned me to live a Spartan lifestyle.  I dated onve in a while even though my ripped phsyqie attracted the women.  I didn't want a relationship because of my secret life as an assassin.  Once in a while I'd find myself envying the normal lifestyle of my clients or fellow trainers but my mission was important.  My country needed me.<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that you don't make more that $30k.  And if you do make more than $30k you can't spend it without compromising your cover.

I noticed how his belly bowed our stretching his shirtfront.  I imagined taking control of my adversary pumping up his fat and watching his belly grow out to fill the chair.  Then he surprised me.  He told me that my last job, presented to me as rliminating an enemy of freedom had actually made my boss a rich man when he shortsold the stock in his company,  The man was totally apolitical.<br>\r\n\"You're lying,\"  I told him and pumped his fat level up to 25%, watching a double chin grow while gaps formed between the buttons on his dress shirt.<br>\r\n\"I'm not your enemy, Mark.  I can prove what I say is true. And by the way, your talent is quite impressive.  We discussed how to approach you and decided that as the fatest member of management, you might not make me fatter.

I had never been so awary of my body as with those extra pounds that were right now my only definse against my old employers.  I was on my own. and starting a new life.  Startin down the subway stairs I looked down.  All I could see was the expanse of my expanded middle.  My hand clutching the handrail was pudgy.  I had my pass and squeezed through the turnstile.  I'd never thought about them before but today instead of pushing the bar with my hip, it was my belly that made contact.  It was a close fit.  Now which way should I go?  Direct to my destination or indirectly.  Since I was short of breath and panting from all the extra weight, I sat down on a bench to recover.  Sitting was strange because of the bag of fat resting on my thighs.  I still didn't believe it was real.  I patted it carefully.  I could feel it move.  It was definitely part of me. Cautiously I stuffed my hands into the pouch of my hoodie and  grabbed its mass.  Inside I discovered that my fat friend had a stash of candy bars.  I couldnt resist.  I ate them all.<br>\r\nAs I ate I was studying the people on the platform.  Nobody seemed suspicious.  Nobody seemed to be waiting for me to make a move.  I finished the candy bars and was surprised that I was hungry for more.  I began to wonder if there would be food when I got to my safe house.  I finally decided to get moving.

Ten minutes later I'd discovered that my new size had affected my appetite as well.  I'd ordered a Big Mac meal regular size which was gone in seconds leaving me as hungry as before.  Next round I uped the order to super size and I was still hungry.  Maybe a pizza would fill me.  I ordered two slices.  Still hungry asked for two more.  Moved on to Subway and went for a footlong.  Finally my hunger was relieved but to be sure I stopped at Baskin Robbins for a banana split.  <br>\r\nFinally full, I traveled the rest of the way to the safe house. I didn't know what to expect but I was looking forward to returning to normal.</span></div></div>",
