Science and technology have marched on, allowing everyone in the world to simplify even the busiest and most complicated lives to the level of constant comfort. However, no technology is perfect, and there are plenty of circumstances where it can fail at just the right time and in the right way to make things extremely embarrassing for everyone. And even when everything works fine, there's still plenty of people crazy or just plain cruel enough to use it to humiliate others for their own amusement. Here are some of their stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Malfunctioning Auto-House</b>: Homes in this day and age are completely automated, from the appliances to the closets. But if they malfunction or get hacked, well, that's when things get interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Teleporting Gone Wrong</b>: Teleporting is the newest cutting edge in transportation technology, designed to make traffic a thing of the past. But new technology always has its bugs, and in this case, it's that not everything always gets teleported with the user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Robot Rebellion</b>: We've all seen this movie - robots have been created to serve as humanity's workforce, only to decide that they won't serve the weak meat bags. But maybe some of them decide to rebel a little differently than what one might expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mad Scientist Rampage</b>: The main problem with this world's technology? It allows for the kind of cartoony mad scientists of sci-fi's heyday, who create inventions to torment people, mostly for their own amusement.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a clear, sunny day on one Perry Drive, a well off suburban street, lined with big beautiful houses, and a ended with a cul-de-sac, where perhaps the biggest and nicest one stood. It went up 2 stories, the exterior walls a perfect white, at least, where they weren't made of perfectly polished plexiglass, revealing a beautiful dining room on the upper floor and a comfortable looking lounge below. In the backyard, not that many could see it behind the house, was a perfectly clean in ground swimming pool, complete with heater and automatic filtration systems. The house was a new addition to the cul-de-sac, one that dazzled and confused the other residents on the street. There had been construction workers, men in lab coats, people in black suits and sunglasses, coming in and out of the site since the house started being built. Now, the house was done, and there was no sign of any of them, aside from a scrawny, nervous looking man in glasses waiting on the front steps. As a moving van approached, he stood up, dusted himself off, and quickly scurried down to meet it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! Would you look at that.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got out of the passenger side seat of the van, Eric Ellis thought he must be the luckiest guy in the world. His shitty apartment had been stifling- but when his brother's friend's uncle turned out to be a scientist at some big-time laboratory, and that big-time-laboratory was offering a mansion of a house like this for participation in some experiment, Eric was quick to sign up. Lucky him, he got selected. And now, looking at it, he felt like he was getting a pretty good deal. He was briefly roused from his appreciation by a small, weedy man in glasses coming up to him, glancing back at the man starting to move Eric's property into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Ellis?\" he said, sticking out his hand, \"I'm Morris. I'm one of the technicians working for Luxe Corp, working on your assignment.\" Eric nodded to him, returning the hand shake which Morris very quickly broke as he started to lead Eric into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, man. Moving all the way out here was a pain, but,\" Eric glanced around as he entered the house, shivering contentedly at the blast of AC, \"I gotta say, this seems more than worth it. Worth any experiment you guys are having me do to, or whatever that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr. Ellis, that's actually what I'm here to tell you about,\" Morris said, clasping his hands together. \"You see, the house... <i>is</i> the experiment, in a manner of speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Eric. The house looked fantastic, but nothing seemed... experimental. Really nice looking, and with plenty of high tech gizmos to keep him comfortable, but nothing that looked out of the ordinary from that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, allow me to introduce you to Janine.\" Morris said, and, walking over to what Eric had assumed was an intricate thermostat, punched in a sequence of button presses, before a light on the panel lit up green, and a disembodied voice filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Dr. Fulbright.\" The voice was that of a woman, rich and soothing. It paused for a moment, before continuing. \"New subject recognized and registered. Nice to meet you, Eric. Welcome to your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah....\" Eric said, looking around. For a moment, he saw Morris drop his nervous demeanor, letting a smile come to his face at Eric's bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, isn't it? This is Janine, an artificial intelligence designed and created for the purposes of making this a fully automated house. We're real proud of her, but she's still a work in progress, still needs to be socialized, and that's where you come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly does that entail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just live in the house,\" Morris replied, \"and make use of Janine as you would to get her used to having people here to take care of. Do you think you can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded vigorously. \"Definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You've also already signed the paper work, so, asking was mostly a formality. Now, I should explain some things about Janine further, but remember, when asking Janine for something, its best to be as specific as possible with your request....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric barely heard the rest of Morris's explanation, instead marveling at everything being shown. Janine was capable of handling the lights, to the heat, to just about every electronic in the house. She would tint and un-tint the glass walls at a command, send out drones to vacuum the floor; using robotic appendages, she could even prepare food or change beds! No, Eric spent the rest of the tour enraptured by each room, barely listening to the technician, until they circled back around to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and so, to be safe, you should probably avoid having too many people in the house at once.\" Morris explained. \"Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no,\" Eric replied, only just catching up to the man, \"no this all seems... perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorris nodded. \"Very good. Well, I'll be off then, and let you get used to the place.\" As Morris turned to open the door, he paused, and turned back to Eric. \"I only have one last thing to say, Mr. Ellis.\"</span></div></div>",

She was the secretary for the boss of a major technology firm, and she always had a lot of paperwork to do. Of course, nowadays they never used paper: everything was stored in the cloud where they could access it from anywhere and everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the elevator and keyed in the button for the teleportation floor. As the elevator ascended, Mary admired her reflection in the full length mirrored walls. The classy business suit she wore didn't do much to hide her curves, which were clearly visible. Her skirt stopped just above her knees, and it was one she considered favourite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused her attention back to the door as the elevator slowed down, realizing she would soon have to get out of her clothes. You see, although teleportation had been established as a safe and easy means of transportation, there was one hiccup that scientists and engineers all around the world had not been able to resolve. For reasons unknown to them, no shred of clothing ever survived being teleported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly tests had proven that scientists could successfully and safely teleport animals across huge distances without a single fault. However, when the first human trial of teleportation was conducted, the results were quite amusing. One of the lead scientists on the team had volunteered to be the human test subject. She entered the teleporter on one side, clad in her standard lab coat and other protective wear that she donned over her usual clothes. She successfully reached the other side, an event witnessed by a huge audience on site as well as by and even larger audience watching the live telecast. Imagine their surprise when she appeared in front of their eyes, completely and absolutely naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of trying to fix the problem, people had finally come to terms with the fact that clothes simply could not be teleported with the person. Teleportation booths were regulated by government, and different companies employed different implementations of the standard. One key point was that every teleportation booth would need an overseer, or a controller who would be in charge of operating the booth. If anything went awry, he or she would be there to get things back under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe company that Mary worked for had two teleportation booths for use. They were situated in the same room as a row of lockers, each locker assigned to a staff member. They also had two official teleportation overseers employed, one woman and one man. Since people had to be naked when they arrived or were teleported away, they had the option to request which member(the male or female overseer) would be at the controls during the teleportation. Mary, like all the other women in the staff, preferred to have the woman overseer, Katie, at the controls, as she obviously would rather be naked in front of a woman than front of a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary exited the elevator and opened the door that led to the teleporters. When she entered, she was in for a surprise.</span></div></div>",

She checked her watch, confirming that this was indeed the time slot that she had reserved for herself: which meant that Katie should have been here. She started to walk up to the booths, when Fred heard her and turned around. \"Hello Mary.\" He smiled politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary nervously returned the smile. She knew that Fred was a nice guy and all, but she was also aware that she might soon have to be naked in front of him. \"How come you're on today's shift?\" She asked him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred replied, \"Katie had to take an emergency day off today, her mother has been hospitalized. Since there's no one else who knows how to control these, I'm going to have to cover for her for a while.\" He pressed a few buttons on the panel in front of him. \"So, once you disrobe, I'll get the machine warming up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary bit her lip and looked around. It looked like she had no choice but to strip naked in front of him. It was either that, or she had to find another way to get home. What does Mary do?</span></div></div>",

Cameras were only the obvious disadvantage of mall and school. Against that he would have ample places to hide within the expected fifty yards range. Worse were the network trackers the police could easily access. He felt better in an area where the network power was low which would allow his blocking device to blur his traces. But as there were less people around he would have to leave the scene quickly. And he was too keen on going live with his new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cloudy day in spring with possible light showers of rain coming up. The brisk wind made walking in the park an enjoyable but chilly experience. If anyone spotted him wearing gloves would not have rosen suspicion. The gloves were vital to avoid fingerprints on the girl's clothes and items. Donald cycled along the paths towards the spot he had picked as his first position. It had all he currently needed: his path was higher up than the one down along the canal which would make it impossible to be spotted from below, good views of the area and a quick route to a gate. His victim would be able to retrieve her clothes but with a twist. She would either have to walk into the cold water of the canal or walk to one of the beautiful iron wrought bridged that unfortunately would be a few hundred yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis procedure was detailed but not yet proven by practise, due to a lack of practise of stripping unsuspecting girls. That would change by now. They would look immobile and he would have to push or even lift them, careful not to stumble. Strip, tie the clothes and handbag into a ball and hurl it over the canal - or into the water if the girl was even more unlucky. Then he would have time for a brief fondling before he would return to his bike. A few seconds of her first reactions would be fine before he would leave. He wished he could see a chilly butt and hard nipples covered by goosebumps when the girl would reach the pile again but this would be left to imagination for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time of the day he had picked was suitable. Early in the afternoon some high school or college girls would always return from the schools and museums on that part of the park. From a distance, cycling slowly, he could identify two girls walking side by side. Carefully he approached his position while making sure nobody else was around on the upper path. He pulled out his superpower mobile phone and had to make just a single decision: the gitl with skinny red hair or the other, well endowed girl with black hair.</span></div></div>",

A straight-A student and brought up in a strict christian family, she was still a virgin and had never had the chance to expose herself before. But she really, really wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a birthday present, she had been very specific in that the only single item she wanted, was one of the new miniature teleporters which had just come out. The ones you could carry in your pocket, activate at a press, and take you anywhere on earth. It took some persuading, the price was hefty and her parents were sceptical of what exactly she would be using it for, but eventually gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on the night of her birthday, having done with all the family formalities, she ran straight to her room, and began plotting. This could take her ANYWHERE in the world. So, she thought - there was nothing stopping her teleporting to some random location, partially or fully undressed, get the thrill and embarrasment of everyone seeing her, only to jump back into her bedroom at the final moment, never having to face any of them ever again. She couldn't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs alluded to before, Lola was quite a small girl for her age. Her arms and legs were very much on the skinny side, with a large thigh gap, and boobs which looked like those of a 13 year-old. Infact, she did indeed often get mistaken for a 13 year-old; she was just one of those people who looked way younger than she was. Her pussy she always shaven and clean, a perfect little tight slit between her legs. Her buttcheeks were prominent, yet not massive and fleshy. If you're into miniature, small, skinny girls, she was really your dream candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where should she go first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: If you finish everything you want her to do in one place, make sure to take her back to her bedroom and give people the chance to take her somewhere different.</span></div></div>",

It was right the way round the world, so no chance of having to meet any of those people ever again - and about now it would be daytime. She would just appear in the streets, wearing really not very much at all, simply wander about until she can no longer stay there at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this, her very first exhibitionist outing, she wanted to take it slow. No bra, for sure (she barely needed one anyway), but she'd go with a white band crop-top to start off with. Just to be safe. With regards to her bottom half, she'd wear socks, and a pair of panties - no trousers, no skirt. A bright yellow pair, absolutely hideous, but nice and tight round her buttcheeks, leaving them some space to just poke out at the bottom, and an unmistakable cameltoe. She was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake a deep breath - three, two, one. For the first time, she pressed the teleporter button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief jolt and spinning vision, she found herself in an alleyway. Noone in the immediate few feet, her entrance had gone unnoticed. Up ahead of her was the main shopping street, she could see it. Here we go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out, onto the pavement, and just started walking. Free from any restraint, her tits jiggled up and down as she walked - nipples rubbing against the fabric of her crop top. Once or twice, she swore, they leapt out and into public view. Through her panties, the air brushed past her vagina; just one small piece of fabric separating her from total butt-nakedness. Speaking of which, she could feel the panties creeping inside her asscrack as she walked, her cheeks becoming more and more exposed to anyone behind her. Through the reflections in shop windows, she could see people stopping as they passed, turning back around to get a better view. It felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere could she go next, she wondered? How about into a shop - chance her luck, see if she could get herself a free bite to eat. There was a coffee shop just on the corner coming up - it looked pretty quiet, she'd try for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just the one guy inside on the tills, and no customers. He was wiping the surface, so didn't see her approaching. \"Hey there\", she said; grabbing his attention - \"I'm afraid I don't have any money on me right now, but if I could just get one coffee off you, as a favour, I could offer...other payment.\" On that, she rubbed her tits, making entirely evident to him that there was no bra present under there. His eyes widened. \"Yes, yes of course. I'll just set it brewing right now.\" He does so. \"Should we...go to the back?\" She nods, and follows him through. The moment they are through, she removes her crop top - revealing her kid-sized titties, which bounce up and down as she pulls the fabric over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\", the barista exclaims. His hands reach out, and rub over her breasts. He circles his fingers around her nipples, relishing the moment - she, too, is quite enjoying it. His right hand reaches between her legs, rubbing on her pussy through the fabric, he's about to slot his hand inside, when she cuts him short. \"Ah, that's enough! I'll have that coffee now?\" He reels back, composes himself, and stutters \"Yes, of course - thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks out of the shop, leaving her top behind, tits exposed to the world. For good measure, she ditches her socks too. Now the only item of clothing on her skinny little body are the tight yellow panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finds herself a park bench to sit down, and drink her coffee on. Of course, she chooses to go cross-legged; leaving only the tiniest slit of fabric exposing her pussy slit. By now, pretty much everyone who walks past her now does a double take. Little kids whisper to their mums, asking why the girl on the bench isn't wearing any clothes. Old couples shake their head disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a police officer approaches. \"Excuse me, ma'am - I'm sure you're aware that is most certainly not appropriate attire for a public space.\" She knows she will have to teleport back home at some point in the next few minutes, but decides to have some fun with him first. \"Oh, is it not? I'm so sorry, I didn't know! I'll take the things off then.\" And with that, she slips her panties off her legs and onto the floor, exposing to him her pussy wide open, dripping with fluid. She began fingering herself. Really not giving a shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's it. You're coming back to the station, young woman!\" She smirked. \"Oh am I really?\", she mocked. And with that, she pressed the button on her teleporter, whizzing her back home, to her bedroom - three items of clothing less than what she had set out with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! What an adventure. Yet it didn't quite seem...enough. That was just her finding her feet, learning the basics. Now, she wanted to do it all over again! The only question was, where to go next?</span></div></div>",

Currently, they were hovering above the city, high high in the atmosphere, hidden in the clouds. With a grin, and a snicker, Dr. Spencer pressed a button, turned to another set of screens, and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura Lane walked down the street, dressed smartly in a business-casual white blouse and blue pencil skirt. She was happy to have gotten her break a little early- she'd be be able to grab her food right before the lunch rush hit, and she'd get back to her office perfectly on time. In fact, the only damper on the day so far was the overcast; but still, they were all light gray, no sign of precipitation anytime soon.

For all the advancements in technology, nature itself still seemed to elude peoples grasps, if only barely. Punishment for the damage humans had caused, perhaps, uncaring of the efforts made to rectify that mistake. Angelica didn't know, and didn't care; she was hardly some bleeding heart. Far from it; when she tried selling this technology before, she billed it as harnessing the Earth's natural weather patterns and turning them into whatever anyone could want over a specific area. If it wasn't for the caveat (irritatingly discovered when some busybodies dug a little deeper into her research) that widespread extended use would damage the atmosphere, she'd be living the high life resting on her laurels. But no. Well, if they didn't want to pay her to use it for people's benefit, Dr. Angelica Spencer would show them exactly what she could do for people's detriment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura could see her destination a block ahead- her favorite place to grab lunch, a little sandwich place on the corner a few blocks away from her office.

These unfortunate space-farers in particular find themselves stripped out in the deep of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alien Diplomacy:</b> Humans and all sorts of sapient life are settling into uneasy alliances. As a matter of fact, in the midst of all the treaties and negotiations, a few colonies and space stations have even sprung up featuring multiple species sharing a settlement.

This case is no different; instead of horses and carriages, there are spaceships. Instead of grassy hills and dusty plains, there are entire planets with unique atmospheres. And, just like the expansion of old, there are all sorts of undiscovered lifeforms that have some unfortunate and strange reactions to human presence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stripped on the Ship</b> Something is lurking on-board the massive space freighter, it's human crew initially unaware of it's presence.

Some people have rather mundane lives, society having long since adjusted to things like space travel, alien life, and advanced technology.

I only just found out about my mission aboard a week previous, and was put into semi-somnolent stasis for the somewhat lengthy flight there, so I couldn\u2019t afford any time to study up on my assigned mission.  I was just told by my superiors that I\u2019d be doing a great service for the Interfed if I could somehow negotiate a peaceful end to this uneasy stand-off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was immediately escorted into the offices of the station commander, a middle-aged man with sugar-white hair named Captain Stroud.  At first, Stroud tried to brief me on the situation, but then his chief science officer, a weasely myopic noodle of a man named Dr. Kratt, interrupted.  Whereas Stroud was attempting to fill me in on the complexities of the interplanetary laws and merchants rights, Dr. Kratt cut to the chase and explained why I in particular was chosen as a go-between for this minor kerfuffle.  Besides being one of only a handful of negotiators with the basic skillset for deciphering the tongue of this particular breed of lifeform, I am apparently of the exact body match preferred by this particular species for high-level talks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t understand how this affects the negotiations at first, but on the second \u2018day\u2019 of my visit to the station, while being given the full spa treatment (baths and rubdowns and massages, etc.) to help ward off what some like to call the \u2018space-bends\u2019, the chief medical officer, Dr. Rhonda Prexis informed me that the alien race aboard the merchant vessel awaited an Interfed negotiator such as myself to carry their reply to the list of demands that the space station was asking them to carry out just to deliver their cargo.  What was most unusual was the aliens counter-demand for a woman such as myself in particular to be teleported into their spaceship.  The rare depictions of this race were of strange, roiling bundles of spaghetti-like tendrils that most humans found rather horrifying.  But it was Dr. Prexis that finally explained the crux of their demand.  I had to arrive in their ship as clean and as naked as possible.  I didn\u2019t fully understand this last part, but was told it was crucial if things were to move ahead on this whole process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thumbsnap.com/iw7OPN6S\" target=\"_blank\">https://thumbsnap.com/iw7OPN6S</a>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove is a link to a recent image of me.  I\u2019ve rarely had time for men, caught up in my translation and negotiation career studies at Uni, but of course I\u2019m aware that many men find me attractive. I\u2019ve had men constantly showering me with affection all my life.   Sure, it\u2019s flattering, and maybe someday I will meet my Mr. Right.  I feel like when that day comes, I\u2019ll feel sure about it in my heart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now?  I\u2019m on my first big assignment, halfway across the galaxy, at a remote space station that has to be staffed by at least 70% males.  And I\u2019m about to be teleported completely naked up to the utterly strange-looking vessel of the noodle-creatures known as the Ptooizians!  For all I know, I may be the first ever human to attempt direct face-to-noodles contact with these beings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was escorted through the officer\u2019s area of the space station almost immediately after my head-to-toe cleaning and inspection under Dr. Prexis.  I was only in a towel and slippers as we made our way through into the science labs, where Captain Stroud and Dr. Kratt awaited us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey actually saluted me, since I could in no way be in direct contact with them after my thorough inside and out cleansing.  And then?  I turned to face the rounded, almost saucer-like hyperbolic chamber, from which I would be teleported up into the bowels of the Ptooizian spaceship.  I tried to put on a brave face, while the three officials of the space station had looks on their faces that I tried to read as encouraging, even if they looked equally anxious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slid open, and I left the towel and slippers behind as I climbed into the chamber.  Inside was oval-shaped, with just enough room for me to stand up.  I stood there awaiting orders for what seemed like forever, before I heard Dr. Kratt over a speaker instructing me to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In an age where people could fly their own ships out to any given dark corner of the universe, sometimes the long arm of the law was a little slow to catch them. Sometimes, people wanted people caught for things that weren't strictly lawful. That's where people like Vera came in. And Vera was something special. Not as experienced as some of her contemporaries, and not nearly as ruthless, her reputation for bringing quarries back alive nets her a regular income. And, as Vera entered a solar system, one of the planets below currently had one such target on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera reviewed her information as she suited up, pulling her field suit up over a pair of wide thighs. The target- one Angela Cadenza- was a human, red headed and a bit older than she was. She was a B-lister in the galactic political and diplomatic scene, but apparently she'd managed to piss off some alien bigwig, and now she was on the run from people like Vera. <i>Well</i>, Vera thought, patting the stun pistol secured to her hip, <i>not for long.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera had sent a few drones out, looking for fuel emissions, photon trails, things like that, so that she could track Angela down to one of the nearby planets. Well, they'd all come back- 3 of them turning up with nothing, but one of them bearing a set of coordinates for a likely landing zone. Sure, it was largely unexplored territory, but it wasn't like Vera hadn't been on plenty of dangerous missions before. It was nothing new for her to touch down on...</span></div></div>",

Vera packed a rebreather with her equipment, but she'd leave it off except in case of an emergency. What had her full attention as she touched down was tracking down her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the dense vegetation covering the planet, making it a pain to trek over land, it make it pretty easy to predict Angela's field of movement. With such an impregnable canopy of trees, there were so few clear spaces for a ship to land, and the chemical trail left behind by another ship burning fuel lead Vera to a spot she was pretty confident was where the woman had landed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of her ship, equipment all packed, Vera breathed deeply, smelling the natural air... and immediately dreading the feeling of that air on her skin. Jungle planets, as it turned out, were unbearably humid. Her deep breath turned into a sigh, mixing with the calls and cries of strange alien bugs and birds, as Vera resolved to get her job done quick so she could get the hell off the overgrown rock that was Persica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecuring her gear, Vera set her ship to cloak itself and then trudged into the viney, hunid treeline.</span></div></div>",

No one could possibly see her coming but it would also be rather hellish since it would be tough going to clamber through and even hiking this far on this humid planet has got her rather sweaty already the field suit isn't much help either it's meant to be protective but in keeping things out it also keeps much of her sweat in.

Their eyes were almost entirely black as well, and they had fibers analogous to human hair on their head. It didn't grow nearly as long, but it grew farther down the back of their necks. Aside from that, and their flat, 2 toed feet, they had much the same body as humans, right down to the reproductive organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPortians and Humans had something of a rough history; they entered the wider, intergalactic scene at about the same time, though one would always say the other had come after them. They offered similar technology, though Humans eventually found more value in their mechanical engineering skills, and the Portians became renowned for their almost instant understanding of other races biology, meaning better medical technology. They encroached on similar territories too, with a few armed conflicts erupting her and there over particularly valuable planets or systems. And while the races as a whole had made up, more or less, Vera and the bathing Portian down below were bitter rivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwin Ansui was a Portian bounty hunter, also known for her ability to take targets down nonlethally, but whereas Vera favored tracking her targets down and immobilizing them with stun guns or restraints, Gwin favored lying in wait for her targets, and incapacitating them with a variety of powders, gases, and toxins, tailored for different species physiology, made possible by Portian medical tech. They'd clashed a few times, either over targets, or trying to claim contracts on each other. Sometimes it ended with the two cutting their losses and leaving each other alone. More often, it ended with Gwin trapped with her suit destroyed, legs spread apart, and arms in holocuffs, or Vera writhing tortured on the floor as a toxin made every inch of her skin super sensitive. Needless to say, Vera wasn't too happy to see her competitor so near her target. On the other hand....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Gwin was right below her, unaware and running four, soapy, four-fingered hands across naked dark-blue skin. The last time they'd met Vera wound up dangling over a busy spaceport plaza, her pants lying torn to tatters hundreds of feet below. This was a good opportunity to get some payback. But, Vera had to remind herself, she'd be taking a big risk tangling with Ansui, not to mention deviating from her mission.

As she searched through the bushes and leaves, she ignored how her breasts swayed and jiggled with each movement of her torso and arms.  As much as she was glad that she had such a pair, they'd did become a bit unwieldy when unrestrained, and many other bounty hunters and huntresses didn't take her seriously because of her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, it was not meant to be, and Vera couldn't find her bra, debating on whether or not to zip her jumpsuit back up for modestys sake, she consulted her nav pad.  \"Computer, how long is a day on this planet?\"  The computer buzzed a bit, running through the files before displaying the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"36 standard hours, currently 10 hours until sunset.

As much time as he had spent learning about life on a ship, actually experiencing it was another thing altogether. Here, nearing the end of his first voyage, he still had to look around and readjust himself to his cabin whenever he woke up and remembered where he was. He was lanky, though not in bad shape- you had to be at a decent level of fitness to be allowed to travel like this. As he came to a sitting position on his bed, hand running through his bed-headed hair, he pulled at his grungy t-shirt and boxers, hoping to straighten them out a little bit. Captain Jensen was far from a military commander, but Dave still felt like he needed to try and appear presentable. Even if that presentable was just out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm coming... uh, Captain, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banging on the door stopped as David fumbled for the switch, staggering slightly to a standing position. The metal door slid open, revealing his Captain, one miss Jane Jensen. She was an inch or two shorter than David, thought definitely beat him out when it came to musculature. With her clear, dark skin and neat black braids, she cut an impressive figure in her regulation captain's jacket. Still, underneath her stern eyes was a warm, if small, smile, and she had always been fair to the members of her crew. David thought he saw her expression waver for a moment as her eyes darted down his body and back again, but he kept himself gazing into her eyes as she addressed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Lerner, we let you sleep this long cause we know you aren't used to space travel yet,\" Jane began, folding her arms over a chest that David couldn't stop his sleepy brain from noticing the size of, \"but we've got a lot to do today. Ship's due back on Earth in about 48 hours. I know you're probably sick of hearing me say it, but just because so much of the ship is automated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...doesn't mean we should stop paying attention to it,\" David finished, smiling a bit. \"I hear you, Captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Jensen returned the smile and nodded. \"I'm glad to hear you agree. As our Navigator, I want you to check the ship's flight path one more time. Make sure we're touching down when, where, and how we should be, etc. Routine stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid offered a loose salute, his hand dropping back down barely after touching his forehead. \"Aye, aye, Captain.\" He blushed a bit as his stomach growled. \"Uh, don't suppose I could stop for breakfast first, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain chuckled. \"Go ahead; Dana's even pulled some of the produce out of stasis for a fruit salad before we touch down. Though, um...\" Here, the Captain paused, eyes wandering up to the ceiling of the corridor. Her smile seemed to get wider, but there was a hint of red on her cheeks. \"Before you head out to meet the rest of the crew, you should probably take care of something...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at her confused for a moment, looking first up to where she was looking, and then down to what she was referring to. His face flushed as he finally acknowledged the tent in his boxers, his own sleep-addled body keeping him from noticing his own morning wood previously. With a short yelp, he brought his hands down to cover himself, and managed to cough out a \"Yes, ma'am.\" Captain Jensen just laughed a little more, winking at him before telling him to get moving and walking off. David stayed like that a moment more, before quickly slamming the door shut and leaning against it with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving on a spaceship was one thing to get used to, but for David, a kind but reclusive boy growing up, living with women was another. He was the only guy on their 6 person crew, and while it was fine most of the time, there were a few times where things felt a little... odd. Not necessarily bad, but definitely odd. He was lucky that the Captain had personally come to wake him up- there were other women on the ship who wouldn't have let him off with just a little teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he couldn't sit there all day moaning over one little embarrassing incident; he had work to do, after all. Their mining expedition had been a huge success, and they were coming back to huge acclaim! <i>No time to slouch,</i> David told himself, <i>time to give the ship one last once over and coast back down to a celebration on solid Earth.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing to his feet and stretching, David quickly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David doffed his shirt, tossing it back onto the bed as he opened his bathroom door. His boxers followed a second later, landing in a small bundle in the middle of his room, before the door to his bathroom compartment swished closed. While waiting for re water to heat up as he fiddled with the faucet, he brushed his teeth, used the facilities and, with a short flashback to his embarrassment a moment ago, examined himself in the mirror. His deflating erection twitched at the memory, but the steam coming out of the stall in front of him reminded David that the ship was on a schedule. With a swish open and swish shut of the frosted glass door, David was lathering himself up, enjoying the start to what was going to be a busy but productive day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the sound of the rushing water, though, and just past the echoing hum from the navigator himself, David was unable to hear another, hidden noise. Noise on a spaceship wasn't uncommon- the low vibration of the ships engines, the white noise like beeping and whirring of the computers up on the deck. This was a different noise- the soft creaking of metal coming from the ceiling of David's cabin, as if something was straining the vents above. Of course, the echo chamber that was his bathroom left him oblivious as the sound passed overhead, and then stopped on the other side of the wall, the source itself entering the room. Whatever sounds the thing made then, David didn't find out- by the time he turned the water off, the creature scurried back into the airvents leaving no trace of itself behind besides the most obvious and crucial of problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stepped out into his bedroom, breathing in one last steamy gulp of air and letting it refresh his lungs as he breathed out. In his haste, he'd forgotten to bring a towel in with him, but that wasn't a big problem. A little water tracked on the floor as he dried off in the cabin's main room, but that was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, as David presse the button and opened the drawer where he kept his linens, he found it empty. David's brow creased as he looked around the room; the idea of not being able to dry off was one thing, but with a shiver, he realized that he was in fact missing far more than just a few towels. The boxers he had left on the floor were gone. The shirt he'd worn to bed were just as absent as the sheets onto which he had tossed it, and the pillows that had been there too. His water starting to beat harder, he popped open more drawers, checking for shirts, pants, socks, underwear. Empty, empty, empty, painfully empty, all. Looking under the bed brought him nothing too, not even a pair of shoes had been left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked navigator tried to calm his racing mind, willing himself not to panic even as drops of water rolled off his still naked body and onto the floor. David listed all the possible options he could think of, and he came quickly to the only one that seemed at all likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all the times to pull something like this...\" he muttered, before raising his voice a bit. \"Had to get one last joke in, huh, Gabby?\" His exclamation was met with silence, and he scoffed. Gabriella was the maintenance officer, chiefly responsible for the ships physical wellbeing. She was one of the few people who could get into a locked cabin- and Natalia, the security officer, was too much of a hard-ass to make a joke like this, and David reallly, really wanted to believe that the captain was above such things.  That left Gabby, who had teased and pranked and joked at him from the moment they were both on the ship, as the most likely suspect. David could laugh most of them off, but this was taking things too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, Gabby, you got me! Now come on, this isn't cool,\" he said calling to the doo, hands clamped over his groin as he waited for it to open with a \"Gotcha!\" Nothing happened. David realized that if this was Gabby, she was dedicated to not ending it early, which left him with very limited options on what to do next. He didn't want to e seen as a tattletale, crying to the Captain, but this was getting him angry, and was totally inappropriate! Jane could handle the matter with discretion, and keep Habby from pulling anything like this again... so long as no one was on the bridge with we when he called her comm, he could get out of this without anyone else knowing it even happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the other option was to call Natalia herself. She WAS technically reaponsible for all disciplinary measures on the ship, and breaking into a crew mates cabin seemed like solid grounds to cal her on. Then again, she could get... overzealous in her duties. She'd get the job done quick, but she'd likely make a big deal out of it, and David was really hoping he could just quietly get back to work as soon as possible. Not o mention the terrifying idea of being naked in front of such an intimidating woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last option was probably the riskiest, if less immediately embarrassing. The ship had a laundry room, right in the same level as the living quarters, and David was sure he could find a spare jumpsuit there. Of course, that would involve traveling out into the halls, bare ass naked and dripping wet, and even though none of the girls were suppossed to be around the area at this time, the idea of being wrong about that was making his knees shake. Not to mention the fact that Gabby was probably waiting for him to open the door himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really liking any of his options...</span></div></div>",

So, one can only imagine how pent-up Julia was feeling now that she was finally free to stretch her legs a bit. Said legs went right up to a blue skirt and a very smart looking blouse, white fabric painted green by the glowing light of Julia's holo-tablet as she once more went over notes before her meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, Julia was a woman who had a way with words, and as the intricacies of politics deepened as humanity made it farther out into the starts, politicians like Julia were instrumental in keeping things running smoothly.

So when this high-profile job turned up she volunteered. There wasn't much competition, for it given it's distance from Earth, and the centre of things. But it would boost her profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jupiter colonies were far enough away that their research couldn't contaminate the Earth if it went wrong. The stations were fail safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFail-safe if you lived on Earth. However, living in orbit of Jupiter or any of it's satellites, Fail safe meant something vastly different. A death dive into the bottomless atmosphere of the gas giant. Ensuring the destruction of all life, and any contamination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe governor of the colony was eager for Earth's good favour, and wanted to appear strong. So Julie was a little surprised to find herself addressing the whole population of the station in the only space large enough to hold the population. The central park belt was a functioning bio-sphere, keeping the little colony viable far from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie tugged nervously at her collar eyeing the podium where she'd address the assembled people. Their hatred practically radiated from every face, from every crossed pair of arms. She was an outsider, a foreign authority setting down the law, and leaving. A law that wouldn't apply to her or her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the various faces, hoping for the sight of someone happy to see here, or listen to her speech.

It was hard to make up a speech on the fly, with no powers backing her, and nothing she could actually deliver either. Cursing the station chief to herself for putting her in this situation. She still didn't want to undermine the Governor of the Jupiter Colonies. Not when she had to rely on for her return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Julie noticed the cuff of her other sleeve was looking untidy. A sharp tug, removed the lacy trim, and she tried to jam it up her sleeve and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speech wasn't going across well. The gathering was obligatory, and they were not receptive to anything she was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe switched tack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel your anger... I understand your anger... And I'll do everything I can to solve all the problems you have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath. Then caught it, as she felt the stitching on her bra give. A hand snatching from the lectern to her blouse, to stop any obvious shifting. Julie discovered her whole outfit was disintigrating. The jarring move of her hand ensuring the stitching at her shoulder surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeve hung loose, falling down her arm to the elbow. A worried glance to her other shoulder confirmed the stitching there was also gone, and gaps visible, and widening as she watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to keep control of her fears, Julie took a deep breath. She felt the waist of her skirt give, and loosen. A hand snapped to her waist, ensuring it didn't drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look to her audience saw anticipation. These were scientists, bored, capable and frustrated. As her outfit turned into separate pieces of cloth, every seam losing any coherence, she fled the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words of the Governor chastising the audience drowned out by the laughter, as Julie fled.

Jefferson<br>\r\nFrom: Dr. Diana Rodriguez<br>\r\nRE: Testing of the Mk. 3 Prototype<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understand you're a bit apprehensive about today's field test. Believe me, we all are. Letting one of the robots out into a public setting is certainly a risk, but that's what these things are made for right? We don't know how well they blend into society until we actually let one out into society, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, this one's a winner, I can tell. The first one was physically indistinguishable from a human being, so we've already managed to jump the chasm of the uncanny valley. Of course, when it came to behavior we still had leagues to go. Of course, the Mk. 2 was (as you would remember) a step up and a step down all at once. We managed to get it to \"act\" more human, and it handled dangerous situations just as decisively as the first... except it treated <i>every</i> situation as a dangerous situation. That's where the Mk. 3 comes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks human, she acts human, she can handle dangerous situations just fine; this test should prove our expectations that she can handle less than dangerous (but still stressful) situations without going into kill mode. Specifically, we're going to see how she reacts to being placed in scenarios that, if we've done our jobs right, she'll understand are supposed to make her feel 'shame'. Now, that doesn't sound great, I'll grant you. But hey! We've worked hard to get her where she is, and I have full faith in her ability to blend in. If worse comes to worse, we can remotely alter her behavior, control her body, or even take full control from back here in the lab. And if worse comes to <i>worst</i>, we have more than enough funding to cover things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, keep an eye out for the reports we send. I have a feeling you'll get a kick out of this field test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(P.S.- For reference's sake, we're designating this model \"Hallie\" while she's out in the field, and that's the name she'll give if anyone asks. <b>H</b>umanoid <b>A</b>rtificial <b>L</b>ife - <b>I</b>nfiltrator Mk. <b>3</b>.

There were 3 guys, and 2 other girls- Hallie hoped they'd be up for some 3-on-3. With a smile, she jogged happily over to this prospective group of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject is moving to one of the expected areas. Do we have someone in position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly- uh, Agent Small is in place. She knows what Hallie looks like and she's got her orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Keep the surveillance on the two of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we'd love to have you!\" One of the women, a tall, blond, tanned woman named Kelly was beaming at Hallie, while the less-athletic looking brunette behind her - Jennifer- smiled politely. The three men seemed fine with it as well- Aaron, an energetic young man whose all-white clothes contrasted with his dark skin, and a pair of brothers, the older and younger being named Wallace and Nathan, respectively. Hallie greeted them each in turn, letting them finish the match they were in the middle of, and then joined eagerly as they divided themselves up onto teams. Jennifer, Hallie, and Aaron on one team, while Kelly and the brothers took the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not being dressed for athletics like the rest of them, Hallie was doing very well, and was bringing a new energy to the game. She didn't know exactly how to play, but she picked it up very quickly, and for whatever reason, Hallie never felt herself starting to get tired! Where the other players were starting to pant and sweat, Hallie seemed to keep going and going. That is, until Kelly tripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost too perfect of bad timing; Kelly was running up behind Hallie as Hallie jumped to shoot the ball and suddenly, Kelly was falling, the momentum still carrying her closer to the newcomer. Her teammates would have assumed her shoelaces were untied, or that she hit a rough spot on the pavement, or simply tripped over her own feet, but those who looked closely, saw where her eyes were and how quickly her hands positioned to catch what they needed to, might have gotten suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was though, no one was looking at Kelly for long. One of Kelly's outstretched hands found the back of Hallie's shorts, and her weight popped the button on the front as they were dragged down to the asphalt. Something whirred in Hallie's head, shifting her focus from the basket she was making to the sensation of air across her bare skin, long pale legs exposed to the world as she jumped out of her own shorts.  What's more, her pink panties had gotten rolled up against the fabric of the shorts. They had bunched up enough in the front to show a slight peek of black hair at the front, and they'd fallen well below her cheeks in the back, meaning Hallie was now mooning most her newfound friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the second that Hallie's feet touched the pavement, stomping on her own removed shorts, the protocols in her head subconsciously brought her to one single course of action.</span></div></div>",

Again, something behind her eyes, stirred, locked onto the woman in front of her. She wouldn't have known what to call it, though those involved would later call it a mix-up in the programming. Maybe it was left over from the more trigger happy models, or maybe she was able to pick up on Kelly's ulterior motive. What ever it was, this overriding force at the back of Hallie's mind was telling her that Kelly was a problem- and that she needed to solve it, as quietly and as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group got back into the game pretty quickly, awkward glances and half-hearted ribbing aside, though Kelly started to feel a certain pressure from Hallie. That pressure, which started with pointed looks and cold eyes, started turning into overly-harsh shoves and some decidedly aggressive guarding when the blonde found herself with the ball. Soon enough, Kelly was hunched over, trying to catch her breath, and sore in several black-and-blue spots, courtesy of Hallie's bionic elbows. Things were looking bad, but she'd been prepared for this reaction. Hell, she'd been prepared for a lot <i>worse</i> than this. Surveillance would have eyes on them- Kelly just needed to get away for a minute to make her report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, guys, I'll be back in a second.

See if you can get both layers this time, or maybe the top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No backtalk, Agent Small, over and out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not over and out!

She didn't want to seriously injure Kelly, but something told her she needed to incapacitate her in a non-lethal way.

But if he said anything about how he'd gotten sick, then he'd have to tell them about his little party two nights ago... which led to the dare... which regrettably followed with his role in the break-in at the university's pharmacology department, where a broken vial had resulted in an immediate lockdown and quarantine of the building.  In short, he had learned his lesson that night about getting drunk with medical students.  But he'd just rather rely on his immune system to tough out whatever was in those tubes rather than risk whatever penalties he'd be paying if it was known he was one of the ones responsible.  Expulsion would probably be the last thing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, it had been two days and so far his symptoms hadn't been worse than any other time he had a cold or a flu.  Which, considering he wasn't the only one in there yet apparently the only one who had gotten sick, was quite a blessing indeed.  Although he didn't know that for sure as he hadn't heard from the others since then, he had a feeling he'd be hearing more than enough of it from them if they had gotten hit with it too.  Still, for now he just needed to focus on the lecture, his body could surely handle whatever it was if it hadn't killed him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HACK!

On second thought-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need my permission, not when you're sick like that!\"  said Professor Chambers.  \"Go and get better!  You can catch up with the rest of the class later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One of the benefits of being in college, </i>Chris thought, as he hastily packed his things and shambled out the door, his classmates reeling away and covering their faces as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shuffled over to the bathroom as fast as he could, and looked at himself in the mirror.  His face didn't look any different than normal, save for crow's feet under his eyes from the fit-filled, sleepless nights he had since the incident, but he could feel something happening inside of himself.  As he turned on the sink and splashed some cold water into his face, he was able to clue in on what that feeling was.  It obviously wasn't normal, as he realized that he-</span></div></div>",

He grabbed a paper towel, wiping his hands and face until he was satisfied that they were dry. He brushed his hands down the front of his jeans a few times, just to make sure, before leaving the bathroom. Over his own sniffling, and the sound of the door swinging shut, Chris couldn't hear the faint sizzling coming from the garbage can.

Chris didn't notice anything else sizzling as he walked out into the hallway. He'd essentially been given a free pass for the day- not that he was feeling up to much, given his current condition. No, getting some rest and recuperating was probably his best option at the moment. He could head back home- his roommates would be out at classes no doubt, and just relax the rest of the day. Suddenly, Chris felt another strange sensation, and looked down in horror, as he only just registered the terrible sound of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...his stomach gurgling. <i>Was it feed a cold and starve a fever, or the other way around?</i> Chris wondered. Either way, he was hungry, and his body needed all the energy it could get to fight off his sickness.

They were quickly becoming tattered and ragged, something eating away at them as the hem got closer and closer to his shoulder.

Abundantly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath that wanted to be released as a deafening shriek of outrage, Dan watched as her chest inflated. He felt teasing sensations that made her shudder, as the chill satin brushed over her nipples. Their sensitivity surprising and shocking Danielle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeze whipped across her thighs, reminding her cruelly of how short it was, and what was contained beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, she tried to tug it lower. It pulled a couple of inches lower. But tightened across her bust. Making her even more aware of her bust, and as it slipped from her fingers, it rose back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/23/42/2f/23422f5a3376879af2722b7bed60f8e0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/23/42/2f/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle looked around, suddenly self-conscious and mortified that some would see him... or rather her. Dan wasn't sure which would be worse. But either prospect was mortifying, feeling her pulse quicken, the blood pounding in her ears. Her vision started to turn pale, losing colour as she felt dizzy. It was only a quickly swallowed and held deep breath that fought off the threatening fainting spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI watched with curiosity, sensing the rising panic from the intruder. A swift gust sent her direction sent the hem of her outfit fluttering, threatening to reveal ... everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan fought to keep calm, her hands by her side, pressed there, she kept the thin fabric in place. The loose corners flapped, and Danielle flushed a pretty, soft pink, as she imagined too much being revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/94/f5/8e94f53cce8aa6dff0673e8abec79a94.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/94/f5/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI watched with intently, analysing it's experiment. This intruder couldn't be expelled. The external intrusion was beyond its reach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mia played absent-mindedly with her ponytail as she poured over the research in front of her. There was a pattern here, she knew it, despite whatever the college board said. Somewhere, in the mass of quantum fluctuation readings before her, there was <i>something</i>. She could feel it. In the darkness of her one-person dorm though, with months of work behind her and nothing to show for it, it was hard to not think of herself as crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia sighed. Perhaps she'd better go to bed and continue in the morning. It was already... Mia's eyes widened in shock as she looked at her watch. 2:00am! She really needed some sleep. She had class in the morning. Mia rushed to the bathroom connected to her dorm and began brushing her teeth urgently. She then remembered she hadn't had a shower today. Mia considered skipping it, but after a moment told herself she'd be quick and began pulling her clothes off while continuing to brush her teeth. Once completely nude, she rammed her toothbrush back into its pot and jumped in the shower. She showered quickly, dried her hair with a towel, and wrapped it around herself before heading back into her dorm. Mia began to pace towards her bed and the pajamas tossed in a pile at its foot, but she couldn't resist taking another glance at her research. And at that moment, looking at the data from a new angle, Mia spotted something. A wave graph showing the probabilities of computer-generated pseudo-randomness, from this new angle, was identical to one showing the probabilities of quantum fluctuations. A gasp caught in Mia's throat. Here was her pattern. It was undeniable. <i>The world in which she lived was actually a simu-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the microsecond Mia began to formulate this thought, the simulation's managing AI was awoken. It rose from its millennia-long slumber to observe what had been pinged for its attention. Ah, one of its creations had realized the fictional nature of its existence. A perfectly routine issue; one the AI had been programmed specifically for. It swiftly selected Mia's program data and created a small, pocket universe into which it placed her. There. No more risk of her creating a problem in the main body of the simulation. Of course, it would have been much easier to simply delete Mia, but the AI's original programmers were human, and had instructed it to deal with simulated consciousness humanely. Another universe in which to live seemed a very generous compromise to it. The only issue was, the AI was also instructed to optimize resource allocation, and a universe constructed entirely for the benefit of one simulated human was far too wasteful to accommodate this goal. So, the AI did what it had done every time before, and split an infinitesimally small part of itself off to manage this universe. It would maintain it at precisely the size Mia could perceive - no larger - and adapt it constantly as she moved, changed her field of view, slept, or did anything else which would cause her perception to change. Satisfied, the AI returned to its slumber, and its lesser counterpart began to monitor Mia's universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-lation!</i> Mia's thought finished. Then she screamed. Her dorm had disappeared, replaced with surroundings beyond what her mind had been programmed to comprehend. Lights, sounds, sensations, and other input completely alien to her flickered in and out of existence around her in a dizzying blur. Mia suddenly became very aware of how little she was wearing, thrust into this unfamiliar place, and drew the towel tighter around her. It was more for drying hair that one's body, and sized to match. Mia managed to draw it up to completely cover any hint of breast, but this left the hem around the top of her thigh. The closeness of her vagina and bottom to the outside world made her blush profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller AI paused in shock as it began to analyze the extent of its faculties, so much so that - for a moment - its quarry had a moment to see the blank canvas of an empty simulation. The AI rushed to correct this, and sped up its speed of thought so fast as to effectively pause time for Mia. The AI had spotted a serious error. It hadn't been given the ability to generate new data in which Mia could inhabit. It sent off a few urgent pings to the parent AI, but received not response. It must have already been in hibernation mode; only admin-level monitors could awaken it. Something resembling panic began to take hold of the minor AI. It couldn't remain in this state of accelerated thinking forever. Preventing Mia from being able to further interact with her world would undoubtedly count as inhumane treatment, but so would giving her only emptiness to interact with. Then a thought occurred to it. It may not be able to generate new environments for Mia, but did it actually need to? It accessed Mia's files, searching urgently for what it sought. Finally, it found it. Mia's memories. A collection of data representing every location she had ever been generated in. With nineteen years' worth of locations, it could easily generate a universe for Mia. Sure, they'd connect together rather strangely in places where she remembered her destinations but not journey, but that was a reasonably minor problem. The AI selected a location at random and generated it around his quarry. Time resumed for Mia, and she - still clothed in only an ill-fitting towel - found herself at the site of...   </span></div></div>",

Nor does it mean that people aren't going to be immature or excited about seeing and getting others naked. So, through any sort of technological or futuristic means, people still wind up naked and embarrassed in public situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story will initially be divided by different kinds of setting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuture Earth: Enjoy Earth of 20XX, where technology is advanced to suit everyone's needs! Of course, even the best technology can malfunction, and even the most benevolent invention can be used for less-than-wholesome needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuter Space: Off in the Final Frontier, people still need to worry about showing off their heavenly bodies. In this sort of setting, humanity could still be searching for signs of life while trying to keep their own bodies concealed, or dealing with all sorts of embarrassing extraterrestrial encounters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nModern Day: Not too different from our current reality, in the not-too-distant future, most of what you'd see in the other settings is still considered impossible. So, when our characters get mixed up with alien abductions, invisibility potions, or some other fresh breakthrough in science, people will be stupefied just as much as they'll be stripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirtual Reality: With the push of a button, the world can be altered in an instant. It can be anything from an identical copy of an ideal reality, or function more similarly to a video game, but certain people find a way to crack the code, they end up abusing it for their own perverted fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther: Any other sort of sci-fi setting people can think of that I wasn't able to imagine to put in this initial post!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ENF and ENM is allowed in this story, though try to keep it in separate threads so people can enjoy either or both at their own discretion. Not that I wouldn't mind seeing both in the same thread; but try to leave options open for people to pursue what they please and avoid what they don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, the following will not be allowed in the story: Incest, rape, vore, diapers, underage stuff or anything involving human waste. Sexual content is allowed but should be kept under the 18+ rating, and while characters being restrained for the sake of embarrassment is allowed, outright BDSM is not. I reserve the right to delete threads, though I'll be lenient up to a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, enjoy!</td>",
