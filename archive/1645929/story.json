After watching the ending you relaxed and that's when you got a strange idea.  Sure it wouldn't work in real life it was just a game plot after all.  Or would it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to your TV you slowly placed your hand on the screen, ripples appeared and rippled outwards toward the corners of the screen, you slowly dipped your hand in further with amazement,  \"Holy crap.....it works?\", you shouted.  Entranced by the amazing prospect put before you you decided to climb through to the other side, when you emerged you weren't in the TV world you remember.  You were in a room, no......a GIANT room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you saw discarded clothes, a towering shelving unit and bed, books littered around the floor and a huge pair of trainers thrown recklessly beside you.  That's when you heard it a loud and thundering creak as vibrations shook the enormous ground before you, you immediately spun round to the door opening and the enormous form of someone walking in, that's when you realized who it was.</span></div></div>",

You gazed up in awe as he got closer to you, each step he took would have felt like several miles  to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know whether to run and hide or try and grab his attention, for now you figured your best bet was just to get out of the way of this giant.  You made a mad dash to the left side of the room just barely escaping the enormous shadow of his foot as it came crashing down on your former position seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one\" you thought, now what exactly would your plan of action be......</span></div></div>",

You figured they\u2019d give you some cover and a chance to stop and think. You briefly considered hiding in the pair trainers but the thought of being crushed along with the fact you could already smell them quickly ruled out that idea. The ground trembled with each of Yosuke's footsteps until he reached his bed and flopped down unceremoniously. You could hear the springs screech as Yosuke sat down and from your hiding place, you got a full view of his gigantic feet dangling off the bedside. Despite how frightening and weird the situation was, you couldn\u2019t help but be a little excited. You were seeing a game character for real, the world of Persona was real. \u201cMan, what a day\u201d you heard the giant mumble before shuffling around on the bed trying to get comfortable. An endless stream of questions ran through your head, scenes you remembered from the games, character revelations, emotional moments and \u201cFrrrrrrtttt\u201d, your emotional recollection was dashed by Yosuke passing gas. His bed muffled the sound but the act was embarrassingly obvious. You couldn\u2019t help but blush slightly even though you knew to his perspective he was alone in the privacy of his room and the fact is everybody farts. Yosuke sighed audibly and you heard the creaking of springs shifting under the magicians weight.</span></div></div>",

Waiting to bide your time and make sure this was really happening you decided to sit on the floor and wait to see what was going to happen.  Minutes passed, the only things that happened were Yosuke's feet twitching ever so slightly or the springs above you creaking from what you guessed was him shifting around trying to become more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he's asleep...?\" you muttered to yourself, quietly not that if you even shouted your voice would probably not reach him.  You prop yourself up onto your feet and proceed to the foot of the bed closer to his hanging feet.  As you get closer and closer to them you notice the smell becoming stronger and stronger, obviously since his feet were probably stuck in his shoes all day.  As you reach his feet you walk into the space directly between his big toe on his right foot.  You blush excitedly as you look up at it and giggle somewhat to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully you reach your hand out and slowly rub the tip of his toe not wanting to wake him, at your first touch the toe twitches slightly but then relaxes again.  You continue taking in all the details of his feet when suddenly the springs of the bed screech above you like thunder.  Not sure if Yosuke is waking up or just turning over in his sleep you still need to make a decision quickly.</span></div></div>",

Just come by in an hour!\u201d Yosuke yells and hangs up.<br>\r\nYou stand still as he lifts up into the air and walks out of the room. <br>\r\nYou decide to go to where he was sitting and lie down.
