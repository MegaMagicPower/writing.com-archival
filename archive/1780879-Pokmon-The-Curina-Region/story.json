Piplup!\" Joined her blue penguin like creature, Piplup.<br>\r\nThey had been waiting half an hour for him to get back from his house. Ash Ketchum and Pikachu live in a place called Pallet Town. Pallet Town is located in the Kanto region. This was the place where the soon-to-be pokemon master started out.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Dawn, but I got overwhelmed by all this... It feels like just yesterday I was running in my pajamas to Professor Oak's to get my first pokemon,\" Ash sighed.<br>\r\n\"Pika pika,\" Pikachu joined.<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys!\" Shouted a friendly female voice. Ash turned to see a tall girl with orange hair, short shorts,a white tee, and tennis shoes. She held a Togepi in her arms and ran up to Ash and gave him a hug.<br>\r\n\"MISTY?!\" Ash exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"I found her at the professor's!\" Brock explained.<br>\r\n\"Ash it's been waaaaaaaay too long! How's your journey?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n\"Its okay... I've filled out four pokedexs since last time,\" he replied awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"ASH?! Ash Ketchum?!\" Yelled another voice. This time it was a boy in a hood. A strange bee creature followed him as he walked up to Ash.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n\"Double T is what you can call me. I was sent here to give you something,\" Double T answered mysteriously.<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Ash started, but was given four tickets with a picture of a heart on it.<br>\r\n\"They're to be used at Vermillion City. They'll take you somewhere magical,\" Double T explained.<br>\r\n\"But-\" Ash started, but Double T had already left.<br>\r\n\"That was... Strange...\" Brock murmured.<br>\r\nAsh looked at the tickets and read them aloud.<br>\r\n\"Take a trip to the Curina region, a region of many mysteries and magic...\" He read.<br>\r\nEveryone looked at eachother and nodded to go. They went to Ash's to bid farewell to his mom. Then Proffessor Oak's.<br>\r\n\"Curina... This is a place which I know little about...\" The proffessor said as he looked at the tickets. \"But, the proffessor there- Proffessor Hickory I think it was- sent in three pokeballs for you. One and that's it...\"<br>\r\nAsh looked at them as the proffessor explained each one.</span></div></div>",

Everyone walked outside to see what was causing the uproar.<br>\r\n\"Get back here! Your under arrest!\" Shouted officer Jenny from her motorcycle.<br>\r\n\"What's going on officer Jenny?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n\"These troublemakers just blew up part of the Safari Zone and took almost all the Pok\u00e9mon there! Then, they blew up part of the Celadon Department Store and took all the merchandise!\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha! Don't you know?\" giggled one of the female members. The group wore black suits with knee high pink boots. The pants were short shorts. Their shirts were skin tight and covered by large lab coats. They wore safety goggles and their hats were small and had a long tail that reached down to their backs.<br>\r\n\"We are Team Nuclear!\" one of the other members joined. \"And now that you know, you can run along and tell all your little friends about us!\"<br>\r\n\"Pikachu, use Thunder!\" Ash commanded strongly. Pikachu lept in the air and curled in a ball.<br>\r\n\"Pika...CHUUUUU!\" He screamed. A flash of electricity shot out of his cheeks and electrocuted their hovercraft. There was a little smoke, but nothing else happened. They smiled at them.<br>\r\n\"Nice try. Really, it was quite a show. But, it'll take more than a mere mouse to bring us down!\" Shouted a man with the same suit, only with indigo and red. They took of and left a dark patch where they had been hovering.<br>\r\n\"We may have lost them, but my love for you will never be lost!\" Brock said as he grabbed officer Jenny's hand. She grabbed a small box and pushed it against him and there was a popping sound.<br>\r\n\"NYA! Maybe later then...\" He choked out.<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me or all taser you again!\" She growled, then she drove away.<br>\r\nProfessor Oak was by the dark patch. He wore white gloves and rubbed the blackened and withering grass and flowers.<br>\r\n\"This is nuclear refuse... Highly toxic, but can be used as an efficient way to use alternate fuel...\" He explained solemnly. \"Well, you better get going to Curina.\"<br>\r\n\"What about the Pok\u00e9mon?!\" Ash exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"... I'm sure you'll find them there. Now, go! Those tickets expire soon!\" He insisted. The group left and headed for Viridian and weaved through the Viridian forest, then through Pewter city where Brock said hi to his family,  got a little lost in Mt. Moon, then through Cerulean where Misty picked up Starmie and Psyduck, down through Saffron, and finally stopped at Vermillion City port. There was a huge mass of people there waiting to get aboard the cruise ship to Curina.</span></div></div>",

I've been looking for you two!! Now GET BACK TO WORK!\" Shouted a fat man in a captain's uniform.<br>\r\n\"Eighty, eye! Captain,\" they yelled as they quickly started mopping the deck.<br>\r\nAfter an hour of mopping and scrubbing and shoving Wobbafett in his pokeball about two hundred more times, they sat down and rested.<br>\r\n\"Well done! I can see my face in the wood!\" Squealed a girl with brown short shorts and a light blue tee-shirt. She gave them all lemonades and gave the pokemon food. She also gave them five dollars.<br>\r\n\"Scuse' me! Can I have a sandwich instead?\" Meowth asked.<br>\r\n\"Goodness! Are you from Curina?\" She asked as she poked at him.<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. Why?\" Jessie asked.<br>\r\n\"The pokemon there are pretty special. According to legend, the pokemon there all belonged to a trainer that lived there. They grew up and learned many of her abilities, such as speaking english. A rumor also started that the pokemon there have the ability to turn a human into a pokemon!\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"A human... Into a POKEMON?!\" The trio exclaimed.<br>\r\nShe nodded. Then gave Meowth a sandwich and left.<br>\r\nLINE*LINE*LINE*THIS IS A LINE*LINE*LINE*LINE<br>\r\n\"Wow... Did you hear that lady's story?\"Ash asked his party. They nodded.<br>\r\n\"That's a little scary, knowing that could happen to somebody...\"Misty murmured.<br>\r\n\"I wonder what abilities the pokemon have!\" Dawn remarked.<br>\r\n\"I wonder what GIRLS it has!\" Brock sighed dreamily.<br>\r\n\"HELLO!\" Cried an echoey voice. The group turned to face the girl Team Rocket had been talking to. She was on a podium with a microphone.\"WHILE WE ARE HERE, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S ON BOARD! TO YOUR RIGHT IS THE BATTLE ARENA. TO YOUR LEFT IS TO THE INSIDE OF THE SHIP. BEHIND YOU IS A BEAUTY SALON AND A GIFT SHOP. AND BEHIND ME IS A WATER PARK.

You feeling better?\" Asked Ash happily.<br>\r\n\"Chaaaaaa!\" He squealed.<br>\r\nThey walked away and headed off the ship. What lay before them was a magnificent landscape. It had tropical trees filled with big ripened fruit and pokemon that were eating from it. The sand was warm and soft and the grass was tall, but not too tall. Just right. The flowers were also in bloom, I might add. They were huge and had the colours of red, pink, purple, and a few times the mix of blue and green. They were just big enough for a Smoochum to take a nap in. The sun complimented all the plants very well. It was as if the sun positioned itself so it made every inch of everything to make it glow. But the ocean was probably the best feature. The waves were perfect. Not too big, not too small, not too powerful, and not too light. Just perfect. Everything looked like paradise and it made them relaxed.<br>\r\n\"Wow... This island... Is so beautiful!\" Dawn remarked with a dreamy sigh.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Misty joined as she sat on the sand.<br>\r\n\"Pikachu!\" Shouted Pikachu.

That's my good ear! I use it to hear things!\" She whined.<br>\r\n\"Wow... Its in a hurry to get out of hear...\" Misty said.<br>\r\n\"He wouldn't let her speak at all...\" Dawn added.<br>\r\n\"Pokemon like Gengar are usually very cruel, but in my perspective, I think it was just being over protective...\" Brock said.<br>\r\n\"I wonder why?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n\"Pika pika...\" Pikachu joined.<br>\r\n\"Well I'm gonna figure out who she is weather he likes it or not!\" Ash shouted.

Hello!\"<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" He returned. \"Who are you?!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n\"I am the GYM leader. I do all types of pokemon. I even have a manor full of them! I live in there by the way. Its nice to have pokemon in every inch off your house because it never get's cold,\" she explained.<br>\r\n\"What about the ice type pokemon?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"I keep them in my giant shed, which is also my refridgerator,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n\"Okay, but what's your name?\" He asked angrily.<br>\r\n\"Sigh...

It slowly stood on both feet and transformed into a human girl!<br>\r\n\"What the-?!\" Ash stammered.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not a proper greeting...\" she growled. Her hair was black, as well as her pants. Her shirt was a light baby blue and she wore a pair of glasses. She also wore a white lab coat.<br>\r\n\"Er... hi...\" Ash mumbled.<br>\r\n\"My name is Hailey. I work with Professor Hickory,\" Hailey explained.<br>\r\n\"I'm Olivia!\" said the girl picking the berries. Her hair was a golden blonde with a few brownish streaks. She was up to the chin of Hailey. She wore red stilletos, a black skirt, a white shirt, and a black sash over it. She also wore glasses, but they took the shape of a rectangles.<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" the group shuddered.<br>\r\n\"What? Anthros aren't that bad...\" Olivia murmured.<br>\r\n\"You are, too?!\" Dawn squeaked.<br>\r\n\"I'm a Poliwag!\" she replied happily.<br>\r\n\"Is there more of you?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure! This place is full of them! Why, here comes Professor Hickory right now!\" Olivia said as she pointed to a large, dog-like creature.<br>\r\n\"An Umbreon?! Even the professor is anthro?!\" Brock said in shock.<br>\r\nThe pokemon got on both feet and turned into a woman. Her hair was bumped up and long. It was blonde and reached to her waist. All you could see that she wore was Nike tennis shoes and a lab coat. Her eyes were a deep shade of blue.<br>\r\n\"Hi Professor Hickory!\" cheered Hailey and Olivia.<br>\r\n\"Hello, girls!\" replied Hickory. \"Ash! Hello! I've been waiting for you! I need your help! Will you please help me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His father helped Professor Hickory find the Drozalisc fossil and then whispered to Ash, \"That is Adam Kaiser, his father help us find the Drozalisc fossil.

He was a pink ball-shaped creature with red feet. He wore a serious and rigid countenance. He had a funny green hat and an intimidating sword. Only Hailey went forward to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Kirby,\" she said. \"What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby brightened up immediately. \"Ah! Hailey!\" he responded. \"I'm feeling fine today. Just decided to take a look at this cave. I felt there might be something of interest in there, but, so far, I was wrong. So, who are your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group relaxed a little and introduced themselves to Kirby. They were still a little cautious by the enigmatic feel around him. For awhile, they stayed quiet. Realizing that, Ash spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where ya from?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm from a faraway planet called Pop Star,\" Kirby returned. \"I came over here to investigate the Legend of the Lost Girl of Curina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey broke in. \"Come on, Kirby. That's just a myth that one generation passes down to another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group gave a puzzled look, so Kirby explained the legend. \"Maybe that's what you believe, but there is just something about it that makes it not a common myth. Since the rest of you seem to not know it, I will explain it to you. See, there was once a girl who was one with Pokemon, able to understand what Pokemon wanted and able to explain that to other people. She was a skilled trainer, and she managed to catch the Legendary Mew with her trusted Charizard, Flame. She continued catching Legendary Pokemon to the point where there was only one not in her possession. Just as she was on the verge of catching this Pokemon, she vanished without a trace. something about that story seems suspiciously true. At least in the words of Azelf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby took out a poke ball and handed it over to Ash. He continued while watching the stunned Ash. \"There are unknown forces at work around, and I believe that you all need to be prepared for whatever might happen. I'm off to see what else I might find in Curina to uncover the truth to this mystery. May we meet again. Farewell.\" A star came down, and Kirby jumped on it. In a moment, he was gone.</span></div></div>",

The cave turned dark quickly, but the flame Hailey supplied as a Growlithe gave ample lighting for the group to progress. It had started off very wide, but ther cave got narrower and narrower the further they travelled. Eventually it began to widen again, but the path took many sharp turns afterwards. Soon, they came into a very large room already lit up well. Hailey reassumed human form and suggested that the group look around. As the group looked around, Ash noticed a strange part of the floor. <i>Wonder what that is?</i> he thought. \"WHOAAAA!!!\" he yelled as he fell down the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty ran over to the hole first. \"Ash Ketchum!\" she yelled. \"What have you got yourself into this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stood up. \"I'm fine. I think I'm going to take a look down here. Oh, and send Pikachu down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu immediately jumped down into Ash's hands. \"Pika! Pika!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underpass was also well lit. Ash and Pikachu walked a bit, but came across a huge wall shortly after. \"Guess that means there's nothing this way. I guess we - WHAT WAS THAT?\" Ash noticed the shadow again. This time, however, it approached them. Ash noted that it looked somewhat like Pikachu, except it was a deep, dark shade of purple and that there was something strangely deep in its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHUUUUUU,\" it murmmered. A second figure walked closer. It was a middle-aged woman with deep, black hair and a mischievous demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" she started. \"My name is Regina, and this is my little friend, Psychu. That's not important, though. Who are you? And how did you find my little hiding place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm Ash Ketchum, and this is Pikachu. I actually fell in through a hole, and Pikachu jumped in after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina was looking more closely at Ash. She seemed to be staring at something deep inside Ash for a moment. Then she started talking again. \"Your aura... it reads the Key of Destiny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Key of what?\" Ash responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Regina's manner became slightly more irratated. \"There are secrets in Curina meant to be discovered by the Key of Destiny. If it be so, I must bestow the Gift to him and his allies. If you are the Key of Hope, prove it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ash could speak darkness shrouded Regina's body. When it subsided a Mismagius was standing. \"I don't know what's going on, but I do love battling.\" Ash took out the Ball Kirby had given him. \"Let's see your strength, Azelf!\"</span></div></div>",

Now's the time for kicking some ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf glanced at Regina and her Psychu. <i>A battle? Alright. Although, it has been quite some time since I was last under a Trainer.</i> Azelf floated over to Pikachu. <i>You ready?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika! Pika!\" replied Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina wasted no time hurling a Shadow Ball at Azelf. Ash panicked. <i>Crap!</i> he thought. <i>I don't even know what attacks Azelf knows!</i> To his suprise Azelf merely yawned before returning the attack with Mirror Coat. The counterattack was strong enough to knock Regina out. Azelf beames with pride. The Psychu, however, quickly became angry. It began to charge up for a Hyper Beam before Ash yelled, \"Pikachu use Thunderbolt on Psychu!\" The ray of pure power unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PIIKAACHUUUU!\" If this battle had occured little after Ash acquired Pikachu, the pure power of Hyper Beam surely would have disintegrated the Thunderbolt. Years of experience, however, allowed it to dominate the Hyper Beam, returning it towards Psychu. It fell down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina stood up as human again. \"Indeed that power could only come from Pokemon who harness the power from the soul of the Key of Hope,\" she uttered.</span></div></div>",

And what is this \"Key of Destiny\" and this \"Key of Hope?\" At that moment, however, he was more worried about how dark it had become and how he could get back to the upper room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, Ash could see a dim light from what seemed to be a very far distance.

Can you guys go back and find another way to get to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do!\" Brock responded. The light grew dimmer as Ash proceeded further into the cave.</span></div></div>",

The waves crashed gently at the shores of Ugaria Town.  Krabby and Staryu scuttled across the sand as the beach began to crowd with tourists from the Kanto Region, just having arrived from the docks.  The Curina Region was waking up for the day, though many of the year's newest trainers were just a bit quicker.<br>\r\n<i>This is it!</i> thought Amethyst eagerly.  <i>The day I get my Pokemon!  I'll be the very first!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon enough, the young Professor Hickory opened the doors to her lab, yawning into the sleeve of her lab coat.  Her blonde hair was ravaged, and she had specks of black oil on herself.  She had bags under her eyes as she gazed at the group of four adolescents, picking Amethyst and beckoning her to enter the laboratory.<br>\r\n\"So you're the first of this generation of trainers, hmm?\"  Hickory asked, eying the young girl curiously.  She seemed to excited to speak.  \"Very well.  You may pick from these three that I have hand picked.  You may only have one, so choose carefully...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amethyst looked them all over, staring at their pictures rather than their stats.<br>\r\n<i>There's Leafbon, the grass type...

To her relief, however, Starckler seemed to be at attention and ready to defend.<br>\r\n\"Leafbon, use Leech Seed!\" Garnet instructed with a shout, grinning eagerly as the Pokemon obeyed.<br>\r\n\"Starckler, use Bubble!\" Amethyst returned.  The Pokemon gave a yawn and slowly performed the task, but it took enough time to take a hit from Leafbon's Tackle attack. The tired Pokemon let out a shrill squeal, the Leech Seed going into effect.  Leafbon seemed rejuvenated, and Starckler a bit drained.<br>\r\n\"Your Pokemon is pathetic, Amethyst!'

It let out a bitter squeak to Amethyst before hastily obeying.  Leafbon manage to Tackle back, and once again was strengthened by Leech Seed, making Starckler plop tiredly on the battle field.  Amethyst could tell the battle was on its last length, but she wasn't going to wuss out.  \"Make this last one count, Starckler!  Use Bubble!\"  The Pokemon groaned, though used what little energy remained and let out a full fledged Bubble attack!<br>\r\n<i>Critical Hit!</i> Amethyst thought excitedly as the Leafbon twirled dizzily and fell to the ground, defeated.<br>\r\n\"Oh, no!

She was glad her mother had packed her with a sleeping bag, because soon enough, the heated tropical forest was a bitter cold freezer.  She set up a tarp, draping it over a branch before uncurling the sleeping bag and setting it inside.  She placed a cute star patterned blanket over the sleeping bag before crawling in to rest.  Starckler followed, its suction cups popping as it shook in the cold.<br>\r\n\"Come here, you...\" Amethyst murmured, pulling the shivering Pokemon into the sleeping bag with her.<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was morning.

A cake with white frosting and ten lit candles was at the center of the table.<br>\r\n\"Make a wish a Forest,\" said the mother, Ivy Vyne. She had a long green braid and blue eyes. She wore a navy polo shirt and jeans. The father, Thor N.E. Vyne, had dark blue hair and steely gray eyes. He wore a button up gray shirt, and khakis. The grandmother, Rose Vyne, had white hair held in a bun, pink eyes, and wore glasses and a pinkght sun dress. The daughter was Forest Vyne. She had long green hair in two pigtails and pink eyes. She wore a button up black shirt, a pink plaid skirt, thigh high white socks and silver boots. <br>\r\nForest took a deep breath and blew out the candles. After eating the cake, presents were passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh a pokecharm!\" Forest squealed excitedly. She dangeled the necklace in front of her. It was a silver star with a pokeball in the middle. Pressing the pokeball, the star unfolded into a circle. There were four screens, and a keyboard on the bottom panel. Forest could check emails and make calls, access maps, and play the radio all at the same time. \"Nanna, Mom, Dad, I can't thank you enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not our only surprise sweetie.\" said Mom, \"Go upstairs and pack your things quickly, Professor Hickory is waiting.\" Forest was confused for a minute before her face lit up with realization. She looked between her mother and then her father. Her father gave a small nod. Without that, Forest tore off to her room, rushing to fit everything in her bag while she prayed her parents wouldn't change their mind. Her grandmother entered her room while Forest was struggling to zip up her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie you realize what this means right?\" Nanna said sweetly. <br>\r\n\"It means I'm going on my Pokemon journey right?\" Forest asked uneasily, afraid she had been tricked.<br>\r\n\"It means we won't get to see each other every day. You will be away on adventures, and we will be here praying for your safety.\" Nanna finished with a sigh. Forest stopped fighting her bag's zipper and looked at her grandmother. <br>\r\n\"Are you worried Nanna?\" She asked<br>\r\n\"My only granddaughter is going out into the big bad world. Of course I'm worried\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nanna,\" Forest moved over to hug her, \"Don't worry so much. You went on journey at my age, just like Mom and Dad and every other adult. It's how I'll become an adult. And I promise to call every week.\" That was when Thor walked in. Forest and Rose hastily separated.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\"  He asked. <br>\r\nForest grabbed her mostly zipped up bag and said,\" yep.\" After a brief goodbye with her parents, Forest left for the Professor's lab. Walking through the lab, Forest spotted the tall blonde woman she was looking for.<br>\r\n\"Professor, it's me Forest,\" Forest called out to the scientist. Hickory straightened up from her machine and looked at Forest.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Forest, so you did come. If you follow me I'll show where the Pokemon are.\" The professor led them to a table with three pokeballs. \"In each ball is a pokemon.

And then promptly kicked them out.<br>\r\n\"Get out and go on your damn journey already!\"<br>\r\nAfter getting kicked out of the Professor's lab, Blush and Forest departed after another round of lame insults and childish bickering. Finally, Forest found herself on the edge of her hometown, Ugaria Town.<br>\r\n\"Well this it...\" She muttered and left without looking back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Professor Hickory's Lab, a young boy received the last starter, Starckler, and his name was... </span></div></div>",

Leafbon ran at her side, throwing attacks at Boohimp at Forest's commands.However, Boohimp was able to dodge most of the attacks, leaving various amounts of damage in their wake. Forest and Leafbon weaved in and out of streets and alleyways while trying to keep up with the Pokemon. Forest's lungs were beginning to burn and her legs were beginning to ache. Leafbon was positively wilted. Eventually the two of them collapsed next to one of the lit street lamps.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Damn...him...\" Forest muttered as she looked around and found she could not fin Boohimp anywhere, \"My...present...\" She gasped a little more before finally catching her breath. Feeling a little better, she took a better look around. Truly, there was no sign of Boohimp or her Poke Charm, she was completely lost and her Pokemon was completely exhausted. <br>\r\n\"Leafbon,\" Forest addressed her Pokemon, \"Why don't you rest in your ball.\" The tired Pokemon happily accepted. Once Leafbon was put away, Forest let out a deep sigh. <br>\r\n\"I'm not thinking straight, and now I'm lost. I need to find someone I can trust to give me directions to the nearest Pokemon center. As much as I hate to give up, I guess for now it's for the best.\" However glancing around the dark street, Forest saw no one but but dark men that clung to the shadows. A little unnerved, Forest decided to move on and try and find a safer looking area. Walking down the street, she heard a few of the men call out to her, call her disgusting things, but Forest just clutched her bag and kept walking. Street after street, she continued, but only grew more and more lost, and was to afraid to ask anyone she saw. Finally, she found herself in front of an abandoned warehouse. A couple of older kids were there. Feeling braver around fellow children (even older children), Forest decided to approach them. As she got closer, Forest noticed they were dressed a little oddly. The girls wore black dresses, black tights, black boots, black shoulder high gloves and a dark gray cloak. The boys wore black pants, black boots, a black turtle neck, and a dark gray cloak. On their cloaks was a strange symbol. To Forest it looked like a swirly moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me,\" She said quietly to one of the girls, \"I'm a little lost. Can you direct me to the nearest Pokemon Center?\" The older girl sneered at her.<br>\r\n\"Hey Hugo!\" She called, \"There's a squirt here who's lost. She wants to get to the Pokemon Center. What should we do with her?\" One of the boys lying down stood up and walked over. He was huge. He stood at least six feet tall and gave Forest a crooked smile that made her squirm. <br>\r\n\"You're looking for the Pokemon Center right? That must mean you're a Pokemon trainer.\" He stated.<br>\r\n\"Yes I am trainer,\" Forest answered him, even though it was not really a question. Hugo pulled out a pokeball.<br>\r\n\"In that case, if you want to know where the Pokemon Center is, you'll have to beat me. But if I win I get your Pokemon.\" Hugo grinned down at her as said it. Forest was terrified.<br>\r\n\"I-I-I don't want to battle you!\" She stuttered out.<br>\r\n\"Then that means you automatically forfeit, and I get your Pokemon!\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" She screamed, but the other kids began to crowd around her, ready to help their leader. ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the Pokeball came a Creapr. Forest pulled out her Pokedex:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creapr<br>\r\nGhost<br>\r\nHt: 2' 6\" Wt: 31 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like a purple puff of smoke with a skull for a face and skeleton hands.

Forest jumped, and then, brought back to reality, grabbed her Pokemon and sent out Leafbon. The exhausted Pokemon took a moment to take in its surroundings and the situation before turning on Forest and chewing her out. Forest was rather happy to be unable to understand Pokemon. Just from the volume and tone, she knew Leafbon was not saying nice things to her. Her cheeks burned red as the kids around her laughed.<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Hugo forced out through his laughter, \" Aren't you supposed be the trainer? It looks like the Pokemon's training you!\" <br>\r\nForest forced out through her indignation, \" Enough talk! Let's battle!.\" Her face burned bright red as she said the words. Hugo said, \"Please, is a Pokemon like that even worth the effort?\" At the words, Leafbon straightened up at his words and turned around in a battle ready stance. <br>\r\n\"Leafbon!\" Said the Leafbon, ready for battle. Hugo straightened up to.<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get this over with. You can go first.\" He offered generously.<br>\r\n\"Fine Leafbon use leech seed!\" Forest commanded.<br>\r\n\"Creapr, dodge and use Bite!\"<br>\r\nCreapr was unable to dodge the leech seed, but was able to land the Bite.

Forest looked up and saw Hugo was smiling his creepy lopsided smile again. \"Do you think you're leaving this place now?\"<br>\r\n\"But you said...\" A confused and terrified Forest said, \"You said you'd let me go back to the Pokemon Center if I beat you!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't remember saying anything...\" He started laughing again, and all the spectators began to crowd around Forest. \"You might be able to leave, if you can manage to beat us all...\" Forest clutched tighter to Boohimp. <br>\r\n\"Boo, hoo, hoo\" He said worriedly. <br>\r\n\"Now, now Hugo, it's not very nice to break promises.\" An unfamiliar voice said. Everyone turned to see a newcomer leaning up against a crate in the warehouse. He looked about the same age as Forest. He had white hair, with his bangs combed over his right eye, and a silver eye. He was dressed the same as the rest of the gang. Black turtle neck, black pants and shoes and a dark gray cloak. Everyone in the ware house, except for Forest and Boohimp, backed away from the newcomer. \"C'mon, kid, I'll take you to the Pokemon Center.\" A strange chill filled the air.<br>\r\n\"Y-you know, I-I'd rather n-not,\" Forest stuttered out, and began to shiver. <br>\r\n\"Oh no, I insist!\" <br>\r\nDarkness filled Forest's vision...</span></div></div>",

Next to the bed was her bag. Leaning back, her hand fell on something furry and alive. <br>\r\n\"Gah,\" Forest yelped and pulled back her hand.<br>\r\n\"BOO!\" Cried a startled Boohimp.<br>\r\n\"Boohimp? You're here?\" Forest gasped.<br>\r\n\"Boo, hoo,\" was the answer she got.<br>\r\n\"Leafbon!\" Forest nearly screamed, the events from the previous night coming back to her. Forest quickly dug the pokeball out of her bag and released the Pokemon inside. Forest jumped out of the bed and hugged the irritated, but safe and healthy Leafbon.<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness you're alright!\" Forest gushed with affection. She turned to Boohimp who was still in the bed. \"And Boohimp, thank you so much for coming to the rescue last night, how can I repay?\" Forest said as she threw her arms around him. After snuggling with him for a minute, Forest pulled away and said, \"But where are we? What happened last night? The last thing I remember is that creepy pale kid, and then... everything went dark...and now we're...\" Forest trailed off, looking from one Pokemon to the next for some clue. Someone knocked on Forest's door.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Miss Vyne, may I come in? It's Nurse Jenny.\" Said a kind voice from the other side of the door. <br>\r\n\"Nurse Jenny! Oh, okay, you can come in.\" Forest said, realizing she was still in her day clothes. The blue haired nurse walked in.<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you're awake. How are you and you're Pokemon feeling?\" She asked as a Chansey walked in behind her. <br>\r\n\"Just fine ma'am, but I can't remember how I got here. What happened Nurse Jenny?\"<br>\r\n\"That's what I was hoping you could tell me. I found you and you're Pokemon unconscious outside the Pokemon Center. I healed your Pokemon and put you to rest.\"<br>\r\nForest considered what to tell Nurse Jenny.<br>\r\n\"Nurse Jenny, does this city have any gang problems?\" Forest asked.<br>\r\n\"No dear, Sunshine City is very safe!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"Forest trailed off, not sure what to say to pure naivety on Nurse's face. In the end, Forest decided not to burden the Nurse with knowledge of the gang-cult-whatever she had found last night. Forest tried to think of something to divert the Nurse's attention. Her eyes fell on Boohimp and she exclaimed, \"e Oh! By the way this isn't actually my Boohimp.\" She informed Nurse Jenny. A confused look crossed Nurse Jenny's face.<br>\r\n\"How strange. But he was with you when I found you and has refused to leave your side. He is very loyal to you.\" The nurse finished with a smile. She double checked the Pokemon and Forest before Forest managed to shoo her away. Once the nurse was gone, Forest went to Boohimp.<br>\r\n\"Boohimp, would want to be my and Leafbon's partner?\" Forest asked. Boohimp was still for moment, and then reached over and gave Forest her Pokecharm back and then nodded. \"Okay then.\" Forest picked up a Pokeball, and gently pressed the center button against Boohimp's head. Leafbon watched them like a witness to something sacred. Boohimp entered the Pokeball, it wiggled a little and then went still. ...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForest looked herself in the mirror, clean and refreshed. A fresh black button up shirt, purple knee socks and pink plaid skirt felt nice. Her silver star Pokecharm shone in the light, her long green hair was washed and brushed and put into two pigtails. She put on silver boots and finally went down for some breakfast. As she entered the first floor of the Pokemon Center she noticed a commotion going on outside. Curious, she went to investigate. Outside in front of the Pokemon Center was a beautiful girl, no older than sixteen. She had short crimson hair that she wore like a cap, red lipstick and golden eyes. She wore a purple tube top, a black leather miniskirt, elbow high finger less white gloves and black boots steel toed boots. A Gardevoir was by her side.<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir, use Light Screen, then follow with Psybeam!\" the mysterious trainer commanded. Gardevoir created a shiny wall in front of itself, and then proceeded to blast it with a multicolored beam. The wall shattered, and in the shards falling in the air, the colors from the Psybeam reflected, making Forest feel like she was looking at a strange midair kaleidoscope. Her mouth fell open. The crowd that was gathered around the trainer and her Pokemon clapped and cheered for her. <br>\r\nThe trainer and her Gardevoir bowed and said, \"Thank you. I am Celina Dew, up and rising Coordinator. Make sure to cheer for me at the Pokemon Contest tonight!\" <br>\r\n\"...Pokemon Contest huh?\" A voice next to Forest said. There was boy about her age.  He had light blue eyes, spiky blue-green hair, wore a black hoodie with purple stripes on his arms, and gray jeans.<br>\r\n\"You don't like them?\" Forest asked. <br>\r\n\"Can't say I'm a fan. I'm more into Gym Battles myself.\"<br>\r\n\"That's right! There is a Gym in this town isn't there?\"<br>\r\n\"If you're thinking of challenging the Gym, you're gonna get you're ass kicked.\"<br>\r\n\"How the hell would you know!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" The boy rolled his eyes as he said, \"How many Pokemon do you even have? Two, three? The gym leader in this town is wicked strong. You won't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\nHe finished flatly. He was really beginning to peeve Forest. She decided... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Again, Forest commanded for a Wing Attack. Zydrone was hit and was close to going done. Boohimp hit it one more time with Wing Attack and won the battle. The boy returned his Pokemon to its Pokeball. <br>\r\n\"Go Starckler!\" From the boy's next ball came a little blue octopus with stars on it. Forest returned Boohimp to its ball, and released Leafbon.<br>\r\n\"Go Leafbon!\" <br>\r\nThe battle began. Leafbon used leech seed on it. It was super effective. Starckler used Tackle. Leafbon sapped health points from Starckler. Leafbon then used tackle. The battle continued like this for a while until Starckler fainted. (A/N: Yeah I know I'm being a lazy ass. Sorry for the shitty battle.)<br>\r\n\"Woo hoo! I won! Ha, so you still think I can't beat that Gym leader?\" Forest said as she grinned. The boy scowled.<br>\r\n\"You don't stand a chance.\" He said flatly. He looked her in the eye, \"Listen, the Gym leader in this town is probably one of the strongest trainers in the region. Stay. Away. From. Her.\" Forest backed away a little and gulped. The boy walked away in the direction of the Pokemon Center. As he walked away, Forest began to wonder what to do next. But her train of thought was interrupted by a voice saying, \"So you must be a new trainer.\" Forest turned to see Celina Dew watching her. Forest blushed and nodded, suddenly having trouble speaking.<br>\r\n\"How'd you know?\" Forest managed to say.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can always figure out how experienced a trainer is based on how they battle,\" She said casually, but Forest was still impressed. Before either could say another word, a growl erupted from Forest's stomach. Forest blushed deeper. She still had not had breakfast. Celina Dew laughed a little. \"You sound hungry. How about I treat you to lunch?\" Forest smiled and, because her mouth still wasn't working quite right, nodded. ...<br>\r\nThe two ended up in a breakfast house eating pancakes and drinking coffee.<br>\r\n\"So you're from Ugaria Town?\" Celina Dew asked over a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've only been traveling for about two days.\" Forest said, having regained her ability to comfortably speak after having food in her belly and spending some time with Celina Dew and getting used to her. Forest wondered if Celina Dew had a tongue-tied effect on everyone. <br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Celina Dew said with a sigh, \"I remember when I was just beginning my journey. It was such a long time ago now. By the way...\" Celina Dew quickly changed the subject, \"Are you interested in Pokemon Contests?\"<br>\r\nForest shrugged her shoulders and said, \"Well, I've seen a few on TV, and they're really cool I guess.\" <br>\r\n\"Are you going to the Pokemon Contest later today?\" She asked quietly.<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't have any tickets.\" Forest explained.<br>\r\n\"I'll give one for free if you like.\" Celina Dew said.<br>\r\n\"I-I can't accept that!\" Forest stuttered.<br>\r\n\"Oh please do.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't take something like that for free.\"<br>\r\n\"It's not for free.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you want in return?\" Forest asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what, let me give this to you,\" She pressed the ticket into Forest's hand, \"Come to the Contest. After the Contest I'll tell you what I want.\" With that, Celina Dew gave Forest a wink, slapped some money on the table and left. ...<br>\r\nForest left the breakfast house and wandered through the city thinking about what to do. Memories of the previous night filled her head. The gang and the mysterious figure; at that point, the whole incident seemed more like a dream than real. It didn't make sense. She knew what happened was real. Her Boohimp was proof of it! But she couldn't shake the feeling that there was something unearthly about that night. Well, it what happened was real, that gang is dangerous and someone has to know. Forest made up her mind to tell Officer Joy. Having come to a decision, Forest looked up to discover her feet led her to a park. She sat on a bench for a quick rest and watched the Magikarp in the pond; she heard a conversation behind her between a group of older kids.<br>\r\n\"Don't do man. You'll get you ass handed to ya\"<br>\r\n\"She's way too strong!\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up, she can't be as tough as they say!\"<br>\r\n\"She's one of the strongest in the Region!\"<br>\r\nForest thought about what the boy said. Despite his warning, or perhaps because of it, curiosity and pride were urging her to see what the mysterious Gym leader was all about. But maybe she shouldn't go after someone so apparently strong. She heard a shriek from a couple of girls a little older than her.<br>\r\n\"Ohmigod, I can't wait for the Contest!\"<br>\r\n\"Chance is gonna be there!\"<br>\r\n\"And Celina Dew!\"<br>\r\nForest thought of the kaleidoscope Celina Dew had created. She thought of how beautiful she was and amazing it would be to see her on stage. She also thought of her promise to talk after the show. <br>\r\nIn the end Forest decided to...  </span></div></div>",

Feeling comfortable now that she had made a decision, Forest took out her Pokemon for some training. The time flew by quickly, and before she knew it she had an hour before the Contest. Putting away her tired Pokemon, made her way to the city streets and followed the map on her Pokecharm. She was about five minutes away from the Contest hall when she heard a very familiar voice-<br>\r\n\"Forest, long time no see.\"<br>\r\nForest turned to see Blush standing behind her. <br>\r\n\"Blush what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"That's none ya business! But since we're both here, let's if you're Pokemon have gotten any tougher!\" Blushed challenged.<br>\r\n\"Fine bring it!\" Forest answered, easily getting fired up. \"Go Boohimp!\" Forest tossed out the Pokeball, and the flying monkey emerged from it.<br>\r\n\"Go Poshyup!\" From Blush's Pokeball, a pink dog with a white fluffy man and a red bow on a fluffy white tail. Forest quickly got out her Pokedex.<br>\r\n\"Poshyup<br>\r\nNormal<br>\r\nHt: 1\"0' Wt: 15 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Pokemon was bred to by ancient nobles as a lap dog. Somewhere along the way, they started using for battles. They have a spoiled nature, a bad temper, and are very loud. It usually lives in urban environments, like big cities\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boohimp, use Swift!\" Forest began. Poshyup dodged it and used Quick attack. Boohimp used Wing Attack  and hit it, Poshyup countered with Headbutt. Boohimp hit Poshyup with a Quick Attack, Poshyup retaliated with another headbutt. Boohimp went down.<br>\r\n\"No Boohimp!\" Forest cried out. She pulled out it's Pokeball and returned it. \"Good job, have a good rest.\" Forest tossed out another Pokeball and said, \"Go Leafbon!\" The grass type came out ready for battle.<br>\r\n\"Leafbon!\"<br>\r\nPoshyup began round two with a headbutt, but Leafbon was able to dodge. Leafbon then used leech seed. Leafbon sapped Poshyup's health. Poshyup tried a Quick Attack and hit the Leafbon. Leafbon hit back with a Tackle and regained some health with its Leech Seed. Poshyup tried to hit it with another Quick Attack, but missed, and then tried another Quick attack, but missed again. Leafbon hit it with a Tackle. Poshyup countered with a Headbutt, and finally landed a blow. Leafbon sapped some more  health from Poshyup, and then hit it with a final tackle. Poshyup went down.<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Blush cursed as she returned her Pokemon to its Pokeball. \"Go Freery. Finish this!\"<br>\r\nThe little grass type came out. The tired Leafbon lasted two embers before finally going down. <br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Forest cried  out.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" Blush cheered, \u201cI always said you were a loser.\u201d Blush walked smirking. <br>\r\n\u201cDammit, this is my entire fault. It\u2019s all cause I didn\u2019t take them to the Pok\u00e9mon Center. I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Said a breathy voice. Forest turned to see a girl about her age with long curly blonde hair and pale blue eyes. \u201cI need some help.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m in a hurry.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Hello, and welcome.  My name is Professor Hickory, and let me be the first to welcome you to the wonderful world of Pokemon!  In this world, there live people and Pokemon, and we maintain a special balance together.  For years, Pokemon and humans have lived alongside each other in peace and harmony.  Some people use Pokemon as pets and submit them into special contests in hopes of becoming a top coordinator.  For others, it's the thrill of being a trainer that drives them to face the Pokemon League.  As for myself, I study the unique way in which this island region, the Curina Region, affects this said balance between humans and Pokemon.  Strange things are play here, and I'm counting on you to help me.  Your very own Pokemon adventure is about to unfold!  Go on, get started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBACKGROUND:<br>\r\nThe Curina Region is a tropical island region located south of the Hoenn Region.  It has a total of 10 cities, and has access to the Sevii Islands. The Cities include:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgaria Town: A calm and peaceful place where you begin your journey.  It's located near the beach, and is where you live, as well as home to Professor Hickory's lab.  There is a beach port here where you can travel to the Sevii Islands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunshine City: Located near Ugaria Town, Sunshine City is a bustling urban area, home to the contest hall and gym leader Catherine, one of the most powerful ghost type trainers in the region.

It has a large forest that is great for finding and planting berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett City: This ominous city is the heartland of the eerie story surrounding the Curina Region.  Legend has it that one of the most powerful trainers nearly caught the God Pokemon, Arceus, here before being cursed by the Angel Pokemon, Lafany, to live the rest of their life as a half Pokemon.  Professor Hickory visits here often for research.

Pokemon do wander the streets, however, though catching Pokemon that are not in caves, water, or tall grass is extremely prohibited here and will result in a visit from Officer Joy. The ground type gym leader Nathan is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\nWrite in story format<br>\r\nCussing Allowed<br>\r\nMake Up your own Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon<br>\r\nYou can have up to two rivals<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotes:<br>\r\nOver 1000 views!<br>\r\nEDIT: 05/31/13 Added more detail to the intro of the story</span></td>",
