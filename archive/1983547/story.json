You had always been fascinated with the concept of teleportation ever since you were a child. After many years of painstaking trial and error, you finished development of your life\u2019s work, or at least a prototype. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin your very basement, you had built a large circular room with two circular portal hatches; one on the ceiling and one on the floor directly below it. These were not small hatches; each was about roughly the size of a large above-ground pool, taking up around 90% of the room\u2019s radius. Along the parameter of the room was a walkway needed to access the control consoles, which were specifically created for the experiment. The room itself was your invention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many days of calibrating the room, you were finally able to start it up for testing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich portal  should you test out first? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The massive hatch on the ceiling began to open with a loud low grind.  A bright light shined through the space between the metal doors as they split from each other.  As the space between them grew larger, it was easier to make out the bluish swirling vortex that was slowly filling up the ceiling. With a thud, the doors finished opening to completion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good so far..\" You muttered in awe as you stared up at the incredible portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next task was to create a secondary portal to connect it with.  With your control monitor, you could create another \u2018portable\u2019 portal anywhere within a mile radius.  In order to test-view the second portal properly within your lab, you needed to make it significantly smaller than the \u2018home\u2019 portal;  you simply hadn't accommodated enough room for a third full sized portal within the relatively small space.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter entering the specific coordinates, you slapped the enter key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly a foot away from you, a foot-long circular portal appeared a few steps away.  With its arrival, the swirling [home] vortex across the ceiling suddenly went still; almost as if the waves of a raging ocean were suddenly made flat as a mirror.  The two portals had been connected. As you stared into the smaller portal in front of you, It was almost as if you were looking at a monitor that was recording the entire lab from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing\u2026..It really worked. It\u2019s a success!\u201d You were beside yourself with pride.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing left to test was if objects can enter and exit safely.  In order test this; you needed to send the secondary portal outside and resize it again. The specific area you intended to send it to was in your back yard where you had set up a large closed-in tent capable of fitting the full-sized version.  At the top of the tent was a robotic arm that would drop an apple, which would (if everything went correctly) fall through the ceiling portal, into the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...here we go..\" Your hands shook with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of your excitement, you accidentally created a typo in the coordinates. Without even thinking to double-check, you hit enter.  It didn't take long for you to realize something was off. You stared up at the ceiling of your lab, only to see blue sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026.? This isn't the tent\u2026\u201d It was then that you realized your mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, I guess I'm more nervous than I thought\u201d You muttered embarrassingly as you began to fix the coordinates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an error dialog box popped up on screen. None of the commands you were entering seemed to be recognized. You remembered that you had not originally calibrated the test-program to send a portal anywhere but the tent.  Entering the wrong coordinates seems to have created a bug in the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, I was so close!\" You brought your fists down in disappointment <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well.....\u201d You sighed as you quickly begun to fix the issue in order to continue the experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing a few minutes of reprogramming can't fix...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having given it any thought, you had totally forgotten that you still needed to resize the portal. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joey had friends, it was just too late in the day to play with them, and everyone seemed too busy to come over.  The boy stood on his cement porch, bouncing a small rubber ball to pass the time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo boooored\" Joey whined to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly,  the ball accidentally hit the side of his house after a hard throw.  Joey watched as his ball bounced from the wall, into the yard.  <br>\r\n\u201cawhh, maaaaan\u201d he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off his porch, he began his mini expedition to find where the ball had landed within the medium-sized yard. Fortunately,  It didn't take long before he spotted it, nestled in the grass only a few feet away.  After reaching down and picking it up, something else caught his attention. In the corner of his yard, he noticed something weird.  It was like something was floating off of the ground, like a frisbi, only a little bit larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempted by curiosity, the boy began to venture towards it. He stopped a few feet away, just to be safe. He realized it was perfectly flat;  Almost like a mirror, only it wasn't reflecting anything.  Pushing aside his fears, he took a few steps closer until he stood right next to it. It was floating about a foot off the ground, a little lower than his knees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey stared down curiously into the strange image within the circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026is this thing\u2026?\u201d the boy thought to himself with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he lowered himself to the ground, sitting on his knees in order to get a closer inspection.  As he brought his face right next to the flat surface, his eyes suddenly grew wide with amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a weird metal bowl inside. Even more shocking was that he could see what looked like a man.   It seemed like the man couldn't see him, since he was facing what looked like a computer of some sort.  The boy just continued to stare with his mouth slightly ajar. He couldn't make sense of what he was looking at. What was this thing? A floating tablet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer able to contain his growing curiosity, Joey slowly lifted his hand, preparing to poke the surface.  The boy gulped as he lowered his finger. To his amazement, it passed right through the surface. It was as if there wasn't a surface at all!!! It was like a hole in the middle of the air! He pulled his finger out for a moment, before poking it back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoooooool\u2026\u201d He muttered in amazement<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing more curious by the moment, He then brought his attention back to the tiny man.  Holding his breath, he brought his entire hand down into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah..\u201d  Joey muttered as he compared the size of his hand to the man next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s so tiny\u2026\u201d The boy continued to just stare, thinking to himself quietly, his hand hanging motionless in he hole behind the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly snapping back to reality, Joey pulled out his hand and sat up straight. Cautiously, the boy turned his head, looking across his yard, as to see if anyone had been watching.  He was still all alone in the fenced in yard.  Turning his attention back to the hole, he stared blankly for a moment before a playful and sneaky expression formed on his face.  He began to reach back in, only this time with a goal.  He opened his hand wide as he reached for the tiny man.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You paused for a moment as you suddenly felt a presence behind you. Turning your head, your heart sank in fear. Encompassing your entire vision was a massive hand.  Without even collecting your thoughts, you bolted towards the door. Before your could make it two steps, the gigantic fingers had encompassed you, pulling you into the massive bare palm. You struggled desperately as your entire body was pressed against the soft warm surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening? Everything was happening too quickly to comprehend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as it had begun, there was nothing. The fingers that had been pressed against your back were now gone.  You felt a cool breeze and smelled fresh cut grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-where\u2026\u201d You lifted your head only to be hit with a horrifying sight.  You were outside. Across the vast fleshy palm was what looked like an enormous back yard. Lifting your head, you were met with the most shocking realization of all.  High up above was the huge smiling face of a young boy.  It took you a moment to recognize him as your neighbor's kid.  You had occasionally seen him playing out in his front yard with a few of his friends, but you've never actually been introduced by his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCooooool\u201d  Joey brought his palm up to eye level, inspecting your tiny form. The young boy's warm breath washed over you, smelling of apple juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hazel eyes were terrifyingly enormous as they focused in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you noticed the secondary portal over the side of the hand. Everything clicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you needed to regain your composure, you attempted to balance yourself, ready to speak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ch-HEY!\u201d  Joey\u2019s eyes widened with surprise that you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-Kid! I need you to put me back in there!!\u201d You pointed at the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey just continued to stare for a moment, amazed that the tiny man could talk. He wasn't sure if you had actually just been a tiny action figure or something. It hadn't occurred to him that you might actually be a real person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re so little?\u201d The boy asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m your next door neighbor! I was conducting an experiment and there was an accident! I need you to put me back into that portal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPortal?\u201d The boy asked, staring at the hole in space.  \u201cWait, you live next door?\u201d The boy turned his head towards the fence to his left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! I know your parents!\u201d  Your voice was starting to get tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coh\u2026\u201d  There was an odd, almost dissapointed tone to the boy's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook! I really need you to put me back! The portal won\u2019t last much longer before it needs to shut down!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked deep in thought. </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not every day he would get to hold a tiny person in the palm of his hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his fingers around you, Joey slowly lowered his hand back down into the portal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as his fist reached floor-level, he paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see through the fingers that you were back in the lab, but you were still waiting for the boy to let you go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is he? -...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your view of the lab plummeted as you were brought back up through the portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What are you doing?!\u201d You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on! I want to take a picture of you!  I want to prove to my friends at school that this really happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I told you I don\u2019t have much ti- \u201c The boys fingers closed around you once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will only take a minute!\u201d The boy smiled to himself as he stood up and ran towards his house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTOP! Go back!\u201d Your muffled screams were hardly audible outside the boy\u2019s closed fist. You watched as the portal get further and further away between the boy's giant fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey ran up to the porch and grabbed his phone.  He opened his palm and aimed to take a picture;  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Now take me back!\u201d You yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018\u2026um... just one more!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE! Now!\u201d you screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" The boy smiled. He seemed content with his evidence pictures as he hit the 'send' button so all his friends could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much urgency, Joey walked back to the portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really getting tired of this kid. You were also silently debating whether or not to tell his parents about all this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Joey was two steps away from the portal, suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ZOoOOop*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange humming noise emanated from the portal before the circle quickly shrunk out of existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your stomach drop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026..!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you weren't paying attention, Joey\u2019s expression slowly changed from one of genuine shock to one of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the hand slowly raise until you could feel the familiar warm breath wash over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Now you can stay this way!\u201d The boy smiled widely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTAY?! What? No! You need to tell your parents!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be my new toy now!\u201d  Joey\u2019s smile widened as his fingers began to close over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToy!? What?! W-wait!! No STOP!!\u201d  The last thing you see before the darkness engulfs you is the boy\u2019s greedy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey lowers his hand and stuffs you into his pants pockets. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was dark, and warmer than you expected in here. \"I have to get out of here. I have to get away!\" You think to yourself desperately. The walls seemed too high to climb, and the smooth material of the pocket was horrible for climbing, offering no grip at all. Even if you could climb, the constant rocking motion would just knock you down again. You sighed as you sat at the bottom of his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, light engulfs your dark world, and 5 long fingers reach in and wrap around you. The boy lifts you out of his pocket, and you're glad when you get a face full of fresh air again. For a moment, you studied your surroundings. The boy's massive fingers wrapped around you tightly, squeezing your body uncomfortably tight. His fingers were slightly dirty, no doubt from playing outside. Above you, his boyish face loomed, huge eyes staring at you with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. A warm gust of wind blew over you as the boy's lips parted slightly, and he breathed the word \"Whoooooaaaah!\" again, still amazed at his new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kid! Let me go!\" You yell. It was bad enough you were stuck at this size, you didn't want to be handled by some kid. Joey smirks at you, thinking for a moment. \"You're my new toy now! We're going to have so much fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm NOT your toy, kid! Now, go find your parents, and tell them what happened! I need their help if I'm going to get back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked at you, his bright smile drooping a bit. \"No way! If I tell Mom and Dad, they'll take you away from me! I want to keep you! I found you, so it's only fair that you belong to me!\" The boy looked triumphant. In his mind, he was correct. You weren't an adult, you were far too small. You were a living, breathing toy that he could do whatever he wanted with. He found you, and that makes you his property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey places you on the hard wood floor, and goes over to a box in the corner. He digs out a bunch of other toys, action figures, large toy cars, nothing out of the ordinary for a young boy, you thought. As the boy was distracted pulling toys out to play with, the thought of escaping ran through your mind. Joey had closed his door, and locked it, but you might be able to slip right under the door. Surely, you could find help then. As you pondered your escape, you're suddenly snapped back to reality by a loud barking noise. \"Crap, this kid has a dog...\" You shudder to yourself as you picture a set of huge, slobbering dog jaws coming down on you if the dog decided you looked like a tasty if curious morsel. \"Maybe I should stay here for now...\" You think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's socked foot slams down behind you, and you snap around to face him. \"OK, play time, little toy!\" Joey says, a smile spread across his face.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Finally, Joey plopped down, sitting cross legged in front of you. He picked up an action figure, some kind of army man figurine from the looks of it. \"OK, you're the bad guy, and I'm going to stop you!\" Joey says, and slams the action figure down in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUD THUD* the plastic figurine slams against the floor as Joey slowly brings it closer to you. \"J...Joey, stop this!\" You scream as the plastic toy gets closer and closer. It's clear Joey won't stop, and you turn, and run. \"You can't get away!\" Joey says in a slightly deeper voice, and brings the toy down on top of you, slamming you to the ground. Your head aches and spins as you lie pinned under the toy. Joey then brings it up, and slams it down on you again, the boots of the toy slamming down on your chest over and over. \"OOF! OOF! AAGH!\" You yelp each time. \"Joey! Please, stop!\" You beg, but the boy doesn't stop. He can't understand the harm he's causing you. He has no idea how fragile your tiny body is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey grabs you up, and slams you against the action figure as he pretends you're locked in a fierce battle. Your arms flail around, like a rag doll as the rough giant boy squeezes you, crashes you against toys, and the floor, and humiliates you. You never dreamed you'd be in the hands of such a young boy, literally one of his toys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Joey tosses the plastic action figure to the side. \"OK, now we're going to play a different game! I'm going to be the giant, and you're going to have to avoid me!\" Joey stands to his full height, one socked foot on either side of you. Without warning, Joey lifts a foot over you, the slightly dirty sole of the boy's socked foot looming high above. Panic sunk in, and pure adrenaline coursed through your body. You got to your feet, and ran, as fast as you could, just before a loud THUMP shook the floor behind you. He would have really crushed you! He has no idea what he's doing! You think to yourself, terrified of your new, deadly situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I come, puny toy!\" The boy scowled down, doing his best to make an angry, mean face. To a normal person, he'd look cute, innocent, using his imagination to play with his toys. To you, however, he was a monster on an incomprehensible scale. It was maddening to think that this little boy, who probably would have only reached your chest a day ago, now towered over you like a titan. You ran across the hardwood floor, towards that door. Who cares if he had a dog, you had to escape. You had to get out. So close. You could make it! You could-*SLAM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's foot came down on top of you. Searing pain ran through your body. The boy had broken bones. \"This can't be happening!\" You think to yourself. \"It can't end like this! I was going to be famous! I was going to be rich!\" You cried in your mind. Tears welled up in your eyes as the pressure of the foot bared down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief came, but only for a moment. The boy lifted his foot high into the air again. You couldn't move though. You couldn't get away. Joey looked down at you, strange feelings running through his mind. He had a real, life tiny person at his feet. He had played this game with his toys before, but they were plastic, lifeless. This was different. He knew what he was doing was wrong. But, he had always loved crushing bugs. Whenever the young boy would see an ant, he'd always get a kick out of stomping on it. This was a whole new level. This tiny adult was powerless at his foot. Nobody would ever know what happened to him. He could do whatever he wanted with this \"toy\". Joey smiled as the power went to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lose, I win! Time to go squish!\" Joey said coldly. You lay on the floor, your end hovering above you. All you wanted to do was improve the world. You never thought you would end up under a little boy's foot, like a common ant. And the worst part was, you had done this to yourself. Your careless experiment had landed you in this situation, and now, you were paying the price. You looked up at the boy's hovering foot, the smile on his boyish face, the gleam in his eye. You began to cry. \"No, not like this! Plea-\" But you never got a chance to finish your words. Joey's foot came down, instantly bringing an end to your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy lifted his foot, and examined the bottom of his sock. \"Whoooah...\" He said, one more time before his mother called him down for dinner.</span></div></div>",

It was even more terrifying when you thought to put yourself in his position. You imagined all the things any regular brat would do if they found a tiny person all for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look kid! I really need you to help me out here!\" You begged, hoping that there was a part of the boy that could empathize with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even seem to have been listening, instead he was staring off ahead, almost as if he was planning out all the things he would do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood there, you remembered the portal down below. You were desperate to get out of this situation by any means possible. Slowly, you side-stepped to the side of the hand, hoping to see if the portal was within jumping distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a stretch, but if you got a running start, it might be possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you readied yourself to sprint when the hand suddenly jolted, causing you to fall over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Damn it!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were staring down at the portal, so was Joey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he probably wouldn't be able to keep you a secret with the portal there. His parents would surely notice it and ask questions. As the boy thought about it, a lightbulb suddenly went off in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you spun as Cody turned around. You braced yourself as he brought his hand down to a nearby picnic chair, dumping you off onto the hard wooden surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of pine hit you hard as you rolled off the palm with a thud. You watched as the giant turned back around and walked over to the fence by the portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he..?\" You stared with confusion as the boy picked up a large stone, about the size of a melon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood drained out of your face as you realized what he was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No......NOOOOO!! STOP!!! PLEASEEE!!\" You screamed despite being too small and far away to be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming over the portal like a building, the boy brought the stone over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T!!! PLEASE I!---\" You screamed in utter desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playfully innocent smile, Joey released the stone, sending it plummeting into the portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud metallic crunch quickly followed by a fizzle as the portal vanished out of thin air. Simultaneously, your house nextdoor momentarily shook from the impact of the resized stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell to your knees in anguish. Not only was years of work lost, but so was your only way of getting back to regular size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey turned around to face you, now grinning from ear to ear like a kid who won a prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stared down at the rough wooden surface, you could feel the vibrations of the boy's foot steps getting stronger until a shadow fell over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine now!\" The booming boyish voice above you spoke with finality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in horror to see his hand opened wide, ready to grab you again. Only this time, for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He kicks off his shoes and pulls off his socks. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing...?\" you say, in complete fear of the young God before you.<br>\r\n\"How would you like to smell my feet?\" he laughs, clearly enjoying owning and controlling you.  Joey grabs you and presses your tiny, frail body against his huge bare toes, while wiggling them all over you.  You squirm in his grasp but are helpless.  He laughs at your weakness and smiles sadisticly.  After a few minutes of suffocating you with his toes, Joey decides to introduce you to the rest of his feet.  He grabs you and lays you flat on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Say hello to my sole!\" he smiles happily as he lowers his foot onto you.  His massive bare sole presses on top of you, squishing you flat against the floor.<br>\r\n\"K-kid...please...stop!\" you shout weakly out from under his powerful sole.<br>\r\n\"Haven't you figured it out yet? I own you now. This is your new life. I'll never listen to you; and no one will ever find you!\" he laughs, smirking devilishly as he wiggles his massive toes all over your tiny body.  The smell is overpowering, and you are now drenched in his foot sweat.  He stops for a second, grabs you, and puts you between his massive boy soles.  He then mercilessly rubs and presses you between them while laughing. Joey is enjoying himself much more than he had ever imagined.  Suddenly Joey's Mom enters the home and calls him downstairs.  Joey smirks evilly.  He grabs you and scrunches you up between his toes.  Then he pulls his sock back on over you, trapping you up with his toes.  His socks are white with gray toes and heels, and as he wiggles his toes on you the gray fabric bulges around you.  He pulls his other sock back on and wiggles his toes comfortably in his socks, knowing you are being smooshed by his toes.  He takes a step forward, and you are pushed against Joey's huge godly toes, but are not crushed because you are in the gap. Joey smiles as he goes out to greet his Mom, with his new foot slave suffering under his massive, powerful toes.</span></div></div>",

It's alright, everything will be sorted out, this kid will help you for sure, you told him about the situation, how it would close every second, and that you needed to go back. You told him, that you were his neighbor, that you knew his parents. He will help you for sure. Just calm down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to the boys face, and it seemed the kid was still thinking through really hard what to do. After a few seconds of no reaction, your fear grew bigger again, that the portal could close any second, and that your only chance of becoming normal size would just vanish out of existence, that it would just pop like a balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that scenario would happen, how would you even ever get big again? You would need to tell the kid to go to your house, explain how to use the computer and open a new portal. Would that even work? If it was a new portal and not the same you came through the first way? What if the size of the new portal wouldn't be the same like this one? Wait, how would the kid even get into your house without a key? And even worse, didn't you lock the door to the ceiling for the experiment!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was floating with questions after questions, and you became more frightened every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of a sudden your desperate thoughts were interrupted though by Joey, just like the picture of that popping portal if you would stab a needle inside a bloated balloon: \u201cAlright little guy, I'll help you. You said you need to go back through that... mirror thingy, right?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit confused but totally relieved, you answered him instantly, \u201cYes! Please hurry, the portal could close any moment, please just hold your hand in front of the portal and I...\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't able to finish your sentence, because just right after you spoke your last word, Joey closed his fist around you, and everything became dark. \u201cHey wait, what are you doing kid!?\u201d You shouted out loud, but none of your words seemed to reach the kid outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry little guy, I'll get you back inside your shrunken home in no time!\u201d, hearing Joey speaking you rolled your eyes, didn't that kid listen to you? \u201cI'm your neighbor, kid, I wasn't this size a few moments ago, it's because of the experiment\u201d. But again, Joey didn't hear you, or he wasn't interested in what you said, because you suddenly felt the ground, or actually Joeys hand to accelerator. He was moving it towards the portal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd outside Joey was about to do exactly that. He had closed his first around the tiny man, looked at the mirror thingy and began to move his hand through, just like he did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment his hand passed the portal, you felt a tingling all around your body, and you knew you were back in your own ceiling! An instant float of endorphin was sent through your body, you felt relieved and just happy nothing bad had happened, and that you were save again, back where all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright kid, you can open your first now and let me...\u201d, ~RING~, \u201c...wait, what was that??\u201d. ~RING~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey had just put his hand through the portal and was about to open his fist, when he felt his cell phone vibrate in his jeans back pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause he had used his left hand for putting the little man back inside the portal, he could use his right hand to snatch back inside his jeans pocket and take out the ringing cell phone. Everything would have been fine and OK, if Joey had just opened his left hand, let go of the tiny man, put his hand out of the portal, and answered his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the boy was much more interested in answering the call than thinking about the tiny man he was still holing in his left hand. And because he was kneeling on the ground, he drew his left hand out of the portal, with the tiny guy still inside, reached with his right hand inside his back pocket, and stood up for answering the call.</span></div></div>",

But that didn't matter much to you, in a few seconds he would open his hand, and you would be back where this had started, and you could start working on your great discovery again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn...\u201d, you said to yourself in the dark but also warm environment of the boys hand, which surrounded you and all of your view. Actually it did that much, that you couldn't even see a thing, and the dim light of your ceiling was also adding to this dilemma a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so glad nothing serious happened, he... he he\u201d, you laughed a little bit in a weird way, thinking again about all the crazy thoughts you just had a few moments ago, going through all those things which might could have happened, and what you should have done if the portal just closed before you were back through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright kid, you can open your hand now and let me...\u201d, ~RING~, \u201c...wait, what was that??\u201d. ~RING~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Joey was about to open his left hand and let the 'tiny' man out, his cell phone began to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Who's that?!\u201d, the boy asked out to himself with a kind of interested but also annoyed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~RING~ \u2026 ~RING~ \u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden and surprising ringing sound of his own phone caused the boy to nearly lose his balance, where he was just kneeling in front of that weird mirror thingy, his left hand still stretched out through, and his body slightly moving towards the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his left hand still inside, the boy tried to take a hold of his ringing and vibrating phone, which was in his jeans back pocket, but he wasn't quite successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fifth ~RING~, Joey came to the conclusion that he better had to stand up, so he could grasp inside his jeans back pocket more easily and take the phone out, where now it was just too difficult for him. His jeans was stretched too tight to his butt, because of him kneeling in front of he portal and so sealing the phone inside the pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also because of him balancing and stretching out his hand. Though everything would have worked perfectly, no harm done, the 'tiny' guy back where he lived obviously, just if Joey had opened his hand, before moving it out, again... And sending the 'tiny' guy inside on a second trip through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey wanted to answer his phone right away, that was everything which counted in this very moment. The caller could hang every second!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight denim jeans slightly loosed up, just after Joey stood to his full size. While standing up, he just removed his hand from the portal of course, hanging now relaxed beside his tummy, still closed to a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoeys clever acting worked perfectly, and his right hand could easily grasp inside his back pocket. Another ~RING~ later, mostly just in time before the caller was about to hang up, Joey had his cell phone inside his right hand, looking on the display who the caller was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez...\u201d, he moaned after reading the word 'MOM' on his phones display. Making a pissed like face expression, sticking out his tongue a little bit, Joey pressed the power button and brought the phone to his right ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want mom...\u201d, while talking to his mother, the boy's eyes caught the still opened portal, now looking down to it again, where it was just a few inches under his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, fine, I will come home in about a minute...\u201d, \u201c ...jeez.\u201d, totally pissed about that he had to go home already that early, Joey put his phone back inside his jeans pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, now in an annoyed mood, was just about to leave the yard and walk the few steps home, when he remembered that he had still this weird tiny little guy in his left hand: \u201cOhhh... right! Hee, sorry little guy, totally forgot about you! Wait let me put you back insi...\u201d ~POP~ \u201c... oops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey couldn't finish his sentence though, because just after he had spoken his last word, the strange looking mirror thingy imploded in an instant, and while doing that, making a sound like a popping bubblegum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy removed his view of where the portal just had been the last few minutes, and brought his left hand in front of his tummy, looking down to it: \u201cWhooa, dude...!!\u201d, Joey said while opening his fist, \u201c....that was ...sooo ...Cooool!! ...Did you see that!?\u201d...</span></div></div>",

The lot was mostly empty, aside from two trees near the tall wooden fence that enclosed it. The ground in the middle of the area was covered mostly with dirt; likely caused by kids consistently playing sports on it. The parameter of the lot was the only area that had grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was high and the nearby road was quiet. The two boys had been visiting the lot every day to play catch and enjoy the summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead before catching the oncoming baseball in his mitt. The boys were going to be entering the eighth grade after summer was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flapping sound came from Ryan's mitt as he caught the incoming ball. He pinched and the front of his shirt and brought it up to his face to dry off the sweat that had been accumulating on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, wanna take a break? I'm thirsty\" Ryan panted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sounds good\" Andrew had just been ready to ask the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys walked over to the nearby wooden fence where they had placed their water bottles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guuuhh~\" Ryan muttered as he collapsed onto the ground, resting his back up against the fence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really hot to day, huh?\" Andrew followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but at least it's not raining.\" Ryan retorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true\" Andrew replied before guzzling down the water from his bottle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*gulp gulp* \"Gahhhhhh~\" the pre-teen loudly hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you wanna do after this?\" Andrew asked as he brushed aside his sweaty bangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...Wanna come over and play that new game I got?\"  Ryan replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure. A little AC would be great~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after the two friends stood up and began to head out of the lot, Ryan noticed something odd over towards the baseball diamond where they had just been playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...Dude, what the heck is that???\" Ryan extended out his right arm in front of his friend's chest, halting him in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?? What's what?\" Andrew asked, as he looked towards the direction his friend was pointing to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something odd floating about a foot off the ground between home base and the pitcher's mound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it appeared flat and disk shaped, and it was surrounded by a strange blue glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooah. What the hell is that???\" Andrew muttered as he and Ryan hesitantly began walking over towards the mysterious object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the lab...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long before the hot, humid outside air invaded the once dry, air conditioned space. The pungent scent of grass and weeds soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blinding light of the hot beaming sun caused Jeremy to shield his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this was all one big unintentional consequence, you did find relief in that the portal was successfully functional.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main problem was that you didn't know where the portal was. It would be disastrous if the portal appeared on a sidewalk or road where people or cars might accidentally fall through.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the monitor, Jeremy attempted to close the portal before anything bad could happen.  As he were typing away at the console, something suddenly fluttered down from over his head and landed over his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh..?\" Jeremy stopped what he was doing and grabbed the stalk-end of the strange foot-long . At first it almost appeared to be a flower of some kind. However, rather than pedals, it appeared to be sprouting white fibrous hairs, almost like cat whiskers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he examined it closer, it finally occurred to him what he was holding in his hand. It was an over-sized dandelion seed, probably a foot or so long. The very same kind he used to watch float away in the wind after blowing on dandelion puffs as a kid.  He would have recognized it immediately if not for it's unusually large size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..how?... that's not...\" Jeremy began to mutter in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jeremy pondered what he was looking at, the harsh sunlight in his lab suddenly faded.  He initially assumed that a cloud had just drifted across the sun, but then you remembered that it had been a clear day. <br>\r\n<i><b><br>\r\n\"Wooaah what the hell is this????\"</b></i> A loud boyish voice boomed from the portal above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy nervously turned his head and looked upward. His whole body went ridged with shock as he was confronted by a gigantic young face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions flooded Jeremy's mind as he stared back at the huge face; The giant boy's puzzled expression seemed to reflect his own. Something was obviously wrong here. Something was VERY wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if the portal over his head was a movie theater screen that made an actors face look many times larger than it really was.  Just as Jeremy was about to call out to the boy, another giant pre-teen appeared next to him, nudging the other boy to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOOAAAH, Let me see, let me see!\" The second boy spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that everything clicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped as he turned towards the screen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" he realized that the secondary portal was still minimized by 900%<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of how weird he knew it would sound to the boys, Jeremy began to shout up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-boys!, get away from here! It's dangerous!\" he yelled.  He had not fully tested the risks of getting too close to the secondary portal while in a completed state. For all he knew, it could seriously harm the boys if they came too close to its glowing edges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words seemed to fall on deaf ears however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the first boy brought his face closer to the portal. You stared up in utter astonishment as the giant twelve year old's face encompassed the entire ceiling. You could actually feel his light breathing against your entire body. You quickly recognized the scent of what smelled like Gatorade on his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid please! You could get hurt! Back away!\" You frantically shouted up at the enormous face above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy seemed to almost be ignoring you as his eyes scanned the room around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally, his eyes focused on to you, sending an unnerving chill down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooaaaaaaaaah\" The giant kid muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see! Let me see!\" The face was pulled away, only to be replaced by the face of the second boy, who was clearly way more excited by their discovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis boy was lot more intimidating. Jeremy's legs almost started to tremble as you watched the boy's eyes rapidly bounce up down left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS THIS THING?!\" A few drips of saliva unintentionally splattered out of his mouth and onto the floor next to the small scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy realized communication wasn't an option.  He quickly ran back up to his computer and began to type as fast as he could. The quicker you could get this portal shut, the less chance that something bad could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nThe portal floated a little lower than the boy's chests , allowing them to peer inside floating disk.  Ryan's face was so close that his nose had actually partially entered the other space.  He lifted his head and turned to Andrew.  It's like a tiny room! And there's a tiny man moving inside!!\" The boy exclaimed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where did it come from?\" Andrew couldn't help but ponder.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Who knows?\"  Ryan didn't seem to care. Turning back to the hole, the boy pulled his sweaty hand out of his catcher's mitt and began to reach into the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Dude! What if it's dangerous?\" Andrew warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan hesitated for a moment before ultimately giving into curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew what it was, but you couldn\u2019t comprehend that you were actually on the palm of someone\u2019s hand. Everything was happening so fast. You looked up at the horrifying sight of the same two boys, only this time, their faces weren\u2019t behind a window. They were up close and their expressions seemed to gush with excitement and wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up, nervously, you crawled up to where the boy\u2019s fingers began. You stared down passed them to see what looked like a 100 ft fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what a minute..\u201d You nervously searched for the portal. It wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonono..\u201d You realized that the computer must have closed it automatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMN IT!\u201d You shouted in frustration and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU THINK HE IS?\u201d Ryan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I am? I\u2019m a human!\u201d You quickly tried to get to your feet . You need these boys to realize that you\u2019re not just some plaything, or things could turn ugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M HUMAN!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he just speak..?\u201d Ryan muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, and I think he says he\u2019s a human\u201d Andrew added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut HOW?\u201d Ryan watched the tiny man struggle to stay balanced on his hand. He couldn\u2019t help but find it mildly amusing. Purposely, he jittered his hand a bit, causing the man to fall. Ryan laughed at this a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-boys! Hey I need you to take me to your parents!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Ryan asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he said we need to tell our parents\u201d Andrew answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!\u2019 You shouted at the boy in the red shirt. As far as you can tell, the boy in red seemed a lot more mature and dependable than the one in the blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the man\u2019s reaction, Andrew understood he had gotten it right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan didn\u2019t seem to care though, he too busy making the tiny man as uncomfortable as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew thought for a moment, his house was only two houses away from the lot, and he knew his mom was home. Ryan\u2019s house was much farther away, and his mom was out grocery shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s take him to my house\u201d Andrew spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan stayed silent, but nodded his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCusping his hands shut, the two boys began to run towards Andrew\u2019s house. Ryan smiled as he made sure the ride was as bumpy as possible for you. Something about feeling your tiny struggles in his hand brought the boy great entertainment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys slowed down as they reached Andrew\u2019s porch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s probably in the kitchen, let\u2019s go\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026.\u201d Ryan spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026.. we don\u2019t really have\u2019tah tell your mom\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what?\u201d Andrew turned around, looking confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean.. we could\u2026 you know\u2026KEEP him if we wanted..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the hot sweaty confines of the boy\u2019s hand, your heart began to pound with anxiety. Deep down, you knew this boy didn\u2019t want to give you up. You could only hope that the other boy would be rational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude\u2026 what are you saying? He\u2019s a person\u201d Andrew spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed with relief. All you really desire right now is to get out of this boy\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fingers around you suddenly opened. Your whole body was wet with the boy\u2019s palm sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I mean, look at him!\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cNo one knows we have him\u2026.. Think about the fun we could have!\u201d The boy grinned mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew stared down at you with genuine concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gestured in desperation towards the boy in red, you knew he was pretty much your only way out of this situation. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is right dude\u2026.\u201d Andrew tried to dissuade his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommon! Here! You hold him!\u201d The Ryan pulled his friends arm up, turning the palm up and carefully dumping you on. <br>\r\nYou sighed with relief \u201cThank god\u2026\u201d. You\u2019d rather not be in anyone\u2019s hand, but you\u2019re grateful to be with someone who seems to actually care about your well-being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?! Doesn\u2019t that feel awesome?\u201d Ryan\u2019s persuasion continued; nudging the other boy\u2019s hand, causing you to fall over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile formed on the Andrew\u2019s face for a brief moment. He couldn't deny it, that WAS kinda entertaining .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Okay, I guess it\u2019s kinda cool\u2026 but still...\u201d The boy quickly fought off the desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan quickly cut him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust think of all the stuff we could do! We could keep him like a pet and play with him every day!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew\u2019s stared down at you, deep in thought\u2026..his parents never DID let him have a pet before\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up worryingly at the boy in the red teeshirt. You could see it in his expression, he was starting to cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! I need your help! Take me to your mom! Please!\u201d You cried out desperately, trying to draw out the empathy the boy was expressing earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink of it! An adult that has to do everything we say!\u201d Ryan continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026well\u2026. maybe it would be cool if we kept him for\u2026just a little while\u2026\u201d Andrew\u2019s eyes glimmered with newfound cruelty as he smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew brought up his other hand and began to hesitantly poke you with his index finger. He couldn\u2019t help but giggle as it knocked you over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, should take him up to my room?\" The Andrew asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs darkness began to engulf you, the last thing you saw were the two young boys grinning down at you. </span></div></div>",

The heat radiating from all around you, the lack of light, the compressed room, but wait, weren't the walls around you way more closer to you a few seconds ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened, where am I, you reasoned for a moment then it hit you again, the two boys, one of them had reached his hand inside the portal and, he enclosed it around you, yes? ... Did he pull also it out of the portal, together with you!!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!?\u201d, you shouted a little bit nervous and still with a weak voice, \u201cKid, please open your fist, it's dangerous!!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I have to shout louder, \u201cHELLO!?

You weren't in your lab anymore. Bright sunlight was hitting your face! You were... outside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear to panic you looked around, the surface you were sitting on looked really strange. Skin-colored, and with, weird looking, arm wide grooves embedded into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no..., am I still in the boys hand? But why does it look so different, what happened!?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a huge shadow fell over you, making your vision also much better.

It was a little bit smaller than an ant, actually it looked exactly like an ant to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpatience grew bigger and bigger inside of Andrew, looking at his best friend who tried to figure out what he had just brought back out of that weird portal, which wasn't there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it!?\u201d, Andrew asked again, this time stepping closer to Ryan, and also moving his head close to his best friends palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew had his eyes focused on Ryan\u2019s face to figure out if it was something of interest his friend was holding in his hand, or maybe just something totally ordinary, something totally boring..., something, like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot getting an answer, he moved his eyes too on the little something laying in the middle of his best friends hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were the two boys looking at?</span></div></div>",

Give me that fucking bug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you it's not a bug you idiot!\u201d, shouting at his friend Ryan suddenly lowered his voice and added, \u201c...it's... it's a tiny person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment his best friend said the words 'tiny person', Andrew lost his smile and also the interest in 'bugging' around with his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, are you nuts?\u201d, Andrew stepped away form his friend and giving him a weird looking expression while at the same time bending his head slightly to the right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I told you, I saw a tiny person inside that thingy... and I reached for it, but...\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... what?!\u201d, Andrew spitted at his friend with a harsh tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... it looked... much bigger from outside. And now... now it's just so damn tiny. Here, look for yourself if you don't believe me.\u201d, and with that Ryan brought his hand back in between the two boys, and both stared at it in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're nut...\u201d, Andrew was about to tell his best friend after a few seconds, but then his jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... whoa...\u201d, still not believing his friend, Andrews eyes had moved closer to the little bug, but then he had seen something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug was wearing... clothes? And had, arms? Which it seemed to... hold over his head, like protecting itself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was cowering on the floor. Or actually on his friends hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuuuude... ! That's a freaking tiny person! Coooool!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you moron. Who's nuts now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm yeah, sorry about that. But whoooa look at it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith total surprise and uprising new joy, Andrew brought one of his fingers again towards the tiny 'bug', and was about to touch, or actually nearby, crushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing man!\u201d, moving his hand back, Ryan yelled at his friend, \u201cYou're scaring it, can't you see that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, no. Sorry little guy.\u201d, this time talking directly to the little bug person, Andrew smiled sheepishly and rubbed with one hand at the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d, Andrew lowered his hand again, \u201cWhat did I do wrong now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn't it obvious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm no?? ... What are you talking about??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez... it cannot understand what you're saying man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why would that be?\u201d, Andrews eyes looked down on his friends hand while his head didn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou moron... a little creature that tiny!? Hello?? It would have the brain the size of a fucking fly! You ever saw a talking fly before, genius?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm... no.\u201d, Andrew looked confused, \"... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew rubbed at his head again... \u201cYeah, maybe... that sounds reasonable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it does.\u201d, Ryan smiled and while saying that, closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt good about how he came up with such a clever movement. He liked the idea of sounding like a clever person in front of his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why does it wear clothes, and where does it come from?\u201d, Andrew said still with a confused look, his eyes focused on Ryan's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d, Ryan lost his smile and opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, well...\u201d, trying to find a logic sounding conclusion to the good point his friend came up with, he never found one. Actually it was his friend himself who 'answered' his own question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe someone put tiny miniature clothes on it? Like how you would on a dog or any other pet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, of course. Someone must have found it before and for fun made its own little clothes, so it would look like a real person!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... but where does it come from?\u201d, Andrew moved his eyes towards his friend, which shared the glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesnt matter\u201d, Ryan said in a short way and started to smile, then lowering his view back towards his hand, and also brought it a little bit higher into the air, while at the same time both boys moved their heads toward it, \u201cIt's ours... now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The teen was supposed to let his dog back in twenty minutes ago so he could eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor hungry pup continued to whimper and paw until he eventually gave up. With little else to do, the lab turned around began his usual lap around the parameter of the yard, sniffing around for anything new or interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround half way across the back fence, Jojo's ears perked. He had caught onto a scent! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his nose to the ground, the dog began sniffing away rapidly, attempting to pin point the mystery scent's location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the dog realize, only a few meters away from where he was walking, a small disk shaped hole floated a mere three inches off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued typing away, attempting to fix the bug and move on with your experiment. You still couldn't believe that you made such a stupid typo at such a crucial moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only had about a minute worth of keystrokes left before you began to hear something odd in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you turned your head, tilting it up towards the hole in the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is that sound?\" You whispered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost sounded like.... helicopter blades? No..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it was getting louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to stare nervously at the ceiling until the sound started to cause your ears discomfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grew wide as the source of the noise peaked out, high over the edge of the portal. You could hardly make it out, but you could tell it was black, and HUGE. As you attempted to identify it, it lowered itself down closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel massive gusts of air fill your lab as it came closer, passing through the portal's barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Now that you had a good look at it, there was no mistake. The black tip, the two holes pulling and releasing air, the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a massive dog muzzle. The rapid gusts of it's breathing caused your lab coat to flutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"n-NO! GO AWAY BOY!! SHOO!!\" You attempted to deter the dog away. It didn't seem to notice or care as it continued it's investigation of the mysterious 'hole'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held your breath in fear as the muzzle sniffed at the metal floor below. You could only pray that it would just lose interest and go away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, the dog's mouth opened, revealing it's enormous tongue, glistening with saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog began licking away at the floor, creating a sticky pool of saliva on the floor. After a few initial licks, the muzzle began to move across the lab, as if to make sure it licked the place clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there in front of your monitor, frozen in fear as the massive maw began to lick towards your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly ran to the left, slipping across a freshly made puddle of slobber.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back to see the tongue ravenously licking away at where you had just been standing. Suddenly, the dog paused. He smelled something else....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer licking, the nose quickly began to sniff towards your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but panic as the muzzle began to track you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you desperately attempted to escape, you suddenly slipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour immediate reaction was to pull yourself up, but before you could even move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready above you were the huge black nostrils, flaring opened and closed as they identified their target. You stared up in fear as the pressure of it's sniffing pushed you down, lightly tugging you up with each exhale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as the dog's tongue lolled out of it's gigantic maw, beginning to lap away at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO!!!!\" You cried as you tried to beat away the slimy tasting muscle. Fighting it proved meaningless now that your size was 1/100th the dogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole body was now covered with layers upon layers of the dog's slobber. With each lick, you felt your cohesion to the tongue get stronger and stronger..until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAaaaaaa!!!!\" You cried as you found yourself unable to pull away from the tongue as it began to pull back into the dog's mouth. You could feel it's hot breath wash over you before it's mouth closed shut with a wet slap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nJojo pulled his head out of the strange hole he found, gulping the one and only treat he could find inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jojo! Come on! Time to eat!\" Jojo's owner called him from the backdoor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly, the golden lab ran back to the house. It might have been small, but it's not every day he got to enjoy an appetizer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In order to test-view the second portal properly within his lab, he needed to make it significantly smaller than the \u2018home\u2019 portal; He simply hadn\u2019t accommodated enough room for a third full sized portal within the relatively small space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter entering the specific coordinates, he slapped the enter key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly a foot away from him, foot-long circular portal appeared before him. With its arrival, the swirling [home] vortex across the floor suddenly went still; almost as if the waves of the raging pond were suddenly made flat as a mirror. The two portals had been connected.

His name was Cody. You quickly did the math in your head to figure out how old he had to be now. Probably around early middle school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought to yourself what a great a surprise it would be if you were to suddenly create a full-sized secondary portal over his head while he was playing basketball in his driveway.

As the cool air refreshed his sweaty skin, he sighed as he made his way over to his living room to catch some tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently he was out in the summer heat with some of his friends, one of them had just got this cool new video game system and was the talk of the circle. While this friend was showing off, most of the other kids, including Cody, were trying to hide their envy with various means of success.  Cody wanted that video game system, but knew that his parents couldn\u2019t afford to get it for him, and although he really liked that friend he was more than a little bit jealous of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, well, Cody thought as his feet flip-flopped their way into the living room, nothing I can do now but watch tv and not think about the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portal gave you a view of the top inside of Cody\u2019s house that was absolutely massive. It almost gave you an image of watching a movie at the theater, but this was a hundred times better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the he portal showed Cody sit down on the couch, grab the remote from the coffe table that was in front of the couch, and turn on the tv. Then he slipped off his flip-flops and put his barefeet on the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view transfixed you, but you do not know why. Cody and the environment was on a massive scale in the portal, but you did not understand how this was. Maybe you could shrink the dimension of the portal a little? You look away and start messing with some of the machinery of the portal, hoping you could maybe fix the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the portal while you crank the lever, you position the portal so that it was over  his reclining legs, giving you a view of the carpet and his flips flops, then you look away and start calibrating the machine so that the dimensions could be a little bit more normal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody yawned as he stretched out his sweaty legs and put his feet on the coffee table. His mom hated when he did that, but she was at work right now, and she would be none the wiser. He turned his attention to the tv. It was some kidish anime about a cat that invented a shrinking machinge, boring, he thought as he changed the channel. This next channel had some super hero on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at the cartoon, but found himself getting bored. He was at that age were superheros were starting to peter out, and become replaced with the new best thing, something cool that Cody was still desperately trying to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced over at his flip-flops. They used to have the image of the same superhero that was currently saving the world on the tv, but the soles of his feet scratched away the image along time ago. Now its just some foamy plastic stuff that absorbs all his foot sweat. He crossed his legs to get a better look at the bottom of his feet. A little bit dirty, a little bit sweaty, and he could see bits of the foam of the flip-flops clinging to his toes. Cody scrunched his nose in disgust as he put his feet back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe changed the channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a commercial for the video game system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody made an overdramatic  yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the portal. No matter how many times you recalibrated the machinery, the dimensions were still off. Cody\u2019s living room still looked gargantuan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is this? You think to yourself.  While you were deeply pondering a possible solution to this problem, you were suddenly snapped back to the portal when you heard Cody suddenly yell. You look at the portal to see Cody suddenly move, taking his feet off the coffee table and look threatingly at the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grab a hold of the rims of the portal, to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit!\u201d Cody was fed up as he saw the commercial to the video game system that should have been his. Without thinking he put his legs off the coffee table, grabbed the remote, and threw the remote towards the tv as hard as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tv was made to be childproof. The Remote? Not so much. Cody watched as something bounced off the top of the remote and went flying skyward while the remote\u2019s body fell to the ground bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn\u2019t he have that system? His body was raging as he put his feet back on the coffee table and watched as the commercial ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Cody threw the remote at the tv. You watched as the remote hit the tv. You watched as one of the buttons detached and went flying. Towards the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a deer stuck in the headlights as you let go of the edge of the portal. The detached button flew right at you, and you did not move away. <br>\r\nIt got closer and closer until it hit the portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button was roughly the same size as the portal and when the button hit the portal something weird happened; it stuck to the portal for a few seconds. Then gravity took its toll and suctioned you through the portal and into the room. You screamed as you fell into the room, the pacing of the air around picking up as you fell. Looking down, you saw the living room from before coming closer. In these fleeting seconds you wondered where you will land; the coffee table or the floor? One thing stuck in your mind as you fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDYY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the commercial ended Cody thought he heard something calling him. Must be the wind, he thought as the next commercial aired, I have the house to myself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow you survived a really nasty fall. You stand up on this uneven sort of surface and realized that you were okay; looking at your body you realized that you did not break anything. You sort of slipped at the strange slipperiness of this surface, but quickly got your bearings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned to yourself as you stretched out your body to find no broken bones. How did this happen? How did you not die? Your relief is momentary as you look around. You were ontop of some sort of red spongy platform that was more than a little moist, and you realized, a little smelly.<br>\r\nIt kinda smells like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA realization hits. You look up and there where two strange black arches just over this platform, rising just at the tip before melding into one pillar and planting themselves into the ground of the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart starts to beat faster as you look over the arches\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were Cody\u2019s legs just above you, only ten times bigger, which means\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the red surface you were on. You were tiny, and you were on his flip-flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees grew weak, and you wanted nothing more than to drop to the ground and hyperventilate, but you told yourself you would not do that. You had to get Cody\u2019s attention and get his help. You grab your bearings and look towards what you suspected to be the beginnings of the flip-flops, towards where the black straps that held the toes in place so that the sandal wouldn\u2019t fly off his feet. Maybe you can climb atop the arches and shout to get his attention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you make your way over them, careful not to slip on the slippery surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looks at the clock hanging over the mantle. Mom should be home any minute now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moves his feet back and forth on the coffee table, gently rocking them in tune to the theme song of the cartoon that was on right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kinda long, but you finally made it to the toe section of flip-flop making your way towards what you would call the thong of the flip flop that holds the sandal in place. You sit at the base of it, breathing in all of Cody\u2019s footsweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made your journey to the toe section, you remembered that you sorta kinda had a small little foot fetish. Breathing in the evaporation of Cody\u2019s footsweat sort of reminded you of it. And you really enjoyed bathing in its smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you, you realized that this is where Cody\u2019s toes rested; you were surrounded by circular and indentations of various sizes that were a darker red then the rest of the spongy material. You lean back against the thong and close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsn\u2019t this a foot fetishest dream? To be so near someone\u2019s foot? Sure you\u2019re not on the foot itself, but it\u2019s the next best thing, the flips flops themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you look at the biggest indentation that was right next to you, the big toe, you think. This is where the brunt of Cody\u2019s dead skin cells and footsweat were collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred to you. What if you licked it? This was such a perverse thought that you tried to stuff it away, but as you breathed in more of Cody\u2019s footsweat, the thought prevailed. you could have some fun. Your line of work constantly got in the way of your life. The name of science cost you so many years of fun, and now look at this. Here was a chance to enjoy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up towards the arches above you. You should do the responsible thing and climb them so you could get Cody\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut\u2026 those toe indentations are mighty tempting\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While not exactly the most ideal place to open a portal, it did have the advantage of being the most private place in the house, making it much more likely for Cody to find the note than say his dirty room. Having baby sat him throughout your high school and college years since he was in diapers, he was always fascinated with your inventions, you and the boy were pretty close aside from the last year and a half or so when his parents decided he was old enough to not need a baby sitter anymore. Giddy with excitement, you couldn't wait to show him as you carelessly place your portal on the bathroom ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the main portal in your lab, your note in hand you almost couldn't contain yourself. As you near the portal, you pick up speed as you need to drop the note before he enters the bathroom so he can see it floating down. Just as you reach the portal your foot connects with some loose cables on the floor and you're sent tumbling forward, reaching your hands out to brace yourself you see that you're falling into the portal! Letting go of the note you reach out for anything to stop yourself from falling and fail only to find yourself tumbling head first into Cody's bathroom. As you pass through the portal, it closes behind you as your note is left floating down onto the lab floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a faint *bzzt* noise you travel through the portal, eyes closed, screaming your lungs out as you're about to make a eight foot fall face first, literally to your death on Cody's bathroom floor. After a brief period of time you notice that you haven't died yet, so you open your eyes to find yourself in the largest bathroom you've ever seen. It doesn't take a genius to realize your newest invention just accidentally shrank you but you were curious as your new size was so small that you were floating down to the floor as opposed to falling. Before you could calculate exactly how small you were, you hear the door close behind you. You turn your head to see Cody reaching over for the ceiling fan and with a flick of his finger, the fan springs to life and begins to displace you all over the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the fan isn't strong enough to suck you up but you're sent flying around the bathroom as Cody makes his way towards the toilet. Your body is ejected out of vortex from the fan just as Cody reaches down and unhooks his basketball shorts and underwear as he lowers them to the floor, his huge naked body on full display as he sits down on the toilet seat. What was supposed to be a fun way to show him your new invention has now turned into a front row seat of him taking a dump! As much as you wanted to turn away in disgust, you needed to try and get to his ear so he could help get you back to your lab! You begin to make a swimming motion in order to steer yourself towards the boy as he sat oblivious to your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to float down towards Cody, you watched as the boy reached down into his shorts, his milk white butt cheeks were contrasted by the black abyss of the toilet bowl that appeared behind him as he fumbled around his discarded clothes, you shuddered at the though of accidentally ending up in there. Pulling out his phone from his shorts, the begins playing on the device, \"Great\", you say out loud to nobody. Getting his attention over the bathroom fan and his phone is going to be difficult as you continued your swim maneuver towards him, you were on direct course for eye level,you just pray that he would be able to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning you see Cody reach down between his thighs and pulls his penis out from the toilet bowl. Your maneuvering is brought to a halt as you watched the boy sit on the toilet, phone in his left hand, dick in his right as he taps the screen on his phone with his thumb, your ears are assaulted by the sounds of a woman moaning. A sense of dread begins to fill you as you realize you weren't getting a front row seat to him taking a dump, you were getting a front row seat to him jacking off! You watch in horror as his limp member begins to spring to life as he begins to slowly stroke himself, he peels back his ample foreskin revealing the tip of his bloating cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving taken the moment to witness the horror show below you, you realize that you're now on the path to his open mouth. As Cody pleasures himself, his breathing begins to intensify as his mouth hangs open, if you continued on he would for sure inhale you so you begin to try and turn around. You are now so close to him that you can feel the slight pull of his breath with each huff of air he sucks in. You try with all your might to try and swim away from the boy as you just narrowly avoid being sucked into his mouth. Your sense of relief is short lived as you begin to drift towards his throbbing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Cody now had his eyes shut, having completely forgotten about his phone, he was lost in fantasy, oblivious to his exhausted, speck sized former baby sitter as he floated down towards his young cock. You were completely tanked, having never been athletic in your life your arms now felt like burning limp noodles. You could do nothing as you continued towards Cody's glistening purple cock head, the giant slit opened and closed with each tug the boy made threatening to swallow you whole as a lake of pre-cum began to develop inside it. The last time you had changed Cody's diaper he was a little baby, his penis was small and almost cute. Now it stood at over 5 inches, thick with faint bulging of veins along the shafts smooth surface. You closed your eyes as you quietly accepted that Cody was about to kill you in the most humiliating way possible, without any more momentum coming from you, you glided down towards..</span></div></div>",

Cody has apparently become uncomfortable sitting on the toilet seat for so long that he needs to shift. You watch as his massive thighs shift side to side before lifting off the porcelain seat, moving ever so slightly, the seat creaks from the weight of the boy. Along with those thighs, Cody's rock hard member shifts slightly as well, moving over just enough to be out of your way! You silently celebrate your small victory, if you were going to die today, it wasn't going to be from ending up inside the twelve year old's dick while he jerked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new trajectory appeared to place you on the toilet seat directly in front of Cody's balls. As you continue to float past the boys humongous tool, your ears become assaulted from the loud noises one normally doesn't pay attention to while masturbating. The scraping from the friction as his hand moves up and down the smooth rod, over and over. The beating*fwap* *fwap* *fwap* noise as his hand meets the bottom of his shaft. Up above, the soft moans that are beginning to escape from his mouth as lust overcomes him, these are all noises you never wanted to hear in your life coming from Cody. This was your little buddy, your small partner in crime and now here you are subjected to the most private and intimate thing a pre-teen boy could do and it was nobody else's fault but your own you think. If you hadn't been so stupid and impatient this wouldn't be happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to beat yourself up mentally, you fail to realize that your projected path had altered a little bit. What once would have led you to the toilet seat edge now led you into the side of the seat. As you got closer, you snapped out of your personal berating only to see the huge sidewall of the toilet seat approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" Is all you manage to yell before slamming into the cold surface of the seat and forcibly being redirected inside the porcelain throne. The momentum shift, swings you around as you're greeted inside the bowl to Cody's massive ball sack being bounced up and down from his pleasure session. Your new re-route has you heading straight for his bouncing orbs, a layer of sweat coats the giant sperm factories as the small amount of light that enters the toilet is causing them to glisten, no doubt from his basketball practice earlier. It's not long until you find yourself closing in on the huge sack, the smell of musk from his sweaty balls is strong and permeates your entire area. Your brain isn't sure if it should be disgusted or turned on from the sudden assault but you don't get enough time to figure it out as you slam face first in the wrinkly skin, adhering to it's moist surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as you might, the layer of thick sweat kept you fastened to Cody's oily balls. You're sent up and down violently as his balls jostle inside the bowl from the absolute beating he is giving his cock. The whole experience is making you dizzy as you vomit down inside the water below. With a last ditch effort, you manage to pull free one of your arms as you begin to pound your fist onto the sack, there was no good ending to this scenario, you needed him to find you now as you noticed the cold interior of the bowl was quickly drying the sweat that once held you fast to the surface of his scrotum.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your efforts are in vain as Cody's focus is only on the extreme pleasure coming from his groin, your small fists are too insignificant to pull his attention away as his pace picks up as he nears his climax. </span></div></div>",

As the sweat on his scrotum dries, you quickly begin to peel off from the dangling orbs as you grab handfuls of the loose wrinkly skin in an attempt to prevent yourself from ending up in the cold waters below. Your arms still burn from your initial goal of reaching his head, you're left screaming at the top of your lungs in a last ditch effort to get his attention, your voice is so small and pathetic it doesn't even echo in the huge bowl as it's dwarfed by the sounds of Cody as he beats his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you scream in vain, a loud growling noise emits from somewhere above you. Almost on cue, everything becomes dead quiet, Cody stops pleasuring himself, you're caught off guard and stop screaming for a second as neither of you make a move. Realizing this may be your only chance for him to hear you, you take a deep breath and start to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP ME CO-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PHBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBTTTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only chance for him to hear you is cut off as Cody releases a massive fart into the bowl. Thousands of cubic feet of foul gas pours out of his ass as it floods the bowl and you're left coughing and gagging as the rotting egg mixture burns your lungs. Taking his cock back in hand, Cody goes back to finishing himself off as if nothing had just happened. Meanwhile, for you, you're quickly becoming light headed as your grip on his balls weakens. Almost in slow motion like the movies, you lose your grip as you plummet backwards, reaching out with your hands for even the smallest of pubes but nothing comes to your aid as you splash down into the cold waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hit the water, you plunge down pretty deep, you have to use the last bit of energy you have just to swim to the top. As you break the surface of the freezing water, you take a deep breath of the foul air that has replaced the oxygen, you open your eyes and the first thing you see is the foul hole that terrorized you earlier. Set dead in the middle of two milky white planets, the huge ass hole that loomed above you looked like a black hole in contrast to the smooth cheeks that surrounded it. The huge scrotum you were just clinging to was bouncing around like crazy as Cody's pace was at an all time high as his breaths were becoming heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second you watch as his huge hand pulls the massive cock down into the toilet bowl as the throbbing rod is ready to erupt. Loud moans erupt from the boy above as huge ropes of semen begin to pump out the gigantic slit just feet away from you as the thick white substance floats and begins moving around the bowl. You found it difficult to pull your attention away as Cody's hand milked his dick for pleasure. As a man of science this was something that had clearly never been done before, yet on the other hand, it was completely disgusting to be watching such a young child do something so intimate. You divert your gaze as your eyes land back on his butt hole as it puckers open with each throe of passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jesus Christ!\" You yell in disgust as you settle for closing your eyes. After a small period of time, the moaning and splashing of cum had long come to an end, you open your eyes to see why Cody wasn't moving. Up above, his once rock hard cock now hung rather limply as it slowly deflated down, it's foreskin still pulled back slightly, your curiosity was satiated as a huge stream of urine erupted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow substance poured out of the lazy member above as it began to mist the air around you, stinging your eyes while also turning the water you tread into the same awful color. The powerful impact his piss is causing begins to displace all the water in the bowl as the turbulent waters begin to move you around. You can feel yourself being pulled towards the powerful stream, yet you could do nothing as you barely had enough energy to stay afloat. You hear Cody give a massive sigh above you as he relieves himself after masturbating, filling you with a sense of defeat as you resign yourself to your fate. You inch closer and closer to the massive stream before the huge force collides with you, plunging you deep under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a minute passes before Cody's dick begins to taper off, he reaches down and gives it a couple of shakes as you somehow float back to the surface. Floating on your back, you gasp for air as you stair blankly into the milky white butt cheeks above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kill me!\" You faintly yell up to the dwarfing butt cheeks above. \"Get up and end this already!\" You can hear Cody shifting up above, but you couldn't see what he was doing. Unbeknownst to you, he was learning forward with his elbows on his knees. As your pleas for death fall upon deaf ears, you're interrupted by a ominous growl from above once again. You watch as his puckered asshole begins to bloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! NO! NO! NO! Not like this Cody!\" You yell, tears streaming down your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PHBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBTTTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fart erupts out of the shit hole above you, more gas pouring into your prison causing you to cough and gag once again. You fight through the urge to close your eyes as they begin to sting, but you needed to make sure he wasn't going to do what you thought he was about to do. Unfortunately, your first assumption was correct as the hole bloats out once again only this time, a huge log of shit begins to poke out along with it. Your eyes open wide with terror as the foul log begins to squelch and schlick it's way out into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, you can hear Cody grunting a bit, this log is going to be massive as it continues to snake it's way out of his greasy butt hole. The massive turd slides out halfway to the toilet water before stopping. Once again everything  becomes eerily quiet as if someone hit a pause button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON!\" You hear the child above grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PHBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBTTTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fart erupts out of the boy, shooting the log out of his now gaping asshole. The massive turd falls just inches from you, splashing down into the water, you and several gallons of the yellow stuff are launched into the air.</span></div></div>",

Looking past his hand you see the bathroom mirror and in it's reflection you're able to make out Cody's moon sized butt cheeks, his ample ball sack and his wrinkled sphincter that currently holds you prisoner. Matter of fact, the only thing you're not able to see is yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do nothing but silently sob as you watch Cody bring his other arm around, his hand clenching the white paper as it invades your tiny world, blocking the reflection and snuffing out the bathroom light. The huge wall of paper collides into you and drags you up along his shitter with heaps of left over dung, towards the mouth of his huge anus. Your body is rolled along the disgustingly greasy surface, before being deposited between two massive wrinkles near the entrance of his rear end. Light returns once again as Cody pulls the soiled paper away as he casually tosses it into the toilet. You watch helplessly at his reflection as he rips another piece of paper and brings it right back around to his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however, the paper passes right over you as the gigantic wrinkles that hold you in place serve as a barrier. The scraping sound of the paper against his rubbery hole is so loud it hurts your ears. Having already accepted death, you watch in terror as the paper isn't able to pull you out of his ass as Cody once again tosses it into the toilet. \"No... please, just take me out of here and flush me..\" You say weakly, reaching an arm out towards the reflection as Cody releases his bulbous cheek causing it to clap shut and wobble again. Your world is thrown into darkness as you hear Cody pulling up his shorts and underwear, his anus collapses in on you as he stands up straight. You can hear the toilet flushing as he walks out of the bathroom, you're rolled along with his hefty cheeks as Cody heads..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tucked away in a giant anal wrinkle in a 12 year old's ass, your teeth clatter together with each step the boy makes as he walks out of the bathroom. Convinced at some point you must have died and this was the hell you were sentenced to for the rest of eternity, reduced to nothing more than butt lint to an adolescent, you break down and cry as you're rolled along with his big butt cheeks. Through your sobs, you're able to make out a muffled conversation through the layers of butt flab as Cody makes his way into his living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey honey, you ready to go?\" you hear his mother ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, where we going?\" Cody's boyish voice is much louder than his mothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father wants to try the new Mexican restaurant your Aunt Kristy told us about, remember? The one she swears the food is so good she overate and ended gassing out your Uncle Terry all night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cody's giant anus begins to contract, his huge orifice undulating in response to an irritation. Could it be he was able to feel you, finally? Tightly wedged in a giant anal wrinkle, you couldn't move, so you did the only thing you could, you opened your mouth and took a huge mouthful of butt hole flesh. Immediately you're filled with regret as the salty, oily, shit stained skin floods into your mouth, tears streaming down your face as you clamp down and tear at the foul hole. Your world is shook as you feel Cody jump from the sudden intrusion he feels in his sensitive hole, his butt cheeks flex in response to snuff out the sharp annoyance. All of a sudden Cody's blubbery cheeks turn as solid as steel as they clamp together in response to your biting. Yelping out in pain, you let the disgusting skin go and you're body is immediately smashed by Cody's fingers as they probe around for the source of the irritation. Your body is hooked by one of his finger nails and you're plucked out from the deep anal wrinkle and drug to the center of Cody's anus as your head and upper body are forced inside the slimy sphincter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Cody?\" His mother asks after she sees him jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like something sharp poked me in the butt!\" he exclaims. Reaching around behind him, he digs his hand between his fat butt cheeks as he rubs a finger along his ass hole to scratch at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CODY! Don't scratch at your butt! That's disgusting!\" His mother scolds him. \"Now go wash your hand so we can go have a nice dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent that he had dealt with whatever was bothering him, Cody returned to the bathroom and washed his hands and pretty soon they arrived at the Mexican restaurant. The typical white suburban family enjoyed a nice night, especially Cody who ate the largest burrito he had ever laid eyes on with a nice big helping of re fried beans on the side. Meanwhile, the whole time Cody's family enjoyed their night out, you were wedged inside the twelve year old's anus, surrounded by the deafening sounds of the boy's digestive system as it worked hard to process his meals. All around you, Cody's intestines squelch as he puts back the fiber packed food. You find yourself in and out of consciousness as you're unable to find a suitable amount of oxygen to breath as the sulfur shit smelling methane gas inside Cody's ass is all you have to breath, an environment that was not meant to maintain other life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a period of time, you regain consciousness as Cody and his family are driving back home. You've lost all feeling in your legs which are still dangling outside Cody's butt hole, you're pretty sure he hasn't cut you in half with his huge log cutter yet. Suddenly, the loud digestive noises begin to change as it sounds like something is heading your way. In the blink of an eye, Cody's colon swells full of gas as his body processes the Mexican food he ate, your eyes sting as the hot gas begins to suffocate you as you cough and choke. Around your waist, you can feel Cody trying to push the fart out as his anus loosens it's grip on you slightly. Your body appears to be acting as a plug for the boy as pressure builds up all around and  you feel Cody make a slight movement, leaning to the side, which created a small enough gap underneath your torso for the hot fart to begin slowly exiting the twelve year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to exit all at once, the fart lingered and lasted for almost 15 full seconds which nearly tore you apart. With not enough pressure built up, your body acted as a fart suppressor as the silent but deadly fart was released from Cody's butt, blasting you directly in the face as it escaped under your chest. The huge anal lips vibrated against your whole body, shaking you to the core. Soon after your chamber emptied, you can hear another muffled conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear lord WHAT is that smell?\" Cody's dad says as he begins to roll down the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dad, that was me, Aunt Kristy was right about that Mexican restaurant, I feel like balloon!\" says Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't kidding either. Several times during the car ride home, fart after fart was released from the young boy. Every time your body was used to soften the expulsion of fetid air as you're bruised and beaten by the vibrating butt hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, you really gotta try to hold those in, we're almost home! At least try to make it to the toilet!\" his dad continues to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the largest fart yet begins to fill into Cody's colon as his bowels begin to creak and squelch in complaint. Convinced he could hold it in until he got to the bathroom, Cody clenched his ass hole hard in order to keep the fart in. You feel his anus clamp down on you again, so hard in fact it begins to suck the rest of your body in. If he continues like this, you might be sucked completely inside, lost in his dark slimy bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Cody...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Cody fought against the natural order of his own body, his huge anus chewed on your lower half like gum. Everytime the smelly orifice contracted and clenched, more of your body was kneaded  into the boys rectum. The thought of being engulfed in Cody's ass was enough to send another round of adrenaline through your body, with your sudden burst of energy, you begin to flail and  punch at the pink slimy walls that surround you, figuring your only chance for survival was to create enough chaos to force Cody to fart you into his underwear, your hypothesis is soon answered. Up above, Cody feels a another slight irritation, committed to holding in his gas, he presses his butt down into the seat and begins to grind back and forth in order to deal with the minor itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unable to feel your legs, you're caught off gaurd as Cody fidgets up above. What was once a slow ascent into his slimy hole was now exponentially faster as each side shift consumed more of your body. Pretty soon, you slid completely inside as your feet were the last bastion of hope you had. Being a man of science, you knew all you had to do was maintain your position near his exit and at the very least you'll be expelled when he finally releases his massive butt blast. The lack of air starts to get to you as you feel yourself losing conscousness, before you pass out, you  prop your body against Cody's giant wrinkly asshole as it continues to convulse, using it as a foul make shift hammock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up above, Cody is relieved when the annoying itch in his butt is finally squashed. Pretty soon his family car pulls into their driveway and he hops out and runs straight to the bathroom. As he reaches the cement stairs into the house, he attempts to jump up the two steps and doesn't make it. Cody is sent falling forward as the top of his shoes don't make it over the lip of the stair and he crash lands on his bloated belly. Almost immediately, the huge fart he was holding in was released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, your unconscious body was flung around Cody's rectum as he ran to the house. When he tripped you were sent sprawling deeper down into his digestive tract but not before the massive torrent of gas bellowed out of the boys butt hole with a loud <b>PHBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBTTTTT</b>. For the entire fart, your body was suspended in the steamy hot putrid gas, the massive fart was almost strong enough to eject your from inside of Cody, unfortunately, just as you were about to pass through his soiled anus, his gas began to taper off. Had you been consciuos, you may have had a chance to grab some of the butt flesh and pull yourself out. Instead your body slowly descends back into the boy until all the gas has exited and you're sent tumbling through his rectum into his dark colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his fart ends, Cody emits an audible groan as he picks himself up from the ground, tears forming in his eyes as his knees were a bit scraped and his pride a bit hurt, he casually walked into  his house. Strolling up to his room, he stops at the closet in the hallway to grab some bandages before shutting himself in shame. He pulls out his phone and lays on his back on his bed as he scrolls through his social media feed, occasionally, he rolls onto his back to stifle the sound of a large fart as he continues to digest the large amount of Mexican food. After a long day of playing, masturbating and a eating a huge meal, Cody eventually falls asleep, throughout the night he continues to release loud bassy farts which manuever your body around the deepest parts of his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being out for several hours, you slowly wake up, realizing that the hell you just went through wasn't a dream, you look around at the rigid pink walls as they undulate with Cody's heartbeat. Unsure which direction you need to head, you begin to walk in one of two directions. Along the way, you notice large piles of dried up shit that cling to the inside of Cody's large intestines. Several times during your trip, you have to take a break as the heat and disgusting smell get the better of you. It was a long trip, but you eventually find your way back to Cody's butt hole and run up to the shut orifice and begin to pound on the giant wrinkles. More time passes and your blows are becoming weaker and weaker until you can barely stand. From behind you, somewhere in the darkness a horrifying noise begins to fill your chamber. Turning around, you see a gigantic mound of shit that was once a burrito slowly approaching it's final stop in digestion! With a blood curdling scream you turn and start to claw, bite, kick and punch at the tightly shut hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CODY PLEASE! LET ME OUT OF HERE!!\" You scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cody snorts himself awake as the familiar pressure in his guts pull him from his slumber. Sitting up, he rubs the sleep from his eyes before standing up and sauntering out of his room to the bathroom. Dropping his shorts and underwear down, he plops his butt down and let's his body do it's thing, not even trying to push the large amount of crap out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you were completely helpless as the steaming hot log of shit continued to slide towards you. Being inside Cody's ass smelled incredibly bad, but being in front of a huge turd still inside of that ass was 1000x worse. As a last ditch effort, you attempt to lay against the intestinal wall in hopes the filth will roll past you.</span></div></div>",
