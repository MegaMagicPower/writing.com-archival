Without as much as a sound he kneels down<br>\r\nand starts to mumble something under his breath. You can't make out<br>\r\nthe words, but it seems to be a chant. With your hands shaking and your<br>\r\npulse quickening you discover that a cool sweat has begun to envelope<br>\r\nyour body. Trying to calm yourself, you slow your breathing. Something<br>\r\nominous, some feeling is threatening to break your resolve. There is<br>\r\nno reason for this, as the solitary stranger has not done or said or<br>\r\neven acted as a threat to you in the least; deep down though, you know<br>\r\nthat his appearance marks the beginning of the end for you.</div></span></div></div>",

You can't wait to get rid of the oppressive feeling that is resting on your chest at the moment. You sit in the dark, hoping that the stranger does not notice the sudden absence of illumination coming from your window. You move your chair closer to the window so that you can see the results of your action. The stranger is still kneeling over something by the tree. Suddenly he turns and looks directly in your direction. A chill once again runs down your spine. His eyes bore into the space that your head is occupying. He is wearing a black hoodie, which masks much of his facial features. He turns back to the object in front of the tree. Then, he takes an object out of his right pants pocket. He walks closer to the tree, then kneels down and you hear a clicking sound. In a few moments you see a faint glow near his feet. Suddenly the tree bursts into flames, the conflagration quickening up the sides of its trunk, obviously helped by the agent in the object the stranger placed on your lawn. He then turns to face you again. He smiles cruelly. He bolts toward the front door of your house. He disappears from sight for a few seconds and then you hear it. The POUND, POUND, POUND on the frame of your front door. Your heart is in your throat. This cannot be happening.</span></div></div>",

The look in his eyes is manic, his pupils dilated to devour any incoming light in the cold night. The streetlight innocuously shines in the background of the scene. You notice the package lying next to the stranger's feet. It is in bad repair and seems to have been through a stressful journey to your house. You call out to the stranger from your front door, \"Hey you! What the hell are you doing on my lawn?\" The stranger is silent, unmoving and stoic. \"Hey! Did you hear me? I SAID, What the HELL are you doing on my lawn?\" And then, with the quickness of a heartbeat, and before you can move a muscle, the stranger...</span></div></div>",

The gun makes no sound save for a muffled click; the silencer screwed on to the end of the barrel renders the gunshot inaudible, thus maintaining the assassin's cover. He fires again, and again a third time, knocking you on your back.<br>\r\n\"Why....?\" you stammer breathlessly, hoping none of the bullets had perforated a lung.<br>\r\n\"This one's for Mr. Valenzetti. A pity you wasn't able to fulfill 'is expectations,\" he says in a heavy British accent, towering over you, pointing his weapon right between your eyes.<br>\r\nTime seems to run slow.

You can't even die in peace; those idiots next door are running their lawnmower, making an annoying buzz...<br>\r\nWait a minute... it's almost midnight. Even those idiot neighbors wouldn't try to mow their lawn at this hour. What could be making that buzzing then?

He glances to the left just in time to see the source as it decapitates him.<br>\r\nOne second, the hitman was standing over you. The next, he was standing over you without a head. All you could make out in between was a flash of silver. The hitman's body collapses and falls backwards. Inwardly, you are glad that his corpse didn't fall on you.<br>\r\nDespite your multiple gunshot wounds, you manage to pull yourself up.

Moving with the grace of a gazelle you silently say a prayer for the soon to be deceased soul in your front yard. You open your window silently, just enough that the barrel of your rifle can slide into and the sill can be used as a stabilizing force. With the patience of a practiced marksman you wait for the right moment to take your shot, the moment when the head of the aforementioned stranger is a target as juicy as a watermelon. The stranger is still kneeling, but his posture makes a headshot difficult. You won't settle for less. This stranger didn't know what he was getting himself into, did he? You silently laugh at his misfortune of picking YOUR lawn, YOUR tree tonight. He is very, very unlucky. The stranger is standing up. He moves next to the tree. The target is juicy. You hold your breath to reduce the subtle movement of the barrel, eager to enact a perfect shot. The time is now. You pull the trigger. The sound is deafening, reverberating throughout the neighboring woods like a cackle in a canyon. No matter, as you live in a secluded cottage. Direct hit. The blood and cranial matter of the stranger's head in splayed in miscellaneous semblances of pattern about your lawn. What a mess. You calmly place your gun back into its case, it's job being done for the night. You hurry downstairs, eager to examine your kill before things get hairy. As you step onto the lawn, an immediate sense of regret wracks your body. You near the downed figure, the dark blue of his USPS deliveryman's uniform caked now with red blood, forming a macabre tie-die look to his attire. The package lying next to him in the grass near the tree in your front lawn is addressed to you. There is no return address. Poor fellow, you think to yourself. Never knew what hit him. You take the package and wipe it against the grass, cleaning up the debris of flesh from the wrapping. Feels heavy. </span></div></div>",

You run, run, run down the dirt driveway of your house, run down the secluded street that leads to your residence, run down this hidden avenue tucked away from society, run, run, you run away from everything you own, everything you know, you run from it all, run, run until you're out of breath... ... ... ... ... ... ... <br>\r\nYou have nothing left. You're spent. You collapse on the ground, nearly a mile and a half from your house, lying on your back, face toward the sky aware that all of the heavens are watching you and you're watching them back, returning the steely stare of contempt for the fact that you have taken a human life. You shove your shame aside and stare back, defiant in the face of the greatness that is apparent in the vast expanse of space above you, aware that all of it could swallow you, swallow you whole in one tiny bite, no problem, and you'd be like you never existed, alone, left, betrayed by your own destructive nature. You are alone. Singularly. Solitary. Just like the stranger that is lying faceless in a pool of his own blood and flesh, identity taken by your bullet, the canvas smeared, ruined, erased, malformed. Broken. You slowly rise to your feet, still staring into the sky, still absorbed in your rebellion. You never see the truck that is going 90mph down this broken stretch of road, as it SMACKS into The Tree that is right next to you, exploding into flames, with shards of shrapnel flying in myriad directions. You dive away from the blast as a piece of metal nicks your ear. You bleed red blood from your ear. It is trickling down the side of your face, painting the picture of guilt with the same red that painted the stranger's demise, painted with the same brush of irony that has created the canvas upon which this scene is built. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie face down in the grass ditch on the opposite side of the road, slowly recovering your sense, slowly regaining awareness. You are still bleeding red blood from your ear. It has slowed, but is still trickling down the side of your face. You lie there, thinking about the poor soul, drunk from some party, wasted beyond recognition, foolishly getting into his Ford pickup, turning the keys to the ignition, cranking the engine, pulling out of the driveway of the bar; tavern; pub; restaurant; now driving down the abandoned stretch of road that is home to the home of a killer, unaware that in mere moments the excessive speed at which he is driving will cause him to lose control of the truck, swerve to the left, overcompensate and turn hard right, into the trunk, the trunk of the old oak standing sentry on the side of the road, watching the windshield erupt into millions of tiny pieces, watching the glass break and fly and dismantle and careen into his face, ripping the flesh from the skull as the impact reacts with the engine and gas tank, causing the truck to burst into flame, searing and burning the now broken body of the driver. You rub your eyes. The image doesn't go away. The movie described continues to play as you move, groggily rising once again. You take a few steps and then fall,........................................................................on the way down you whisper, \"I'm sorry,\" into the night air,............you hear and feel your skull crack on the concrete simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're out cold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light is up ahead....there is no tunnel.....just light.....what is it....ah.......bright....hurts......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou......</span></div></div>",

First though, you'll need some towels for the blood and other supplies. You leave the body momentarily as you head back inside to find your things. Rummaging through the washing room, you can't find your cleaning supplies anywhere. \"I know I left them right here,\" you say softly. A faint whisper of suspicion is running through your mind and the wheels are starting to turn in that certain instinctual part of the human psyche; your \"gut\". You feel a deep sense of foreboding once again creep up your spine, and you realize that this unlucky stranger was not the source of the sense of dread that is now shaking you to your very core.
