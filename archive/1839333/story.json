Jess was one of your oldest friends, more like your sister, and to make a little extra money on the weekends she had a little house cleaning business, nothing fancy usually just apartments and single story houses that she would straighten up for the owners. But this time was different, word had gotten around how good she was so she was contacted by a man who wanted her to clean out an old house he had just bought, you know just make it presentable for any potential buyers, and he would pay triple her usual rate. She couldn\u2019t pass that up, but it was bigger than she was use to so she called you for help, you didn\u2019t mind you weren\u2019t doing anything, she said she\u2019d buy you a full tank of gas and lunch so you were happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk up the front porch steps and through the front door, \u201cOkay now I just need you to take everything not bolted to the ground outside, furniture on the lawn and anything else just put it in the back of your truck. The guy said he already got all the valuable looking stuff but he would still like to sort through anything else we find.\u201d Jess says, \u201cCan do.\u201d You say, \u201cOkay if you need me I\u2019ll be in the back filling boxes.\u201d She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then go your separate ways, from where you had been standing the house looked pretty empty so you decide to go upstairs and work your way down. Upstairs you found boxes, some empty, some full, and various items covered in dust laying around. So you start packing boxes and moving them down stairs. And then when it looked like you notice a rope hanging from the ceiling in the hallway. \u201cOh you\u2019ve got to be kidding me, there is an attic too?\u201d you say you then move the last of the boxes on that floor downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move the last of the boxes to your truck and Jess\u2019s van she was just coming outside, \u201cWell first floor is done, did you get everything from the second floor?\u201d she asks, \u201cYeah now it just needs to be swept, hey have you been up to the attic yet?\u201d you ask hoping she had already taken care of it. She looks at you confused, \u201cAttic? That\u2019s funny the owner never mentioned anything about an attic.\u201d She says, \u201cDang, well one more floor then.\u201d You say walking back to the house, \u201cOkay ill help you with that and then sweep everything down.\u201d She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then make your way to the attic, at first you gently tug on the rope, but it wouldn\u2019t budge so you tell Jess to stand back and you pull harder. Suddenly it shoots open in a cloud of dust. \u201cWell I guess no one has been up here in a while.\u201d You say, he two of you then walk carefully up the stairs into an open room with a desk, a chair, candles, and dozens of books. There didn\u2019t seem to be any lights but you could see thanks to a single window. \u201cWell I guess it could be worse. I\u2019ll go get some boxes, open the window and see if you can get us some more light.\u201d Jess says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walks down the stairs as you step up into the room and make your way to the window. As you open the window the room is filled with an almost blinding light. Once your eyes adjust you make your way to the table where you find an open book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look down at the open book preparing to decipher the strange words when suddenly Jess walk up the stairs, \u201cHey what you got there?\u201d she asks, \u201cNothing just books.\u201d You say closing the book and placing it on the bookshelf. \u201cOkay I\u2019ll box up the light stuff, you find out how to get the desk and chair downstairs.\u201d She says, \u201cAh fun stuff.\u201d You say sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much time and frustration you manage to get them down them to the front lawn. You then sit down on the tailgate of your truck to catch your breath. Just then, Jess walks up carrying a box with a book on top of it. \u201cWell that\u2019s the last of it,\u201d she says placing the box beside you. \u201cWait, I think you forgot one.\u201d You say pointing to the book. \u201cNo, it just didn\u2019t fit in the box.\u201d She said picking it up and throwing it in your truck. \u201cOkay the moving truck will be by any minute now for the furniture then all we have to do is drop this stuff off and get paid.\u201d She says smiling, \u201cSweet, cause I\u2019m starving. And you\u2019re buying so I was thinking Olive Garden, maybe that Japanese place I like\u201d You say smiling, \u201cHey! I said I\u2019d buy you dinner I didn\u2019t say you could pick.\u201d She says smiling, \u201cOh come on.\u201d You say, \u201cYep McDonalds dollar menu it is.\u201d She says laughing, \u201cHey!\u201d you say smiling, \u201cOkay okay I guess you did earn a little more than dollar cheeseburger and small drink.\u201d She says smiling. \u201cThank you.\u201d You say smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the moving truck pulls up and lets down its window, \u201cThere you go guys.\u201d She says, \u201cAlright lets head out.\u201d She says, you then get in your vehicles and you follow her. About twenty minutes later you arrive at a house even bigger than the old one, as you pull up Jess is talking to a man while two other men unload her van, you then get out and begin unloading your truck, once the van was emptied the two men joined you and in no time both vehicles were unloaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man hands Jess an envelope, thanks both of you, and walks inside. The two of you then get in your vehicles and drive away. She then buys you a full tank of gas and takeout from a reasonably priced restaurant and the two of you head back to her place to eat. When you get there you carry the food inside and the two of you eat while watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alright everyone, this is the part where you decide what kind of Lost Body swapping secret they discover)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you pick it up and bring it inside. \u201cHey you forgot this.\u201d You say putting the book on the coffee table. \u201cOh yeah, well ill just return it tomorrow.\u201d She says, as you walk over to plug up your phone picks up the book and looks at it, \u201cYou know it\u2019s weird, there isn\u2019t any writing on the outside of the book, not even a symbol. How are you suppose to know what it is?\u201d she ask, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s handmade and the owner never planned on selling it.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then opens the book to a random page, \u201cHey check this out.\u201d She says as she hands you the book, \u201cWow I\u2019ve never seen symbols like these before, but for some reason\u2026 I think know what it means.\u201d You say pointing it out to her, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I could read it, it\u2019s just like my brain naturally understands it.\u201d You say, \u201cHere try again, but don\u2019t try to read it just look at it.\u201d You say handing her the book.

The two of you then begin reading, or at least understanding what it the symbols mean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the two of you silently sit back on the couch, \u201cThis can\u2019t be real, it has to be some kind of trick\u201d you say, \u201cWell we just \u2018read\u2019 a book in a language we have never seen and since we found this in an old abandoned house I doubt this is the latest technology.\u201d She says, \u201cSo let\u2019s see if I\u2019m getting this right. It\u2019s says that this isn\u2019t magic, and the reason we can naturally understand it is because it is written in the \u2018original\u2019 language.\u201d You say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I got too and that this thing contains knowledge that has been past down since the beginning to preserve that which has been lost to time and legend.\u201d She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah are we sure this isn\u2019t fiction because this would make a great movie.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She says, \u201cSo let\u2019s see what kind of ancient wisdom this thing possesses?\u201d you say picking up the book and flipping the page. \u201cOkay let\u2019s see, the truth of trading bodies?\u201d you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it says the soul is what is important and the body is just a vessel, and even though a body\u2019s original soul has presidency over it, under the right circumstances two people can trade bodies.\u201d she says, \u201cWhat kind of circumstances?\u201d you asks, \u201cWell let\u2019s see it says, that two souls form a network and agree on a trigger word and that\u2019s pretty much it?\u201d she say laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I mean think about it, all the movies were wrong? They could come up with magic and technology but they never considered two people could just trade as easily as exchanging cars?\u201d you say laughing, <br>\r\nJess then turns to you with a big smile on her face, \u201clet\u2019s try it!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cWait what?\u201d you say, \u201cLet\u2019s try to switch bodies.\u201d She says, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d You say, \u201cYea I am come on.\u201d She says excitedly, \u201cCome on it\u2019ll be fun, now first it ways that knowledge is power, so reading this gives a person the power, next two people have to agree on a trigger word.\u201d She says, \u201cOkay,\u201d you say humoring her, \u201cwhat about, Tag you\u2019re it?\u201d you say laughing, \u201cHmm a little long, but I like it.\u201d She says smiling, \u201cOkay so we read the book, we agreed on a word now it looks like one of us just has to say it.\u201d She says, \u201cOkay, Tag you\u2019re it.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly what you\u2019re looking at changes, it was like switching from one channel to the next. One moment you were looking down at Jess reading the book and the next thing you knew you were looking at the book! Confused you look up to see yourself, standing there speechless. You knew exactly what had just happened but you didn\u2019t want to believe it, so you rushed to the closest mirror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat body do you see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Okay now up until this point I haven\u2019t given a physical description of either of them.

And unfortunately for you when she got home she change out of her comfortable work clothes and into something sexy, you were actually a little surprised when she came out of her room dressed red spaghetti strap shirt and a pair of shorts, I mean her closet was full of stuff like this, maybe her feminine ego wanted to feels sexy after a day of cleaning but that meant now you were.

You slowly sit down taking deep breaths, but your concentrations is soon broken by the sound of your own laughter, well at least your bodies laughter. You look up to see Jess flexing your muscles and smiling, \u201cThis is amazing; I\u2019ve never felt anything like this.\u201d She says lifting a chair over her head with one hand. You then jump out of your seat, \u201cPut that down! This isn\u2019t awesome, and this isn\u2019t funny!

I guess it\u2019s a reflex.\u201d She says laughing. \u201cAh.\u201d You exclaim breathing deeply until you fall back onto the couch. \u201cDon\u2019t worry we only got another fifty minutes to go.\u201d She says smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an agonizing hour of you trying to remain still and covered up on the coach watching TV as to not draw attentions to any aspect of your body while at the same time watching Jess enjoy your body, she could jump and touch the ceiling since your body was taller than she was use to and your upper body strength which she had used to lift everything that wasn\u2019t nailed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was just about time, \u201cMan it\u2019s nice not having to sit down every time.\u201d Jess says walking back into the living room while zipping up her pants, \u201cBut this things got a mind of its own.\u201d She says laughing, realizing what she had just done with your body, you stair intently at the clock while repeating, \u201cTag you it,\u201d over and over until suddenly you\u2019re not looking at the clock anymore. \u201cOh thank god!\u201d you exclaim jumping up and down in your own body, you then look over to see Jess getting up off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee now that wasn\u2019t so bad now was it?\u201d she asks, \u201cSpeak for yourself, I was counting the seconds.\u201d You say laughing, \u201cOh was being me such a bad thing?\u201d she asks, \u201cWell yeah.\u201d You say, \u201cWait what do you mean,\u201d she asks seriously, \u201cAh well it\u2019s just that your body...\u201d you say, \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with my body!\u201d she exclaims, \u201cNothing, it\u2019s just I don\u2019t like it.\u201d You says, \u201cWhat!\u201d she yells, \u201cNo it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t like being in it, so we shouldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d You say, \u201cOh come on, we\u2019ve found something amazing, it would be wrong to waste it.\u201d She says enthusiastically, but you simply take a deep breath, \u201cSorry Jess, but hey it\u2019s getting late, I\u2019m going to head home.\u201d You say, \u201cOh yeah okay.\u201d She says dishearten, she then gives you a hug and you leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then drive back to your place, take a shower, and go to sleep. You were sorry that you hurt her feelings but it was just so weird being a girl, you were fully dressed and safe indoors. You couldn\u2019t imagine going out in public as her. You then drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Okay we all know that Jess isn\u2019t going to just accept no more swapping so does she swap with you while you\u2019re asleep so that you wake up in her body.

You wildly swing at the sound coming from your nightstand and silence it. The phone's screen glows slowly into focus as you pull it over and squint at it with barely enough consciousness to recognize the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Je-Jess,\" you sputter through your dry mouth and throat. \"It's the middle of the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's way past sunrise, sleepy head, and I've got exciting news for you. I've arranged for that one-on-one with Melissa you've wanted so you can find out more about her and see if you're compatible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa O'Mara is a redhead from across town that was in one of the pictures Jess took on a school exchange day she had gone on to your rival school. Your mind snaps to attention at the words remembering the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tiskin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ce42article-2038331-0DEE3CC400000578-254_468x737.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://tiskin.com/wp-content/uploads/201...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been bugging Jess to tell you about her, but Jess would just shrug it off saying she doesn't really know anything about her. Still you would dream about going on a date with her and occasionally ask Jess to contact her to set something up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your mouth becomes moist, and you quickly ask, \"Yeah. When?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only time she can meet is this morning, but I know you're not a morning person, and it would take you forever to get across town. So, <i>Tag, you're it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the cozy dimness of your room is replaced by bright light, although it is filtered through something in front of your eyes. You recognize that they are sunglasses and that you are now sitting at a small outside table with a cup of coffee and looking down the sidewalk watching Melissa walk towards you with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun. See you in an hour, Jess. Make sure you put in good words about me,\" you hear your own voice from the phone you're holding just before the line disconnects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then you realize that Jess has set you up as her to meet with Melissa, and there's no time to hide. You start to panic and almost scream into the phone even though no one is there. Melissa is almost here. The only thing you can do is go through with it pretending to be Jess and finding out all you can as well as set yourself up with her before Jess brings your body in an hour.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you pick it up and bring it inside. \u201cHey look what I found.\u201d You say putting the book on the coffee table. \u201cOh yeah, my bad I\u2019ll just return it in the morning.\u201d She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk over to plug up your phone she picks up the book and looks at it, \u201cYou know it\u2019s weird; there isn\u2019t any writing on the outside of the book, not even a symbol. How are you suppose to know what it is?\u201d she ask, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s handmade and the owner never planned on selling it.\u201d You say. She then opens it to a random page, \u201cWow I\u2019ve never see writing like this before.\u201d She says, \u201cCool, let me see.\u201d You say, she then hands you the book, \u201cWow me neither, but for some reason I think I understand it.\u201d You say pointing it out to her, \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s nothing but weird symbols?\u201d she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I could read it, it\u2019s just like my brain naturally understands it.\u201d You say, \u201cHere try again, but don\u2019t try to read it just look at it.\u201d You say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand her the book and she stares at the page, at first it is sarcastically as though she was just humoring you, but then she her expression turned serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way you\u2019re right.\u201d She says as she turns the page, \u201cBut how is that possible, what does it say?\u201d you ask, \u201cWell in best place to start is the beginning, let\u2019s see what the first page says.\u201d She says, \u201cGood idea.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lays the book onto the coffee table and flips to the first page. The two of you then begin reading, or at least understanding what it the symbols mean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the two of you silently sit back on the couch, \u201cWait are we sure this thing isn\u2019t fiction?\u201d you ask, \u201cWell we just \u2018read\u2019 a book in a language we have never seen and since we found this in an old abandoned house I doubt this is the latest technology.\u201d She says, \u201cSo let\u2019s see if I\u2019m getting this right. It\u2019s says that this book is not magic, and the reason we can naturally understand it is because it is written in the original language.\u201d You say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I got to and that this book contains knowledge that has been past down since \u2018the beginning.\u2019 To preserve that which has been lost to time and legend.\u201d She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah are we sure this isn\u2019t fiction cause this sounds like an awesome movie.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I agree.\u201d She says, \u201cSo let\u2019s see what sort of lost knowledge this thing possesses?\u201d you say picking up the book and flipping the page. \u201cOkay let\u2019s see, trading bodies?\u201d you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait really let me see?\u201d she says, the two of you then quickly read the entire first chapter. \u201cYeah that\u2019s what it says alright.\u201d She says, \u201cIt says that human beings can naturally exchange bodies.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it says that the soul is what is important and the body is its home, so a bodies original soul does have presidency over it, but under the right circumstances two people can trade bodies.\u201d She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo all the movies are wrong? They came up with magic and technology but they never considered two people could just agree to do it?\u201d you say laughing <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess then turns to you with a big smile on her face, \u201clet\u2019s try it!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cWait what?\u201d you say, \u201cLet\u2019s try to switch bodies.\u201d She says, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d You say, \u201cYea I am come on.\u201d She says excitedly, \u201cCome on it\u2019ll be fun, now let\u2019s see it saw that we just need to agree to the terms, you know how long, or what we would have to do while in the others body. \u201cNo way.\u201d You say, \u201cOh come on, just to see if it works.\u201d She says pouting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh alright, how about this, we\u2019ll flip a coin and you call it in the air, if your right we swap for one minute, deal?\u201d She says smiling as she pulls a quarter out of her pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then tosses it in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeads.\u201d You say causally, she catches it and places it on the top of her hand, \u201cHeads it is.\u201d She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly what you\u2019re looking at changes, it was like switching from one channel to the next. One moment you were looking at Jesse and the next you\u2019re looking at the coin on your now manicured hand! You\u2019re both speechless that it actually worked, even though you knew exactly what had just happened you still didn\u2019t want to believe it, so you rushed to the closest mirror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat body do you see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Okay now up until this point I haven\u2019t given a physical description of either of them. So now you can decide what you and Jess look like. Please use pictures if possible.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright all my beloved readers and writers, as you have all noticed I have been revising all of my stories. Now even though this is one of my more recent items, I\u2019ve saved it for last so that I could rename it and expand on the basic premise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally this story was about the \u201cTag you\u2019re it\u201d style body swap. But I have decided to make things more interesting by coming up with and allowing my writers to come up with some original body swap methods. And keep in mind that I am not saying that these are all original ideas for transformations but I know that I haven\u2019t found them on this site yet. Unlike the standard; remote swap, body swap machine, website, witch, amulet, random, or one of my favorites someone somehow has control over another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example:<br>\r\n1. The idea of \u201cSwitch\u201d or \u201cTag you\u2019re it\u201d is that two people create an agreement that allows them to trade bodies simply by saying the trigger word. <br>\r\n2. And the other idea which inspired me to expand this story is \u201cBody Bet\u201d which is similar to \u201cTag your it\u201d except two people make a bet and wager their bodies for a period of time on the outcome.<br>\r\n3. And if you can think of any new ideas that you would like to see feel free to post and ill work with you to make it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut regardless of how the swap works the idea is that you stumble onto some sort of text that reveals to you the lost art of trading bodies. And another original idea I want to introduce is that what you find isn\u2019t a spell book, in fact it specifically states that magic is not involved, and that body trading is a natural thing that human beings have always been able to do. The truth was simply forgotten with time as it faded into obscurity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo depending on the circumstances, once you and another person discover how to trade bodies it soon becomes a competition to see you can swap the other into the worse situation or winning the bet and swap with the other person so that they have to do something the other doesn\u2019t want to such as a doctor\u2019s appointment, work, school, jail, being sick/hung-over, at a restaurant holding a bill with no money, at the beach in a string bikini, ext.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pretty much anything goes but try and keep it relevant to the idea, and please:<br>\r\n1. When adding content make it meaningful and try to make it at least a solid paragraph, if it\u2019s just pointless fillers it\u2019s gone. <br>\r\n2. No mental changes, if he\u2019s not mentally there to react to the situation what\u2019s the point?<br>\r\n3. No gay stuff, even if a guy is technically a girl, he\u2019s still a guy, so no willing attraction to guys<br>\r\n4. And with the new male attention that comes with female body, no friends falling in love with him, and no rape, they can hit on him, flirt, and sexually harass him but if it crosses the line it\u2019s gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease keep in mind that none of my stories are meant to be about sex or playing with the new body so keep it to a minimum, and you aren\u2019t supposed to be enjoying this <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I want to see my stories grow but if I\u2019m the only one writing it\u2019s no fun. So if you have any comments or suggestions please feel free to send me a message, I would be more than happy to take requests. So please add, and help me make this story a success.<br>\r\n</td>",
