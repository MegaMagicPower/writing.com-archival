The last thing he remembered was sitting at home enjoying a nice chili dog, and the next thing he knew he was here. He stood up and surveyed the room. It looked like a large living room with a TV in the center and an arrangement of couches, spacious enough to sit at least 20.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever something was off. Sonic went over to the coffee table and tried to lift the book on top of it, however it wouldn't budge. Nor would anything for that matter. All of the objects looked like they were there only for presentations sake. \"What is going on here?\" He asked himself as he walked to the other side of the room where he saw a figure slouched over in a recliner near an artificial Fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails!\" Sonic said as he rushed and shook Tails in an attempt to wake him up. After a few good shakes, Tails opens his eyes. \"S-Sonic?\" He then yawns \"Where are we? And what do you have on your neck?\" Tails pointed to a metal band around the Hedgehogs neck. \"Huh? I didn't even notice this.\" Sonic said, attempting to take it off. \"I can't remove it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails got up from the chair. \"Let me try. He reached up to Sonic's neckband, but stopped when he noticed his friend pointing at him. Tails moved his hands to where Sonic was pointing and felt a collar on himself as well. \"GET IT OFF!\" The fox began to panic pulling the neckband as hard as he could, but to no avail. Suddenly out of nowhere.<i><b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was slapped in the face fell to the ground, and when he looked up, he saw Sonic  with his arm still frozen from the slap. Both of their eyes were in shock. \"... Tails I'm so sorry.\" Sonic reached down to pick him up. \"I don't know what happened, one second I'm trying to get this off... then... then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You lost control of your body?\"</i> An ominous voice came from the TV near the couches. The two looked at each other and then headed over to the TV to see who was talking. However all they could see was static, but the voice continued to talk. <i>\"Why yes that is exactly what happened. Those collars you're wearing allow remote access to your bodies functionality. Now why don't you take a seat, and I can tell you why you're all here?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance bud, we're leaving.\" Sonic replied to the voice, cracking his knuckles. However against his own will he felt himself moving towards the couch and taking a seat across from Tails, who had decided to follow of his own free will. The Hedgehog scowled, seeing that he could lose control of his body at a moments notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that wasn't so hard.\" The voice said. <i>\"I think this will be a grand experiment don't you think? Having you all locked up down here. With only the entire facility at your whim\".</i> Tails looked up and asked. \"The whole facility?\" The voice laughed and continued <i>\"Yes the WHOLE Facility. It's completely self sufficient. You'll have all the food, bedding, hygiene and everything else you'd need to survive. But you won't just be able to survive. You can thrive in here as well. There are so many objects for your amusement down here...\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Sonic asked suspiciously, but an answer never came. The TV turned off. \"I guess we'll have to figure out on our own.\" Tails said, getting up from the couch. Sonic got up after him and retorted \"Seriously?.... Fine. You go take a tour. I'm going to look for a way out.\" The two left the room and ventured off into separate corridors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does the Observer Follow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sonic's quest led him to what looked like the bathroom of the facility. Showers that resembled ones seen at a gym lined the two side walls, while in the back were several toilets with only a glass door separating it from the rest of the bathroom. \"Not much for privacy are they\" Sonic said to himself as he looked for some sort of duct in the room to escape from, but there was nothing there. \"Of course it wouldn't be that easy\"  He then walked over to the toilets to see if there was a vent above them. \"Are you kidding me?\" Sonic said leaving the bathroom without a lead, only to see a familiar Echinda at the entrance, wearing the same collar he and Tails had on as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're here too?\" Knuckles asked rhetorically. Sonic's ears perked \"Wait, who else is here? I thought it was just me and Tails until I saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, Rouge, Shadow, Sally, Bunnie, and Silver are who I've seen so far... So with Tails and you as well. That makes nine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, the more the merrier.\" Sonic chuckled. \"Any luck finding a way out?\" The Echinda shook his head. \"Nobody is able to do a thing. I can't pierce the walls to dig out. Bunnie can't break them down either, and Teleporting has failed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh what is this thing made-\" Sonic felt a strange sensation flow through his body, he looked down and saw himself fully erect. \"Aww geez\". He attempted to cover himself but couldn't move his arms. His cheeks went red exposing himself to Knuckles like this. Knuckles however had already turned away from him. \"I know it's that voice controlling you. He stopped Shadows heart for a bit when he went out of control and attempted to blast his way out of here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles started to walk away but he was then stopped in his tracks. Sonic heard him mutter \"Shit.\" Before he saw Knuckles make a dive at him. Sonic Dodged out of the way just in time. \"Sonic this isn't!-\" \"I KNOW KNUCKLEHEAD!\" the Hedgehog replied as he saw Knuckles Lunge at him again and this time pin him to the ground, and position his lips over Sonics erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fuck No!\" Knuckles struggled, fighting as best he could to prevent himself from giving his first blowjob. \"I gotcha!\" Sonic shouted, raising his feet and kicking Knuckles into the bathroom and locking the door. \"Thanks Sonic...\" Knuckles Panted, having averted a small disaster, only to have his heart sink when he heard the door unlock and this time Sonic didn't have time to react once he was back in control of his body again. Knuckles was on him and bobbing his mouth up and down on Sonic's dick, cursing up a muffled storm, and pinning Sonic's legs to the ground with his fists. While Sonic normally wouldn't reject something like this. Under this condition he tried with all of his might to push Knuckles off of him, but once he felt the orgasm hit. It was too late. He saw white globs fall from Knuckles mouth as he quickly got up and started spitting out everything that he could. Knuckles pointed at Sonic. \"Don't you fucking tell ANYONE about this....\" Sonic shook his head, and Knuckles stormed out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does the Observer follow next?</span></div></div>",

The fox thinks to himself \"They should have quite a bit in here.\" He opens the doors and sees Amy standing in front of him, trying to close her mouth as she raises a glass to it. Inside the glass is a mixture that anyone could see is not natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turns her eyes to see Tails standing there in shock. \"TAILS HELP M-\" She yells out to him, but her body took control of her distraction and shoved the vial into her mouth, ingesting about half of it before Tails snatched it away from her. Amy stood in a daze. Tails helped move her over to an examination bench on the other side of the room so she could sit down. \"What was in that?\" He asked her, looking for a label on the glass, but not finding anything. He looked up at her, she seemed okay, but confused, and like Sonic and himself, had a collar around her neck as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here alone?\" He asked her. Amy shook her head. \"No. There are more with me. Knuckles, Rouge, Shadow, Sally, Bunnie, and Silver. We heard more voices, and this place is really big, so there may be more people.\" She said trying to force a smile. Tails nodded. \"It was just Sonic and me in one room. I didn't know who else was there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy perked up. \"Sonic's here too? That's great. I know he'll help us... help us...\" She began to get woozy and falling over. \"AMY!\" Tails shouted grabbing her and laying her down on the bed. She was struggling with something. He looked at the vial. \"That has to be it\" He said to himself. He ran over to the vial and drank the remainder of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes grew wide when he realized what had just happened. He'd lost control of his body again. Tails tried to get up but everything was dizzy. His vision was getting blurry, and he felt achy all over. And before he could react. He was passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails, Tails!\" He heard his name being called out, as well as the all too familiar shaking from before. He opened his eyes and saw Amy. But she was different, She was bigger. Amy's chest had increased several cup sizes. Tails tried to look away so that he wouldn't stare, and got up as quickly as he could and almost fell in the process, like he hadn't walked in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and began looking around. He and Amy were still alive, that was good. But when he looked down, the floor looked alot farther away from him as it did before. \"I'm taller?\" Tails asked himself, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're older\" Amy interjected. \"When I woke up I found this.\" She handed him a label from one of the cabinets that were filled with a various assortment of glasses filled with all sorts of weird chemicals. Tails looked at the label and saw that it read. \"Age Progression. Five Years\". He looked at himself. His frame was bigger for sure, and his proportions were almost equal to Sonic and Knuckles, while Amy's figure had expanded in areas to get her appearance closer to Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it in the space where I was forced to take the bottle from. I guess now we're as old as the others now.\" She said to Tails. \"Now come on. Lets get out of here. I saw Knuckles pass by here while you were still unconscious, he was cursing like Crazy, I think we should find him.\" Tails Nods and the two make their way out of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does the Observer Follow Next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does the Observer Follow Next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>\"Augh!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn anguished cry echoed around the room, it's origin, the scaly green hide of Vector the Crocodile, who had just smashed his poor hand against a steel wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crocodile leapt about, shaking his bruised fist in pain. \"I <i>told</i> you not to try and punch through that wall\" chastised his nearest friend, Espio the Chameleon, who was looking on with an expression mixed between detachment and annoyance. The crocodile stopped hopping about and glared back his associate, \"Yeah, well at least I'm <i>trying</i> something to escape!\" he shouted back, before tugging, with his uninjured hand, on the large neckband outfitted over his throat for what had to be the fiftieth time since they'd woken up in this strange place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am trying <i>something</i>\" Espio coldly replied, \"I'm observing and planning our escape instead of rushing into idiocy.\" The purple reptile resuming his meditation stance and deliberately tuned out his distracting partner. Vector just grunted, displeased at his lack of sympathy, \"Bah, how was I supposed to know there was a damn metal wall hiding behind this flimsy paper facade\" he muttered to himself, glancing across the oriental style room they currently occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the other rooms in this twisted labyrinth, this room looked normal at first glance, like a Chun-nan style dojo complete with training mats, burning incense, jade statues and large metal gongs. But on closer inspection everything proved to be remarkably fake; made of plastic or simply a cardboard cutout like the weapon stand in the center of the room. There was a hole in the sh\u014dji style paper-wall where Vector had struck, and if you looked through it you'd see the slightly scuffed metal wall that revealed this place for what it truly was, a prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room two different individuals were discussing things, \"How do vous theenk Eggman... or whoever thiz madmon iz, even caught us Rootur?\" Asked the nervous voice belonging to gallant swordsman and Freedom Fighter, Antoine D'Coolette, who was presently shaking in his boots. \"I don't think it's Eggman, maybe he used some sort of voice masking program... but this doesn't feel like his style\" responded Rotor Walrus, the buff inventor tapping his foot in frustration and deep contemplation, everyone here just having heard the same monologue from The Observe the other groups got a few minutes ago. \"We must have been drugged somehow, since none of us seem to have any memories of how we got here. I think... I need to find some parts and maybe I can build something to contact the outside world, contact Sonic... unless he's trapped down here too\" he said with a gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww <b>shaddup</b> you two!\" The vitriolic outburst coming from none other than resident outlaw and treasure hunter, Nack the Weasel, the final member of this small group. The violet colored mustelid was pacing around the room, cursing that they had left him his guns, but no ammunition. He was freaking out a bit over the fact he'd lost control over his body only a little while ago as a \"demonstration\" to the group of The Observers' power; by having him involuntarily suck his thumb and cry like a baby. How humiliating! He gritted his teeth and kicked over another \"jade\" dragon statue, it bounced away like a inflatable balloon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Freedom Fighters just gave him a disapproving stare, ordinarily they'd be trying to arrest him, but now wasn't the time for fighting between themselves. \"...rrgh, I wish I could be knowing zhat moi honey is in safety\" Twan said breaking the silence, wondering about the state of his wife. \"I'm sure she's fine Ant, that girl can handle herself\" reassured Rotor with a pat on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So should we leave?\" Vector asked aloud to anybody who would listen to him, \"Try exploring more of this un-fun fun-house?\" They had already been a few rooms, waking up in a padded cell of sorts, meeting Nack and Rotor in some sort of observatory with a fake skyline drawn on the roof, a long hallway and finding Antoine in this dojo. \"Oui, this place has nothing to gain here\", \"Affirmative\" the Freedom Fighters replied, but Nack didn't seem so eager. \"What's the point?! We're trapped like rats and you want to play into this sicko's mousetrap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not going to get any more free standing around here.\" Vector snapped back, crossing his arms. He'd actually be delighted to ditch Nack, but they needed the manpower for whatever they were going to face (and someone to set off traps). Nack was about to say something rude in response, leaning up against the wall to perch himself for the perfect snappy retort, but to his surprise when he put his weight down on the wall a hidden door flung open, toppling him over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Vector marveled, \"Secret passageways! Maybe this leads the way out!\" he yelled as everyone crowded around the entrance. The door led to a tunnel that looked significantly different from the other places they'd explored so far, while the other rooms had sort of a dollhouse feel to them, this passageway looked kind of like a \"backstage area\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, I'm not sure...\" Espio said wearily, \"Maybe they wanted us to find this? It could lead to danger. I think we should search the other main rooms first, see if we can find anyone else stuck here\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much Espio. And this place is like a crazy mansion, it could take <i>days</i> to fully explore the place. We need to take this opportunity and break out now!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few moments of squabbling, eventually the Chameleon relented and the team decided the best course of action was to investigate this hidden passage. All except Nack, who outright refused to go anywhere, \"Nope, I'm not going down some dark tunnel where anything could jump me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you big baby\" Vector criticized, hand-waving his protests as he trudged off first down the dark tunnel, strewn with pipes and hanging electrical wire. Espio followed behind him, and then Antoine, who was practically being pushed down the path by Rotor, the skittish coyote full of misgivings just like the weasel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light grew dimmer, the group striked up conversation, \"So eh, if the controlling person can move our bodies like the puppets, why would he allow us to travel down this path I am wondering?\" Antoine questioned, wishing he still had his saber on his belt for protection, \"Well, if I hazard to speculate,\" Rotor replied brushing away a cobweb, \"if this IS off grounds maybe his collars don't work here? Off the grid and all that.\" But the mechanic didn't sound too convinced with his own reasoning and Espio's worries that they were walking into a trap only increased with every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudging deeper into the tunnel they ran into several abrupt twist and turns, eventually they reached a junction, a Y shaped intersection. \"Oh great, what now leader?\" Espio grumbled, \"Quiet! Uhhh, we'll just have to split up, you two take the left path, we'll take the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Split up? Non! The splitting up iz the first step unto getting the bad end, haven't you watched the horror movies?\" Rotor laughed at his friends superstition, \"This isn't a movie Twan, we'll cover more ground. Come on.\" Grabbing the coyote by the paw and pulling him along, whining all the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained was Espio and Vector now. The ninja was not sure how good this splitting up idea was going to be, but it was pointless arguing it now. He turned around to take Vector's hand... until he grabbed air and realized Vector was suddenly not with him either. \"Hey! Vector! This isn't the time to fool around!\" Espio yelled into the darkness, but there was no response. The start of a cold sweat trickled down the Chameleon's forehead, it would have been impossible for the Crocodile to sneak past him back to the dojo, so he must have gone down the right path without waiting for him, right? \"Shit, this is a bad idea\" he said to himself as he followed along, senses on full alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding another corner, a beam of light flooded a section of the passageway. It looked like it was coming from a window! Espio rushed towards it, hoping it was to the outside, but was disappointed to find that the light was actually coming from some sort of bathroom. He quickly deduced he was actually looking through a one-way mirror into the bathroom (where it looked like someone had recently had a scuffle) that was probably used to perv on the occupants. What kind of weird house was this? \"Vector?!\" he called out again, hoping for a response but not expecting any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead there was a robotic clanking sound. Espio froze, there was something here, but he couldn't see it. The unnatural sound was getting louder, a clicking and shuffling, but no matter where he looked he couldn't find it. Until he realized it was above him, but too late, and a mechanical tentacle wrapped around Espio's body. The ninja struggled, trying to escape, trying to kick out the window and retreat into the bathroom, but it seemed to be made of bulletproof glass. All he could do was squirm as another tentacle grasped around his wrist, pulling him upwards, leaving only tiptoes on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chameleon yelled out, in some pain, but mostly in fear. Maybe one of the other guys would come to help him? But as another vine like appendage wrapped around one of his foot, hope was quickly diminishing in Espio that he'd ever make it out alive, these things were so strong, they could rip him apart in seconds if they wanted too. <i>\"<b>-BZZT-</b> unauthorized access by test subject E-17, punishment and reconditioning protocol activated!\"</i> Wait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What the hell did they mean by that?\"</i> Espio thought, as he frantically struggled with his bindings with renewed vigor. Out of the corner of his eye he could see another robotic tentacle slide down the wall, but this one was different, pink colored and more \"fleshy\" looking than the others. Not wanting to find out what it does, with one last piece of effort he started to swing himself from side to side, hitting the walls of the narrow passageway and actually being able to use that to bounce into freedom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting a second the ninja leapt to the floor and prepared to run to the exit, but before he could take more than a few steps he suddenly stopped in his tracks. \"W-wha?!\" Espio cried, confused that his legs were disobeying him. He tried to turn invisible, but that didn't work either. The control ring, it was still in effect even behind the scenes! All the ninja could do was control his upper body, his legs just standing motionless, numb. \"Argh, this is not fair!\" he shouted, fearfully looking back to see the tentacles slowly approaching him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey coiled around him, his arms, his legs, hoisting him up in the air, now he was completely helpless. The pink tentacle slithered around and dragged over his body and face, it felt wet and cold. Espio shuddered, tears welling up in his eyes, he tried to yell out for help again, but that was the pink vine's cue, launching itself lightning fast into the ninja's mouth as soon as he opened it. Espio wailed round the pink member tip, gagging slightly as it invaded his personal space. He tried to spit it out, but once again the control was taken from his body, and he was forced to suck hard on the tubular appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle yellow cord like tentacles, dozens of them, suddenly descended from the ceiling. Espio hadn't even noticed them, he was so preoccupied with the pink tube in his mouth that when the tip of a yellow cord touched his skin he was utterly unprepared for the tiny electric shock that ran through him. It felt like a small zap of static electricity and Espio yelped, as best he could, but it was only seconds later until another little zap hit him, and then another. It didn't hurt so much as it was disorientating and uncomfortable. He guessed this was what the voice had meant about \"punishment\" as he writhed in his bonds, little shocks nipping him everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the shocks also had a different effect that Espio was not expecting, he was becoming aroused. Still sucking the thick, meaty, pink tube, Espio suddenly became aware of just how hard he was getting, his moderate sized member springing to life. This only encouraged the yellow vines, who redoubled their stinging lust shots, specifically targeting the Chameleon's aching privates. Espio moaned, each zap now actually giving him a little bit of pleasure with the pain; this was awful, this was humiliating, this felt really good! Already he was leaking pre, struggling reduced to a minimum, only twitching every once in a while at the tentacles worked their magic on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn such a short amount of time Espio's body and mind had built up an intolerable amount of need, need for release, need for more. The venom in his system was making him sweat and shiver, drool ran down his chin and the throbbing pink tentacle shamelessly plunged in and out of his face. He wanted to swallow more of that wet, sticky appendage. The ninja's brain was in meltdown mode, totally overwhelmed, until finally he came. An abnormally large load, coating all over his chest, in an orgasm that seemed to rolled on for over an agonizing minute. By the time it was over the yellow cords had retreated, and the pink tentacle stopped pumping. The binds loosened and Espio just lay there, panting and dazed until he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would be placed back in the facility, his sexual appetite permanently altered, it wouldn't be long before he'd need somebody else to bed with.  </span></div></div>",

Knuckles was strong, but Espio was crafty, crafty enough to...\"No.!\" Espio thought to himself, shaking his head. \"What am I thinking? I can't do this to Knuckles.... I won't allow it.\" He continued down the hall with him until he caught himself having the perverse thoughts again, and getting noticeably hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me. Please.\" Espio stopped and headed towards the restroom. Hiding his member from Knuckles. \"....Nature Calls. I'll find my way to the dining hall.\" Espio's shallow lie was easily betrayed by his clear struggling to stay focused, however Knuckles fell for the lie, or perhaps didn't care. \"Alright. See you there.... I'm not going in there\". Knuckles then took off leaving Espio alone. He turned the corner and saw the open bathroom, and rushed to one of the stalls, entered, and pinned his legs against it, preventing anyone from entering. Once his position was secured he wasted no time furiously pleasuring himself. A Hobby he worked his life to avoid, but now there was no other way. The Heat he felt was immense, and this was the only way to make it better. He panted and moaned for a good several minutes until he felt the buildup begin to reach a boiling point. He could hardly wait to release the lust that filled him, but something seemed off. His arm felt tired, but it kept going as strong as it had been when he started. He saw his hand tile his member towards his face and he realized. \"No... No....\" He wasn't in control of his body, and after muttering those words he was unable to close his mouth. \"This is fucking disgusting!\" He thought to himself, trying his hardest to free himself from the control, but he had no time. He quickly erupted an unusual amount of himself into his mouth  and all over his face. The Heat he had been feeling instantly drained from his body and he felt like himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Espio gagged and started wiping the excess off furiously once he got his body back. Making his way to the sink and rinsing off his entire body so nobody would be able to tell what had transpired. He took a deep breath before he was ready to head out again. The heat came back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Halfway to the exit, Espio stopped in his tracks and cringed, that familiar warmth creeping back into him and playing tricks on his body. Only faint; a slight tingling, beckoning sensation originating from his crotch; yet slowly but surely he could feel the heat growing stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned a pale shade as the blood ran from his face, both in shock and apprehension. <i>How could he already be aroused again??</i> he desperately questioned, perching on the sink for support as his legs still felt weak from his previous orgasm. The purple Chameleon closed his eyes and tried to take back control of the situation; drawing upon his years of ninja training and discipline, he resolved, <b>this time</b> he would not give in to theses corrupt urges. But already, unprompted lewd thoughts were sneaking into his subconscious. Espio blushed, dots of sweat beading on his forehead. <i>\"Think unsexy thoughts!...\"</i> he mentally commanded himself, <i>\"Think... Big in a bikini, urgh... or Vector's stinky feet...\"</i> Shaky, Espio pushed himself up off the sink and resumed his walk to the Dining Room, the other were still waiting for him, maybe they could help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudging down the latest of several incredibly similar looking hallways, the Chameleon quickly realized that he had no clue where this meeting place was and finding it was going to be no easy task. <i>It almost seemed like the rooms were shifting around.</i> All the while, the distraction in his loins was intensifying. How he wished he could just slump down in the hall and jack-off... <b>No!</b> He wouldn't betray his ninja code <i>twice</i> in one evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was no point hiding it, he could already feel another boner erecting. Breathing headily, he took a lust-glazed glance down at the offending appendage. It was half-hard, although otherwise appearing perfectly normal, what <b>was</b> unusual were his noticeably larger balls, which had swollen up to baseball size. Espio shuddered and unquestioningly gave them a squeeze with his palm, not even sure if he was doing this of his own free will or being taken control of again - frankly he wasn't even sure he cared at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more squeezes the ninja realized what he was doing and snapped his arm away, with great reluctance diverting his attention elsewhere. \"I can't...\" he muttered to himself, turning to walk down another identical corridor, \"Vector! Knuckles! Hey anybody? Where are you?!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the Dining Hall, two irate hedgehogs were bitterly arguing over who had the better plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>stupid</i> Shadow! We can't just wait around here to be played with like a bunch of puppets! We've got to escape, now, tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're not <i>listening</i> Sonic! <i>Nobody</i> wants to get out of this more than I do\", shouted Shadow, hand gently rubbing his chest area, \"But we've checked around the facility and it's sealed tight, so unless you've got a chaos emerald hidden somewhere up your glove; there <i>is</i> no exit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a good reason to stop searching for one!\" Sonic shot back, tapping his fingers on the large ornate table annoyed. Shadow grunted dismissively, \"Don't you get it? Even if there was an <i>open door</i> to the outside world it would be completely <i>useless</i> until we could find a way to disable these damn neckbands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what it comes down to isn't it, you're just chickening out because the bad guy used his shock collar on you. We can figure that out when it comes to it, that's what a hero does!\" Shadow stood up fuming, half-considering punching Sonic in the face for being stupid, though that was hardly an irregular desire for the the black hedgehog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it doesn't seem like they've kidnapped Omega,\" Rouge chimed in, \"so it should only be a matter of time till he tracks us down and blows a crater size hole in this operation\" she said hopefully, trying to defuse the situation. \"I'm with Shadow, I've slept though worse prison cells in my time - at least this one has a pool.\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We can't afford to slack off\" Sally interjected, \"this place is not a beach resort. We need to organize a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We</i> don't need to do anything,\" Rouge replied coldly, \"not with <i>you</i> anyway. How do we know one of you guys didn't trap us all down here anyway? Any one of you could be pulling the strings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked shocked and indignant that Rouge could suggest such a thing, \"Oh, and like G.U.N. isn't a prime suspect for pulling this sort of shit? They have the resources.\" The buxom bat just rolled her eyes, \"All I know is the only people I trust down here is Team Dark, and that's me and Shadow.\" Sally glared daggers at the pair, \"Fine! Whatever, be a -\" Just before she could continue that sentence and possible start a cat fight, Tails and Amy burst into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, I'll never get used to you two looking like that.\" Sonic uttered, still shocked his lil buddy was now as old, or older, than he was. \"So any luck on finding more captives, or an <i>escape</i>?\" The pair sadly shook their heads no. \"I think there are more people in here, but this place is like a maze, I swear I've gone through the same rooms from fifty different doors...\" Sonic sighed and rested his head in his hands. \"This blows... there isn't even anything to eat around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yeah.\" He said in a rather cautious tone. Under Normal Circumstances he would be happy to see a giant platter of Chili Dogs, but here it was very suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bastard Upstairs must have heard you yapping and felt pity on...\" Shadow started to say mocking the hedgehog, but he immediately passed out. Sonic did a doubletake when he saw this happen, then spun around more as everyone else in the room did the same. All Collapsing to the ground without any notice. \"Tails! Sal! Amy!\" Sonic ran over to check on all three of them, and took a deep breath when he realized they were simply sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over to the door to go get some help, but his body had other plans. He went to the door and locked it from his side, preventing anyone on the outside from entering. \"Whats this?\" Sonic spoke to the invisible controller. \"Just want some private time between us huh? Could just come down here yourself and talk!\" He was trying to put up an act, but he knew that he was going to be forced to do something he wouldn't like very soon. And once he sat in front of the Chili Dogs and shoved it in his mouth he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" \"You think this will...\" \"Be a problem...\" He spoke between Dogs. \"I eat at least ten of these for breakfast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he finished bragging, that a second ceiling section lowered, with just as many Chili Dogs as the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit\" Sonic thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like hours of nothing but him stuffing himself with Chili Dogs. New ones kept getting shoved in as the old ones were still being swallowed. Bits of chili were landing on his chest and a small potbelly that had appeared after the two platters. His gloves and shoes were stained beyond repair, and he felt ready to burst at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sonic finished the Final one, he just wanted to lie and sleep with his other friends, but he was forced to get up and walk over to trash bin. Feeling Disgustingly bloated, feeling his small belly and padded frame jiggle slightly with every step. He wasn't fat by any means, but pudgy wasn't an alternative he was happy with either. Once he reached the Trash Bin he opened it up and carelessly threw his gloves and shoes into it, and upon entering, both were instantly vaporized. Had he not been in so much pain, he would have freaked out over the loss of his iconic shoes, but here. He just wanted the pain in his gut to stop, and once he regained control of his body. He realized he had made it all the way to one of the beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked out the door and took a few steps to try and get the others, but he was too tired and miserable to muster up the strength, and plopped into the bed. Ending the First Day in Their New Life.</span></div></div>",

Rouge opened her mouth to scream, but Espio's reflexes used the opening to shove a vial of fluid in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge could only struggle and try her hardest to not swallow. She knew Espio was under the Masterminds control and wasn't controlling his own body.... That is until she felt herself lose control and swallow the entire contents. Rouge involuntarily started coughing as she looked at Espio, who was almost in a feral state, and acting of his own free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspio moved her to the ground and shoved his dick in her mouth, and as much as Rouge wanted to just bite it, her body wouldn't let her, and she began sucking as she felt her body change. As Rouge was on her hands and knees sucking Espio off, she felt her breasts expand rapidly, as they grew heavier and heavier on her, while her rear and thighs also ballooned out, filling out nicely. The Chameleon wasted no time ferociously groping her rear for his own pleasure as he grew closer and closer to climax. When he finally ejaculated into her mouth. Rouge's breasts were bigger than her head, and her bottom matched that, giving her an extreme hourglass figure. As the final stream of semen erupted from Espio and hit Rouge in the face. He returned to his normal state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... Wh.... Rouge.....\" Espio stood up, still dizzy from everything. He stumbled a few feet while Rouge also regained her composure and cleaned her face off. \"I-I'm so sorry...... I didn't....\" Espio looked down once again at his erect penis and screamed in terror and ran out of the room cursing. Rouge lay there, resting on her massive breasts for several minutes, until through no will of her own she stood up with no problem. The Chemicals she drank must have enhanced her spine as well, so that she could at least move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge went to the bathroom to get some mouthwash to get the taste from her mouth out.</span></div></div>",

While already most of their companions seemed to have given up finding a way out, or having been incapacitated like Sonic with his sickeningly bloated belly; Vector, Antoine and Rotor were keeping vigilant and searching for answers... or something like that, as only one of them was a true detective, and a rather lousy one at that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mon dieu! It feels like we're walking in the circles <i>Rootur</i>, who was the <b>fuel</b> who said we should go searching though more of these hopeless rooms?\" lamented the orange coyote, who walked extra close to his burly buddies just in case anything jumped out and attacked them. \"Uh, if I recall right, it was <u>you</u> Ant\" replied the equally frustrated purple walrus, rolling his eyes at his fellow Freedom Fighter's whining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector was in the lead, stern expression on his face with eyes affixed to the mauve carpet, giving the impression he might be following something big, perhaps mysterious footprints of some kind? Or a trail of blood... honestly he had nothing, but <i>someone</i> in the group had to act serious-like as if they had an evidence trail, and since Espio was missing. Again. It was gonna be him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crocodile huffed in dismay, he'd lost him in the tunnels yesterday and he'd felt bad about it ever since. Even after they found him, during that brief time they got to spend together, Vector could tell something was wrong, he was just so jittery. Yet before the Croc could ask any questions the ninja ran off with his tail between his legs. Talk about unreliable in a crisis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, clearing his mind for the task at hand, \"Yo, you think we have a chance of finding where Rouge stashed my chains? No way would that gold digger dispose of them.\"<br>\r\n\"Vector, I'm telling you she didn't have free will at the time,\" Rotor replied wearily, \"and even if she did when she stole all our clothes I don't think your 'chains' are exactly her style\"<br>\r\n\"Oui, she would most likely melt them down to make the gold rings\" <br>\r\n\"<u>Not helping Twan</u>\"<br>\r\n\"Gah, if that bitch did that I'll destroy her nightclub when we get out of here!\" Vector shouted with rage, fist shaking in the air. \"<i>-sigh-</i> if we get out of here\" said Rotor glumly,<br>\r\n\"Do not being the depressed Rootor, we will find the way out\" Antoine reassured, \"...and in the meantime we are having a free pass to see all the girls topless no, eh?\" <br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're such a perv Ant\"<br>\r\n\"Peh, I am always forgetting you, as they say, swing for the other team. It must be boring for you since we male mobians always walk around naked anyway\" <br>\r\n\"What about Bunnie, doesn't she get annoyed at you staring at other girls?\"<br>\r\n\"We have an an understanding, look but no touch, I will always be faithful to mon ch\u00e9ri\"<br>\r\n\"Yo, you two quit squabbling!\" Vector interrupted, \"<i>I think I hear something</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the sound of a low buzzing noise was in the air. It source? Apparently from a inconspicuous room up just ahead, notable only for having it's door slightly ajar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group slowed to a stop as they approached the open door, darkness covering the mysterious room from what they could see, in sharp contrast to the brightly lit corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of hesitation between the three of them, until Vector ultimately stepped forward to enter. Inside, he searched for a light-switch but found nothing, the only illumination the room offered was from the many monitor screens inhabiting the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a computer lab of some kind, full of large servers, big complex machines and draped in blue glow that made the place seem sinister. Only one workstation seemed to have a mouse and keyboard. Rotor, the ever inquisitive tech head, rushed over to the computers, eager to find out what they were for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, check this out!\" he yelled after a few moments sussing it out. Antoine and Vector cautiously approached, weary to see the nerd stuff Rotor was suddenly fascinated in. Looking over his shoulders they could see a bunch of pictures and names, and lots of other random information that wasn't comprehensible to non-robotic beings. At first glance it appeared to be a list of profiles on all the captives held in the facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge's file was selected, and next to it in big bold letters was written, <b>BIMBO, SLUT</b> next to a bunch of random data and other weird junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector laughed, \"<b>Ha</b>, I guess they got Rouge's personality right! Hey, wait! What's mine say?\" he asked, suddenly interested, shoving forwards to see better. Slightly annoyed at being shoved aside, Rotor nevertheless pulled up Vectors. Next to his was written, <b>FATTY</b> and Rotor had to resist the urge to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector snarled, \"Wha? I'm no fatty! I'm all <b>brawn</b>!\" he declared, flexing his biceps for emphasis. Although as if by coincidence his stomach growled at the same time... well he had skipped breakfast after all. \"And Sally is no bimbo\" Rotor said confused as he clicked on her picture next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say about moi??\" Antoine asked dramatically; snatching the mouse away from Rotor, much to the walrus' annoyance, and selecting his own profile pic. In big block letters the word <b>STUD</b> was displayed. Antoine's face blushed at the description, \"Eh?... Well... can't say that they're wrong!\" Antoine said grinning. Rotor just groaned , as if Twan needed any more reasons to feed his ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they visited Espio's profile, it also said Stud inexplicably, then Sonic's which had Fatty. And Knuckles had Slut. Rotor frowned, trying to think of any sensible reason a room would contain a database of profiles with widely inaccurate and kind of insulting names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was another rumble from Vectors stomach, much louder this time. \"Oooh man, I really think I need to eat something.\" he whined, placing his hands on his gut. There was a quizzical expression on Rotor's face, \"<i>Hmm</i>... Vector, let me follow you to the kitchen. I think I might have a <i>theory</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coming Twan?\" Rotor asked as he got up to leave, but the soldier was still interested in this weird machine that called him a stud. \"Huh? Oh no, merci, but I'll stay. I wish to be reading what the rest of the profiles say.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just don't tell me what mine says.\" was the last thing Rotor request as he exited the room with Vector.</span></div></div>",

Each one listing several incorrect labels alongside everyone here, as well as some names of others they had not encountered. He wondered where they could be, but stopped instantly once he saw Bunnie's name with <b>BREEDER, SLUT </b>under the listings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mon dieu! Zis cannot stand!\" He grabbed her file and crumbled it up, before throwing it in the trash can. \"Dishonoring her name... I will NOT STAND FOR ZIS!\" He said drawing out his sword, knowing that whoever was controlling them had to be watching. He went over to several of the computers and attempted to break them to get the attention of their captor, but all Antoine managed to do was hurt his fist, his wailing agony for some reason did alert the mastermind, and he saw a door on the far side of the room open, but inside the room there was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh....\" Antoine froze. \"I suppose, zat I will leave you with a warning...adieu...\" He turned to try and leave, wanting to back out, but his body would not let him. \"Non... Nonononononon......\" Antoine started to panic as step by step he moved closer to the room. His bluff was being called, and now he was being taken into the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his constant whimpering Antoine made it into the unusually empty room, with only a small vertical table, and a cabinet in the corner. His body moved towards the Cabinet despite his many please and apologies to the unknown entity controlling his body. Antoined reached into the cabinet and pulled out an empty syringe and a bottle. This sent him into an even further panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! ANYTHING BUT ZAT! I 'AVE A FEAR OF NEEDLES!\" His mouth continued to act of his own free will, while his body filled the syringe up, and injected it into his arm, warranting an exaggerated scream coming from the coyote. The injection took a good 5 seconds to get the full amount into his body, and while Antoine was still woozy from his freakout, he moved over to the table, and had his arms and legs instantly strapped in. The sudden action brought him to his senses as he saw the table separate into a form of a body A separate platform for each limb, and it started moving and rotating, forcing Antoine's body to move in a way that he could only call a demented workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds of movement his body started burning and he felt sore all over as the chemicals he injected finally began to take effect. In almost no time he saw his arms get bigger, ripped with muscles, his chest expanded outwards into noticeable pecs, and a six pack formed underneath. Antoine was barely able to notice the immense muscle gain he was experiencing due to the sensations in his body. The whole thing he found was arousing... As he felt himself get hard, he felt something else strange. Something had attached itself to its member and exerting a pressure on it. Antoine moved his head down to look, and saw a capsule that was expanding in the shape of a balloon, and expanding along with it was his dick. As the seconds turned to minutes he saw it emerge from below him, and felt the added weight in his crotch. The combined forces, combined with the arousal led him to ejaculate instantly, forcing him into a relaxed sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Antoine awoke several hours later he was lying on the floor, on top of a hard warm pillar. He opened his eyes and saw he was facefirst with the tip of his penis, complete with a puddle of cum at the end. \"MON DIEU!\" Antoine shouted as he darted up, his hyper shaft whacking him in the head upon reaching his feet. Shaking his head and reassessing his situation. Antoine was flabbergasted to discover he now had the shape and stature of a bodybuilder that would put anyone he knew to shame. He wondered how he would even fit through the doorways due to how large his torso and arms were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, his penis which he had concealed barely after the clothes went missing was now impossible to hide. It was the length of his arm, and almost as wide. His sack wasn't left out either. In between his legs were two softball sized lumps barely concealed. He laughed to himself. \"Merci... if there was a trap to fall into, zis was not a bad one...\" Perhaps it was his titanlike physique that gave him confidence, or perhaps it was the chemicals effects, but Antoine showed no shame as he went back to rejoin the others and show off his new frame.</span></div></div>",

What could they do here? But me, I'm a wimp...\" He stopped at an intersection, looking around where to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of these halls look the same.\" Tails complained. \"I have no idea where I'm going...\" And on cue, Tails felt his body move on its own. Walking down the path like it knew where it was going. He gulped as he realized what was happening. \"Guess it's time to see what I can do...RIght?\" Tails let out a nervous chuckle, but as expected he heard no response from the Observer, so he stayed silent and let his body go where it wanted, and after many turns, it finally stopped in front of a familiar door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be it.\" The fox said looking around, and quietly entering. Not wanting anyone to catch him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he explored around the area he observed many tools and gadgets around the room, all for different purposes. \"This must be the on stop shop for all transformation needs... wow\". Tails looked around more until by chance he opened a cabinet and saw an array of flasks.\"Bingo\" He said, and he got down to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight Gain, Weight Loss, Gender Shift, Fertility, Monster... Tails read each and every label he saw and passed by, before finally stopping and picking an orange colored one. \"Strength. Here we go.\" He examined the back to see if there were any instructions on it, and sighed when there weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails... If you're going to be brave, you need to take some risks... That;s what they'd say.\" And with that he held the flask up to him lips and chugged the whole thing, and instantly stumbled back into a chair, feeling the instantaneous effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body began growing at a rapid pace, growing almost twice the height he was before. Tails gripped his head as it began swirling in pain, and losing concentration. Completely missing the expansion of his body into massive muscles all around, and several layers of fat on top of it to give him some extra girth. As Tails leaned forward, his enlarged fists caught him from falling forward as he stood on all fours, taking the posture of what appeared to be a gorilla. Tails brow furrowed as it began sticking out more and his mind became more and more clouded. He had no idea what was going on at the current moment, but he knew he enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Transformation halted as it finished. Tails breathed heavily and looked at himself. \"Me... Strong.\" Was all he could speak. \"Me very bigger\" Tails said looking at his new frame, which aside from the coloration and fox head and tail, almost appeared fully ape like. \"Tails go get Other!\" He ran towards the door and was stopped by the smaller frame blocking his exit. However instead of tilting his body like he would have done prior. Tails simply smashed the door and headed out, grunting along the way.</span></div></div>",

It was unusual to go slow like this, walking at only a leisurely pace, but the slight jiggling of his belly when he ran annoyed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ever-present feeling of being watched hung over him like a heavy blanket, and the feeling only intensified when he left the company of the group. He didn't want to listen to any more stupid ideas about <i>'embracing change'</i>, which was getting a lot of discussion with the other mobians after Antoine left. Sonic was perfect before! Or so he thought at least, the only change he wanted to make was to rearrange Shadow's dumb face for annoying him... and maybe turning Twan back from such a... Sonic's brain couldn't even stand to think about it. A mixture of disgust and... a little bit of envy, boiling up inside him when he thought about the goofy coyote. <i>Bleh</i>, even his musky smell still lingered in his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he'd gotten over his stomach ache, even the faintest tinges of hunger was returning to the pudgy hedgehog. Not that he planned to indulge that hunger any time soon, it was diet time until he returned to his original weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead there was a few clashing noises, Sonic quirked his eyebrow, it sounded like somebody was having trouble. \"<b>-rrgh-</b> get <u>off me!</u>\" a frustrated voice shouted, it sounded like Vector! Sonic hadn't seen him since morning, the crocodile was supposed to be looking for Espio wasn't he?? Sonic hasn't really been paying attention to who was doing what in the morning, when he was only focused on rubbing his taut gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic raced ahead, taking barely a second to reach his destination (though much to his frustration, his belly took another few seconds to stop wobbling after he finished moving). He took another second to appraise his surroundings to see what terrible threat he was gonna have to pound today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a kitchen, ugh, and Vector was lying on the floor, with a <b>huge</b> bloated belly, and a muzzle covered in some kind of pink substance that looked oddly like Cake Frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic tapped his foot impatiently, waiting for Vector to realize Sonic was there and was judging him harshly for crying wolf. <i>\"Ugggh... no more... no more icing....\"</i> Vector whined, his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth in a stupid expression. \"Yeah, no wonder there's no more, you ate it all!\" Sonic harshly chastised, wagging his finger disapprovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector's eyes lit up when he realized someone else was in the room, \"S-Sonic! Help me! R-Rotor - \"<br>\r\n\"Wait, Rotors around here?\" Sonic cut in, quickly glancing around for his purple buddy. \"Rotor... Rotor's crazy!!\" Vector bellowed, before he let out a loud gassy \"-<b>BBBbrrruaap!</b>-\" that sent speckles on icing all over his torso. \"Uhhnng...\" Vector looked a little too out of it to speak any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn't imagine the walrus doing anything malicious or intentionally harmful to one of his allies. Something didn't add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog backedup into the doorframe, he didn't want to leave Vector like this, but there was no way he could carry him - and if that scuffle earlier had been Rotor, he could still quickly catch up to him so long as he didn't lose his trail in this maze of a house. So he had to leave now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll.. if I find Sally I'll try to get them to pick you up!\" Sonic exclaimed, though he doubted Vector could actually hear him at the moment, before running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took mere moments to find the walrus he was searching for, that was the benefit of super speed, even if he did have to backtrack into several different rooms before he found him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room they were in now was a dark room; dim lighting with darkwood flooring, it looked like a scene out of a noir film.

He sniffed it, then, against his better judgment, <i>or maybe control was taken away from his paw for a second,</i> he dipped his index finger into one of the pink goo messes, getting a thick glob of it stuck on the tip. Then without thinking he stuffed that finger into his maw for a taste of what Vector had overloaded himself on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only realized his mistake moments later, but it was far to late, the taste... it was orgasmic! Sonic almost smashed his face into the wall trying to lick up the remaining goo. He whimpered, knowing he'd just fallen into another trap, and such a obvious one! Once he finished licking up that glob, Sonic regained enough composure  to reassert his free will. Though his knees were shaking, his eyes darting around the room at all the tempting little dollops of pink stuff coating the kitchen, Sonic cleared his mind to think about what Vector had said, \"W-what about Rotor?! Where is he?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector clenched his teeth, as if it was painful to think back, his tongue was constantly licking his lips. And that made Sonic unconsciously lick his lips too, even though it was clean from any food. \"Hnnnngh... Sonic? Is that you? You - you gotta stop Rotor, he's stolen all the pink stuff!\" he whined, the tail end of that sentence devolving into a emotional blubber. \"He said I <b><i>- burrrp - </i></b>, had enough and took it from me. I <b>need</b> it. Sonic please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic shut his eyes tightly, now he truly observed how hopelessly addicted Vector was, well he couldn't be helped for now.

One changes the individual into a big breasted bimbo who is desperate for a master or mistress while the other increases the consumer's strength and intelligence tenfold of what they were before. These solutions take a few hours to be in full effect and to undo them a consumer must simply drink the opposite solution otherwise it is permeant but bare in mind these solutions can only be found in this room and one person cannot enter alone, each solution must be consumed by a different person and after that happens the doors will be given access to those in the room once again. Another thing to bear in mind that regardless of what gender the consumer may happen to be beforehand they will be female if they drink the bimbo solution and male if they drink the other.\" What remained on the note was instructions of explaining how to figure out which solution was the bimbo drink and which was not it by looking at which cup had a red dot on the side...that being the pink drink. \"There's nothing else on here, I'm already assuming you guys are going to force me to be a volunteer to consume one of these so I'll save you the trouble!\" Turning away from the group he smirked as he drank the solution that would make him smarter in the next few hours, since it was the pink drink the heroes would likely assume it'll make Nack a bimbo which meant one of them would quickly volunteer to drink the blue solution.</span></div></div>",

The fox thinks to himself \"They should have quite a bit in here.\" He opens the doors and sees Amy standing in front of him, trying to close her mouth as she raises a glass to it. Inside the glass is a mixture that anyone could see is not natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turns her eyes to see Tails standing there in shock. \"TAILS HELP M-\" She yells out to him, but her body took control of her distraction and shoved the vial into her mouth, ingesting about half of it before Tails snatched it away from her. Amy stood in a daze. Tails helped move her over to an examination bench on the other side of the room so she could sit down. \"What was in that?\" He asked her, looking for a label on the glass, but not finding anything. He looked up at her, she seemed okay, but confused, and like Sonic and himself, had a collar around her neck as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here alone?\" He asked her. Amy shook her head. \"No. There are more with me. Knuckles, Rouge, Shadow, Sally, Bunnie, and Silver. We heard more voices, and this place is really big, so there may be more people.\" She said trying to force a smile. Tails nodded. \"It was just Sonic and me in one room. I didn't know who else was there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy perked up. \"Sonic's here too? That's great. I know he'll help us... help us...\" She began to get woozy and falling over. \"AMY!\" Tails shouted grabbing her and laying her down on the bed. She was struggling with something. He looked at the vial. \"That has to be it\" He said to himself. He ran over to the vial and drank the remainder of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes grew wide when he realized what had just happened. He'd lost control of his body again. Tails tried to get up but everything was dizzy. His vision was getting blurry, and he felt achy all over. And before he could react. He was passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails, Tails!\" He heard his name being called out, as well as the all too familiar shaking from before. He opened his eyes and saw Amy. But she was different, She was bigger. Amy's chest had increased several cup sizes. Tails tried to look away so that he wouldn't stare, and got up as quickly as he could and almost fell in the process, like he hadn't walked in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and began looking around. He and Amy were still alive, that was good. But when he looked down, the floor looked alot farther away from him as it did before. \"I'm taller?\" Tails asked himself, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're older\" Amy interjected. \"When I woke up I found this.\" She handed him a label from one of the cabinets that were filled with a various assortment of glasses filled with all sorts of weird chemicals. Tails looked at the label and saw that it read. \"Age Progression. Five Years\". He looked at himself. His frame was bigger for sure, and his proportions were almost equal to Sonic and Knuckles, while Amy's figure had expanded in areas to get her appearance closer to Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it in the space where I was forced to take the bottle from. I guess now we're as old as the others now.\" She said to Tails. \"Now come on. Lets get out of here before he tries anything else in this room. There are some extreme potions. We got off lucky.\" Tails nods, and the two of them leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does the Observer Follow Next? </span></div></div>",

Now that he was older looking he felt strange hormones and urges pulsing through his body. His rational side trying it's best to keep him under control as he nervously scratched at his small gloves. The pink hedgehog quickly went to work ripping and creating knots in her once beautiful red dress. The end result was a makeshift two piece outfit that wasn't able to hide much, but covered enough to keep her dignity. <br>\r\n\"This will have to do for now\" she sighed and pressed on her bussom causing the Fox behind he  to go stiff.<br>\r\n\"Tails do you think we should stay together?

Screaming out in fear he bolted as fast as he could tripping and kicking off his small shoes desperate to escape from his own perverse desires. He closed his eyes, covered his ears and continue to run screaming like a lunatic. By the time he stopped running and broke down crying he noticed he was in a fancy, high tech looking kitchen. Giving a shuddering breath he leaned back against a counter sitting on the door gripping the boner that still wouldn't go away.<br>\r\n\"Amy... Amy...she I can't... she's my friend and Sonic, oh Sonic\" he cried shots of pleasure shooting up his spine as his hand tended to his desire filed by lust. \"His confidence... her strength, the chest... Oh his blue butt, and the quills\" he hissed louder gripping the countertop and  pulling himself up noticed Sonics favorite meal chili dogs on the counter, that's when he snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiled by lust and hunger the Fox began greedily feasting on the dish crying out for more. \"Sonic Sonic!\" He screamed his mind a total mess his desires an  pleasures increasing with each though about the blue hedgehog and each bite of food he had. He didn't realize such a combination would lead to disaster as he ate and  masturbated at the same time. The more he ate the stronger the pleasure as I  just built up higher and higher hallucinations plaguing his fragile mental state. He saw him that hedgehog he loved feeding him, HIM! Delicious food his mind wanted him to keep going as \"sonic\" rubbed his belly. \"Eat up little bro... your big brother loves you BIG\" he growled as tails howled in bliss. Finally passing out the Fox lied there in the kitchen obscenely bloated with his crotch spattered in semen.</span></div></div>",

The starving fox was soon rewarded with a delicious looking chocolate cake layers piled high and smothered in a rich thick frosting. <br>\r\n\"Wow... looks good\" he still had some hesitation but it evaporated instantly the moment he had a small lick.

He also felt an unnatural coolness around is feet as large orange toes wriggles freely his sneakers split In half the remains clinging to think ankles. Each step he took his body jiggled an  pushed down onto his erect shaft, semen oozing out the tip as he never felt so satisfied in his life.

The first room he entered was a lavish master bedroom built for a king. Or better yet for him. He prowled around the area, giving everything a through examination. As he examined the room he noted that it had been used, and through the smells, it had to have been a female. Tails waited in the corner, knowing the inhabitant would soon come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat near the door frame for what felt like several hours, when in actuality it was only a matter of minutes, but his hungry stomach said differently. He felt famished by this point. Just as he was about to get up and leave, the door opened, and Fiona Fox entered. Tails wasted no time and pinned her to the floor under his increased weight. His hands covering her screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...\" He said in an almost crazed tone. \"I'm going to make you better...\" He forced her mouth open just enough to slide the vial into her mouth and force the contents into her.

Artificial Heart....\" He picked her up and placed her on the bed naked with his erect penis ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona panted, under a daze of lust. \"Please... Please fuck me! Fuck me hard!\" That was what Tails wanted. He climbed on top of her and started thrusting in her, his belly resting on her the whole time. Fiona was lost in her emotions as she let him do whatever he wanted, and didn't stop even when he came inside of her and pulled out. Tails backed up and rested on the bed, leaving her desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I need more! Please!\" She begged to him. Now facing an addiction for Tails. He smiled as things had gone exactly how he planned. \"First off. Call me Master... Because that's what I am to you now.\" She nodded eagerly. \"And you will get more of this... When you Satisfy my appetite..\" He rubbed his belly, signifying to her that he needs to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona shot up from the bed and ran elsewhere to get food.

Tails himself managed to catch a whiff too, and instantly became hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew words left either of their lips, but within seconds, both were on the ground fondling and groping each other. The fox had no idea if she was acting of her own free will or not, but he didn't care. He slid his throbbing dick into her pussy and thrusted away, and after excessive thrusts and force, let go all of his seed into her. For Tails it was the greatest moment of his life. Sally slid to the floor, content and satisfied, but Tails still had work to do. He wiped his cock off on her rear and hooked up the large remainder of the potion up to the air purifier, and set it to slowly leak its contents into the air to give his friends some \"Extra Incentive\" To get Risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails noticed a small change in the scent in the room as he felt the potions airborn effects taking shape, as well as the fierce heat in his crotch coming back.

If we don't play exactly the way he wants us to, we get an even worse deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's worth anything, as weird and horrible as that was... At least you were gentle. Tails was too, even when he was evil... All three of you are better than Scourge was...\" Fiona murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks.\" Knuckles shrugged, taking the awkward compliment as best he could. Sonic and Sally, however, heard something else in her voice. Something hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiona, are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" She said. \"It wasn't that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean with Sc-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not talking about it.\" She snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... But if you need to open up, I'll listen.\" Sally put her hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... thanks.\" Fiona shifted, leaning against the squirrel slightly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they managed to make it back to the rest of the group. </span></div></div>",

The fox would silently gesture to the others in order to get them to notice the bee as he grew concerned over her but they all seemed to have the same advice: it would be better to figure out how to fix him and let her be for now, she would be in that fragile state until she had him once again. They planned on going out again in a large group while leaving a couple there to watch over the three greatly affected ones. They all had a hard time sleeping that night as Bean and Amy were eventually brought back in but chose to be in a room similar to Charmy's as Amy felt she still needed to sort things out with Bean which was easily given, albeit this room wasn't see through like the bee's. </span></div></div>",

After a few minutes the duo stopped working out and began to compliment each other's toned out bodies before deciding to test them further out by having sexual intercourse with each other. Once done with that they found unitards that were colored red and purple and put them on, as if they were expected to find them.
