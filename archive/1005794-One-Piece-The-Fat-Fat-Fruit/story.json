I got myself a first mate, a navigator, a cook, a doctor, and a archeologist!\" grinned Monkey D. Luffy, standing on the figurehead of his ship. Suddenly, he began slipping and was about to fall in the water when a hand grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Luffy!\" shouted Zoro, Luffy's first mate and a master swordsman. \"You know you sink like a rock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami, the crew's navigator, then went, \"Bet you five minutes later he'll be on it again,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This crew needs more women. I love to have more beauties like Nami and Nico around,\" said Sanji, as the cook sat back, smoking his cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want more crazy, hard hitting girls around?\" asked Chopper, the reindeer who ate the Huma-Huma fruit and the crew's doctor, just before Sanji's leg came down on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it, Chopper. Men like that never grow up,\" said Nico Robin, the archeologist and former Miss All Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Luffy! You forgot me!\" shouted Usopp, the long-nosed crewmate scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what are you again?\" asked Zoro, \"Are you the gunman? You spend more time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got tired of waiting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!!!\" shouted Sanji, a hole opened in the deck. Standing there was a large, fat woman with long purple hair. Her belly stuck out from under her shirt, and her hair was down to her well-rounded, big butt. The girl was clad in an armless shirt with pants that squeezed and hugged her jello-like legs and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there! The name's Debuki!\" smiled the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE'D SHE COME FROM?!!!\" shouted Usopp, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're all soft and jiggly,\" said Luffy, the not-too bright rubber man poking Debuki's belly in curosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki grinned, before grabbing Luffy's head and giving him a huge kiss on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cuter in person than in real life,\" said Debuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spill it...what are you here for?\" asked Zoro, pulling out one of his three swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To join up with the Straw Hat Crew of course! You guys are going to be big, I just know it!\" smiled Debuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" went Luffy, a bit dazed from Debuki's kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what for us?\" asked Nami, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki pointed a jiggling arm to the left, saying, \"50 feet to the west...there's a small rock with a red lobster crawling on it. He's between the moss and a rock,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, like anyone...\" began Usopp, taking a telescope, before drawing his jaw. \"NO WAY!!! SHE'S RIGHT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've trained my eyes since childhood,\" smiled Debuki, \"I can see further than a telescope when I focus, and I can see to the smallest detail. I'm going to be the lookout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Debuki's our new lookout!\" shouted Luffy, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks like she can enjoy a good meal,\" thought Sanji with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...another girl on this ship would be nice, even a fat one,\" thought Nico and Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going off. Chopper, would you give me a hand with training?\" asked Zoro, before taking Chopper off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with him?\" asked Debuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old sword boy never trusts anyone at first,\" said Sanji, \"Go figure,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have eaten the devil fruits, haven't you?\" asked Debuki to Luff and Nico. \"It's ok. I've eaten one too,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Luffy, \"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Fat-Fat Fruit,\" smiled Debuki, before taking a breath and suddenly her body began swelling up and up, making her larger and larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!!!\" went Usopp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fight using my entire body. Body slamming, grappling...it's all enhanced by being this huge. As an added bonus, the fruit makes my skin stronger,\" smiled Debuki, before deflating back to her regular fat size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no offense, but don't do that again to extreme, or you may sink us, much less fit in the crow's nest,\" said Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob,\" said Debuki, before everyone went back to their normal activities. Debuki then decided to spend time with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've got some things to do in my cabin!!\" she pushed away from her empty plate, covering her face with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki giggled, making her immense gut jiggle. She saw a certain black haired archeologist outside on the deck, reading a book. \"Oi! Robin-san, why don't you come share a meal with me?!\" she eagerly waddled off to see the woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami groaned, why was she so hungry?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been two hours since she and Debuki had shared their meal, and the young navigator's stomach was rumbling so loudly that Luffy thought the ship had hit a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was seeing double and it hurt to stand straight up, that's how hungry she was. Every part of Nami seemed to lose energy, even her bright orange hair even seemed faded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... that's it... I'm gonna go get a snack from the kitchen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hobbled slowly out of her cabin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonkey D. Luffy waltzed down the inners of the ship, towards the kitchen. Sanji was out on the deck so now was the perfect time to sneak a meal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned widely, all of his teeth exposed at the thought of getting some of Sanji's sweeeet meat. He heard another loud groan, \"ANOTHER ROCK?!\" he over dramatically latched onto a nearby beam. Looking around, and seeing that there was indeed no rock, he resumed his trip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami greedilly shoved the drumstick back into her maw, taking a huge (almost Luffy-sized) bite out of the poor leg. She grunted as she did so, only stopping to swallow and take a drink of grog. Another bite, and another. She was only focused on filling her belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami finished her drumstick, and grabbed another one hastilly. \"Oi!!\" Luffy shouted, \"THAT'S MY MEAT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami, broken from her trance, looked over to the archway. Luffy was crying like a little kid over his 'stolen' meat. \"Tough luck, want some?\" Nami teased Luffy with her drumstick. Luffy pawed at it, \"Pay me, and you can take all you want.\" she said, making her signature money sign<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy pointed a finger angrilly at the gluttonous navigator, \"NO FAIR!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother couple of hours passed, now nightfall, and Nami was experiencing similar problems to before (albeit to a much lesser degree) She was back in the kitchen for a small snack, where she saw Debuki, who was eating a meal much like the one she herself had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple haired girl had stopped mid-bite, \"Oi? What's up Nami?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami blushed again, she didn't want Debuki thinking she was in here for a snack after that little 'fat talk' they had earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Luffy asked me to get him a drumstick!\" she quickly lied, \"Why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki finished her bite and pat her stomach, \"To feed my belly! Why else? After that little meal with Robin, I got hungry again, so here I am!\" she smiled, expressing her fat cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, then I guess I had... y'know... get this drumstick to Luffy!\" she grabbed one and quickly hurried off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nami was halfway down the hall, Debuki finished another segment of her meal. She swallowed, \"Yeah sure... for \"Luffy\", whatever you say...\" she smirked to herself, knowing of her fruit's side effects towards people around her...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, she heard a low grumbling sound from the navigator's quarters. Smirking as she imagined what she might find inside, she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnnngaah...\"<br>\r\nNami couldn't understand what was happening. She lay on her back on the floor, surrounded by the long discarded wrappers of various snacks. Her recent change in habits, from nigh anorexic to glutton, had made a great impact on her body. Her bikini top was strained, and close to bursting and revealing swollen, smooth breasts the size of great melons. Her mouth was left opening, gasping for air as her chubby, red face jiggled ever so slightly. Her plump rump was lifting her ever so slightly off of her cabin floor, and was straining the tight jeans she wore. An airy fart escaped her, but she was in too much pain to care. She lay her hands upon her belly, wondering what could have caused this. It had swollen to a great size, bigger than a beach ball. Right now it was tight, but soon, it would be soft like a pillow. She rubbed her hands all over it in an attempt to soothe it's ravenous hunger. For weeks, she had been able to do nothing but eat, otherwise her stomach would growl and moan and ache.Nami had no choice but to feed it, and Sanji was only too happy to oblige, but this was only a temporary cure. She had just eaten a mountain of snacks, yet already felt utterly famished. Every meal she ate, her body swelled more, and she could tell that soon she would have to eat constantly or suffer a permanent punishent from her gut. Her once flat belly was already protesting, and her red face screwed up in pain, was a clear indcator that she was at the end of her rope. As another fart escaped from her once tight ass, continued writhing in pain.<br>\r\n\"H-heeeelp.... Hngggaargh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki chuckled to herself. Her fruits side effects were working wonderfully. It was almost like karma, striking down all those who would have once mocked her for her weight. She also felt a lot of lust at the sight of this utterly helpless woman.</span></div></div>",

She decided that Nami had suffered enough... for now. After all, she had to adjust to her newly found weight and eating habits, so tormenting her by increasing her hunger might just be too much. Furthermore, Debuki realized that Nami wasn't ready to accept her body and Debuki's view on fatness or more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, poor Nami was struggling to get up, despite the pain, and the change in her body's stamina she wasn't used to yet. There she made her way to the kitchen, where she saw Debuki, Nico and Sanji, the first two being busy eating a huge plate of ramen noodles. Ashamed of her body and thus not wanting anyone to see her, she decided to go back to her cabin, where she lied down in order to get some sleep. Sanji left the kitchen to take a break and smoke, leaving Nico alone with Debuki<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Nico was stuffing herself silly, as she gradually lost restraint; more so when Sanji left. Debuki was pleased at the two girls' progress so far but pretending not to notice any of the change or her eating compagnion's forcefulness towards the meal. She also notice Nico;s body, in the heat of the kitchen, and due to the lenght of the meal, it was covered in sweat, thus emphazing the changes that had occured since Debuki joined the crew.They weren't as impressive as Nami's though. She had grown a small potbelly, but wasn't yet touching her thighs, which were also a bit larger. Her breast had expanded as well as little bit. But she stil had a long way to go before reaching Nami's size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki was now laying in her bed, with a small portion of meet.

Nami had him at the oven all day every day, last week he had missed out on an awesome adventure on an island... from all the stories he heard from the rest of the Strawhat Crew, it involved some kind of giant lobster, a squid, and a rampaging Sea King<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely had time to eat his own confections, much less take a break from cooking Nami's food. He had learned the fastest way to get to Nami without dropping the food, although it was a short walk from the Going Merry's kitchen to it's Meeting/Dining room, Nami tended to get a little impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the Curly-Cook minded at all, anything to keep 'Nami-Swan' right?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SANJI-KUN!!\" Nami bellowed. Despite it's sweet contents and honorific, the sentence still had a commanding and dictator-like tone. She shifted her ass in the sofa, if she sat down long enough her backside went numb, and the orange haired navigator didn't like the akward feeling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami had grown quite fat in the past few weeks, only increasing her stomach's capacity. Her days were either in the women's cabin while she mapped out sea charts, or she was in the Meeting room being waited on by Sanji. Sometimes she was joined by Luffy or Debuki, the two biggest eaters of the crew, and sometimes even Nico Robin. But usually, it was just her and a plate of food<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami maintained a certain top-heavy figure, her bust and waistline increasing on what seemed to be a weekly basis. Her soft, pillowy belly spilled inbetween her thicker legs, yet maintained just enough thickness to support her large breasts evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer greedy nature had now extended to food, meaning if Luffy was stupid enough (which he usually was) to wander into Nami's room with meat, she demanded it be hers. Her food problem, which was carefully avoided by the rest of the crew, had led Nami to become really sensitive about the matter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a little embarrassing, because since her weight gain she needed bigger outfits. Since the crew was out at sea a lot, this was a little tough. She didn't mind, however, sending Nico Robin out to look for clothes in her newer size range while she ate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SANJI-KUN!!\" she bellowed again, only to see the blonde haired cook enter carrying her platter. Her chubby face lit up in delight, \"Oh thank you Sanji-kun, I really appreciate it!\" she psuedo-swooned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji took the bait, his one visible eye became a heart. \"Oh of coooourse Nami-Swan!!<img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" he set the heavy platter down in front of his love, only to be ordered back into the kitchen. Nami began to work at the platter, resting a heavy, porcelian plate on her stomach as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of heavy eating, Nami heard a knock at the women's cabin door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ni?

This little, yet big guy had gotten seperated from his mother and school of squids in one of the many common storms that plagued the Grand Line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow living down in the extremely dark and lightless bottom of the ocean with the giant squids for so long, this squid had no idea what his mother looked like other then a rough outline in the dark and that her body was large, smooth and squishy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been wandering this ocean for such a long time, he was so lonely and missed his mother. It was just when the squid thought it'd give up when a large thing came floating near the reef he called home. He was curiously as he swam closer but his eyes widened when he saw a figure dive into the cool blue from the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropelling himself closer to get a look, it was shocked to see that it was large round figure very similar to what his mother looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah this is relaxing...\" Nami sighed rolled over her backside as she surfaced, and merely floated across the top of the watter like an overweight otter. Rubbing her stomach to relax, she didn't notice the curious squid swim closer to her hopefully. She noticed something brush up against her backside but merely passed it off as a fish as she continued to swim on her back by kicking her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the squid was extremely excited, when it cautiously brushed against the strange figure, it was also smooth, round and squishy just like his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo being an young squid of little common sense or the difference between an overweight red head girl and a giant female squid, it did the most logical thing a squid did when re-united with it's mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAAAAH!!\" Everyone on the Going Sunny turned in suprise at the sound of Nami's scream just in time to see her flailing in the water with several long bleach white tentacles wrapping around her body and caressing her flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami-swan, dont worry I'll save you!!\" Sanji yelled in shock as he was in the water in the time it took you to blink and was swimming towards Nami who was trying to pull the tentacles off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squid had latched itself to Nami's large budha belly and had wrapped it's tentacles around her, waiting for her to start swimming again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami struggling began to slow as she grew tired and tried to stay afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext....</span></div></div>",

Nami bent over to set up the lounge chair, her big belly served as a cushion separating her huge boobs from touching her legs. Her grand derriere wobbled during her task setting up, a sight Robin couldn't ignore. \"Ugh there we go.\" Nami groaned overwhelmed by the arduous labor. Nami fanned her sweaty self with her hand before plopping her ass in the lounge chair. Nami loudly sighed as her body sunk into the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting a moment Nami than went straight for her chips. \"Grr com' on.\" Nami grumble as the bag proved recalcitrant. The determined Nami triumphed and began to casually eat potato chips as Robin read a book. Nami made quick work of the chips but still hungered for more. \"Sanji! Can you get me more chips?!\" However the chef was too far away to hear Nami's pleas. \"Grrrr, Luffy!? Zoro!? Usopp?\" Her cries went unheard. \"Gah Do I have to do everything around here?\" Nami growled attempting to lift herself out from the lounge chair. \"Huff pant hrmphhh!\" Robin watched her crewmate struggle \"I'll get you some chips Nami.\" \"Gee thanks Robin.\" Nami expressed her gratitude before adding \"Oh and can you get the barbeque flavor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking back in her chair Nami rubbed her soft belly. \"Guess I am getting kindof lazy...\" Nami than studied her body, her once anorexic figure was now voluptuous. Rail thin legs were now encased in wobbly adipose, stick like arms had become smothered by flab, her trim waist now poured with fat, Her already nicely sized butt and boobs had grown even more impressive wearing down any restraining clothing no matter how valiant. \"Hard to believe that only a few weeks ago I was thin. Guess I have Debuki to blame for this.\" Nami said recalling spending the past few weeks constantly eating with Debuki, perpetually encouraged to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico Robin returned bearing a nice big bag of bbq chips and Debuki accompanied her.

Her big butt was bigger than J-Lo's and it sagged on the sides of the chair. Robin's body jiggled at she let out a loud belch and a fart.

More!\" Robin cried. \"Hold your horses!\" Debuki exclaimed. Soon, all the food was gone. ROBIN WAS HUGE! Her giant stomach pushed Debuki and Sanji up against the wall. Her huge butt would shake the whole ship when she farted. Robin had ten big flabby chins and fat red cheeks that rested heavly on her giant boobs. Each of her breasts were 800 pounds each and they would jiggle when Robin burped or farted. Robin's neck was gone in the sea of fat that was her body. Robin let out another large belch and sighed. \"Oh, yeah!

She could easily switch me back and fourth from slender to me playing around with THIS.\" as she poked her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro then said, \"Why do you guys think that Devil Fruit users are so weak to water?  Is it because there are actual demons in the fruit?  Or is it due to the bitter qualities of the fruit that can cause a paralyzing effect on the body when exposed to salt water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Robin and Usopp looked at Zoro, all shocked at what he said, thought Robin hid her shock better as she asked, \"How would you know so much about Devil Fruit weaknesses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro then said, \"Hey, if you fight enough Devil Fruit users like I have, you start thinking about <i>why</i> they have the weaknesses they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis chat carried on for a while, Robin eating the coffee cakes and donuts provided to her, all the while.  <i>This is nice...</i> she thought.</span></div></div>",

He has a liking of food, but because of how much we do from island to island, he drops the weight easily.  Hell, all the way back in Whiskey Peak, I saw Luffy eat so much meat, that he was quite the fat bastard.  He dropped that weight in an instant after he fought some poor bastards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin: So even if this weight wasn't the result of the Fat-Fat fruit, I could still burn this off relatively easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsopp: Yep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin: Hmm.

Just wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I always like my body no matter how it turns out, I want to point out that I wasn't going full on pro-fat mode when I did this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was surprised. \"Oh... then why <i>did</i> you do what you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then explained. \"2 reasons.  One, I wanted to experience the lathargy and luxuries of being fat.  Considering how reversible all Devil Fruit powers are, and how this tale isn't canon, I have literally nothing to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami then said, \"Again, Robin.  Easy on the fourth wall.  Although, I can see why you feel so confident in what you're doing, but why did you let her do what she did to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin didn't hold back. \"Two, I don't trust her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine this, navigator: Say you were this soldier in an organization who had an ability no one else had, but you were ranked at foot soldier level.  Now say the organization took a special interest in you, and decided to send you out on several missions involving pretending to be just a random stranger, or pirate, and that you join your enemies for a bit, maybe have a fun time with your abilities, before ultimately revealing yourself to be in the organization, and a higher up, at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see your point,\" Nami said, \"but what could that have to do with Debuki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is actually <i>Captain</i> Debuki of the Marines.   Her goal is to take us down by fattening us all up, before firing at this ship, which is already heavily damaged, mind you, until it's completely obliterated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami began to worry.  \"Oh, noooo... We're screwed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite...\" Robin said.  \"Debuki doesn't seem very competent as a captain, <i>and</i> she is a Devil Fruit user, <i>AND</i> she has me, the captain and the swordsman to deal with.  The cook would be useless here, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was relieved. \"Whew, I thought we were screwed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gave Nami a nice smile, and said \"Not to worry, navigator.  We have this under control.  So goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Robin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Robin got in her bed, she grabbed her copy of <i>Rye In The Wind,</i> and began reading.  <i>This isn't so bad,</i> thought Robin, <i>since I do more of what I liked doing anyways, plus I can cut loose in what I eat, not to mention the nice feeling of flab.  And when it's time for me to switch back, I can easily.</i>. Robin was in deep thought as she read, before going to sleep herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During midnight, there was the sound of someone walking around the crew, talking to someone else.  Robin, as fat as she was, still had to see what was going on.  She surprised herself, though, at how hard it was for her to do that.  <i>I suppose I should ask the cook for more sweets tomorrow morning...</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she made it up and, true to her suspicions, Debuki was talking to one of her superiors via Transponder Snail.  \"And what do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki turned to look at Robin and jumped in shock first, before calming down.  \"Oh, it's just you, Robin.  What are you doing up so late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin responded. \"This is what I always do, to make sure no one attacks us in night time, but enough about me, what are <i>you</i> doing up so late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had enough.  \"Quit lying to me and my crew!  I know who you are, Captain Debuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki dropped her usual cheerful demeanor, and instead got serious fast. \"You know too much, Nico Robin.  Prepare for capt- HMF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was covering her mouth, and spoke. \"No, I don't want to get caught, not by you!\"  She then threw Debuki into the ocean via her powers, and felt an immense heat coming from her body the moment Debuki went into the water.  Her belly was contracting until it was slim, her thighs were thin again, her butt shrank to being just juicy, not chunky, and her rack only shrank 2 cups.  In short: Robin was thin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh, it feels good to be thin again.</i> That was as much as Robin cared on that subject, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me!\"  Debuki said.  Robin went over to se her clinging on to a bouy, and was surprised to see Debuki scrawny.  \"Here!\" Robin had extended her arms to help Debuki onto the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraumatized, Debuki said, \"Why?  Why did you help me?  I thought the World Government said that you weren't to be trusted at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin responded. \"For the last 20 years of my life, I had spent all of that time in hiding, fearful of the day that the World Government might catch and execute me.  For you see, I've always wanted to learn the true history of the Void Century, but considering that the World Government would execute anyone who learned too much, I had to become a pirate and betray all of the groups that would eventually betray me.  At first, it was justified, but somewhere down the road, I had clicked to the villainy inside of me and became a twisted pirate, for two organizations.  Then I met Crocodile, and you know the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki was lost. \"Wait, but then why did you change with the Straw Hat pirates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thought about it, and said \"Honestly, I don't know.  Maybe it's because their atitude of extreme loyalty was rubbing off on me.  That, and I am having the best time of my life with these people.  Who can say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki thought it over, and said, \"How about we restore ourselves back to being fat?  That way, no one would have to know what we talked about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Robin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHUBBY CHUBBY ZWEI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin felt that sensation again, what with her thighs closing the gap, her ass getting chunky, her belly getting fat with two flab rolls, and her rack in jug level, increasing by two cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And I'm back to being fat...</i> Robin thought.  <i>Well, I like being slender AND chubby, so I'm good.</i>. With Debuki, she plumped up in an instant, going back to the fat-happy girl she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, goodnight Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Debuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they both headed off into their own respective quarters.  When Robil laid down her now-fat body on the bed, she wondered, <i>Am I actually liking this fat body MORE than my slim body?  Hmm...</i>  And with that, Robin dosed off.</span></div></div>",

See you, my love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin got straight to her meal.  She took her first bite into a coffee cake, and was amazed by the flavor it brought out.  So she surprised herself by wolfing the coffee cakes down, her stomach getting bigger in the process.  After the 12th, her pants button snapped.  And so, Robin added all of the sugar Sanji provided to the coffee, along with the fattening creamer, and drank the whole thing in one chug.  After she was done, she let out a medium belch, and then thought, <i>Weird, normally I'm quite controlled when eating something...</i>. And so, Robin stepped out of bed, swollen gut and all, and headed outside.  She saw:</span></div></div>",

You see, my powers allow the expansion of <i>any</i> object, not just humans.  As a Devil Fruit user, you know fully well how complex these kind of powers can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin regained her composure. \"I'm sorry if I was out of hand just now.  But of course, Devil Fruits are indeed complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Robin added. \"So, what will you be doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've realized that I have become a selfish, gluttonous person from using my powers for my own gain instead of for the good of others.  Ironically, that was why I became a Marine in the first place.  So now, I'm going to give back to the people, plants and animals on that island, and I will watch over them for the remainder of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin said, \"I will miss you, Debuki.  Now go.  Go and fulfill your goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki smiled, then said, \"I will.  Goodbye Robin.  I won't forget you, or your friends.\"  She then took a great leap, then launched the energy sphere towards the island, resulting in all the plant life blooming again, the weak hungry people healed, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a good person, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin replied. \"Yes, Zoro.  I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we sit down on our chairs and watch the sun rise?\"  Usopp asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled and said, \"Yes, let's do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, while the other Straw Hats continued business as usual, Zoro, Usopp and Robin just sat there and watched as the ship sailed away from their friend.  And like that, Zoro, Usopp and Robin had a tradition of coming together at this very spot on the remainder of the Going Merry's life, and on the new Thousand Sunny, to pay their respects for a friend they could never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>F.I.N.</i></span></div></div>",

Sure, Zoro's abs weren't as sculpted, and Sanji's chin was starting to mold into his neck, but nothing more then a 5 to 10 pounds gain for anyone on board- except for Robin, that is. Robin had the unfortunate condition of sharing a cabin with Debuki. Now this normally wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that Debuki's Fat-Fat fruit stored enough energy to make sure she never had to sleep. So Debuki would spend the entire night keeping her internal battery charged- otherwise known as eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki's constant night \"snacking\" (more like an all night binge session, in reality), plus the fact that the two spent most of the day together on the main deck (Robin sunbathing or studying ancient texts, Debuki still eating) meant that Robin was, in effect, gaining somewhere between triple and quintuple the amount of calories the rest of the crew was getting- which was no small amount, to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki continued eating her pancakes as she stepped into her cabin to lay eyes on her pride and joy- her project, Nico Robin. Robin was still sound asleep at well past 10 in the morning, a fact Debuki was proud of. Robin, who used to wake up at the crack of dawn, now slept later and later, making it easier and easier for Debuki to park herself in a chair and eat ridiculous amounts of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's pale stomach moved up and down with each breath, peeking out from under her torn shirt. Debuki drank in the sight of the enormous Robin- a one hundred pound gain in only a few short weeks. Robin's already large breasts had snapped the last of her bras last week, forcing her to use spare fabric meant to be used for mast repairs as the only thing keeping her modest. Her rotund stomach looked like a balloon filled with water, jiggling when she walked and rippling at even the slightest bounce of the boat. But Robin's real treasure was her magnificent lower half. Debuki had never seen anything like it- Robin's thighs were as thick around as large cannon- and her ass cheeks stuck out like pale white moons, held back only by one of Debuki's largest bikini bottoms.<br>\r\nSanji was normally not a fan of fat girls, but the sheer size of Robin's assets combined with the fact that she was becoming too lazy to resist his advances, was giving him nosebleeds at the mere sight of her pasty posterior or bodacious bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebuki couldn't be happier. Part of the Fat-Fat Fruit's power was to bend fat people to her will- and these stupid Strawhats were both giving her the perfect army of obese slaves, and eliminating themselves at the only real contenders for Debuki's run at the Shichibukai.</span></div></div>",

Since they both were Devil Fruit users, she knew that Debuki couldn't handle salt water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she got up with great effort, and walked over to ask Zoro if he could bring her a bucket of salt water.  \"Sure, I guess...

It was quite a loaded sandwich with 5 meats and 5 cheeses.  In short, it was big.  Robin got it for two reasons: One, she was quite hungry.  Two, Debuki would be all over what Robin was doing, which served as the perfect distraction for what Robin was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkip to Robin's cabin, and we see that Robin was busy wolfing down her meal, when Debuki came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you got hungry, Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin feigned the act of being surprised.  \"Well, you caught me.

Her chunky ass shrunk to being just juicy.  Her thighs and legs shrank to being tone and lean again, with a significant gap.  Her double chin was removed completely.  It was only her rack that hadn't changed much:  it shrunk back 3 cups, resulting in being DD-cups, as it was before.  <i>I look nice...</i> she thought.  <i>And now, the truth.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to see Debuki, now scrawny and angry.  \"How <i>dare</i> you ruin my plans of becoming a Warlord!  I was just going to have all of you turned into my fat slaves and rid of my competition.  And I was doing so well with you too, Robin: You could have been my right hand woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had crossed the rage point.  \"SEIS FLEUR!  BIND!\"  Suddenly, Debuki's arms, legs and neck were sealed to the wall via Robin's sprouting arms.  Then, in a cold fury, she said, \"Do you know how long I've had to put up with people like you who just use me for my services?  <b>20 years.</b>  There was always a different gimmick involves, but they were all the same.  They just wanted to get to the top and leave me screwed.  So eventually, I did the same to them.  I figured, 'Hey, if I've got this 79,000,000 Berri bounty since I was eight, why don't I earn it?'  Eventually, the World Government switched their reasoning around, but I didn't care: I was going to discover The True History of the world, no matter what it took.  So after <i>that</i> dream was crushed back at Alabasta, I was prepared to die, before joining the crew I'm in now.  And they did something no one else did: They made me feel welcome, like I was wanted, like I was actually <i>NEEDED,</i> instead of just another pawn.  So excuse me when I say that I have <i>no</i> intention on returning to that life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT, WHAT ARE Y- MMPH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in hell, Debuki!  Now, Seis Fleur...\"  Six more arms were pointed towards Debuki's stomach.  \"PIERCE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six arms tore through Debuki's stomach, causing it to bleed out and empty the organs in it.  Blood soon filled Debuki's mouth, before she lost consciousness.  Her puddle of blood increased in size until finally it stopped.  Debuki was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to throw this body out to sea...\"  Robin picked up Debuki's dead body off the floor, and carried it l the way through to the star board.  She then tossed the body overboard, never to see it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji saw Robin, and did an overtake when he saw her slender and sexy again. \"ROBIN, MY... Love... how... are... you...?\"  Sanji said, as his perversion quickly shifted into the feeling of mutiny. \"Robin, where's Debuki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like all the other scum in the world, rotting in the ocean.\"  She then headed back to Nami's cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been 1 week since the ordeal, and everyone learned why Debuki <i>really</i> joined the crew, and that Robin had killed her.  At first they were bitter towards Robin, but then that bitterness became understanding, which then patched things up nicely again.  To this day, the only things Debuki was known for was making the crew fat, and being killed by Robin.  Oh, and everyone else was thin again, too.  And so, they sailed on, awaiting the next adventure on the Grand Line. And so, Robin smiled.  Things were back to normal.</span></div></div>",

Her prodigious posterior and swelling stomach weighed her down enough that she would plant herself in one spot and remain there until returning to her cabin for sleep. This was making it much easier on Debuki to fatten her- she would simply plop herself down right next to Robin and glut herself while Robin napped or read ancient texts. However, much to her delight, Nami was being drawn in to her scheme as well: the navigator had read a report that tan skin was the new trend, so she would plop herself down next to Robin and Debuki to try and catch some rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this had all played directly into Debuki's increasingly pudgy hands.
