            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first day of being captain was pretty loose so far. I've been getting handshakes from everyone and they're all congratulating me on my new position. I was lounging in my quarters that night when Kira came in nervously. \"We, as in the rest of the squad and I wanted to show you something.It's in the barracks.\" He said sheepishly. \"Well this is unexpected. I'll be right there.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 15 minutes later I was walking down the path toward the barracks with my hands in my pocket. I could see the dim lights coming from the lanterns inside and hear the slight buzzing from within. \"The whole squad must have been in there.\" I thought. Letting my mind wander off with the thought of exactly how many were inside. \"Seventy-four, seventy-five, sevent...ow\" I was cut off when I collided with the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, i was forced to cover my eyes from a bright light. \"SURPRISE CAPTAIN AKECHI!!\" Wow, a surprise party for my first day as captain. \"Awwww thanks guys.\" I said cheerfully. Almost immediately, i was passed some sake from one of my squad members. I accepted the cup and raised it high into the air. \"To my squad\" I said. \"To our captain\" They said also raising their cups. All then began drinking their sake including me. Most of us had more sake and more sake until almost everyone was passed out. I tried my best to walk back to my quarters. Several falls later i made it to my door. Opening it was exceedingly hard but i was able to do it. After i fell to the floor with a loud thud. \"I gotta make it to my bed\" i said in my head. So i started crawling. I finally pull myself onto my bed and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I woke with a splitting headache. \"Well that's what i get.\" i said aloud. Walking over to my desk i had seen a large number of papers. \"Well thats gonna take awhile.\" I then walked over to my bathroom to wash my face. A few minutes later I was out and siting at my desk. I started reading then signing papers about the recent ruling, stating the captain-commander is going to take the place of Central Room 46, and that the captain-commander is going to stop chasing after Rukia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the day continued on like this. Reading then signing papers that had nothing to do the squad with random interjections from squad members. Most stating news I had already known. Until a hell butterfly came through my window. After landing on my finger i heard the captain-commander's voice. \"There has been strange hollow activity in the human world. I'm sending your squad to deal with this.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then sent the hell butterfly away. After some searching through my pockets i was able to find a scroll. It held the incantation needed to summon a hell butterfly. After speaking what seemed to be gibberish a small black butterfly appeared on the back of my hand. I told the butterfly \"Gather some of the new guys then meet me at the senkai gate at the edge of the courtyard.\" The butterfly seemed to know i wanted this message to go to Kira and it flew out the window and into the barracks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After looking at the butterfly fly away i rose from my desk, grabbing my katana and tieing it to my side. Leaving the papers behind Ryan casually walked out the door and into the hallway. The sound of his sandals hitting the floor filled the hallway with a slight echo. Eventually making it to the door i found it had been left halfway open. After fully opening the door i found there was no one in the central courtyard. Walking toward the barracks i see that door is partially open too. Using shunpo to get to the opening i was surprised to see what was inside. Nobody. \"Where can they have gone\" i said to myself. i stood there, rubbing my head, wondering where could they have all gone. Then the thought came to me \"The training dojo!\" i turned around and used shunpo to get to the across the court and into the dojo. Inside, i could see Kira and somebody else fighting with bokken. The rest of the squad was cheering them on. Kira was the first to notice me. Then his opponent, then others began to just stare at me. \"Sorry to break up this session, but we got a mission. So get your katanas and get to the senkai gate.\" I said. Kira was the first to start walking toward the exit. Others got up and started walking out. Then many started running out. After the room cleared i used shunpo to get to the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the gate i noticed there where no guards. I looked to my left then to my right. No guards. Before I got the chance to search my squad came running towards me. \"We're ready to go captain.\" Kira said. \"Then lets\" I responded. Turning to the gate, i remembered i didn't know how to open it. As if to read my thoughts the doors opened. After taking a deep breath, i walked in. Followed by my squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked into a very dark hallway. The only light was from the entrance and there was a green light on the far side. The strange thing was, the green light seemed to be coming faster then they were running. The light also seemed to be a beam rather than a doorway. I stopped dead in my tracks. \"THATS A CERO!!\" Kira yelled. The squad stopped in their tracks too. Ryan raised his hand to about chest level. He seemed prepared to catch the cero. The squad stepped back as the cero neared, its light brightening the path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cero connected with Ryan's hand there was a shock wave and an even brighter light as the two conflicting powers met. The first few lines of squad members covered their eyes from this near blinding greenish, white light. Ryan then looked back at his men with a smile on his face. He then looked down at the cero which was shortening by the second. Ryan's pure white aura overtook the cero, turning it into a white ball in his hand. He pulled his arm back then pushed back toward the darkness ahead. Not far ahead, the cero exploded and a loud roar could be heard. Followed by many more roars and the sudden spiritual pressure of many high level hollows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an army of hollows could be seen around a mile ahead. The spiritual pressure of the many hollows seemed to weigh heavily on the weaker side of my squad. Kira was one of the many who stood their ground. Yet he still had a very scared look on his face.</span></div></div>",

He had thin white half frames glasses frames and long purple fingernails. leading an army of adjuchas, Menos Grande, and huge hollows. The combined spiritual pressure of all the hollow brought most of my squad to their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man. I'm really gonna have to use it in a place like this.\" Pure white aura surrounded Ryan as he raised his spiritual pressure. The sudden rise brought the rest of the squad to their knees. The rise also seemed to slightly phase the hollows as they started coming faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurify...ALASTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></div></div>",

With my glowing white zampacto in hand, i used shunpo to get to the front lines. Again i used shunpo to get to a Menos Grande's mask. Stabbing downward into the mask. The Menos disappeared faster than i expected. I had just enough time to use the remnants of the mask as a support for my next shunpo. I then cut deep into the side of a Gillian. My speed and spiritual pressure increasing with each kill, my movements becoming faster. After each hollow died, two more took its place. The light from my zampacto zipping from every corner of the army. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leaders eyes followed me as i gained speed. He would look at me for awhile, then he would write something down on his clipboard. Finally i had enough. I jumped off the Menos' mask to get high above the hollow army. I began charging Shining Light. The surrounding area became a bright blue, lighting the entire hall. I was then hit in the back by a weak cero. The cero caused me to lose my focus and distorted the spirit particles i had gathered. Many other ceros came towards me. The blinding light forced me to close my eyes. I could then feel the force and searing pain of the ceros.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I could feel all the ceros hitting me, launching me into the ceiling. I could feel my numb body slowly slipping from inside the hole I created. As I felt life slipping away.\"Damn...\" I said in my mind.\"I can't be killed by these weaklings. Well I guess it's time\" I roared at the top of my lungs. I gathered a few spirit particles around my feet. I blasted out of the hole with a nicely powered shunpo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy once white spiritual pressure turned red. My once blue eyes turned a bright yellow as my hollow mask began to appear. Alastor pulsated with energy and excitement as we neared the hollow horde. Then Alastor Turned into Bankai without any command from Ryan. I closed my eyes and concentrated to help boost the hollow mask. Then I found I was in my inner world. I was in an empty, light blue warehouse and my sword's soul Alastor appeared before me. He looked rather skinny and wore ancient samurai armor with blue pads and under cloth. he stood there with his arms crossed and an angry look on his face.\"You can't just blast off into battle Ryan. Full power is not always needed.\" his voice boomed.\"I needed to act quickly. Now please let me go back and save my men.\"I pleaded.\"Very well. Just don't make me bring you back here or i'll let the hollow out.\"My vision returned just in time as i was very close to the hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed on my feet on a Menos Grande's mask, digging my blade in deep. i jumped up as the Menos began to disintegrate, looking back down at the hollows. Many of the adjuchas and weaker hollows were jumping and flying towards me. My mask now fully appeared gave me a boost in my speed. I focused some spiritual energy at the bottom of my feet and use that to launch me at the incoming hollows. I charged my shining light with as much spiritual energy i could cram into a few seconds. I shot it seconds before i collided with the a flying hollow. With a bright light all the flying hollows were destroyed and the tallest Menos were killed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter landing Ryan slashed at the adjuchas and smaller weaker hollow freeing up what little spiritual pressure to save his men. The leader still stood in the same spot, watching me purify his hollow soldiers. His clipboard in one hand and pen in the other still writing things on the paper. In the midst of combat I attempted to get closer but was intercepted by a much larger human-looking hollow with a zampacto and a broken mask. The remainder of his mask was only along his jaw line.I could tell he was too strong for me. He brought his blade down to chop me. I blocked his attack with my own sword. As he pushed down on my blade  I tilted mine counter clockwise, forcing his into the ground to my left, and causing the ground to distort and create a crater. i quickly used shunpo to get away from this hollow brute, landing me once again in front of the, now smaller, hollow army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the fight the surrounding spiritual pressure began to even out, letting some of my squad get to their feet. One of the first to get up was Kira. He watched his new captain destroying the hollows. None of the squad members ever thought the captain was a Vizard. After Ryan manged to shunpo close enough to the squad, they stood there both scared and amazed.\"I cant take all of the hollows alone. Now we need to...\"he was cut off by one of his men.\"Why didn't you tell us you were a Vizard. I thought we shared trust throughout the squad.\"the soldier asked nervously.\"No one ever asked, so the need to say it never came up. But now is not the time for this, we need to close them in.\"</span></div></div>",

The bigger hollow man must have took this as an insult i guessed as i could here him angrily yell \"RUSH THEM! KILL THAT BASTARD!\" I turned to the hollow crowd then said \"Way of Binding Number 81: Severing Void.\" An almost clear white barrier appeared before the hollows, bouncing them away as they tried to attack. \"NOW SECOND GROUP, ATTACK!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen i could feel a different spiritual pressure toward the entrance to the real world on the far side of the dark halls. It seemed to match that of a captain. Yet there were none in the real world at the moment. This new spiritual power caused the walls of the dark hall to distort.</span></div></div>",

As the walls pulsated with this purple light, yellow beams of light came down at random parts of the hollow horde. Then hollows could be seen flying up them. The second battalion ,which was supposed to attack, had pulled back, ending up behind the first battalion. As more light shown across the hollows, the more of my squad pulled back. Some of the beams began to shatter, killing the hollows inside. I stood in the middle of the confusion, dumbstruck. I had never seen anything like this happen before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs more of the hollows rose and more shinnigami fled I managed to get a look at this mysterious helpers back. I could tell he was a shinnigami from the black zampacto he held. After more and more hollows died and my entire squad had gone there was only the sound of explosions as his blade crashed through the barriers of the hollows. It was amazing how fast he moved and how quickly his blade sliced through hollows. I was snapped out of my trance when a stray rock hit me on the head. Then i realized the walls had begun to crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hollows were gone There was an awkward silence. The walls had momentarily stopped their crumbling but left a slight grey fog across the ground. Suddenly there was a rumble at the soul society end of the dark hall. The walls began crumbling again. blocking my way home. Suddenly i was grabbed by the back of my collar and dragged across the floor at an amazing speed. \"Is the mysterious helper saving my life, or bringing me to my death?\" My mind pondered. As i looked to see the face of this man there was a blinding light.</span></div></div>",

Thats when i realized both my kimono, and my haori had been removed. I also realized i had been cut across my side and that there were bandages covering it up. After standing up I found my zampacto wasn't in the room at all. \"Weird' I said aloud as i walked over to my kimono. As i finished sliding my arms through the holes I felt a grim presence outside of the door. I quickly jumped to my haori, grabbing it as i rolled across the floor. I used the wall as support as i readied my hands to fire my kidou. The door slowly slid open to reveal a boy around 16 years of age, with yellow hair. He was dressed in the normal shinnigami kimono and i could just barely see the hilt of his blade over his back. \"Who are you\" I demanded. \"Ichigo, Ichigo Kurosaki. I'm the substitute shinnigami.\" He responded. I slowly lowered my hands and rose from the floor. \"Are you the one from the garganta?\" i asked. \"Yea I'm the one who saved your ass.\" He said smiling. \"Don't get too excited berry, that was the first and last time you will have to save me.\" I said getting to my feet. \"Hey\" He yelled \"don't call me that. You should be grateful i was there to save you.\" I chuckled after he finished yelling. \"So where is my katana.\" I asked. \"First you tell me your name\" Ichigo Replied. \"I am the third squad captain Ryan Akechi.\" I replied. \"Now where is my Zanpakuto\" I asked eagerly. \"Urahara has it\" He responded pointing out the door. I walked out the door and put my haori on as I walked down a long empty hallway. Rounding the corner, my face was met with something blue. Taking a step back I realized it was an apron. Looking up it was a large man staring down at me. His weird mustache twirled beyond his cheeks and his black tinted glasses gleamed from the sun light behind me made him look extremely weird. He began getting closer to me as if to get a better look. I silently leaned back until my back hit the bamboo frame of the window behind me. A stare down ensued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a skinny, white hand came over the large man's shoulder. Then came a green and white striped hat followed by the voice of the man under it. \"Tessai, you'll scare him off like that\" He said. Tessai slowly backed away to reveal a smaller man behind him wearing an open, green  coat, and loud wood sandals. \"I'm Urahara\" he said proudly \"and already know what your first question may be. Your sword is in that black box over there\" He pointed over across the room. I slowly walked over toward the box only to realize there was a lock on it. I turned to Urahara, who had a small fan over his face. \"you'll have to work for it\" He said trying to supress a laugh. Angrily I turned to the box and shot a weak lightning kidou at the lock. The lock absorbed the lightning and glowed for a few seconds before it settled. Looking back at Urahara, he said \"That lock absorbs kidou and strengthens itself.\" I looked at the ceiling \"So this is what Rukia warned me about\" I thought</span></div></div>",

He has yet to discover his powers and relize his destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay now for the bio<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alex Ningeki (Duh)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: Human. Hidden Soul reaper and arrancar<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: He look a lot like Ichigo but instead of brown eyes he has Blue eyes. He wears a white T-shirt and black jeans. He always cares his lucky necklace which carrys a skull symbol (Like that on Rukia's soul glove thing.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstory: Before arriving in Karakura Orihime and Him used to chat via mail due to he never owned a computor so he is excited to see Orihime in person. (Wait til he does heheh^_^)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZanpakto: Name Sin/Saint<br>\r\nShikai<br>\r\nRealease command: Judgement!<br>\r\n             Apearence: Depending on his advesary's soul, it can be 1 of 2 forms.  <br>\r\n1. If he/she soul's majority is good. It will morph into a blade similair to rukia's zanpakto but hab a keychain attached to the bottom with angel wings. In this mode when it cuts the opponet it purifies sum of it's soul and when i defeate them their soul is purified and sent to the soul society.<br>\r\n2.If he/she soul is pure evil the blade shal become big like ichigo's and take the shape of a giant meat cleaver. When this blade strikes the opponet shearing pain shall enter the wound causing the being to cry out in pain. When it defeats a opponet in this form, it swallows the soal and glows with a red aura like that of a hollow's red eye's.<br>\r\nIf the release command is not uttered it looks just like a regular zanpakto except the blade is a mix between white and black Black being the majority due to so many evil soul's absorbed.<br>\r\nBankai<br>\r\nRealse command: Awaken (Sin/Saint depending on shikai form)<br>\r\nAppearance<br>\r\nGood: The sword remains the same. Alex's clothes become like  that of a captain's uniform thow all white and his shows are regular human feet. He also sprouts a pair of Agelic wings from his back<br>\r\nEvil: The sword splits into two of the same blades but are the same size of Ichigo's Zangetsu. Alex morphs like that of a hollow, his body becomes black and surrounded by white ribs, his legs morph into demon legs that are the color of blood,his feet become razor sharp claw-feet with nails the same color as blood. His hands remain human thow his nails grow a bit into dagger like shape and are black. And just like above he sprouts a pare of wings but instead of Angel wings the wings are black devil like wings.<br>\r\nPowers<br>\r\nGood: 1.Protect my friends: A wall of holy light surrounds Alex and his allies and cannot be pierced no matter what the attack. Note: this move can be activated when in shikai form thow coasts alot more spiritual energy.<br>\r\n          2.Save their soul: Alex's body is bathed in a holy white light as his speed is increased to that of 5 fold his original. The opponets chest opens up to reveal their soul which Alex gently grasps in his hand and crushes it turning it into a white hell butterfly and lets it go.<br>\r\nEvil: 1.Blood of the tainted shall be shed (In short:Slay my enemy): Alex's eyes glow red and so do his blades. Alex begins to laugh manicly and flash steps at his enemy before slicing them in the back severing a arm in the prossec if unlucky enough. He contiues this until his second abillity activates.<br>\r\n       2.Devour Sins: Like #2 from the Good mode the opponets chest opens up but instead of thier soul it reaveals a black heart. Alex walks up to the victim as the are paralised by his abillity(This is the same as the above 2 tho with less force used). Alex grabs their black heart and crushes it inside thier body. Thier whole body soul and all are then turned into a red orb and absorbed by Alex's blade.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Warning: To all who are Alex's commrads or friends, avoid contact with Alex when he is in his evil mode. He will do anything to destroy his enemy even if it means breaking threw the barrier between worlds. One person has the abillity to calm him in this state but the person who did it is curently unknown. We shall look into this matter and inform you more as we learn more information about this matter.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright now doesn't this sound like a interesting character to play as?

The teacher began role call as she called out a few names followed by the students to reply with here \"Ichigo Kurosaki?\" \"Here\" replied a tall teenager that looked almost exactly like Alex except for his brown eyes \"wow he looks just like me\" Alex thought as Ichigo sat down. \"Uryu Ishida\" the teaqcher called. \"Here\" replied a teenager with blue hair and glasses who was almost the same height as Ichigo just by .2 inches. \"Hm he seams like the type who enjoys peace and quiet. Hmm maybe we can become friends\"Alex asked himself. \"Orihime Inoue\" called the teacher and Alex dropped his jaw in suprise \"Orihime Inoue! Orihime my old pen pale! I'm in the same class as her\" Alex looked around and saw as Orihime stood up. She looked so beatiful and cute with her long orange hair and her blue snowflakes hair clips \"Here\" she replied with a voice to Alex atleast sounded like a angel. Alex blushed as he addmited he had grown a small crush on her from the letters she had sent him describing herself but nothing beats the real thing eh? \"Alex Ningeki\" called the teachera snapping Alex out of his daze. \"Here Miss\" Alex replied. \"Oh i see your here well please come up here and tell us about yourself\" with that Alex gulped as he felt a bit embareced but did as he was told and walked to the front of the classroom.<br>\r\n\"Hello my name is Alex Ningeki and i come from a far off place around America.\" \"Oh so you are from america i hear that place is great to vistit in the summer\" replies the teacher. \"Well yah i guess it is\" Alex chuckle and so did Orihime a little bit. As Alex contiued someone in the back asked a question about him \"Uh excuse me Alex i was wondering? Erm...\" \"Yes Chad contiue\" replied the teacher. \"Ah yes you'd like to ask what the last name Ningeki means i want to know as well\" inturpted Uryu. \"Yah me to\" IChigo added. \"I know\" Orihime replied. \"Alex bliushed a bit and she contiued \"Ningeki in some cultures it means this. Nin: Protector Geki: (of the) weak, so Alex Ningeki means Defender and protector of the weak.\" \"Wow Orihime you remebered\" Alex said with a happy grin before a uproar of questions surrounded Alex and Orihime. \"Hey how do you know Orihime\" asks a red haired female student. \"Yeah what else dfoes she know about you?\" \"How do you know her?\" The questions flooded Alex's ears and mind \"Hold on hold i'll answer them sjust back up\" he said but no one heard hm over the comosion. Alex was backed up against the window by multiple students as they pushed their questions. Alex slipped and fell threw the window sending him plumiting three stories down and on his head.OW! </span></div></div>",

His head was bleeding due to the fall but it was surprisingly only a minor bump that would heal in about a day. A blurry image covers Alex's vision as he notices something on him. He tries to knock it of with a few punches but it doesn't work when he suddenly hears a voice \"Hm it seams you can see me human. Well that means you either have immense spiritual pressure or are just really dam unlucky. Either way too bad for you fool. A sudden glint of light hit Alex's face as it reflected of a blurry image of a sword. \"Hey are you ok\" asked a familiar voice?  \"Yeah fine thanks\" Alex replies as the being gives him a hand up. Alex now standing takes a good look at his rescuer who now became as clear as day in his eyes \"Wait a minute Ich...Ichigo! Wait you save me from that thing.\" \"Yeah i did now you mind not making such a big fuss and getting back to class so no one becomes suspicious\" Ichigo points towards your body that was laying down eye's closed and out cold. He also pointed out the chain attached to your chest and explained the whole chain of fate thing to you. Alex nodded and walked back to his body before a flash of dark red light enveloped him. <br>\r\nThere standing before him beside his body was a black blade with a small amount of white on the cutting edge of the blade. Alex picked it up and in another flash of light he was now wearing robes similar to that of Ichigo's tho with one big difference his pants were just like that of his normal black jeans except they were red and he was barefoot. \u201cHey Alex are you ok\u201d asked Ichigo? \u201cYeah I'm fine but what is this thing\u201d Alex replied? \u201cAlex what you hold there is called a Zanpakto. It's like what I have here altho yours is a lot smaller\u201d Ichigo explains as he holds out his gigantic blade for an example. \u201cHm well that seams a little strange but anyway I guess I'll just get back into my body now\u201d Alex slips into his body and then returns to class. <br>\r\n\tAt the end of the day, Ichigo and the rest of the gang stop him as he was about to leave the school. \u201cHey Alex wait\u201d Alex turns around at Orihime's call to see Ichigo, Uryu,Chad, and Orihime all walking towards him. \u201cOh hey guys whats up\u201d Alex waves and slips on a smile. \u201cHey Alex are you ok\u201d asks Ichigo? \u201cNever better why do you ask\u201d Alex replies. \u201cWell its just the whole fact about that odd Zanpakto you were holding when you tried to return to your body. I've never see one like that before and I just got a strange feeling about it\u201d says Ichigo. \u201cWell I don't really think anything of it as long as it won't happen again. Right?\u201d Alex gives Ichigo a questionable eyebrow raise before a female's voice came from behind him \u201cIf you want to know more about it you should talk to me.\u201d What felt like she popped out of thin air was actual just a flip over a nearby wall and Alex didn't notice her til she spoke up. \u201cOh hey Rukia what up\u201d Orihime yells in a cheer. \u201cRukia? So you must be the black haired heroin I've heard so much about\u201d Alex bows as a good gesture to Rukia as he remembered Orihime said in one her letters that Rukia had come from a noble family. Rukia bows and then continues \u201cAlex Ningeki I heard from Orihime you'd be arriving. I wanted to meet the guy who she addmires so mu\u201d \u201cRukia no don't tell him that\u201d Orihime covers Rukia's mouth telling her to shush before she objects to the statement. \u201cAnyway\u201d Rukia removes Orihime's hand and continues \u201cFrom what I over heard you somehow posses powers like that of Ichigo's.\u201d Rukia puts on her soul glove and readies to rip out Alex's soul but before she can do that Alex's necklace reacts emitting a flash of bright light before transforming Alex into a state similar to that of his earlier encounter with the Hollow except this time he was wearing the traditional shikigami outfit along with a blade strapped to his  left side. \u201cWhat the? What happened to me\u201d Alex screamed in a moment of panic? \u201cHey Alex calm down it's okay\u201d Orihime gives Alex a small but joyful hug and Alex calms down. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why my house? And why not your place\u201d yells Ichigo with a bit of anger in his voice. \u201cWell 1. Orihime says your place is the best to have meetings and 2. I don't have a place for us to go to\u201d Alex explains and everyone nods in agreement, everyone except Ichigo that is. \u201cEr... Fine we'll all meet at my place in an hour so don't be late\u201d Ichigo says before walking off towards his house. \u201cAlright we'll meet at Ichigo's in a hour. Alex I recommend staying with someone until we can figure out a way to turn you back\u201d Rukia says pointing a finger at the remaining three. Uryu and Chad quickly step aside leaving Orihime to be left.\u201dHuh oh ok I keep Alex company until the rendezvous\u201d with that Orihime grabs Alex's hand and the two speed off towards her house leaving Rukia, Chad, and Uryu in a giant dust cloud.<br>\r\nFour Minutes later at Orihime's house...<br>\r\nAs the two arrive at the house Orihime notices Alex unconscious, she turns around letting go of his hand and shakes him awake. Alex wakes up a minute later and they both go inside. \u201c Wow Orihime! This is your house\u201d  Alex was amazed as when he talked to Orihime via letters she never told him about her house. It was about as what you can expect a normal house could be but she had picture of various people all along the walls to the up stairs. Upstairs there was just a living room area and a kitchen but Alex didn't mind. He took a seat at the small table in the center of the room and Orihime brings him a glass of ice cold lemonade. \u201cThank you Orihime\u201d Alex says as she hands him a glass before she herself pours herself a glass and sits down. \u201cSo how was the trip here\u201d asked Orihime? \u201cAh pretty good at least I didn't have to use the alternative way\u201d Alex replied remembering the alternative way here. It was his mother's idea to use some spell or something to teleport him here but she hadn't been here in so long so Alex didn't trust her aim. He just remembered something else about his mother and it was the fact she never told him she was human tho she did look it. <br>\r\nShe had pale white skin and wore a beautiful black gown. Her red eyes looked like the color of red though she didn't look evil not to him at least. He voice was calm and gentle like that of Orihime's tho at a different tone (Alex's mother's voice would be the english voice for the arrancar Halibel). She would always be kind and gentle to those smaller or weaker than her and she would never hurt anyone tho she did spare a lot with his father Ningeki. Oh yes she did live up to her name, Kemay (Pronounces Key may). It meant elegant rose where Alex came from.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His ruddy hair hangs in his face. His mother wants to give him a haircut, so he is constantly locked in combat with a pair of scissors. He also has a pair of brown eyes that divulge none of the inner workings of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZanpaku-t\u014d: Shining Silver-Haired Lovely-Locked Wonder, Ace Romantic Adonis 'Shing-Shing' Charlemagne IV! (Male.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikai Release Phrase: Pirouette of the Winter Doe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikai Form: Bedazzled with purple and red rhinestones, with strands of Nooitgedacht pony hair coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBankai Form: A 6\"9' long blade that is somewhat jagged, similar to that of a bread knife, only is bright amethyst when it catches the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBankai power: A stream of bright pink ribbons ensnare the enemy while diminishing their ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownside: It diminishes your own ego, and ribbons aren't that strong to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Justin works hard but is taken advantage of by the higher-ups due to his reputation as a pushover. Is underappreciated but determined to rise up to the ranks and one day be the greatest Soul Reaper ever. Yeah, like that'll happen. While Justin mostly works as a lowly custodian, he has his own Zanpaku-t\u014d and is often forced into tasks others do not wish to complete. Whether or not you choose him decides if he will spend the rest of his life working like a pack mule or become a heroic figure that has his scorners bowing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdonis Charlemagne IV got his name not only from his endlesslly flowing silver tresses but because he is totally hip with the ladies. The 'Shing-Shing' part comes from the noise he makes when removed from the sheath. It is no different than any other sword, by the way. He is incredibly flamboyant, his favorite thing is himself and he bosses Justin around just like everybody else.</span></div></div>",

Boy, does he look horrified to see you are in possession of that paper. He also looks like he just spent the entirety of last night drinking sake but you ignore that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh... Frank,\" he begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Justin,\" you correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, of course,\" Akechi says, and continues in a desperate tone, \"Listen, I'll really be needing that paper back. You didn't read it, did you?\"</span></div></div>",

Draco didn't know just how strong or dangerous anything or anyone was here so took the caution of lowering his reiatsu as much as he could, even removing his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco cautiously peered around the corner of the tree he was behind watching as two figures drew closer and finally landed next to his kill. Draco could feel each of them was at least as powerful as his father, but they both carried Zampacto wereing clothing similar to his mother's. Wondering if they might actually be Soul Reaper Draco inspected both closely trying to listen in on any conversation they might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco quickly noticed that the one on the left with spikey orange hair had had a huge Zampacto, bigger than any Draco had previously seen. He also had an air about him that seemed strangely familier to Draco, but Draco couldn't put his finger on it. Draco was sure that in a fight he would be the toughest of the two to bring down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was much smaller in both stature and blade size with smooth hair as dark as the sky of his home land. While she was obviously weaker of the two she was studying the hollow he'd killed with much greater intensity and care.

Draco decided to try and hide among the many stone structures that the two Soul Reapers had come from in hopes of losing them jumping off a ledge to save time. Only to notice in midair that the paths between the structures were flooded with more of the strange maskless inhabitants of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco crashed into the ground and tried to run without being spotted just to notice that aside from the two chasing him almost nobody seemed to even notice he was there. Draco paused and waved his hands in front of some of the inhabitants eyes to see if they reacted but they didn't. Before Draco could investage further he heard Ichigo shout, \"Hey you wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco felt some of his hairs stand on end as he resumed running as fast as he could heading for something he recoginzed, water. Draco dove in and swam quickly upstream and hid under a large structure spanning the river gasping for breath and pausing for a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mere seconds he heard Ichigo say, \"Damn I lost him, any idea who that was Rukia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've never seen him before in my life,\" Rukia said, \"Strange that a fellow Soul Reaper would run from us though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco bristled at being called a Soul Reaper but remained quiet and hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" Ichigo said, \"I we see him again we'll just have to ask. Come on the others are probably starting to worry about us by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco heard the two leaving but continued to to hold his breath for several seconds before sighing and sitting down. It had been a rough day so far for him, several hours of sitting bored among the dunes before having to hunt a weak little hollow and ending up in a strange world he'd never seen before. Not only that he'd had to remove his mask, something he hadn't done in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco looked at his reflection and was surprised by how much his face had changed since he had last seen it. His face no longer has any of its boyhood chubbyness, it was now a long lean face of a warrior unmarred by scars or any other blemishes. He felt his slightly pointed chin and distinctive cheekbones as well as his short long nose, all that paired with his glinting hazel eyes made him look damn good. If no one in this world wore a mask he might just stay like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's thoughts were disturbed by the sound of footsteps coming to a stop behind him as he slowly looked to see...</span></div></div>",

His father would then go on some wild rant about how back in his day he didn't get a Soul Reaper helping him transform or housing him, he had to do it for himself.

Bright amber eyes, is usually very expressive with her face. Has a decent chest(B-cup), waist, and hips. Wears a snow hat with a skull motif, along with normal clothes she <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">steals</span> finds. Finally, she has a spiked tail, kinda like a anklyosaur. <br>\r\n(Hollow Form): She still has her snow hat, but now has claws, Shark-like teeth, has a gray cape that can transform into wings, her spiked tail looks more deadly. Has super strength, and can regenerate small wounds in minutes(deeper ones take hours.) Finally, Eve gains fur that is the same color as her hair. That and the fact she gains a foot in height.(In case you can't tell what Eve is supposed to be, she's a chimera.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Very kind; Kinda tomboyish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZampacto: A normal sword that looks more like a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: Can manipulate her blood into either spikes, a blast, or even grow extra arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikai Release Phrase: \"Roar, my blade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikai Form: Her sword grows larger, and gains serrated teeth around the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Although she's far from stupid, Eve is very kind-hearted. She will also do anything for her little brother, Max Noone(Read bio).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: <b>Originally Eve Noone, she lived a normal, everyday life, along with her brother Max, alone in a house after their parents death. That is, until a Hollow attacked both Eve and Max after middle school. She pushed her bro out of the way, and was rewarded with a stab to the gut. She passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later, Eve wakes up and hears her brother crying in the graveyard some odd blocks away. When she got there, Max was crying near a grave that said \"Here lies Eve Noone\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, she turned to him and asked him what was wrong. Max, startled at the voice that seemingly came out of nowhere, looked beside him and was rewarded with a confused..... something looking at him. He screamed, before he ran away. Eve quickly followed, unsure about what Max screamed at. That is, until she looked at a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she was scared, but after a few minutes, she got used to seeing her body like this(Wow, that's fast). She went to her house and knocked on the door, hoping that Max was here. He was, and after her telling him that she was not only her sister she also mentioned her mysterious year-long coma/transformation. Reluctantly, Max let the creature in. There, Max told Eve his tale; Not long after her death, he's been seeing spirits that no one else can see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a connection, the duo teamed up to figure out both the mysterious \"Soul Reapers\" and what the creatures they are fighting are. Who knows, maybe they will find a few things about what happened to them!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do you want to choose this character?</span></div></div>",

Her eyes are replaced with reptilian eyes and she grows poisonous fangs.  In this form, her already considerable speed, agility, and strength are greatly increased <br>\r\nRessureccion 2: same as other form, except she grows three wings (blades instead of feathers) her tail length grows to 20ft, and she grows an extra arm under her right arm. Her physical abilities are improved further.<br>\r\nHollow true form: a giant (20 feet long) serpent with blades for scales 3 large wings sprouting from it, blades instead of feathers.  Occasionally, there will be an eye replacing a scale. <br>\r\nPersonality: cheerful shinigami, though very straightforward, and not that observant.  She is smart and strong though and values other lives above her own.  She holds a hatred for hollows and arrancar much greater than other shinigami.  Because of her hollowfication (she ended up getting turned into what she hated) she is prone to occasional depression and moodiness, but she tries not to let hollowfication keep her down.<br>\r\nBio: The former 4th seat of the fifth division (Aizen's squad), maybe she is not as devoted to Aizen as Momo is, but she still never suspected Aizen of being a traitor.  However, her lack of observation did make her an easy target for Aizen's experimented.  Close to when Rukia was sentenced to death, Keiko was confronted by Gin, Aizen, and Tosen.... Tosen bested her easily, and she was put through hollowfication.  Distraught by her own transformation, and now having the seretei as an enemy if they found out, Keiko faked her death and fled to the human world (Karakura).  She took a gi with her, and currently works in a convenience store, occasionally rising up to slay the occasional arrancar/hollow.  She is incredibly lonely and longs for companionship.  This will take place a little before Inoue was kidnapped.<br>\r\nOther notes:<br>\r\nShe's incredibly bad at kido<br>\r\nMuch to her dismay, she's incredibly talented at using hollow powers, not needing any training to mantain her hollow mask for close to 11 hours, and unlocking her resereccion soon afterwards.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Brown, straight hair that ends at around his neck. White skin color. And is almost always seen with a great big smile plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZanpakuto: Aboost-to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikai Release Phrase: Fly away! Aboost-to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikai Form: Suriu's Zanpakuto transforms into two 6' angel wings that are sharper than normal steel, which Suriu duel wields. Wings also begin to glow a faint sky blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikai Power: With every strike the wings make, as long they hit a part of his opponent, the wings becomes faster and lighter. Enabling easier sword strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBankai Form: The two wings fuse with Suriu and turn into a transparent sky blue color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBankai power: The two wings on Suriu's back draw forth his full potential, enabling Suriu to move 10x faster than Flashstep. Also enables him to be in up to four places once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownside: Being in more than one place at the same time puts a lot of strain on Suriu's body. If he doesn't stop to relax after a time, he could end up destroying his own body from moving so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Suriu was a prime candidate for becoming a member of Aizen's army. He was tricked into luring other Soul Reapers who were onto Aizen's plan into a trap. But when Suriu learned of the fate that awaited them, he was too late to save them. And ended up being forced to the brink of death by Aizen's hands. If it had not been for his Zanpakuto skipping Shikai and going straight into his Bankai state, he would've died that day. Ever since that day, Suriu spends most of his time training with the other Soul Reapers. Preparing for the day when he'll get to fight Aizen once again.</span></div></div>",

During these 10 years I had trained both my mind and body, but nothing prepared me for what happened next. A shinigami that I didn't recognize appeared before me and told me that Captain Aizen of the 5th division had betrayed the Soul Society and had gone to Hueco Mundo along with Captains Ichimaru and Tousen. I was ordered to return to Soul Society at once and help restore balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving I went to see my master and when I saw him I said, \"Master I thank you for teaching me all these years, but the time has come for me to leave you.\"<br>\r\nHe just looked at me and said \"heh, It was time for you to leave 2 years ago.
