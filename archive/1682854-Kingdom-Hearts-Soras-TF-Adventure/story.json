Before he did though he figured he'd check the Secret Place, just to make sure everything was still fine. Everything was fine, but as he turned to leave something glinted in the corner of his eye. Deciding to take a closer look Sora approached the glinting object. On closer inspection it was revealed to be a crystal, kind of like a gummi only clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Sora grabbed the crystal a powerful bolt of static leapt to his hands and when he looked again he saw the crystal was gone. \"What just happened?\" he asked to nobody in particular. Shrugging it off he headed for his boat and began making his way back to the main island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

I'd best get home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora lay in bed, feeling woozy still, and got out his scrapbook.

Um.\" Sora didn't really know how to react to this. In the mirror were two Kairi's both wearing matching leopard print bikinis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm confused. You're not mad at me?\" Sora asked her as he turned to face her. \"Nope. Not at all! In fact I'm kind of impressed.~ Now I don't have to be the only one in our relationship that looks good in a bikini.

Besides we both look rather ravishing in them, don't we?~\" Kairi asked Sora in a seductive tone. \"Y-Yeah.\" Sora smiled as she strutted over to the mirror and posed as well, looking at his and Kairi's curves. \"This is a sight I could get used to seeing every day.\" Sora chuckled a bit. \"That's the spirit Sora!\" Kairi smiled as she wrapped an arm around Sora's hip, which in turn made Sora buck her hip at Kairi's, much to her amusement. \"So, what's the plan now Kairi?\" Sora asked her again as she had a hand around Kairi's hip as well. \"I'm thinking that we could-</span></div></div>",

You can change others, right?\" she asked him. \"I think so... I haven't tried it, but it's certainly worth a shot.\" Sora nodded to her. \"Alright. So I'll call Riku up and tell him to meet up with me here... you're gonna hide when he gets here and change him when he's too distracted by me in my bikini.\" Kairi explained to him as she called Riku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several moments later before a knock on the door could be heard. Sora immediately ran into the closet and hid, waiting to make his move... Riku had just entered the house. As Riku entered the house he called out to her, wondering where she was. He proceeded to check out every room till reaching her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised to see Kairi clad in nothing but a leopard print bikini. \"K-Kairi... Wh-Why are you wearing that?\" he asked her. Kairi giggled a bit. \"You'll see in a second. Now, Sora!\" she signaled to Sora as Sora opened the closet door and looked at Riku, his eyes glowing a bit as well as Riku's, which caused Riku to start changing... A few moments later Riku's transformation was complete and he was now an identical copy of Kairi wearing his regular clothes(Which were too loose on him now).

Kairi and Sora smiled at Riku and handed him a leopard print bikini. \"How many of those did you get anyway Kairi?\" Sora asked her. \"Enough.\" was her only response as Riku entered the closet to change into his new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku strutted out clad in the leopard print bikini and hugged both Sora and Kairi, all of their breasts pressing up against one another and Riku's hands on both Sora and Kairi's butts. \"This is rather nice.\" Riku admitted to his friends before turning his attention to Kairi and kissing her firmly on the lips, which made her giggle in response. \"Don't think you're counted out of this too, Sora.~\" Riku kissed him on the lips as well before turning his attention towards the mirror and posing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora couldn't believe this sight for a moment. Looking at the mirror, he could see three Kairis clad in nothing but leopard print bikinis, the wildest part of the whole thing was that him and Riku made up 2/3 of the Kairis he was staring at. \"Thanks guys.~\" Riku smiled to his friends as he posed. \"Hey, anything for our best friend, right Sora?\" Kairi smiled. Sora was too busy checking Riku, Kairi and himself out in the mirror. \"Distracted, now are we Sora?\" Kairi giggled deviously and groped Sora's butt from behind, resulting in Sora moaning sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku couldn't help but laugh a bit at Sora, which resulted in Sora retaliating by going over to Riku and pulling him into a hug, their breasts pressing up against each other and both of them letting out a moan before Sora pulled out of the hug and giggled a bit at Riku's reaction. \"H-Hey! You moaned too you know!\" Riku countered as Kairi was just giggling at the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora and Riku smirked to one another as Sora went in front of Kairi and Riku behind her. Kairi seemed rather confused and a bit flustered by this before, Riku started caressing Kairi's thighs, making her moan a bit before Sora kissed her on the lips, Sora giggling after breaking out of the kiss and looking at a blushing Kairi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, we need a plan for what to do next.\" Riku stated to his friends. \"I propose that we-\"</span></div></div>",

Sora in her body, was just off shore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a curse (and letting go of Sora's cock), Kairi scrambled to get Sora's speedo on and cover up before Sora or anyone else could see her. She quickly however ran into a rather <i>hard</i> problem, that <i>really</i> didn't want to be sealed away again so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi, close to panicking...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sora went in, dripping wet, wearing only a bikini. He went upstairs, into kairi's room. As her best friend, He'd been here quite a lot. The Walls were pink and skyblue, with pictures of her, Sora and Riku all over. There was a bookshelf, full of what appeared to be quite long, complicated novels. Then there was her make up stuff, which puzzled Sora, as she never used it. There were drawers of clothes, a big oak wardrobe, Next to the wardrobe was a large mirror, and finally kairi's bed, which lay at the far end of the room. <br>\r\n\"So, thechnically, this rooms mine?\" Sora said \"Well, it should be a fun night then!\"<br>\r\n\"First I should get changed\" he thought \"The moment of truth...\"   He unhooked the the bikini, which basically flew off (He did think it was a bit tight) and his cleavage was released, now laying upon his chest. He walked over to the mirror. \"Holy crap\" he thought. They were huge! Like melons! He placed his and on the nipple, which was firm, and felt really good. <br>\r\n\"Why hello girls, I don't believe we've met\" sora said, giggling. He started rubbing them vigorously, just feeling the pleasure. \"yeah baby! Keep going!\" he said, his breasts jiggling madly. After a few minutes he decided to stop. Fun was fun, But kari was his best friend, and he still had respect for her.<br>\r\n\"best get changed then, hadn't I\" he said. He pulled out Bra from the Drawer, a nice pink one, and checked the label.<br>\r\n\"Woah Kairi, 36D! That's amazing!\" he said in disbelieve. He had a struggle getting it on though, but finally<br>\r\nmanaged it.

What havoc and fun can this cause on Destiny Islands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbility description:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorph: Changes shape, but not powers. So he could look like Riku, buthe'd still wield his own Keyblade and not the Way to Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwap: Switches bodies and therefore Sora gets the powers of the body he's in. However he can't morph while swapped and has to at least be looking at the swappee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters (All in KH2 clothes):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora (Main)<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\nAthletic, tanned, brown hair, blue eyes... if you know Kingdom Hearts than you know what he looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nLeanly muscular, platinum hair, teal eyes, again if you know KH you know what he looks like. For the purposes of this interactive he's had a bit of a haircut since KH2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\nReddish-brown hair, athletic, blue eyes, same as the above two, you should know who she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelphie<br>\r\nAge: 14<br>\r\nBrown hair, athletic, green eyes, you can invent her 'KH2 outfit'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWakka<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nRed hair, muscular, brown eyes, free control over his 'KH2 outfit'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus<br>\r\nAge: 14<br>\r\nBlond hair, athletic, teal eyes, again free control over 'KH2 outfit'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas and Namine are also sort of characters given that they're part of Sora and Kairi. Either way they're viable full-morph options. You can add other characters as you see fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Third-person perspective.<br>\r\n2. Try not to make it all slash please. Not saying you can't do them, just try to keep it under control. Canon couples can be just as fun.<br>\r\n3. Don't get too descriptive with sex please.<br>\r\n4. Try to use good spelling and grammar. We're not perfect, I know, but don't type in script format, in l33t or in text message type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan't think of anything else to add here. Remember Destiny Islands is not just the little island from the first game, it also includes the much larger island seen briefly in the second game.</td>",
