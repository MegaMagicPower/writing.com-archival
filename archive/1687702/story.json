As soon as you hide the unconscious guard another group of men come into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            They questioned you but were more preoccupied with helping the near death Bear. They made a makeshift stretcher and rolled him back down the caverns and into a service elevator. After a long ride you reach the floor they were using as a personal medical facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             You followed the group to where the leaders were standing in-front of a window. Inside a few medics wheeled in the heavily wounded Bear. This gave you a chance to see the other three. The Crow, the team leader wore a gas mask the eye lenses tented a crimson color, a black tactical helmet with a yellow stripe in the middle of the helmet that extended from front to back. He carried a silenced mp5, an identical handgun to your own on his side, and lastly a combat knife in his tactical vest. He was about your own height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding behind him were the Hawk and Viper. The Hawk wore a tactical helmet with a single goggle over his left eye, he wore a black bandana around his mouth. He carried a DSR-1. He was taller than you by a slight bit. And finally the Viper who you didn't know much about him, he was short only standing 5'4 at most and wearing a urban hood which covered his head and body, though you couldn't see his face. The only visible weapons you could see were two twelve inch blades on either hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          After a few minutes none other than Anya entered as one medic exited and walked up to her. \" He's stabilized. He has a punctured lung, his leg is fractured as well. We can save him, but he won't be nearly combat ready.\" Anya sighed heavily at the news \" very well, do what you can.\" Her heavy British accent rang out as she looked up at Crow. \" This doesn't happen again, am I clear?\" He nodded \" Yes mam, it won't. Bear underestimated Coyote, I'll see to it that it won't.\" Anya glared at you before turning on her heel and walking down the hall way. Her sharp footsteps echoing as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you follow her?</span></div></div>",

It was the Crow tackling you to the ground. The Hawk aiming at you from a distance with a scorpion sub machine gun. You barely were able to stand as Crow knees you in the gut, forcing you to your own knees. \" Good fight Coyote, luckily Anya wants you alive.\" Before you could react he slams the butt of his weapon on the top of your head, knocking you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Each of your limbs were cuffed to a metal chair to prevent you from escaping. Soon enough the lights flicked on revealing you were in a windowless room. Soon enough your captors entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 Anya was the first to walk up to you with Crow standing behind her, towering over her slender frame. \" Well Coyote, it seems your skill, or luck has faltered. Regardless you were most impressive at evading detection, improvising, disguising yourself.\" She counted on her fingers as she walked around you, her heels clacking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \" Oh, and nearly killing the Bear. Now what I can't figure is what your here for.\" She stared directly into your eyes, a smile of satisfaction on her face.\" What is your mission here?\" Your only response is grinning right back at her. She slowly stood back up before stepping back. \" Make him talk Commander. Just don 't kill him, not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Crow moves about the room getting prepared to interrogate you. He retrieved two buckets of water, a rag, a nightstick, and his combat knife. Both the Viper and Hawk were standing by in case he asked theme to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      Anya tapped her foot   \" How did you arrive, by what means.\"  You lie saying by submarine. \" What fools do you take us for?\" She nodded at Crow who jabbed you in the stomach with the knightstick before brutally slamming it on your back. You cough and sputter as Anya waits for an answer. You give none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" Very well, what do you have in ways of reinforcements?\" You lie once again. The crow places his knife at your fingertips before sticking it under your middle fingers nail. The pain was intense making you feel that would cut clear through, before this he pulls it out again and repeats the process with every finger. You say nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Anya getting frustrated turns to walk out.  \" I have work to do. Punish him.\" Crow kicks you in the stomach causing the chair to slam on it's back. He proceeded to place the rag over your face and steadily poured the water over the cloth. It went on for a minute before he removed it to prevent you from blacking out. He repeats this four more times. You weren't sure how much longer you could keep this up, luckily Crow tires of this and orders guards to toss you into a holding sell in the police station.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   The guards tossed you onto the bed and left. \" Keep an eye on him.\" Your torturer told Viper before leaving. You lied their racked with pain, your fingertips bleed, your back is twitching in pain from the beating, and you were on the brink of passing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               You noticed the Viper looking at you with sympathy in her eye's. She quickly turns around to hide her expression. As you tried to fight the feeling of sleep creeping, you noticed the woman singing quietly to herself , or you possibly. ( Her singing: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://youtu.be/w9pXsWlDi7k\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/w9pXsWlDi7k</a> ) You no longer fight it and close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             You awake with a jolt hours later.
