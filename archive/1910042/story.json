You had just redecorated your room and now you are looking for something new. <br>\r\nYou haven't found anything special, just some old clothes your parents used to wear, Stacy's baby clothes, nothing but clothes. Your parents should have something useful around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice out the corner of your eyes a box lying on top of a shelve. What was weird about it, was the material of the box. It looks way much older than your parents boxes. You check it out, moving some boxes around. When you almost grab it, you feel the box beneath you giving away. The contents of the box spill, some old clothes, and you fall down. You feel the pain in your back, as you get up. Everyone must have heard you in the house. Luckily the content of the box didn't break as it landed on you.You put the box on the ground as you open it. You only see three things: a note, an old bottle of water and a golden bowl. You read the note as first. It explains the purpose of the bowl, it seems the bowl is capable of switching bodies. The bottle contains ordinary water, but you need to pour it into the bowl. Only when the bowl is drunk out of, people can switch with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're done reading, you hold the bowl in your hand. You wonder if it's true and who you should try it on.You fill the bowl with water, nothing happens yet. Suddenly the door to the attic opens, startling you. You let the bowl out of your hand, but you catch it just in time, seeing a drop land on the floor. You look up to see who it is startling you. You see... standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mother examines it carefully, looking at it from several perspectives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hon, but that's no gold.\" She says giving it back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

She read what was on the piece of paper and then frowned at you. \"Body swaps? Really honey?\" she said, her tone dripping with skepticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why else would something like this exist? And with a bottle of old water too, it looks a little cloudy doesn't it?\" you said, holding up the bottel than you found with the bowl and the mysteriously written note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart, this isn't Disney, things like body switching just don't happen. But I'm willing to try drinking from it with you just to prove that I'm right of you like?\" your mother told you, as she put her hands on her hips. As she took a deep breath you saw her ample bosom heave and drop again. Without uttering another word you poured the contents of the bottle into the bowl and then smirked at your mother. \"Okay, lets do it\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if that water makes me sick, you're grounded for a month young man!\" your mother warned you in her usual firm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever!\" you laughed, before taking a sip from the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as you swallowed, the taste was a little bitter. \"Well, what's it taste like? Let me guess....12-month old water?\" your mom joked, as she took the bowl out of your hands and held it under her nose for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its tickling my throat a little, but it doesn't taste that bad. Kinda like...flavored water\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother shrugged, then took a sip of the water herself from the opposite side of the golden bowl. She then licked her lips, and experienced the same tickling sensation that you had just moments before. \"You're right, it tastes like raspberry-flavored water\" she said, before putting the bowl down. \"Now come on, lets get finished with these boxes\" your mother said, as you just frowned and looked down at the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to take a step forward...you were hit by a wave of dizziness, the whole attic seemed to spin for a moment and then just as quickly as it had started...it ended. Your vision returned clear as day, but there was something not quite right. You felt a lot hotter than you did a moment ago, and there was added weight that seemed to be pulling on your chest. You sighed and took a look down at yourself...only to be greeted by the sight of your mother's cleavage. \"Holy shit!!\" you blurted out loud as you reached up with your manicured hands to grab your new 'assets'. \"I'm....MOM!\" you exclaimed in your mother's familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!!\" you suddenly heard your old voice call out behind you, causing you to spin around.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead of berating you for groping her boobs in front of her, your mother's hand simply went for her crotch and felt the 'growing bulge' that was present there. \"Oh my!!\" she mumbled in embarrassment and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...it worked! We switched bodies!!\" you said, as he then swept your mom's hair from your face. \"I mean...we really did!\" you added, as you looked down at your floral patterned dress and the espadrilles you now wore on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't believe it!\" your mother gasped, shaking her head as she experienced her first erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!!\" you said in excitement, eliciting an agreeing nod from your mom. Both of you then automatically looked at the bowl with the water still inside, and you knew that it was responsible for the swap. \"So mom...how's it feel?\" you suddenly asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's what feel?\" your mother answered, clearly distracted by the 'stirring' in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a hard-on!\" you smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John!!\" she exclaimed in surprise, striking a feminine pose in your body, which just didn't look right with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...don't do that, you're making me look gay\" you joked, before turning your attention back to your new body. \"I suddenly know why girls always have a smile on their face\" you muttered, heaving your mother's boobs in your slender hands. That was when she stepped forward and slapped 'your' hands away from her boobs. \"Stop that you little pervert, I'm still your mother remember, have some respect\" she admonished you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah okay...whatever!!\" you groaned in typical teenage fashion. Except it sounded funny in your mother's adult tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should swap back\" your mother then suggested, before a look of fear appeared on your former face. \"We...CAN...swap back right? We're not stuck like this?\" she asked you, causing you to just shrug your slender shoulders. \"I don't know\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've got an idea!\" you grinned, feeling mischievous. \"Why don't we trick two other people into drinking the water?\" you suggested to your mother, who you could see was anxious to reach down her pants and satisfy her erection in some way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you had flipped on it...and you'd lost, so you honored the agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking charge, your mother then took careful hold of the bowl and you made your way down into the kitchen, where Stacey was sat eating a bowl of cereal and reading a magazine. Stacey was wearing a pink t-shirt, a pair of jeans and some ballet flats, which she was slipping her feet in and out of under the table as she tended to do. Her long brown hair was fastened into a tidy ponytail to keep it out of her face while she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom!\" she said, looking up at you. And for a moment you wondered why she had called you that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...right!\" you chuckled quietly, grabbing your boobs briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick slap to your arm from your mother made you pull your hands away just as Stacey looked up again. \"Did you just hit mom??\" she asked your mother, who was still inhabiting your teenage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, course she...er...he didn't sweetie\" you replied with a chuckle, looking between them. \"If there's any hitting to be done around here I'll be the one doing it\" you then smirked, striking a 'authorative' pose in your mom's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push it!\" your mother mumbled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down at the table opposite Stacey and picked up the newspaper, while your mom put the bowl of magic water on the table. She then sat down at the head of the table, where she normally sat. After a while, Stacey looked up again and realized she was being 'watched'. \"What?\" she asked, shrugging her shoulders. \"And why is there a bowl of water on the table mom?\" she asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was grin in response, which sort of freaked your sister out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only your mother clearing 'your' throat that stopped you and your sister from staring at each other. And then...the back door opened and in walked your father, dirty from work as usual and wearing his illuminous jacket, khaki shirt, scruffy jeans and steel toe-capped boots. \"Hey guys!\" he greeted you all, then to your surprise...even shock...he came over to you and planted a kiss on your cheek. \"Hi sweetie!\" he said to you, as you recoiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed your mother stifling a giggle in your body, and you frowned at her. \"Um...hi!\" you then said to your dad, somewhat nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom watsed no time in enacting her plan. \"Here 'dad', taste this new flavored water\" she said to her husband. \"Hmm, I prefer beer, but okay\" your dad responded with a deep chuckle, as he took a sip out of the bowl. He then licked his lips and frowned a little. \"Not bad, a little bitter though\" he said, before putting the bowl back down. As your dad took his jacket and boots off and washed his hands and face in the sink, your mom reached over and pushed the bowl in front of your sister. \"Here, have a taste!\" she told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey just stared at your mom blankly, not knowing that you and her had switched bodies.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was an unexpected development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStacey has a good point,\u201d chuckled dad. \u201cIf they want to market that new flavored water, why dump it in a dog's water dish? It isn't too bad though, honey. Just a little bitter. But you definitely lose points on presentation if you expect people to lap up water from a water dish like a household pet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn't a water dish,\u201d you start to protest, but mom nudges you to be silent. She gestures to you that she'll handle the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the commercials, they say pouring the water into a bowl allows its fragrance to breath,\u201d improvises your mother. \u201cSomething about more surface area exposed to the air. Plus, there's just the exotic ambiance of being served in a golden bowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, I'm not still not going to drink from a bowl,\u201d says Stacey, getting up and leaving the room. \u201cI'm meeting Linda.

Yeah. You, uh, go have fun and things. I'll stay here at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey gives you a weird look, but just shrugs and starts to head for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to come too, John?\u201d she calls out to your mother. You sometimes spend time hanging out with Stacey and Linda. Despite their younger age, the girls are pretty cool and the three of you have become decent friends over the years. It's not that unusual for you and Stacey to go meet Linda on the weekends and spend some time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d grins your mom, with a weird expression on her face now. \u201cYes, Stacey. In fact, I'd love to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide in panic. Why is mom leaving you here trapped in her body? What's she got planned now? And what about the soul-swapping bowl? Your dad has already drunk from it \u2013 the next person to drink from that bowl, should switch with your dad! It seems unwise to leave the bowl here, unguarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut but but \u2026\u201d you stammer as Stacey and your mom head out the front door to meet Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later, Mom!\u201d says your own mother to you as she exits the house.</span></div></div>",

You had to say you were looking for it!  Why not say you were looking for a purse or a scarf?  Stupid!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Dad expects you to change into the uniform.  You reluctantly put the uniform on the bed and start to pull the dress over your head.  Its not easy, what with the wider hips and prominent thrust of your new breasts getting in the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me give you a hand, honey!\"  Your father says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear the desire in his voice, which oddly excites you.  One hand pulls the dress over your mother's baby-maker hips while his other hand gets a firm grasp on your behind, sending a strangely pleasant feeling through your new body.  As the dress approaches your big breasts he pulls his hand free from your rear and grasps one breast at a time, gently moving your sensitive top-heavy flesh about so the dress continues to rise, as do the nipples under your bra, responding to his firm masculine touch.  Finally, the dress goes over your head, your hair flying about your face as the hair gets pulled through the top of the dress.  Your father throws it on a chair with a laugh of success.  You see your new body in the mirror.  All you have on is a bra, panties, and a pair of high heeled shoes.  Your mind wants to run away but your body wants... more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father picks you up with ease, something he hasn't done since you were a small boy, and gently carries you to the bed.  He touches your body in ways he never did when you were a child.  You could feel a finger of the hand grabbing your bottom slip into what you think is your new vagina.  Such a strange feeling but it is a good one!  Putting you down, Dad reaches behind you and undoes the clasps of your mother's D-cup bra...  Your big boobs bounce free, jiggling like sexy jello.  You giggle at the thought, which only turns your father on more, as he thinks you are enjoying his touches.  Maybe you are...?  Who are you kidding!  You have never felt so... alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting all day to do this...\" he says to you as his hands stroke your big boobs.  Your already swelling nipples seem to double in size as he begins to touch them.  The sensations almost make you faint.  It's weird enough to have boobs attached to your chest but to have them touched in such intimate ways...  'It feels oh soooooo good!' you think to yourself as your dad leans in for a kiss!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his lips approach yours, you...</span></div></div>",

The sex had left you exhilarated and you sat their panting. In truth, you were panting not just because of the sex, but because you also were really scared at what you had just done - and quite enjoyed. <i>What had you just done? What if mom found out?<br>\r\n</i> Slowly, the warmth and afterglow in your midsection dies down and you start to come to your senses. It is suddenly clear how impulsive your mom's female hormones had just made you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad rolls over to start falling asleep. Thankfully he did not seem interested in cuddling with you. In shock, you look down to see your white panties around your knees. You see a bit of semen dripping from your vagina on to the bed sheet. <i>Oh shit, dad didn't use a condom. What if I got mom pregnant?</i> Quickly, you pull the panties up to your crotch. The absence between your legs still felt weird, but it felt a lot less weird than the sex you had just had. The panties stop the semen from dripping on to the bed. You see the matching bra on the floor beside the bed, but you are too embarrassed to move to grab it and decide to leave it their. Instead, you sit up on the bed, pull your knees to your breasts, and then place yourself under the covers of the bed. As you lay your head on the pillow, your dad's heavy breathing beside you reminds you what you just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night sweetie\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night\" you whisper, lost in your confusion. You lie their for a while, scared to move lest you be reminded of the sticky feeling between your legs or the large breasts on your chest. You stare at the ceiling until you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake to the morning sun peering into the window. As you move to turn over, you are shocked as breasts flail on your chest. You quickly remember what happened the night before. You look beside you to see your dad is no longer in bed with you. You quickly get out of bed and go into the bathroom connected to your parent's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you come into the bathroom, you look into the mirror to see that your mom's shoulder-length brown hair is a mess from the night before. You also notice that your crotch feels a little sore. You also have to pee. You realize to hide what you have done, you will have to clean up, even if you don't want to face the current reality of your situation. You turn on the shower and step in to clean the sins of the previous night from your mother's flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull down your panties and leave them on the bathroom floor. You then step into the warm water of the shower. The difference in your body is immediately apparent as the water drapes your hair across your head and runs down your breasts. Not wanting to have to think about it, you decide to just pee as you shower. Peeing felt really similar to doing it as a guy, and peeing in the shower meant you could partially ignore the fact you had a vagina between the legs as the pee blended with the shower stream. After this, you scrub your body thoroughly with soap, trying not to focus on last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the shower, you grab a towel and dry off thoroughly. You then grab another towel and after a few tries you manage to wrap it around your hair to dry. You didn't want to worry about making your mom's hair look good since you knew you would do a horrible job of it. Right now, you just wanted to hide the fact you and your dad had had sex and go downstairs to swap back immediately. Your plan to mess with your dad and your sister by swapping them had clearly gone way too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your mom's clothes from last night and throw them deep in the laundry hamper. You then go into her dresser and grab a matching pair of black panties and bra. You put them on, struggling with the bra before you secure it. It felt nice to not have your breasts wobbling around anymore. After this, you grab a pair of jeans and a simple plain white t-shirt. You pull the tight jeans onto your legs and the white t-shirt over your head. Lastly, you grab a pair of black socks and throw them on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the towel off out of your hair and then throw it into the hamper too. Your hair is now clean, but it is still a mess. <i>Mom never goes downstairs with wet hair like this </i>you think. You go back into the washroom and spend another ten minutes blow-drying and brushing your hair to make it presentable. <i>No way I am doing makeup though</i>. Satisfied with how your mom now looks, you quickly do a once-over of the washroom and the bedroom to make sure there is no evidence of the deed you did. You do a shoddy job of making the bed and are satisfied. <i>Okay, I need to find mom and end this nightmare</i>. You go into the wardrobe and grab the bowl from the bottom and then leave the bedroom to head downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you come downstairs and enter the kitchen, you see your mom sitting at the table eating cereal in your body. Your sister Stacey is also sitting their on her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom\" says Stacey as she sees you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom\" says your mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey John\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's fine mom, I'm not here or anything either\" pouts Stacey. She rolls gets up, rolls her eyes, and walks out of the kitchen. <i>Gee, what a brat. What is that about?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to switch back, right now\" you say to your mom as soon as she leaves the room. You turn to walk to the sink to fill the bowl with water.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You start to think that maybe you could swap with the first one of them who drinks from the bowl. If it\u2019s Carmen it\u2019s a win win for you because she\u2019s almost as young as your old body and doesn\u2019t have any activities for a long time. If it\u2019s Erica she does have Melody which would be a problem but she still has more energy than your mother and would be more acceptable than Carmen at helping you adapt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when you tell your mother the plan your going to do. As you tell her you say:\u201d Mom I\u2019m going to need the bowl with me at all times\u201d. At this she looks angry and asks for an explanation. \u201c It because if I\u2019m the one doing all the work I need it to give it to both Carmen and Erica and if you in my body came to Carmen and said drink this she would just walk away\u201d. After hearing your explanation she gives you it with a warning to not overuse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you decide to put the bowl at the kitchen while first taking a sip when your mother isn\u2019t noticing. After you drink it you put it in the place where both of your elder sister take their water regularly. After a few minutes of waiting the vertigo comes back and you feel your soul being ripped out of your mothers body and being send to the kitchen. In mid flight your thinking.\u2019 Please let it be Carmen who drank it, please plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you start passing through the walls you see a passed a female body waiting for your soul to be inserted into.

There was something more to be done here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nudged at the door and your mother understood what you were going to do. With a grin she headed downstairs followed by you. You saw her going to your room and when inside locking the door. You couldn't hold it out any longer either, you decided to go to your parents bedroom. You opened the door and stepped inside. It felt weird, the room didn't feel like it was your room now. It just looked like your mom and dad's room complete with their large bed and the walk-in closet for your mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing you couldn't resist was playing with your body. You don't how but you being inside her body made your mother's body feel like it's on fire. You could feel it from feeling of how pointy your mother's nipples are to the wetness of her vagina. You were getting excited. You sit down at your parent's bed with your legs open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first order of business is getting out of the dress, you can't go do anything without the dress being in the way. Seeing it as a long shirt you first try to pull it over your head, sadly it won't move up because of your breasts. \"Why now?\" You mutter as you let it slide down. You then proceed to do it the other way. You pull down the straps and start to move the dress downwards. Finally you get it done, getting to see more of your mother's figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step outside the dress you take a look in the huge mirror in the room. You have to admire your mother's figure. Running a household and working part-time in the hospital did great things for her figure. She was wearing a sexy black bra with black panties. And even more sexier were her breasts which are yours now. You make several sexy poses, which turn you even more on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you just had to undo your bra, you have to feel around a bit but thanks to the mirror you can find the straps earlier than you expected. As you let the bra off your breasts just sagged a little bit. \"Nothing a little plastic surgery won't fix.\" You mumble as you feel both your breasts. You then pinch your nipples which immediately send a shock through your body making you loss your balance. As you hit the floor you can feel how your breasts were affected by the gravity and slapped down rather hard. But you're not thinking about the pain, you're thinking about how you can replicate the pleasure flowing through you when you pinched your nipples. You do it again this time with both your breasts. You begin to worm as you can't stop moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this go even better?</span></div></div>",

I'm just sick of them and what comes with owning a set like that, I want them to be someone else's problem. And what better person then a boob man, a boob man who sees those things as a gift rather then a curse and don't deny it either I see you sneaking peeks. You're a boob man just like your father is, I know all about your park visits ogling all the women jogging, your dad told me because he can never figure out why you don't talk to any of them. Don't worry I didn't tell him the truth, that while your father wants to get in their pants you actually want to be in them wearing them, it's why you didn't freak out when you found yourself in my body. Every son I know would have screamed bloody murder finding themselves in their mom's body then demanded to swap back that instant disgusted by the fact and not wanting to spend one second more in their mom's body. You're the exception, wanting to go and enjoy your own mother's body, eagerly anticipating seeing your own mother's body naked, checking out every inch of my body before playing with my boobs and vagina. Because you've thought of having my body before, dreamed of owning it I'm betting, there is no point in denying it, its called mother's intuition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, \"If you could see the way you look at him, the way you idolize him and if I know your father he's told you a lot more then what any son should know about his parents and what goes on in this bedroom with the door closed. So with you being the way you are about owning my body, and idolizing him, i'm sure you imagined every scenario he told you about with you playing the part of me. Plus it's not like your father would ever suspect that his wife use to be his son not looking like that, all he'll see is you, his wife, so even if you act a little different it won't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your job, I can't be a nurse.\" You argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again, \"I didn't tell you, while your father likes hanging out with you on the nights when his work allows and he's up to ogling the women at the park, he enjoys the company of his wife a lot more where he can do more than only ogling at big breasts. So even though he works late most nights and I don't see him until he comes home at like 6 or 7, he felt like me working night shift until 11 even though it was only two or three nights was taking away too much time from the family, from him. So I quit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You quit? You love that job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do but I love my family and husband even more so if that's how your father felt it was an easy decision because my number one job is being a wife and mother. I've accepted that a long time ago and i don't regret a single thing, it was my choice. If you stay as me I expect the same thing, you'd be the mom and your family comes first, and the way you treat your sisters has to change, understood! You're in the body of the one who created them, you're their mom now and Melody's grandma, I hated hearing someone calling me that word \"grandma\" I'm not ready to be a grandma. Being in your body I'm not, I have a chance to do things over, a chance not just to be a wife, mother, and grandmother. Come to think of it I was scheduled to work the night shift tonight I wonder if I could go over and show them my impressive skills I learned from my mom, tell them that I've decided I know the path I want to go and it's start with getting my foot in the door at the hospital. Maybe they'll hire me on the spot being shorthanded and all. Then tomorrow we could go over to the library and when I tell them I'm quitting, I can tell them I have the perfect replacement, and you can impress them with all the knowledge you have on the way the library works, all that time spent listening to your son, who knows then maybe they might keep you on past the summer. That is if it's all okay with your father he just might need a little convincing!\" you saw the smile on what use to be your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Convincing!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, \"See more information then a son should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that bad, I can't imagine how it tastes or swallowing it down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed \"It's not the cum sweetie, your father's tastes wonderful, it's the fact that I'm on my knees with your fathers cock in my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he'd do anything for you then, you have all the power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, \"Is that what you think or what your dad told you? Why should I have to be on my knees with his cock in my mouth to get something that interests me, isn't my interests alone enough. It's just his childish way of getting his cock sucked and showing me whose the man and what my position is, on my knees with his cock in my mouth sucking him off servicing him as I look up at him with those beautiful brown eyes and he stares down at me and my cleavage. Like I said though that's your father and I love him for better or worse, and all his muscles and all his faults. Which is why I wouldn't do this or even think about it unless I found the perfect replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we just try it out then, like a week or a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No because when you make a choice sweetie you can't go back on it you have to accept it and learn from it, a week or month means we didn't make a choice! I'm still Tracy in my son, John's body, I want to be John or just forget about it and continue on as my life as Tracy. What you have to decide is what do you want. I'm sure you've thought about your future, your plans, just think about your life as me or your life as you. What life would you rather have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched your mom move across the room, \"Come over here\" standing in front of the mirror staring at her new reflection, you joined her watching your mother's reflection come up behind your body. She turned to the side giving you the whole mirror, what looked back at you was reflection of your mother's naked body, and those amazing boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you have to decide is if you want to own this body to become the object of affection for the person you idolize the most, your father. To be able to spend the rest of your life with him in the way that you've only dreamed of in my body as his wife. With a life probably working at the library stocking shelves on a part time basis just for something to do then coming home cooking dinner and making sure it's ready and that you're looking beautiful for your dad when he gets done with work, at a job where he makes enough money providing you with everything you could ever want. Or.... would you rather have this body with a whole future in front of you, you just have to figure out what that future is?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But your still not safe young man\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think you mean madam\u201d you correct her as you show your new clevage. \u201c Don\u2019t touch them son! she yells angrily.\u201d Well they are mine now aren\u2019t they. So I decided what to do with them\u201d you say in your best mocking tone. \u201c Your going to regret those words later son.\u201d \u201c Yeah sorry mom got a bit carried away.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what can we do\u201d. We need to drink from the bowl ASAP to get back to our normal selfs and after that your grounded young man\u201d. \u201c What! So no only do si discover something new and you try to take it away from me but your also grounding me.\u201d Yes and you better do it fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then start to think of something to do. If you give your mother the bowl while she\u2019s you, you could swap with someone else and escape from her punishment. \u201c Ok Mom here I go\u201d. You say as you take a sip from the bowl while also walking to the edge of the attic with your moms body while also touching your ass and swaying it seductively. Stop doing that! She yells at you.\u201d Make me! Oh your si grounded young man\u201d she says as she takes a sip of the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you next wake up your yourself again but can\u2019t think of that as you need to move fast. Without a second thought you take a sip of the bowl and run to your sisters rooms. Carmen\u2019s one is locked as she\u2019s away on a party( like always) and the only one open is Stacy\u2019s one. You leave the bowl there for her to drink from it and run back to the attic. When you get there you see your mother finally awoke and looking angrily at you. Oh your sooo grounded John\u201d she says as she grabs your ear and drags you to the living room.

Glancing back at your body, evidently your father was wasting no time in enjoying himself, why should you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very kind of you, Miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, <i>Mrs</i> Miller. My husband passed away several years ago,\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh... that sucks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"It does - it did, I mean. For a long time. But you learn to move on. And how about you? What's your situation?\" she asks, hinting at your old body. You realise she's asking about your marital status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been married,\" you say honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he still see his mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We visit her occasionally,\" you say after some thought, thinking of the retirement home where your grandma has lived for some years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk together towards the edge of the park. She talks about her kids, about the stresses and challenges of raising children alone; you do your best to nod along but its hard to focus on anything but the sight of her mature figure in those yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I worry that my son doesn't have a father in his life, y'know? Like a strong, male figure he can look up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you don't have that problem. Does you son ever miss his mother? It's different for boys, I suppose... but we have to look out for their development, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he okay with us just leaving him like this by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right. No, he'll be fine. He can find his own way back. He's... pretty mature for his age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You live near here then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continues over coffee, you just barely keeping up. She seems to want to know everything about your life, what you do for a living, what your hobbies are, forcing you to wrack your brains about everything you know about your dad's life. Fortunately it seems as though you can't fail to impress her. Everything you say seems to make her laugh or smile, and she keeps touching your dad's arm in a way you kinda like. Was picking up girls really this easy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your coffee. She glances round the quiet restaurant and leans closer.</span></div></div>",

Off.\" Your eyes widen in alarm as her nimble fingers reach out, sliding down across your chest, and into the waistband of your jogging trousers, tugging free the hem of your exercise vest.

Annoyed, you find yourself defiantly blurting, \"I'm not a complete hopeless case, y'know. As a matter of fact, I've got a date tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy drops the handful of cloths, standing bolt upright. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember who you are and slap your hand to your mouth. You're your father. You're married. You don't go on dates. \"Um, nothing,\" you squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks towards you, her expression stern, and she says slowly, \"no, I heard you. So my husband has a date tonight, does he?\" She is only a small woman and you've the body of a construction worker, but her look of 'you're-sleeping-on-the-couch-tonight' awakens a deeply-ingrained marital fear in you. Sweat trickling down your brow, you back away until you come up against the wall. She stands close, her face right next to yours. \"Have you been picking up girls too?

You shake your head with terror. \"Liar,\" she giggles, stretching up onto her tiptoes and kissing you. Her soft breasts press into you. Her tongue forces itself through your lips, exploring your mouth. You, or perhaps your father's body, reciprocates. As your tongues slide across each other, you discover yourself trapped somewhere between arousal and disgust, at the precarious crossroads of either grabbng her ass and pulling her body closer or retching into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breaks away, breathless. \"You're not mad?\" you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm mad alright,\" she assures you. \"But you know there's nothing like reminding me what a sexy, virile stud my husband is to get my engine going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your <i>engine</i>?\" you choke is disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" She leans closer and whispers in your ear, her hot breath tickling your earlobe. \"Lubricated and raring to go, sweetie.\"</span></div></div>",

And John... well, if you're being truthful, he won't be back within the next hour at the very least,\" your mother giggles as she insults your body, proceeding to close in and nibble on your earlobe. \"Besides, we haven't done it in <i>sooooo</i> long, sweetie. I'm just burning for release right now. I might even forgive you for picking yourself up a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" You hesitate, biting your lip to hold back the moan you almost let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts!\" She retorts. \"Besides, even I can see that you're desperately aching for me now. Or is this erection from the thought of the date you're going to have tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to hold yourself back from replying. If you had answered that it was due to the date, your mother would shackle you to the couch for the rest of the evening. But the truth was far more nefarious. Your swelling penis was the result of your mother's skilled hands carefully prodding, squeezing, and stroking it continuously. You felt ashamed and bewildered as more blood flowed into your gorged erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of your mother was rapidly changing. Your memories of a guardian angel who would always care for you, could delicious food, clean your clothes, comfort you when you had a bad day, and always, always love you were quickly being eradicated, vanishing from your mind. Instead, they were being replaced by images of a sex demon who was skilled in perverse techniques. And she was skilled indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to back off her into the wall you are currently leaning against. You had no idea that she was this good at pleasing your dad, and perhaps this was the reason he hadn't left her after all these years despite young girls chasing the masculine guy that was your father. The image of your mother was quickly crumbling before your very eyes as your desire to harshly fuck this woman grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou horrifyingly try to hold on to yourself. The part of your mind that is rational keeps repeating, \"This is wrong. This is your mother. This is completely wrong. You can't screw your mom.\" While the part of your brain that had hormones shooting through it could only utter stuff like, \"Hot damn, this big ass MILF has D cup titties!\"  You try to fight your irrational mind as you steel yourself and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't do that all of a sudden!\" Your mother yelps, as you sweep her onto your shoulder, your irrational mind winning over as you carry her to the bedroom. You know you shouldn't be doing this. You know that this is wrong. But your sex-crazed hormones tell you otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roughly drop her onto the bed as you strip her of her shirt and skin-clinging jeans. You shove your right hand in her black, lacy panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Your mother moans as you shove three fingers in her cunt immediately. \"You haven't been this rough in quite a while. Not that I mind, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" you retort, yanking off her panties quickly. \"Just spread your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Your mother exclaims amused, spreading her legs to reveal her shaved pussy. \"You want to be this rough? We haven't done this since we first met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even listen to her and frankly don't care as you shake your shorts and briefs off to reveal your dad's hefty 10 inch penis. He would always brag about its size, and you just couldn't wait to surpass him, which seemed like a far off dream for you at the moment. You poise it at the leaking cunt, and jam it in in one short blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh yeeeeeeees,\" your mother moans, her eyes rolling up at her forehead, tongue lolling out. \"Yeeees. Fuck me. Fuck my pussy! This is it! This is the cock that I remember! I've always wanted to have another son. Knock me up right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pound her even quicker. Your judgement has been clouded. All you want to do now is to just blow your load. To just release it all at once. Somewhere, in the far corners of your mind, you keep reminding yourself about how wrong this is. But the rest of you just doesn't care. It just wants to rape this woman in front of you silly. Suddenly, a voice resounds downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Mom?\" The voice was all too familiar. After all, it had belonged to you for many years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Your mother gasped, trying to pull away from your grasp. \"We can't let John see us like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her efforts are for naught as you pull her back in. You honestly don't care if your dad sees you like this so long as you get to blow your load. The slapping sounds on flesh become even more pronounced as you pick up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? You here? I brought a friend with me. She... Hey, what's that sound?\" Your father wonders as he pulls open the door knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that you cum. String after string are shot into your mother's fertile pussy, her gasps loud and clear. You roll over from her, penis exiting her cunt as a waterfall of sperm begins to flow out of her. You feel relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that you suddenly recoil in horror as your mind clears. You quickly shift your gaze between your mother's horrified look and your body's shocked face as your jaw drops, realizing what you have done. <i>You just fucked your own mom</i>. <i>And your dad saw you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as your body opens its mouth and your father...</span></div></div>",

The room spirals crazily around your head. It feels like you're being sucked out of your body and pulled into another, much softer one. A high, womanly moan escapes your lips as you slump groggily in your seat. You can your slightly too-small bra digging into your heavy, mature boobs, the skirt that comes down to your knees, and the draft from the catflap swirling around your naked lower legs. And there between your legs you can feel... it, a weird emptiness where your penis should be, just waiting to be... filled. <i>Oh gross, I can feel mum's vagina!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit you, you see Carman handing the bowl to your dad with wet lips.

Remember that you're in charge of the housework now. I expect this place to be spotless when we get back. Whatever damage Carmen makes, you're expected to clear up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen gives a strange spasm, slumping like a doll but rapidly pulling herself together. \"That's right, son.

Whatever she does reflects badly on you,\" he grins Carmen's party-girl smile. He reaches down, cupping and lightly squeezing Carmen's C-cup breasts. \"We were right, honey, this was a great idea. Let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took the words out of my mouth,\" your body giggles, taking your dad by the hand and leading him out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen gives a deep, guttural groan. \"Mother of all hangovers,\" he grumbles, clutching his head. His hands slide down across his face, finding the two-day stubble. He opens his eyes, noticing the empty house with satisfaction, then turns to you. His eyes alight on your pillowy cleavage. \"Hey, little brother. Looking good,\" Carmen smirks.</span></div></div>",

You come across your old bedroom, you try to hear at the door for any unusual sounds but you can't hear anything. Carmen is doing the same with her door and she just shrugs. You enter your parent's bedroom and sit on the bed while Carmen walks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they did anything?\" You ask her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I seriously hope not.

You in your boxer shorts, and Carmen in her panties and bra. You go over to the bathroom, you pick up your tooth brush while Carmen goes sitting down on the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I need to go.\" She explains herself whispering while pulling down her panties. You concentrate on your brushing first, but then slowly your focus goes towards Carmen. The mirror gives a reflection of Carmen peeing. You observe her sitting there, her big sagging breasts in the white bra, her tight belly, and then her crotch. You couldn't see all of it, but somehow it makes your crotch tingle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Carmen suddenly asks you.

When you're done, Carmen is ready too and so you change positions. You take your stand peeing and while you try not to look, you wonder if Carmen is looking just the same way at you like you just did. She doesn't reveal it to you either way.

Simultaneously, you explode with such an extreme orgasm that you feel like you're going to shoot her back off you. In fact, when she rises to slam you again, you think you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body continues to convulse even after spearing her a dozen more times, and she collapses on top of you sucking your tongue into her mouth as her tongue dances with yours. Her mammoth breasts force her nipples into your chest, and you wrap your arms around her and hold on tight not ever wanting to let her free. Everything just feels so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the two of you break; and in a few more, you have your breath, and senses, back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What have I just done?</i> you think but are distracted as she smiles at you and speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was great, John,\" Jenny says in Carmen's voice. \"It really made me thirsty.\" She reaches over to the side table while still straddling you and picks something up. \"How about you? Have a little sip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are parched, and without thinking you tilt your head up and let her pour some water into your mouth. Just as you swallow, you realize you just drank out of the soul swapping bowl. You start feeling strange, and your vision spins and flickers. The next thing you know, you are ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You first play with the outer rim not wanting to get into it to fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome.\" You moan out loud. It's then that you put your finger inside and can feel your body tightening. This was the place where you just entered Jenny. It's weird to think that you now were on the other end of it.

Life is for living, John. Do you really want to sit there on your deathbed someday wondering 'what if?' Go ahead and refuse this deal if you want.

Anytime you're with a girl now, you'll always be wondering in the back of your mind if it's really Carmen doing an impersonation act with the help of this soul swapping bowl. Carmen is wild and unpredictable like that. She would really do such things: steal somebody's body and then go make out with her own brother, without him knowing what was happening. The bowl was in pretty dangerous hands as long as Carmen possessed it. Maybe he shouldn't have let it out of his sight so easily? Shouldn't he have fought harder to keep it for himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll worry about it later,\u201d you tell yourself, heading back down from the attic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, you return to your room and stretch out on your bed.

After being rebuffed by her brother John (you), she thought a little demonstration of the bowl's powers was in order. But who to test it on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was certain of the bowl's mysterious powers to swap bodies; it was the only thing she could remember from her Ancient Mythologies course in freshman year in college. It was the only thing she could remember because that was her only morning class, one into which she would often stumble hung over and still half drunk from the previous night's debauchery. But while the professor mentioned the bowl offhand, more of an aside to a supposedly fake artifact of times gone by, Carmen believed the thing was real. And here it was, half full of water and shimmering in the early May sunlight, held steady in her own hands as she strolled over to the nearby park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who to test it on? Carmen surveyed groups of parkgoers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver there underneath the large oak tree: a young family sitting down for a picnic atop a checkerboard cloth. The father had a chiseled jaw and rugged features, wearing a button-up plaid shirt with sleeves rolled up. Kind of hunky, Carmen thought to herself, a little <i>too </i>worthy a body for dear old John. He could have been here, helping her uncover the mysteries of this bowl. Besides, maybe John would be better suited as the thirty-something year old wife sitting criss-cross next to him. Her short-cropped blonde hair looked tussled about from the wind, and she was wearing a blouse that accentuated her tall, lithe figure. How would John react to becoming a housewife? Carmen snickered to herself and continued looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the open field were two young children, a preteen girl and her little brother, flying a kite. No doubt the children of the man and woman from earlier, Carmen presumed. The girl held the reel tightly in her small fingers, while the boy skipped about underneath the shadow of the kite twisting and tumbling overhead. Swap John into one of them? Carmen shook her head: too difficult to get near them and have them drink from the bowl without coming across as some kind of creepy stranger. Would she willingly accept a drink from some random person? Well, maybe if she were at a house party and the drink came in a plastic red cup... but most people wouldn't, probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen espied an old gentleman wearing a three-piece suit and bowler cap, sitting on a bench along a jogging path. The greying, elderly man looked lonely; resting against his hip was a cane and his mustachioed face worn and wrinkled. He was feeding bread to the pigeons. Perhaps this man could get a new lease on life? And perhaps John could come to appreciate the youth he was so carelessly wasting? Carmen liked that idea most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the jogging path on her way to the old man, she saw someone else who filled her with rage... and delight. In that instant Carmen knew exactly who to swap with John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir apartment lease was up for renewal in April after university ended: Brad and Carmen. But their relationship had been on the rocks for several months already, and Carmen could see the writing on the wall. He had found somebody else. He didn't care about her any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had met at a tailgating event before a game in September, taking their lusty encounter straight to Brad's frat house room without even seeing the game. Two weeks later, Brad signed the lease to an apartment off campus and Carmen stopped commuting to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's wages as a part-time campus tour guide were decent but insufficient to meet their living expenses, which included sky-high rent in the trendy, gentrified part of town. Brad worked as an announcer and color commentator for several of the uni's sports teams, hoping some day to make it on a high-profile broadcasting network. A former athlete himself, Brad's stunning figure is what attracted Carmen to him initially, and then she learned to like his boneheaded jocky personality after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both flirts; Carmen would be the first to admit that. Which is why she wasn't totally against the idea of maintaining an 'open relationship' as Brad called it. So what if he slept around once in a while? She was free to do it as well (which she did). But the original condition of 'once in a while' turned out to be like every weekend. Every Friday evening, Carmen would arrive home from work and find some girl scurrying out of bed, half naked, grabbing a wad of clothes before disappearing. She gave him hell for that, but he never listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of these girls Carmen recognized more than any others: <b>Alexia Tate</b>. They went to the same high school together, but Alexia was literally too busy bedding the entire football team to focus on her studies. She developed a reputation of being a tease, an easy lay, a dumb bimbo with fake T&amp;A and a ravenous appetite for the male sex. Whether or not it was all true, she made Carmen look puritanical by comparison. Alexia graduated, apparently, although it took her a year longer than everyone else. Carmen doubted Alexia had the brains to go to college. Probably on the prowl for some sugar daddy or young stud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen could go on and on. Which is why she felt especially betrayed when Brad finally told her his intentions of breaking off their relationship in favour of Alexia. When she first heard him announce that in April, Carmen wasn't sure how to respond. Sure, it was one thing to go for a nice girl, maybe one who's more prim-and-proper and ready to settle down and have a few kids. Carmen could understand that. What she couldn't understand is why anyone would want to go steady with someone like Alexia <i>over her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia was stretching her leg, not having noticed Carmen approach yet. It infuriated Carmen that she probably had enough spare time to get a real tan. Her arms and legs were shaved, and her fingernails were tipped in a cutesy pink. Her eyebrows were penciled to perfection. Her hair was dark and smooth, trailing down to the small of her back. Today she was wearing a sports bra underneath a strappy purple tank top, as well as a pair of black yoga pants and sneakers. Carmen even took note that her ears were pierced, she scrutinized her that closely:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/DnppikC.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/DnppikC.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Carmen thought about it, the more furious she got. So, as she approached her ex-boyfriend's girlfriend, she adorned the fakest, most insidiously syrupy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy seeing you here!\" Carmen squealed, setting down the bowl and embracing Alexia in a hug. \"You look positively gorgeous in that outfit, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Beamed Alexia innocently, continuing to stretch as she talked to the young woman who hated her guts. \"Got these shoes on sale last week. Don't they look so sporty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure do!\" Carmen quickly cut to the chase. \"Say, I noticed that you didn't bring a water bottle with you on your jog this morning. Super important to stay well hydrated, y'know!\" <i>As if she needs water after all the cum she's been guzzling</i>, Carmen thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia's slack-jawed expression was replaced with one of surprise. \"Oh! That's what I forgot on the way out this morning. Stupid, stupid!\" She shook her head before noticing the bowl of water at Carmen's feet. \"Do you mind if I take a drink before I start my workout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a coincidence,\" Carmen replied, picking up the bowl in her hands. \"I just happened to be carrying this water with me too!\" For the briefest moment, a twinge of guilt crossed her mind: Should she go through with this and make her drink from it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good friend, Carmen.\" Said Alexia thankfully. \"You're a much better person than what Brad says about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Alexia was about to place her lips against the bowl, Carmen stops her. \"Wait! What does Brad say about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia shrugs demurely, replying in a soprano, singsong voice. \"I dunno... he just... y'know... said you two were incompatible. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncompatible? Carmen frowned. Alexia looked again at her before taking a big gulp from the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck them!</i> resolved Carmen. <i>Let's see how incompatible they are once Alexia becomes my teenage brother!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now Carmen is standing in front of you with her lips curled into a mischievous grin. She looks taller for some reason. Carmen is holding the golden bowl from earlier against her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look down and gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen! What the hell have you done to me??\" You squeal in a strange woman's voice. It sounds lilting and breathy, a big difference that doesn't go away even after clearing your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've turned you into my ex-boyfriend's girlfriend, duh.\" Carmen looks giddy with excitement. \"I told you this bowl works! It swapped your bodies and you're inside her now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about this body feels wrong. Black hair trails down your neck and shoulders; you've never in your life had hair this long. You've never had your ears pierced either, yet you can feel something studded dangling on your new ears. Big boobs push out against a purple tank top and form a valley of cleavage easily observable from your new vantage point. Even with a tight sports bra hugging those beauties, your back still aches from supporting them. This girl's yoga pants are skin tight and accentuate her curvy glutes and thighs. This body feels weak and top heavy at the same time. The cool breeze outside gives your hairless arms goosebumps... or maybe it's just the 'empty' feeling down below where your manhood should be that's sending chills down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/CbxHmN3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/CbxHmN3.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you turn me into this girl?\" You seethe, trying to snatch the bowl out of Carmen's hands. But she holds it out of your reach. Not to mention you almost trip over getting used to your new center of gravity. Your whole body feels softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to swap you with <i>somebody</i>,\" She replies calmly. \"You chose to drink out of the bowl first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was before I knew it was real!\" You argue to no avail. Carmen turns the bowl over to reveal that it's empty, so even if she handed it over you couldn't use it to swap back immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Can you at least tell me who I am now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, you're my asshole of an ex-boyfriend's current beau: Alexia Tate. I knew her several years ago. She's... well... she <i>gets around</i>, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resist the urge to hurl. \"You mean I'm... some sort of... <i>slut</i> now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, yeah.\" Carmen says unsympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why her? Why <b>me</b>??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want you to break up with Brad. Show him how it feels to get dumped. I dunno, maybe dig some dirt up on him to use against his employer? I could tell you loads to get you started. I just want him to feel the same kind of pain he caused me, for making me into such a fool for allowing him to take advantage of our relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen still hadn't let go of Brad, you gather, so you respond, \"Don't you think there are healthier ways to turn the page? Y'know, plenty of other fish in the sea and what not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She says flatly. She turns and begins walking home, so you follow behind, trying not to dwell upon the bouncing of your new boobs. You need to take quicker strides to keep up with Carmen's taller figure. Feeling your new ass wiggle and womanly hips pitch back and forth against your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where do you think you're going? You're not gonna leave me like this, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout turning her head, she replies, \"What are you talking about, <i>Alexia</i>? You don't live here. Why don't you go home to Brad and get started on subverting your relationship? I'll keep <i>John </i>from causing trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentioning your old body causes your heart to skip a beat. For a moment you almost forgot about the person inhabiting your body, living your life right now. Carmen's description of her rival likely unflattering, but from what she's said you can't trust that Alexia won't harm your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she ruins your reputation at school? Not that you're among the popular crowd, but you don't actively invite their disdain and have successfully avoided being pinned as a nerd or loser so far. You don't want Alexia messing that up. Or what if she embarrasses you in front of Brooke? Brooke: an angel sent from Heaven in human form. The prettiest girl you've ever laid eyes upon. You've got a major crush on her, but for now she's just your classmate and occasional acquaintance. You can't stand the thought of Brooke judging you based on something your imposter might do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this assumes Carmen will even entertain this diabolical plan of hers longer than a day or two. Carmen is well known for acting impulsively, long-term planning not exactly her strong suit. Which is why you don't want her handling that incredible swapping thingamajig unsupervised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I... I don't know how to live like a girl!\" You protest. \"Please change me back, Carmen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not hard being a girl, John!\" She continues. \"Erica, Stacy, and I do just fine every day. We put our trousers on one leg at a time. Don't go out alone at night, and birth control is your friend. So are tampons.\" She snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep whining and maybe I'll let you stay swapped... permanently!\" Threatens Carmen. That shuts you up to her satisfaction. \"My old apartment is a few miles away. You've visited me before while I was in college, so you know where it is. So why don't you get started on that workout, Alexia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Alexia you doubt you could force the bowl from Carmen - your best option was to play along for now. You stop following Carmen and watch as she continues on. She briefly turns back to look at you with a sly and evil grin on her face. You stand on the sidewalk in your uncomfortable new form and watch her disappear down the street with the bowl in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is horrible</i> you think, trying not to move so you don't have to acknowledge your now female body. Every breath, however, reminds you of the large breasts now sitting awkwardly on your chest and offsetting your accustomed center of gravity. <i>What an evil bitch</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you couldn't just stand on the sidewalk forever. You had to go on living, even if it was as Alexia for now. But what did that entail?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young man turns the corner and approaches you on the sidewalk. He is clearly around Alexia's age - somewhere in his early twenties. Although he could be no taller than your previous \"John\" body, it was now clear he was at least a half foot taller than you are as Alexia. He is tanned with short blonde hair and broad shoulders. As he passes you he gives a glance and an awkward smile. <i>Did he just check me out</i>? Creeped out by the thought, you hope he was instead just thinking of how weird you must look standing motionless on the sidewalk. You turn your head to watch him walk away and can't help but notice his toned ass as he walks away. You feel an unusual warmth in your midsection and a slight tingle between your legs. <i>He looks very handsome</i>, you think, <i>wait - what</i>? You quickly avert your eyes and shake your head. As you do so, your long black hair recklessly flies in front of your face. <i>This is unbearable</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you have to do something to either distract yourself or work towards getting your own body back. Since Alexia had just dressed and stretched to prepare for a jog, you could start to do that to distract yourself and become a little accustomed to using your new and beautiful body. Alternatively, you could head to Alexia's and Brad's apartment immediately - but it was about 5km away. You knew this because your sister used to be the one living there. You think about calling a ride but notice you don't have any pockets on your tight yoga pants. <i>Alexia's phone must be at her apartment</i>. It seems no matter what you do, you will have to move on foot for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could jog to Alexia's apartment, but if I go there I could run into Brad, and I'm not sure I'm ready to deal with that. Maybe I should just jog around town as an excuse to avoid that a little longer? If I waste time maybe I will come up with an idea to get my body back.</i></span></div></div>",

The realisation of what had just happend yet to hit her. For the first few minute seconds she was none the wiser untill it kicked in.  What!? Her mind began to race as she dropped the controller and rose quickly from her new chair. She stretched her hands out in front of her in awe and shock of what was going on. She was indoors, but how? She was out for her dailly jog just seconds ago before catching up with carmen, next thing Alexia knew she was indoors on some... some kind off video game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the room before catching a glance of a nearby mirror. Alexia slowly made her way towards it dragging the headset along the floor, un-aware it was still connected to her. The headset too slammed onto the ground, as Alexia increased her speed towards the mirror. She grabbed ahold of it re-directing it towards her face and catching a full view of her new body. She released the mirror from her hands almost imediantly, it too same as the headset and the controller before it slamming into the ground. Alsxia began to panic even more now. She was a guy!? But she couldn't be, how could she!? Alexia couldn't even recognise whose body she was now occuypying. Her mind continued to race with questions before leading her to question that if she was in this guys body, was he... in hers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept paniccing, trying to convince herself this wasn't real, that it couldn't be real. She began to grab ahold of her new manly body, clutching and gripping away at it. Everything felt so...so alien to her. Her mind continued to race with thoughts before she stopped herself briefly. She moved one hand down lower and into her shorts grabbing ahold of the first thing she found. This wasn't a dream, it was to real for that. Thoughts began to flood her head yet again, what would her boyfriend think? Whos body was this? How did this happen? Alexia started to search the room franticly searching for any clues as to who she currently was. As she continued to rummage through the mess of this guys room a loud knock came at the door. Whoever it was, Alexia wasn't alone in this house.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly being inside her made you wonder something, did Carmen and Aaron did it already. You suppose not, when you take a look at Carmen's face as her face depicts happiness that would only display by an act like this. While your hormones are speeding things up, your eyes are being drawn again to Carmen's breasts. Did they look that good before? Before you know it you're kissing her body, making Carmen shiver by every kiss. When you've reached her breasts she holds your head against them. The smell of them making your member grow even more inside Carmen.  Kissing them up, you proceed to lye Carmen down on her bed as you begin moving your member inside her. The combination of them both seems to be working as she begins to moan louder. You can only keep up with her as you're taking away by lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel you're almost ready to cum. \"I'm almost ready.\" You tell Carmen as you are kissing her neck. \"Just inside.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, as you obey her orders.

It's priceless!\" as she sauntered closer towards you, swaying your mom's fully exposed, curvy hips and causing her vast display of boobage to wobble and jiggle within the confines of the tight black teddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It....It worked? The bowl actually worked?\" you finally managed to ask, letting out an awkward gulp as your eyes were pulled towards your mother's hefty cleavage - her breasts looking positively ginormous in the lingerie, and not something you could really avoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well obviously</i>,\" Carmen replied, sounding a little frustrated that you weren't keeping up (which was weird to hear your mother's voice carrying your sister's usual snarky tone), \"It's not like we have any other ancient magical body swapping artifacts lying around the house you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's amazing! But uh, why are you dressed....you know, like <i>that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it, huh?\" she smiled, misconstruing what you were asking as she placed a hand on her hip and pulled a sexy pose (a pose you certainly never imagined seeing your own mother pull). \"I found this stuff stashed away in the bottom of mom's closet. It's pretty sexy, huh? I really need to get some stuff like this for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the question, finding it rather uncomfortable and just down right embarrassing to be looking at her like this, you instead rather awkwardly replied,  \"Uhm, yeah...but why exactly are you wearing it now? It's pretty weird seeing mom dressed up like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately this only made the grin on Carmen's face grow wider. \"Oh, I get it. Is little Johnny-boy having a hard time looking at his sexy mommy? Is he perhaps getting a little excited downstairs in the trouser department...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? <i>No!</i> No of course not!\" you told her, shocked by the very suggestion as you pushed away the hand that was now pointing towards your crotch. You did however feel yourself turn slightly red, the very fact that she was standing there wearing very little - dressed like some sexy model in a magazine - with her large breasts bulging out in front of your face creating some slightly mixed emotions. It should have been just creepy and weird, but you couldn't keep yourself from staring as you tried desperately to explain, \"It's...it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just nothing, baby brother,\" she interrupted, looking even more smug now as your mom's soft brown eyes lit up, clearly enjoying having you in this position. \"You're totally getting turned on looking at mom's body. Don't deny it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, that was why I decided to swap with her and dress up like this in the first place - to teach you a lesson for being such a little fraidy cat...and for <i>checking out my boobs!</i>\" As soon as she mentioned boobs you internally winced, turning an even brighter red as you realized that she had indeed seen you looking at her cleavage earlier, something that as a overly hormonal teenage boy you just couldn't help doing...even if she was <i>your sister!</i> \"You obviously like boobs, big ones especially, and they don't come much bigger than these,\" Carmen continued, shifting closer towards you again and causing you to nervously take a step back, as you watched a hand glide its way teasingly over your mother's soft and pale expanse of cleavage. \"Mom's got a huge rack so it's only fitting that you should get to check out these boobs too...and maybe even do <i>more.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muh-more?\" you gulped, barely able to pull your gaze from those two large domes. \"Carmen, what...what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I was going to use the bowl to have my own fun, and seeing as you didn't agree to our deal, I think a little lesson in why you should always listen to your big sister is in order. I was going to swap with your girlfriend, but I think somehow this will be far more humiliating...getting to know mommy's body in a far more intimate manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you weren't already overwhelmed and freaked out by what was going on, you certainly were now - hearing what your sister had planned turning your beet red face practically pale. \"Wait...<i>WHAT?!</i> This...this isn't funny!\" you protested as Carmen then shut the door, trapping you both inside. You knew she had a wild side, but this...this was just wrong and...and sick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have had any girl in the world to experience sex with if you'd just gone along with my plan, but seeing as you said no, mommy's gonna have to be the one to teach you all about the birds and the bees herself.\" And with that, she then reached up and grabbed the straps of the teddy, sliding them slowly down her shoulders, causing the material to peel slowly back, exposing more and more of her epic chest and causing you to once again squeak \"<i>Oh God...</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With his pink panties still on, he turned his new backside then placed a had on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for these to go\" he said as he pulled off the last of Carmen's undergarments.

I know him <i>very </i>well after all\u201d you tried to flash that smile that you knew could charm a lot of people to do things on your own way, but you were sure that in your current body the effect was null or even opposite, given that your old body still has the same look of concern in it. \u201cAnyway, make yourself comfortable, this is your house\u2026 or at least, you know it better than me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...\u201d you could still make the look of uncertainty in your face, <i>he makes me look like a total loser, I will have to teach him if he wants to pass like me</i>. You follow him towards the kitchen where he looked around, before facing you, \u201cwould you like water\u2026 or something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit down. First we have stuff to discuss\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...\u201d <i>gosh</i>, he was really making your body to be seen like such a wuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was around the same size as the one in your house, something that was expected given that both houses were very near each other. But what was different was that it wasn\u2019t clean like your old house. Maybe it was because Jacob lived alone - from what little time you have had in your current body - and didn\u2019t want to pay for a maid, or maybe because he didn\u2019t have good cleaning habits - something that you could infer given the state in which you received the body - and in that case you were sure that you will change that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on one extreme of the rectangular table, and putting both of your arms behind the seat, you remain staring at your old self, after which he quickly proceeds to sit on the opposite extreme.<i> I\u2019m sure that I look like a boss, or even a CEO right now</i>. You could almost picture yourself like a officine man in a reunion room, smoking one of those expensive cuban cigars.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo about what we have to talk, I\u2019m most curious about how you had <b>that </b>quantity of money, it doesn\u2019t appear that you are the type of people that has that quantity of money in your hands free to expends at any moment\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 about that\u201d he started straightening himself in the seat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was like that old reunion that you had participated in back when you had a job. \u201cI was working on a company that did some shady stuff...\u201d you started, knowing that couldn\u2019t say so much, but at the same time you have to explain your current situation, because the opportunity of staying in your current body for longer than expected was tempting enough. \u201cAnd long story short, I was a scapegoat \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have your papers stained?\u201d your old body says in a commanding voice, very different to your normal tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 no '' it was difficult to form coherent thought when you were subjected to this kind of interrogation, but the new possibilities that were opening in front of you if you passed this interview was making you head centered like never before. \u201cThe company needed a scapegoat, so they selected me\u2026 a low profile person. In return for being one, and being able to never work again in something related to my old field of work, or anything that could put me under scrutiny of other people, they would give me a quantity of money upfront, and receive money for my living every quarter until my death\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good\u2026 very good in fact, being provided for life without having to work again in your life\u201d your old body started, showing a security that you never could amass before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it was at the start\u2026. You see, I can\u2019t talk about the subject, I have firmed a confidentiality agreement that doesn\u2019t let me talk about the matter. Also, in the agreement that I firmed, it was stated that I have to continue my low profile life, without raising notice of my existence\u201d pausing for a moment, trying to catch your breath before proceeding, \u201cAnd at the start it was good, but then the insecurities started. I can\u2019t buy an expensive house because it would raise suspicions over an old overweight man without family all of a sudden buying that kind of house. I can go on travel because I shouldn\u2019t have the money for traveling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd did you think about investment, or going abroad to other countries?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt my age, I couldn\u2019t learn something like that\u2026 And even if I did it, I\u2019m not sure that I would be good enough. I don\u2019t have hobbies or family, and at my age and with my body, I don\u2019t think that I would be able to enjoy other countries\u201d. Your pessimistic outlook in life was really hitting you, you could even feel the tears forming on your eyes. <i>I can\u2019t even go to prostitutes because my body is ugly that they don\u2019t want anything to do with me\u2026 and even if they did it I can\u2019t risk being caught by the police</i>, you say in your mind, \u201cIn fact, this happened about three years ago, and in that time I have become more miserable\u2026 and more fat\u201d you ended in a low tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time you have been fidgeting with your eyes, without knowing where to rest them, between the cleavage of your breast, and your old face. But now, you could see your old face making a smile, as you\u2019ve never seen it before \u201cThis only means that you are free to do anything while you don\u2019t raise suspicions, right?\u201d Carmen says, and you noticed the excitement on the voice, \u201cThis is the reason why you requested to make the change, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that...\u201d How could you admit that with the excess of money, and the possibility of being in the body of a sexy young woman, you didn\u2019t think about the consequences. If the possibility was real, you could explore your new body free of probing eyes. You didn\u2019t even remember when was the last time that you touched a female body... and then, you just jumped at the opportunity of solving your increasing lust, one so high that it even made you give 100,000 to a possible hoax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd well, fortunate enough the one with whom you changed has a lot of ideas of investment\u201d she said, with the same excitement tone. \u201cJacob, if you were interested in continuing being our investor, I could prolong the swap for an extension of time\u2026 and <i>John </i>doesn\u2019t have to know, so you could really <i>pass</i> for me\u201d, she paused, clearly waiting for your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid reaction was difficult, because you didn\u2019t know how to answer, Carmen was clearly manipulative, and everything about what you have seen indicated that when she wanted something, she really made sure to have it. And apparently she still wasn't done because of what she said at continuation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if <i>we </i>play our cards right\u2026 not only you could request a regular swap with me. I assure you that I could provide you with a regular influx of differents bodies that you could try\u201d saying this, she stand up in your body, that with your current perspective even if the appearance was less than desirable, almost pathetic, you couldn\u2019t help but to feel intimidated by her presence and the confidence that she was exuding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter big confidence steps and stopping next to you, she extended your old hand towards you and holding eye contact she said, \u201cso, <i>Carmen</i>, are we partners?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was late summer, so the weather was warm and the sun up late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess I won\u2019t have many other opportunities then\u201d as Jacob closed the door to Carmens room.

But Brad's party is tonight!\" Carmen whines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou type in Carmen's response and you get a message back. \"She will give you fifty bucks extra if you swap with her tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell Carmen is hesitating, on one hand the party and the other hand the money she could earn. But in the end the money wins. \"Fine, we'll swap tonight but she's going to that party.\" She then looks at you very intensely, \"and you're going to be there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" You ask confused. \"No way, Brad didn't even invite me, so I'm not allowed to enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's simple to fix, my loser brother....</span></div></div>",

I'm going back to my room to make a list of things she needs to know when she's me, make sure she does it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, aye captain.\" You mumble as she closes your door and walks over to her room. You tell Consuela that there's a party tonight, which you will be going with her and that she needs to make a list detailing a few pointers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe writes in her reply that she's happy you go with her and she'll make a list right away. With that you put your computer off and go to play some games on your Xbox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner is quiet, you and Carmen tell your mom and dad you're going together to a party. Your mother is delighted you spend time with her. Your dad tells you to try and score a girl, there's bound to be some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are waiting down the stairs as you're waiting for Carmen. You are in your thoughts when you hear the sound of heels clicking on the floor. You look up to see your sister coming down. Only wearing a tube top which make her breasts bulge out a bit, a mini skirt which only cover very little and high heels which make her even a few inches taller than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good.\" You say after a long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She says unsure what to say. \"Let's go.\" She says leading the way to her car. As she steps inside you step in the passenger's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure I shouldn't drive?\" You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen looks annoyed at your suggestion. \"Ruining my car? I have experience driving like this.\" She turns the keys and you go off like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly find the address Consuela gave you, there seem some lights coming from downstairs so Carmen parks the car a little further away. You carry the bowl with you in your backpack as you sneak towards the house, trying at least as Carmen's clicking of her heels tells the whole neighborhood that you're here. You push away the bushes to the house as you hold the opening for your sister to follow you. As she comes through her hair is in a bit of a mess.  You are careful not to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding under the only window with no light on, you throw a pebble against the window. Knowing the signal, Consuela opens the window and throws a rope down. You are about to climb when you notice Carmen's heels. \"I think you have to leave those behind for now.\" Carmen nods and puts her heels away. \"You better make sure you pick them up when you leave, they are vintage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling yourself up the rope you notice it's a rather new rope. You wonder where she got it, she didn't seem like the girl to use a rope for a reason. When you're underneath the window you pull yourself inside.

Carmen explains what's going to happen, so because of that they both sit next to each other on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've never tried it out yourself?\" Consuela asks surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we prefer to stay to our own gender.\" Carmen sneers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen takes a sip, \"Tastes like cherry\", and then hands it over to Consuela. She eagerly drinks from it as you have to take the bowl from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't know how much to drink. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsuela and Carmen both pass out at the same time. You check their pulses and find out they are okay. You just hope her parents won't barge in like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so both girls stir a bit. When they open their eyes they look a bit confused. When they take a look at each other they are both surprised. While Carmen's body checks out down. Consuela stands up and looks right in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the tooth fairy you dimwit.\" Carmen scowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she checks herself out, you can see her disappointment at seeing her bust size greatly diminished. As you turn your head you can see Consuela looking at herself too, a bit surprised at seeing her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that is taken care of, I hope you have written down all the things I need to know.\" Carmen says a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsuela nods as she walks over to the desk, you can see she has to straighten her back a bit more. She grabs the papers and hand them over to Carmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, in the car I have prepared the same thing and if something's missing you can always ask him.\" Carmen points at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsuela nods and suddenly Carmen's eyes bulge. \"You are not serious are you?\" She asked in a horrified voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsuela takes the paper again and nods. You wonder what they are talking about, but they didn't seem to let you know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll deal with it. Now make sure you drink a bit at the party, dance around. And if you see a nice guy, make sure he's wearing a condom. I've a package in the purse in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsuela turns flushed hearing this. \"Carmen, not every girl wants to jump in bed with the first guy she comes across.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but she is in my body now.\" Carmen points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you have to go, you promise you will keep in touch with each other. As you and Consuela land on the ground and Carmen pulls up the rope you grab the heels Carmen pulled off earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to put these on.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my first time wearing heels this tall.\" Consuela explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans on you a bit as she wriggles her feet inside the high heels. Holding your hand the first steps she later walks like a pro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think I could do this.\" Consuela tells excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the car where you take the wheel. Consuela couldn't access Carmen's memories and as you knew the way it was agreed on that you would drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you drove away Consuela was reading the papers Carmen left for her. She seemed far away, especially when you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou parked the car a few meters further. Consuela was still reading the papers. \"We're here now Consuela.\" You say when you touch her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up and sees you're right. \"I guess so. Well here we go.\" Consuela tells you exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk your way over you ask her: \"What are you going to say when Brad asks you who I am?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsuela tells you that she's going to say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was really stunning, and her ethnicity made her even more attractive in your opinion. \"And... Send!\" you said, dispatching the email. You then went back onto her picture and tried to picture what she would look like without her headscarf. You tried to see what color her hair was, as it wasn't listed in her personal details. \"Hmm, I doubt she's a blonde\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless she's dyed her hair, dummy!\" Carmen spoke up again, having overheard you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the same!\" you mumbled lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen just laughed. \"We don't even know if she wants to swap with me most or you\" she said.

Then she snapped herself out of her trance. \"Right lets get going, we don't want to keep Nerin waiting do we?\" she told you, ushering you out of the door as you bundled the bowl into your backpack. The trip to the mall on the bus only took 10 minutes, and once you had both arrived you slumped down on a seat while Carmen looked around eagerly. \"It was 10:00am we agreed to meet her right?\" your sister asked you, seeming impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Now stop pacing back and forth, you'll give yourself blisters\" you said, gesturing to Carmen's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister just looked down at the grey, 3-inch heeled suede pumps she had on, then walked over and sat down beside you. Her shoes actually went well with the 'skinny' jeans and pink t-shirt she had chosen to wear. The t-shirt was the tightest one she had and really emphasized her ample breasts. <i>\"Might as well have a big flashing neon sign over them\"</i> you thought, rolling your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you both looked to your right when you heard a voice. It was Nerin, standing there smiling, and appearing somewhat nervous. \"Um... hello, how are you? I'm Nerin!\" she introduced herself, her voice thick with a Turkish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you!\" Carmen said, jumping to her feet and shaking Nerin's hand. \"I'm Carmen!\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!!\" Nerin grinned, as she looked over the body that she would be wearing soon enough, she hoped. \"You look amazing!\" she nodded. Meanwhile, you were taking note of the way Nerin was dressed. Conservative as you expected. She was wearing a bright red hijab, which was hiding her black hair, a dark denim jacket with a red sweater underneath that went all the way up to her neck, and a long black skirt. On her feet she had a pair of plain black flats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is my brother John, he's a pain in the ass but you get used to him\" Carmen suddenly introduced you. You frowned at your sister and then smiled at Nerin as you shook her hand and admired her beauty. You could tell her breasts were at least as big as your sister's, if not larger, even though they were hidden from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the two of you got a surprise when one of Nerin's friends appeared from behind her, and was introduced to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aisha was hoping she could swap with you John\" she said, causing both you and Carmen to do a double take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what now?\" you mumbled, rubbing the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... if that's okay, just for a little while. Growing up with three brothers, I've always figured what it would be like being a boy\" Aisha explained somewhat nervously. You looked at your sister, and you were surprised to see her so amused, arching her eyebrow and grinning at you. \"I think that sounds like a great plan bro, don't you?\" she said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour response was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aisha's body was certainly growing on you, and you were glad you had been persuaded... or 'forced' to swap with her. \"How do you like Nerin's body?? You like being a Turk?\" you chuckled, nudging Carmen as she saw on the wall next to you, checking her new body out also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah its nice, but don't want it for keeps though. Life as a Muslim girl might be a little 'restrictive' shall we say?\" Carmen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not while you're here\" you pointed out, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen nodded. \"Okay, lets get to the mall, I want to buy some new clothes, these don't do it for me\" Carmen grinned, pulling you to your feet... but carefully so you didn't stumble in your heels.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

About 1 block (leaving the cost to clear), Nerin screamed with excitement \"Oh my god I cannot believe That I get to teach an American boy how to an Arab girl, this is going to be so fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing they did was go to an Arab grocery store, of course Nerin showed Aisha all the indigents of Sharma and how it's basically there pizza, Next, Nerin wanted to try out a more western thing and go shopping for a night out occasion. What John really liked was that Nerin didn't try to make John wear slutty things, instead he wore a black dress, with black heels, making Aisha look good but professional. Nerin laughed at John as he tried to show off the dress and heels combo but fell, saying that John \"Would get better at this kind of thing\". Finally Nerin and John got back to the dorm. John was just tired and stated that he was just ready to sleep for the rest of the day. Then Nerin remembered about Kunafeh, a dessert from the middle east that Nerin forgot to pick up from the store (Nerin only got these kind of things for celebrations and having John as a guest would consider a celebration). Nerin stated that she would be 20 minutes as she runs back to the store and get the item. And there was a text from the former Aisha,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey there is a small key on your new keychain that opens a locker in the room, where you would find a special toy. Don't tell Nerin about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn opened the locker and found it, a dildo. John quickly got undressed and looked at Aisha naked in the mirror, \"Damn, Aisha you are fine\" John said to himself in Aisha's sexy voice. John, knowing that time was of the essence, got down on Aisha's bed and started looking at pornhub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally John would have been happy with any video from his favorite actresses, but he was more picky this time, but what he didn't realize was subconsciously he was looking for a video that featured a cute guy. John found the right video and started to watch, and he started to play the video, and it started to get him worked up as he started playing with his own tits, which were becoming increasingly sensitive. Then in the video, where the guy entered. John took his toy and penetrated himself as well. As the toy vibrated John felt better and better, feeling a warmth from his new privates, on one hand the longer the toy went the better he felt, on one hand he wanted the buzzing to end, but on another he wanted it to keep going and to never stop. Eventually he orgasmed, which lasted way longer than he expected. At the end he was satisfied and put on pajamas and waited for Nerin to come home. </span></div></div>",

With a section on learning Arabic.<br>\r\n\"Why do I need to learn this\" John replied. \"I'm only Aisha for a month\"<br>\r\nNerin looked stressed, \"I know I just need you to know a couple of phrases and prayers to be on the safe side. If anyone wants you to speak Arabic just state that you are practicing your english, but there might be a few times where you have to speak Arabic and I want you to be ready\".<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll take the class, but I'll only do it for you\". John stated, trying to sound as sweet as possible. Which did bring a smile to Nerin's face. <br>\r\n\"So Aisha, what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I am going to listen to this first class on speaking Arabic, while job searching.\" John said smiling back.<br>\r\n\"Ok cool, Thanks, <i>Aisha</i>\" Nerin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that John got on with his job search, Looking at Aisha Resume, there was so many things that she did, Volunteered at numerous organization, took cooking jobs, took tutoring jobs. She also listed her grades as above a 4.5 GPA meaning that she aced AP classes. Which felt good for John for his ACT scores, but bad when he had to live up to that reputation. After searching on the internet, John found a job he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.) A Rock climbing instructor job in the athletic department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.) a person representing foreign students on campus<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John woke up the following morning. The First thing he noticed was the new weights on his chest and when he opened his eyes he saw black hair strings, <i>Yup, Yesterday wasn't a dream</i>. He soon got up and heard a ringtone. He quickly picked up the phone. \"Hi is this Aisha Haddad?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes it is.\" John stated, still getting used to that name.<br>\r\n\"This is Craig at the Jacksonville Athletic Department, We saw that you applied and would love to interview you\".<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds great, when would be good for you\". John replied, he was all excited.<br>\r\n\"Well with the dorms being filled in 5 days and classes starting in 2 weeks, I think as soon as possible. Maybe noon today, so if we hire you, you can pass all the certifications needed\". Craig said.<br>\r\n\"Noon sounds good to me\" John stated. Soon after John saw Nerin entering in their dorm room coming back from taking a shower.<br>\r\n\"Guess what Nerin? I have a job interview today at noon for the athletic department for the rock climbing section\".<br>\r\nThen Nerin expression went to a happy panic look. \"What is it\". John replied, questioning Nerin.<br>\r\n\"Nothing Aisha, it's just that you're not really an athlete at all, and in fact you kind of said in the past that soccer and football and all kind of sports are dumb.\" Nerin said.<br>\r\n\"Really\" John paused. \"Well I can't really tutor, I can't cook, and besides I visted my-\". John took another breath, realizing that he can't bring in his past life in this body. \"We'll I guess you can say past life, that I had a cousin who worked at a rock climbing center and said it was the easiest job in the world, so If I can do it, Aisha or I definitely can\".<br>\r\n\"Alright if it's an easy job and pays well I guess you'll have to deal with it\". Nerin said.<br>\r\n\"So um, heres the thing, the interview is today, and I feel like it's one of the only jobs I can get, so can you make me look nice, the interview is at noon.\" John said sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Aisha is always helping me out with fashion but this should be exciting. I always wanted to give someone a makeover\". Nerin replied happily. It was 9 AM and for the next two hours Nerin helped give John a makeover, doing her hair and makeup. While giving John a peptalk. Soon afterwards Nerin played Human Barbie with John until they settled on a blazer, a necklace, and long pants. Making John look like casual but a professional women. Before John left though he packed Aisha's only sporting shorts and a plan old tee shirt and running shoes in Aisha's backpack and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Interview went great, he was able to answer all the rock climbing questions about bouldering and do's and don't and John's spare outfit even came in handy when he began to rock climb. Though he found it more difficult than usual. He made it halfway up the wall then fell down (with a harness) because he misjudged a jump he thought he could make. Though Craig was impressed and offered John the job. and Even asked if any of Aisha's friends wanted jobs in the department as they were looking to diversify. After the interview was over John texted Nerin about the opportunity. But as he was leaving he made small conversation with this guy named Jim who had cute curly brown hair and beautiful blue eyes. He was an instructor last year at the rock climbing section. They had a good conversation about coming back to campus where John lied (kind of) coming back from Lebanon. After the conversation ,John had a thought about Jim, about how all the girls on campus must be after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was easy. John continued studying Arabic. Finding it was super easy to pick up on. Soon to end the day, John asked Nerin for the TV remote in Arabic, which he got right. and to that Nerin celebrated and got out another piece of Kunafeh. Nerin commented on how amazing it was that he got it perfectly and John replied that he wish he had Arabic as an option at High School as he would have definitely aced that instead of getting a D at Spanish. To which Nerin was amazed and surprised. Both laughed it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what John didn't realize was that he was receiving Aisha's neurological genes when he switched places with her. Since Aisha was a quick learner, John now was becoming the quick learner while Aisha was going to find it harder to learn new things. But this also meant Aisha would become interested in girls while John would become only interested in guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens the next day?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

John, still hesitant about his brain knew of some people who had no computer experiences until they hit college, and went into programming, so he was hoping that he could keep up with the class at least for two weeks until Aisha came back.<br>\r\n\"Can I take two computer classes, I was hoping to take them in college\". John replied, he was hoping she would say yes, and actually got a little nervous.<br>\r\n\"Fine, But on the condition that I get to join a club for you\" Aisha texted back.<br>\r\n\"Deal, also I got you a job on campus\". John texted back, he smiled Aisha's radiant smile, and in that moment he didn't care what club Aisha signed him up for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas John able to sign up for the computer classes</span></div></div>",

He looked over at Nerin and saw that she was in the mirror doing her makeup. <br>\r\n\"Hey you doing anything today?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got an interview at the Athletic center\" Nerin replied<br>\r\n\"Awesome, It would be cool to work at the same place, even if we work at different locations\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when do you go to rock climbing courses\".<br>\r\n\"In thirty minutes\". John looked through Aisha's closet, He couldn't find any athletic clothes in Aisha's closest other than the old pair that he used yesterday.<br>\r\n\"Hey does Aisha have anything athletic?\" John asked Nerin.<br>\r\n\"No, Aisha despised sports, so I haven't seen her buy any athletic wear\".<br>\r\n\"Perfect\" John replied sarcastically. He then threw on the athletic wear he wore the other day which was a bit old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later John arrived at the rock-climbing center, but before John entered, he met up with Jim and had a nice chat where they decided that if they had to belay another person they would choose each other. (Jim offered it and John was eager to accept). The class went well, although strange things started to happen first john caught himself staring at Jim\u2019s butt, thinking that when he switched back bodies, he should work for a butt like that. Then when John was being belayed, he hoped that Jim liked the view of Aisha butt. Which started to confuse and intrigue John. The training exercise was fun though towards the end John noticed Aisha\u2019s boobs getting sore, probably from moving all around and hitting the walls when he jumped. Finally, when the day finished John got Aisha certification to teach rock climbing and then he took another, personal big step. John asked for Jim\u2019s number, and he was nervous about it. But luckily Jim gave him his number which caused John to smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually John went into the women's locker room and took off his shirt and bra and rubbed his (well Aisha's) tits. They were just so sore, and he let out a little moan. Soon another rock-climbing girl came in and caught john giving himself a rubbed down. <br>\r\n\"Forget to wear a sports bra for the first climb? don't worry it happened to me first time I rocked climbed\" this new red head, light skinned girl said to John. (John also started to wonder what the hell a sports-bra was) John was embarrassed to get caught.  However, this new girl was super friendly and introduced herself as Nicole. She also exchanged contact info with Nicole, and she stated that they should meet up sometime and get some drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that John went back to the dorm and found Nerin at her desk. John asked how the interview went and Nerin stated that she got the job at the sign in counter. Nerin also mentioned how the other girls she talked to in the sign in center brought books to study when they weren\u2019t busy, which Nerin said was a big plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that conversation, Nerin asked if John wanted to watch some Arabic TV, to which John replied that it depends on Aisha's current wardrobe. John then looked at Aisha's closet and couldn't find a sports-bra (he looked it up on the way back to campus). He told Nerin that he would be out for an hour and then he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn went to the mall and got some sports bras. John then remembered Nicole\u2019s outfit and the other girls outfits, he saw how they dressed. Yoga pants and short gym shorts. John wondered how Aisha looked in those. John started to try on Yoga pants, and they looked real good on her, like really sexy, then John tried on some short athletic shorts, which made Aisha's butt look good, (though it could be a little more toned). Finally John eye got caught by a pink laced bra, he quickly grabbed it and tried it on in the changing room. He admitted Aisha looked sexy in this, however he realized that if he was going to buy this, he was going to buy this specifically for a guy to see. John decided that he was ok with that. Just to experience the girl prospective of dating, he kept telling himself. John finished up shopping for some slim fit tank top and long sleeve shirt and bought some running shoes. The cost at checkout was high but John figured that since he starts working soon and got a job right away that the paychecks could go to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then John noticed the tear in her eye.<br>\r\n\"Hey is everything all right?\" John asked.<br>\r\n\"No, no it's something stupid\" Nerin replied. John took a seat next to her.<br>\r\n\"Hey, come on, you can tell me\" John said in a calm friendly manner. Nerin looked over and saw John's bright radiant smile shine through Aisha's face.<br>\r\n\"Ok so, me and Aisha used to watch this soap opera from Egypt and it was our favorite show together, and tonight was the premiere and I'm just missing her\". Nerin replied. John felt bad, I mean it was technically his fault that Aisha wasn't here.<br>\r\n\"Hey can you explain the show to me and then we can rewatch the show with subtitles and i'll be your soap opera pale tonight\". John said. John really wanted to Nerin to be happy, especially since she had been such a great roommate. Nerin agreed to the terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the show Nerin explained that in last season, Reem (girls name) had a choice to make, Mohammad, the poor pool boy going to college, or Ahmed, the Engineer from a rich family. Nerin explained that Reem truly loves Mohammad, but doesn't want to disgrace her family name by turning down Ahmed.\"Well its simple, Reem should marry Mohammad\". John replied.<br>\r\n\"But what about family tradition and disappointing the family name?\" Nerin stated.<br>\r\n\"Well if your family truly loved you, then they'll support you being happy no matter who the guy is\". John stated.<br>\r\nNerin came over and touched John's feminine hands, \"I want you to know, I was always team Mohammad and Aisha was team Ahmed\". Nerin said.<br>\r\n\"That's so funny, hey if you want I can record a video confessing my team as Mohammad\". John replied.<br>\r\n\"Totally\" Nerin stated.<br>\r\nWhile the show was going, John noticed he didn't really need subtitles, he was understanding all what they were saying. While the show was going he was beaming with pride with how well he was understanding Arabic. The episode finally ended with Reem choosing Ahmed over Muhammed.<br>\r\n\"shit, how could she chose Ahmed,  he's totally not right for her\".<br>\r\nNerin looked over with shock and amazement  \"I can tell totally tell that's not Aisha in there, I mean you make her look and sound so western\". <br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll take that as a compliment\". John replied.<br>\r\nSoon Nerin got out her phone and started recording John confession that Reem should have chosen Mohammad, at the end John also stated that Mohammad was also the sexier looking one in Arabic. That move stunned Nerin in an excited giggle stating that she can't wait to show that to Aisha once she's back, and that she'll never delete the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after the episode John asked Nerin if there were any Mohammads in her life. She exclaim that there was one western  Muslim boy Yosef that she wanted to go out with, but that her family wouldn't approve of. Nerin quickly stated not tell Aisha she told him about Yosef, and John got the sense that Aisha might not have approved of Nerin and Yosef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone the less, the girls (John and Nerin) got to go to bed. Nerin reminded John that move in day was tomorrow and class was in three days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn quickly went to bed afterwards.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being move in day on campus was quite busy at the rock climbing center, and John had to teach new college students the safety of rock climbing. However during break Jim came up to John and complemented him on his new athletic look. John blushed, (but Jim couldn't tell due to Aisha's natural olive skin) and John complemented how good Jim's shirt was. Afterwards he felt like a total idiot making the same complement back to him. But then Jim asked him what he was doing tonight, and John replied that he was just doing a girls night with his friend Nerin. Jim then responded that if John wanted, he could go to a party tonight. John emphatically said yes, but then asked if he could bring a couple of friends. Jim replied that if it was only a couple it wouldn't be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNerin POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn went to Nerin during the break, \u201cHey, guess what? I got us invited to a party, and I got you and Yousef invited. Listen it would be awesome if you could help me get ready in the dress we bought together\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if we get caught, I mean we are underage College Sophomores. We could be kicked off campus\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cListen if it gets too big or out of hand we\u2019ll leave, but I want to show you apart of my culture\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, when I\u2019m done my shift I\u2019ll let you know my answer\u201d. Nerin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter signing in and out people at the gym, Nerin thought about what John had to say. She wanted to experience an American college life. But Aisha always told her about needing to avoid mistakes in order to remain in the US. Even if it meant no parties, and no boyfriends to remain focused on school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Aisha wasn\u2019t here, and why not have a real American college experience. So Nerin showed up to the dorm room She immediately told John to shave his legs. <br>\r\nSoon after shaving the leg process, Nerin helped John with makeup and hair. She could never image doing this with the real Aisha, but there was Aisha body smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohns POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Getting ready for a party was fun, he\u2019s never been to a college party. And getting all dressed up just added to the excitement.  Soon it came to that bra.  \"Am I really going to put a pink bra on. \u201c John thought about it.  \u201cWe\u2019ll even though I don\u2019t want to sleep with Jim, its nice to have options, and besides its all part of getting dressed up.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were about to leave Nerin saw a pink trimmed bra?<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, were did you find that bra, I never took Aisha as the one to have a bra like that\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh it was in the back of her drawer, I just thought it went with the outfit, you know going to a party\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWeird, I\u2019ll have to ask Aisha that when we talk next\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after as John and Aisha were walking down the stairs and saw Yousef. \u201cWow he\u2019s a better looking than the Mohammad actor\u201d. When Yousef saw the two girls he complimented their look. But he stumbled on Nerin\u2019s complement. John just smiled to himself. They made small chat to the frat house, which was a 15 minute walk. Nerin and Yousef obviously had crushes on each other<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They made small talk and Yousef also knew Jim from Chemistry class. John text Jim while they were on their way and he let them in.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Aisha, Nerin, and Yousef right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d Yousef replied.<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything i can get you to drink\u201d Jim replied. <br>\r\nJohn looked around the house and saw the house party was just getting started. But the peer pong table was empty.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can get us drinks as long as you and Yousef play me and Nerin in beer pong\u201d. John replied to Jim.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get right on that\u201d Jim replied.<br>\r\n\u201cAisha I don\u2019t know how to play\u201d.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, just shot the ball into the cup, If they're distracted bounce it into the cup. if they try to bounce swat it away without knocking down our cup. If you don\u2019t know just ask me\u201d John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the four played John and Jim smacked talked each other. While Yousef and Nerin just kind of complimented each other. What was surprising was that Nerin was good at beer pong. This went along John being pretty good and so they dominated the first game. Though John had to teach Nerin how to drink a beer (quick sips try not too taste).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Nerin, beer pong was a simple game. After their victory, They played two guys and won that. During the match John was getting hit on by guys, but once John caught on that he was getting hit on, he made the new onlookers Jim his lucky charm (John high fives him after every shot) and John made Nerin high five Yousef after every shoot of the ping pong ball. That worked for the second and third game. However by the forth, John, already not great on heels, started to stumble and Nerin was feeling the effects of her first drinks. They lost but they were happy of their 3 game winning streak. Nerin then told John she needed to use the bathroom. During that time John went and found Yousef.<br>\r\n\u201cHey I think you should ask out Nerin, you two would be perfect for each other\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Aisha, what happened to you this summer? Going to a party and telling me to date Nerin, where was this last year?\u201d. Yousef asked.<br>\r\nJohn replied his best to save face \u201cWe\u2019ll being new students, I was worried that Nerin would fail, but after having a year under our belt I feel we can experience American college experience while not failing. Sorry last year we were scared of difficulty of American schools\u201d. John said, trying to put Aisha in the best light.<br>\r\n\u201cYou think she\u2019ll say yes?\u201d Yousef asked<br>\r\n\u201cI know she will\u201d. John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards after finding Nerin coming from the bathroom. John went to her and told her about Yousef\u2019s intentions. Nerin was worried about schools and a boyfriend and John reassured her that boyfriends can help her study, and that when she\u2019s stressed out, her boyfriend can help calm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn walked across the room to Jim and then saw a smile light up Nerin face, pretty soon Nerin came over and asked John if he could stay at the party for an hour more. To which John said yes. After Nerin and Yousef left, Jim asked what John was going to do? To which John asked how far away was Jim\u2019s room.<br>\r\nJim replied he had a room in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohns POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can\u2019t believe this. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. I can\u2019t do this I\u2019m not gay. John looked up the stairs at Jim\u2019s cute butt. Ok this body is definitely  not straight. Maybe this is ok? Maybe since this body isn\u2019t straight, this makes it alright. And besides I\u2019m only in this body for 3 weeks, might as well get the full experience. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went upstairs and John got out of the dress that he got with Nerin, He left the pink bra on. Jim slowly played with John\u2019s long hair. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease I need this\u201d John whispered in Jim\u2019s ear. Jim quickly threw John on the bed and the two started a little foreplay with Jim eating out John. It felt incredibly good for john having that warm moist source against his warm moist source. Soon John couldn\u2019t take it anymore and he told Jim he was ready. Jim Penetrated John and they went at it in the missionary position. Eventually both orgasmed. At the end Jim took off his condom and the two cuddled. Soon John told Jim that he had to go, and that they should make it official. Jim agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn got up 5 minutes later, Jim asked john to text him when he got back to the dorm. As John entered the building John texted him and smiled as he sent the message. When John got back to the dorm room he opened the door and asked if anyone was here. John could hear Yousef voice say \u201cUhh. five minutes\u201d.  John just waited out the door and laughed as soon as Yosef came out. Yosef than thanked John as he campout looking disgruntled. John then went into the room. Nerin wanted to explain what happened but John was too tired and Nerin they would talk in the morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nerin looked stressed out.<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, it was a mistake, I can\u2019t believe I did that\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy was he mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he was sweet and kind\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cThen why was it a mistake?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I should be focused on school work\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cListen plenty of college students have boyfriends or girlfriends. Why don\u2019t you at least test it out, see how the semester goes with a boyfriend and if it becomes too much then you can be honest with him\u201d. John replied.<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think i can do that?\u201d Nerin replied.<br>\r\n\u201cI know you can\u201d. John replied.<br>\r\n\u201cOk I got a text from Yosef for a lunch date so I might see how this plays out\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cCool\u201d John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon John left for his rock climbing job. He saw Jim there and the two exchanged glances throughout the workday. John thought a lot about last night. As much as he hated to admit it, the sex was great. And Jim was pretty cool. He also thought about what would happen when Aisha comes back to her body. based on the talks with Nerin it seemed Aisha wasn\u2019t the dating type, which meant no Aisha and Jim couple. During work John thought a lot about this. If he was a girl now, he was straight to date Jim so it isn\u2019t really that wrong John thought. And besides why not get the full women experience while he had the chance and be happy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when their shift ended Jim came up to John and asked if they should be exclusive. and John said yes. Jim then went in for a kiss which John reciprocated. He liked it. And missed it from last night. Besides it was only for 3 more weeks. Or so he thought.</span></div></div>",

After the session was done, John looked down at his homework and felt he could really understand it. Some guy from class asked john if he needed help, but John honestly told him that he understood it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Normally when working on homework John had to really think about things and go back and reread about the lesson but he just went ahead with the homework and got it done in 15 minutes where everything was perfect. So after John was done homework, John decided to go to the gym improve the strength of Aisha's body, but as John entered the gym he saw that it was 90 percent guys doing weight lifting. It kind of made John nervous. Then John saw a yoga class which had the opposite makeup. John quickly went over and signed up. And honestly, John found Yoga really fun and relaxing, but there was a slice of difficulty to it which made it enjoyable. Also John didn\u2019t realize how flexible this body was.

Nerin questioned how John knew that since he was a guy and he just said it was his best guess since he had a sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Nerin quickly went to the mall and saw that the nail salon was empty, to which Nerin quickly signed up the two to get both nails and fingernails done. Getting nails done was quite the experience for John and relaxing, it was weird to get his foot messaged but it was cool and relaxing. While getting Nerin in a good mood he asked about Yosef. Nerin thanked John for telling him to keep dating him and said they had a wonderful lunch together. Then John needed to address the elephant in the room. \"So Nerin, I need to tell you, Jim and I are a thing\" John confessed.<br>\r\nkeeping in mind the person doing their nails. Nerin responded with this.<br>\r\n\"Aisha, I never took you as the dating type, what lead you to this decision\".<br>\r\n\"Well Life is too short not to have fun, and he makes me happy and I have to make the most of this dating oppertunity\". John replied.<br>\r\n\"Hey, whatever makes you happy, just remember to make sure things end nicely\". Nerin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued getting their nails done. and when they finished John and Nerin had a conversation in private.<br>\r\n\"Hey are you really sure you are happy with me dating\". John asked in earnest.<br>\r\nNerin looked over at the person in her friends body. She was much more friendly and more open, since John has been in Aisha body, she had been an MVP friend. And honestly she liked John's Aisha more than Aisha's Aisha.<br>\r\n\"No you deserve to be happy, besides how do you like doing girly things and being a girl.\" Nerin replied.<br>\r\nJohn looked down at his female form. Shopping was more interesting, living with a roommate was better, and he hadn't noticed the downside.<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I didn't think this would be this good, obviously I don't want to keep being a girl longer than I have to, but I can honestly say it's been fun\". John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNerin just laughed a nervous laugh. <br>\r\nThe two went home and slept.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Please don't let Carmen see this!\" you sighed, rushing over to Nerin as fast as your awkward high heels would allow. After kissing Scott, Nerin glanced to her right and saw you approaching. She seemed shocked, as if caught red-handed. She moved to pre-empt you before you say or do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aisha... hi!!\" she called out, breaking her embrace and standing up to hug you. You were taken aback as your sister's body hugged you and kissed you on the cheek. \"Scott, this is a friend of mine, Aisha, she's from Lebanon!\" she then introduced you to Carmen's ex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you!\" Scott smiled, standing up and shaking your feminine hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah hi!\" you mumbled, not sure what else to do. You immediately saw Scott's eyes glance at your 'modest' breasts after he had greeted you. There was no wonder Carmen had ditched this creep, he was like nearly all other guys, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNerin's sharp mind had already worked out that Carmen probably wouldn't be far behind you, and so she instantly suggested that you all leave the park and head to the mall for a while. You couldn't really stop her from 'taking over'. You found yourself being swept along for the ride, even though you knew that Carmen would be pissed if she caught you hanging with Nerin and her asshole ex-boyfriend. Nerin also had realized that her seeing Scott was something Carmen didn't approve of, not thats he was really bothered. As long as she was wearing Carmen's body she figured she could see who she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Aisha, lets get out of here!\" Nerin grinned, taking hold of your hand and leading you out of the park, ignoring your quite protests as she did so. \"Don't spoil my fun John! Your sister's body is hot and horny\" Nerin whispered into your ear when Scott wasn't looking. You just gulped and remained silent, not knowing what to do next. You had one last look around the park but you couldn't see your sister. Before you knew it the three of you were on a bus heading back to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were definitely in a predicament, to say the least.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't mind being in Nerin's Turkish body, but Nerin seeing Scott behind her back was too much. He was an asshole and she swore she'd never see him again. All Carmen wanted to do now was get her body back. As she approached the opposite end of the park, she walked up to a woman who was watching her two children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, have you seen a young woman, about 22 years old, red hair. She's probably with a boy around the same age?\" Carmen asked the woman, who gave it a moment's thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo I'm sorry... oh wait a minute, yeah.. I think I saw them leaving the park together a few minutes ago. There was another girl with them though\" the woman responded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another girl??\" Carmen frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was foreign I think. Similar skin tone to your own actually\" the woman nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... did 'she' have dark hair, hanging loose? Wearing jeans and heels?\" Carmen then inquired, putting her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe she did yes. She seemed a little reluctant to go with them come to think of it. The red-headed girl was leading her by the hand\" the woman then said, after glancing to make sure her children were okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen by this time wore a 'pissed off' expression on her face. \"Did you happen to hear where they were going?\" she asked, trying to stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm sorry I didn't! But they were heading towards the bus stop, and that line goes to the mall\" the woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you!\" Carmen said, forcing a smile out. She then walked past the woman and out of the park, muttering to herself. Her anger was now split between Nerin, Scott and her brother. She wanted her body back and she wanted revenge. Hell hath no fury like a sister scorned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted her body back and she wanted to kick her ex-boyfriend's ass while getting it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat puzzled her though was why her brother would betray her.

She briefly apologized to him but didn't stop to help him up. Letting out a sigh, she looked around, studying the facade of the building, then went inside again in search of her wayward brother, her asshole ex and her own body, currently inhabited by a mischievous Nerin. Carmen adjusted the long black skirt she was wearing and tensed her toes inside Nerin's flats before setting off walking again. She had dispensed with the red headscarf, being unwilling to wear such a 'restrictive' garment. Which meant Carmen's (Nerin's) dyed blonde hair with black roots was on display, and not exactly tidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen went from person to person, asking if they had seen Nerin, Scott and 'Aisha', but she had no luck... at least not at first.

They don't even speak our language and won't survive when they are forced to return home in your places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNerin then spoke up and said \"I already applied a couple months ago to stay here indefinitely so Carmen might not have to worry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me!?!

Why am I doing all of the leg work and you're doing nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that she was partially right. She was the one doing the switching and you were basically sitting back and collecting free money. \"This is all your idea. I'm just providing the swapping bowl. You will have a stripper's body and how much money you make will be all on you.\" you angrily told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you said seemed to have worked.

Stepping out of her doorway, you went into your room and closed the door. As soon as it was locked you went into one of your desk drawers and made sure the bowl was still there.

Realizing that the time was now, you walked over to your front door and opened it to see not one, but two women walking up to you. Both women were black. The one on the left was Nia and the one on the right was Joan. Nia wore jean shorts and a leopard print halter top that showed off her large, dark brown breasts while her hair was tied up in a bun. Joan was dressed more conservatively wearing skinny jeans and a tight pink t-shirt while her hair was woven into some kind of African braids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two approached, you said \"I told you last night that my sister could only switch with you Nia. Your sister will have to wait until next weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia's expressions seemed to indicate that she was not happy with what you said. She paused for a second and looked over to her sister before saying \"I know that. She here to watch and chill with me after\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you understood her. This was your first face to face meeting and this woman seemed to speak in street slang that took a moment to understand. Motioning for them to follow you inside you quietly told them \"My parents aren't home at the moment and my younger sister is still sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you went inside and you lead them down the hall towards Carmen's room. You quietly knocked before opening her door. Carmen was already dressed and sitting on her unmade bed scrolling through Facebook on her phone. She wore a pair of grey sweatpants and a white t-shirt where a black bra could be seen underneath. Her hair was at least combed and it didn't look like she had just gotten out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nia and Joan were inside, you left to go get the bowl from your safe spot in your room. When you came back, you saw both Carmen and Nia looking each other over while Joan stood there in the corner just watching. Realizing that this was a business transaction, you told Nia \"So it will be $400 dollars to switch with my sister until Monday morning. She gets to keep whatever money she makes in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia stopped hungrily staring at Carmen and looked over at you with anger. \"I know you stupid cracker. I may be black but I can do math.\" Nia said before laughing. Joan joined in as the two women laughed until Carmen told them to keep it down. Nia then said \"I'm sorry. I just called you a cracker when I'm about to become one myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell from Carmen's face that she really didn't like these women. They were really crass and something didn't feel right about them. \"So lets see the money.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia pointed over to her purse that Joan was holding in addition to her own and said \"I got it all right there.\" Joan opened the cheap fake leather purse and pulled out a wad of twenty dollar bills before putting them back inside. Nia said \"I ain't forking over shit until after this switch of yours works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen grabbed her chair and told Nia to have a seat. Nia sat down in a very unfeminine like manner while you handed your sister the golden bowl. She sat down on the side of her bed held the bowl up to her face and looked over at Nia and thought about what she was doing. After realizing that all three of your eyes were watching her, she drank and big gulp of water out of the bowl before handing it back over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you had the bowl in your hands, you turned towards Nia and handed her the bowl. \"I need you to drink out of this bowl\" you told her. She briefly stared at Carmen with a hungry look in her eyes and began chugging all of the water out of the bowl. Once the bowl was empty, she dropped the empty bowl onto the carpet and then asked \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what was supposed to happen next when suddenly Nia seemed to doze off. Looking behind you, you saw that Carmen had passed out as well and fell back onto her bed. You were worried that something had gone wrong when you saw Carmen waking up almost as quickly as she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately ran over to her and tried to help her sit back up when she pushed you away and said \"I don't need help you stupid cracker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Carmen seemed shocked. But for different reasons. She immediately noticed something different about her voice and looked down. She began examining her hands and arms while you looked over towards Nia who was already examining her body as if she had never seen it before. \"Carmen?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia's body had already been cupping her breasts and was trying to adjust her top to hide part of the dark brown nipples that had popped out. Nia's body quickly looked up at you and said \"I'm inside here John.\" while continuing to try and control her new and large brown breasts from spilling out of the top she now wore.</span></div></div>",

But prove me wrong, right now I\u2019m one of that crackers, and boy oh boy I\u2019m enjoying this\u201d she says interrupting your sister, at the same time that she slowly moved to the bowl that was near her feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t wat to make this, trust me. Transactions are transaction. But you leave me without option\u201d.

The sole image of your sister holding a gun against you was so surreal that you doubted if you weren\u2019t dreaming. The mad smile on your sister body only making this more of a nightmare than a normal dream. Why did your sister had to select her? Why you had to found that damn bowl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t whisper between yourself\u201d the hard tone on the voice of your sister was harder than the worst fight that had happened between you and your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I going to lose my body?

Your mind was completely cut down from having any rational thoughts. The smell of gunpowder woke you up from your stupor. <i>Did Nia killed Carmen?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNia! You killed her!\u201d the hysteric voice of Joan confirmed your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, shit, shit. It wasn\u2019t supposing to be loaded.

What the fuck is she thinking? The situation was pretty bad and you didn\u2019t know how you would exit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk white boy, let\u2019s make a deal\u201d Nia voice bring you back from your thoughts. Joan stayed standing against the door, also looking at Carmen body, in an expectantly way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your problem, you just killed my sister\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I could kill you, take this bowl and disappear\u2026 but it is more easy say it than do it\u2026 and I don\u2019t want to do bad just for the sake of it\u201d Nia started meanwhile she seated on her new bed. \u201cLike it or not, you are my new brother, and I don\u2019t want for Joan to have any kind of problems with the cops\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not my sister\u201d you said, with the most hateful tone that you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are going to help your old sister here. And for that, you just need to select one of the next options\u2026\u201d she continued, obviously ignoring you. \u201cFirst, you change with my sister here, and you go back to her life. You can take the bowl with you, and we don\u2019t say anything to the cops about the sister of the striper. If you want, we could even help you to obtain a new body\u201d the way that she was talking was making you mad, like if the life of Carmen was already her. \u201cSecond option, you help my sister to change with someone of your family. I could have done that to that mother of you, but I would prefer to not raise suspicion\u201d Nia looked at her sister, before looking back at you. \u201cThird, you help Nia to obtain a new body of her preference. And fourth, I kill you and then change into a body that doesn\u2019t and will not have problems with the law\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last sentence was a bucket of cold water. Nia was serious about killing you if you didn\u2019t help her, maybe because she already didn\u2019t have anything to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it, you could have anybody if you decide to change with Joan. A man life, and if you want, I could be your new girlfriend\u2026 I promise that you will enjoy your time. Or if you want, a woman body and to become part of the better sex. Any friend of your sister that you fancy? I can also give you photos of my old coworker.\u201d She paused, turning her sight towards her sister \u201cJoan, would you like to be a man, or you prefer to continue being a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoan being alluded, started looking you, eyeing from head to toes, clearly thinking about the possibility of becoming you. \u201cI don\u2019t have a preference, I suppose being a man could be fun, they have more power\u201d You had though that she had a better moral compass than her sister, but now that she was saying this without any problem it makes you reconsider your evaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia looked back at you \u201cAny time has you thought about someone of your family that you wish would change, what do you think of a new set of people for family? Trust me when I say that I take care of my family\u201d she paused, analyzing your expression. \u201cI could hook you with some of my friends\u201d she said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up she started taking stuffs with her left hands, meanwhile the right hand was still holding the gun that was directed at you. If you could take the gun from her, everything would be solved, but Carmen wouldn\u2019t come back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you have a girl that you are interested, but has never noticed you? Maybe a bully that you would like for him to suffer? Joan could be your new friend, girlfriend even\u2026 and I would help her\u201d The implications of what she was saying was making you sick in the stomach, but was also making you react down there. \u201cSo\u2026 John\u2026 what do you decide?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about what she has done to your sister inclined you to say no, but that would mean your death. You could always accept and then try to cross her, but that sounded very difficult to do. Finally, she has given you a lot of reason for accepting her offer, and even if you didn\u2019t want to admit, the propositions were very attractive. But something was bugging you about the proposition. If you had thought about accepting and crossing her, who said that she wouldn\u2019t cross you out?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It actually worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hardly believe this. You've become Stacy! More to the point, you've become a girl! Heck, even besides that, just the fact that you're someone else is incredible. Every single detail of your body feels fascinatingly different, from the slim shape of your fingers to the modest lumps on your chest. You feel like you could just stand totally still for the rest of the day, taking in all the differences, big and small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you don't get to indulge that feeling for long before the door bursts open behind you. You spin around to see none other than yourself... or, presumably, Stacy in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?!\" she almost screams. At the sight of the hysterical expression on your own face, your sensory overload gives way to smug amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it looks to me like <i>you're</i> John,\" you snicker, making an attempt at feminine posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, you're John! I'm Stacy!\" she says, not quite sounding entirely sure of herself.

You have barely sweat, while in your own body you would be smelly already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour amazement goes down when you want to pump some iron. When you try to hold up the weight you normally do, your arms sink even faster than the titanic. A couple of nearby guys have to help you, get up. They warn you that you should begin with something lighter. Like you didn't know already. You then begin to lift lighter weights which goes much better. You do some other machines as well, making sure to train Stacy's muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are done working out, you have sweat a lot, your muscles ache, but it's all worth it. You make your way to the changing room, sitting down on the bench next to your sport bag. It's time to change back into Stacy's normal clothes.

What more could you ask for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up your bag and find a spot next to Nina. As she's standing in her underwear you tap her on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, can I help you?\" She asks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you're Nina right?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. Who are you? Wait a minute, Carmen right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Stacy. Carmen is my sister.\" You tell her rolling with your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah right, I got you mixed up with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So was there anything you wanted to ask me?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but can you keep it a secret?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around and grins: \"Sure, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to swap bodies with me?\" You ask her revealing the bowl. You tell her how the bowl will swap your bodies with each other. The other women have left the changing room so you are alone now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, it looks familiar.\" Nina tells you as she holds the bowl in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really do you know where?\" You ask her excited. You were wondering if there were similar things like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina looks at it again and puts it down on her lap. \"Sorry sweetie, I can't remember it exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a little:\" That's okay, perhaps you will remember it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nods as she laughs. \"Besides didn't you want to swap bodies with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slightly as Nina takes hold of the bowl again and sips a little of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tastes sweet, really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the bowl and take a sip too. When suddenly your vision changed, you don't have the bowl in your hand no more. You look to your right and see Stacy sitting there. She looks at you first then down. \"Oh my gosh, I can't believe this.\" She runs over to the mirror. You stand up and walk over next to her. Walking around makes you realize your center of gravity is slightly different, as is the way you walk. You stand next to Nina as she examines herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable. And how long did you say this will be?\" She asks you as she studies your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no time limit to this thing, until we drink again we will stay like this.\" You carefully place your hand on your breasts as you feel them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to stay like this for now at least. I can't wait to do some gym exercises. I'll bet it will be much easier now.\" Nina jumps up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so too.\" You say as you jump up and down as well. The weight of your breasts makes you stop much earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nina undresses herself and puts on the baggy t-shirt and sweat pants you have to put on Nina's sports bra and yoga pants. When you pulled off Nina's bra you had to focus on something else, you were almost grabbing those beauties.  When looking again in the mirror you feel yourself a bit uneasy to look at this view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait. And I didn't catch your name?\" Nina asks suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, the name's John. Stacy is my sister. But how did you figure that out?\" You ask her confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles as she looks at you. \"Well putting on a bra, even the one your sister is wearing is something all girls would know, but you fumbled around with it for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stupid of me.\" You say shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina takes your hand. \"That's okay John, I knew you wouldn't do any harm.\" She then lets go and opens the door and goes through. But she returns just a second later. \"Oh yeah, you could check out my body, I don't mind but I will do the same thing then too.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There is no question about it: Nina, your mother's coworker at the hospital, is a gym bunny! After you awkwardly clasp her sports bra behind your back, you shimmy into her skin-tight yoga pants and a turquoise blue tank top. She had already tied her long, black hair into a ponytail, which you can now feel tickling your upper back and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be a very strange experience for you, John.\" Remarks Nina, observing her coworker's teenage son with amusement. \"But it seems you are taking it well. Have you swapped with girls before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeeting her glance after tying her running shoes, you answer: \"No. Stacy was my first time. I just discovered that bowl this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles, then suggests: \"Well, you could do a good job passing as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" You ask, looking down at Nina's trim, toned body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" She nods approvingly. \"But it's one thing to look the part. It's another to actually go out there! Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're glad how comfortable and open-minded Nina is regarding the swap. Since you have never really talked to her in depth before, you weren't sure how she would react. If she had any reservations about becoming your 15-year-old sister, she certainly wasn't showing it. In fact, she seems to enjoy exploring Stacy's lithe figure. Despite being twice as young, Stacy stands a few inches taller than Nina. You realize that Nina's 5'1'' frame is just really short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place Nina's workout bag in her locker and watch her fasten the padlock back on. Before leaving the locker room, you pause in front of a full-body mirror. \"Do you mind if I take a picture?\" Then, unable to resist adding, \"I... I think you're really beautiful and --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina tilted her head slightly, then purred, \"No need to be bashful! It's your body now, after all. Do what you like with it!\" She had seen that expression of lust before. On men's faces, to be sure, not on her own. But she knew the look all the same. She knew it would be one John was about to receive too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you snap a couple photos on Stacy's smart phone, figuring that you could send them to yourself once you swap back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/jUD4hgu.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/jUD4hgu.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nina walk over to the weight room first. Stacy prefers to go to the gym Saturday mornings when there are fewer people using the equipment. Even so, you could feel eyes trailing your athletic form. The unavoidable feminine pitching of your hips and ass hypnotizing several men as you pass by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nudges you quietly. <i>Don't worry about it, it's only natural</i>. She might have said. You could definitely see things from their point of view (you had until half an hour ago). But you weren't sure whether to feel complimented or unnerved. The jiggling of Nina's ample breasts and ass not helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally: the weight room. Pop music plays on the speakers overhead as Nina throws herself into her usual workout routine. You have no idea what Stacy normally does, if she even lifts weights as opposed to running on the treadmill or swimming in the lap lanes. Flexing Nina's biceps, you know this is her stomping grounds for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her lead, you and Nina stretch before venturing over to the lateral triceps machine. Nina goes first, carefully testing Stacy's strength before adding bars to the point where she plateaus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These stick-thin noodles!\" She jokes, prodding your youngest sister's arms with a manicured nail. \"It would take a year, at least, to get up to my speed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" You begin, \"How much do you normally start with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not begin with 110 pounds?\" She suggests. \"That's probably less than you can normally manage, John, but that's not bad for a woman of my size.\" She tacks on the right amount, and you plop your butt down onto the seat. Tucking your thighs in place, you reach up and do a set of 10 pulls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BHfYhctD2Y_/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BHfYhctD2Y_/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad!\" Nina claps lightly as you stand up, smoothing out your tank top and patting your flat belly. \"Let's take it up to 120 this time.\" You tell Nina you want to do one of your favourite routines, the bench press. She tells you she doesn't normally do that. Gingerly, you rack on only 75 pounds and give it a try:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/8bB2-QQK2j/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/8bB2-QQK2j/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room for improvement?\" Nina says, then (while no one is looking) slapping your rear end. \"At least I've got a nice butt! Seeing it from this angle, I know why it drives the guys crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it went, with you and Nina chatting about various sorts of topics while lifting or stretching out on a foam mat. She seems like a pretty down-to-earth person, you conclude. Telling you all about her family, growing up as a child in Venezuela, moving to your country to study at university, getting a job, meeting your mother at work, and so on. In turn, you tell her more about your life, your interest in the paranormal, high school, attempts to get a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicks her tongue. \"Tch, that is such a shame. I don't see how a guy like you can stay single. Aren't the girls all over you??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, clearing your throat with a ladylike cough. \"Well, I wouldn't mind having a girlfriend... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't know how to ask one out?\" Nina surmised pointedly. She scoffs, \"Boys! You think girls hold all the cards, but we're just as nervous as you sometimes. You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any girls in mind you'd like to ask out?\" She continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it. \"There is this one girl at school I like. Her name is Brooke Smith, she's in a few of my classes.\" Brooke being the textbook definition of 'cute' -- in a girl next door kind of way. Not a busty bimbo type, but not a bookworm either. Actually, you haven't talked to her many times since meeting her a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Nina asks, \"And you're concerned that she doesn't know you well enough? That you might come off as strange by asking her out all of a sudden?\" You nod. In more or less words, that's exactly the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only someone with better experience talking to girls could speak for you somehow.\" Suggests Nina. \"How about an <i>actual girl</i>?\" You get the hint immediately. Gulping, \"N-n-no! That's not necessary! There's a school dance coming up in a week, and I figured that I could ask her to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how to dance?\" Nina presses. Again, not really. Dancing skills never being emphasized as a 'macho' or masculine thing to know. She shook her head. \"<i>Ay dios mio</i>, you need my help I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't learn to dance well in just a few days!\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not you, but I absolutely <i>love</i> dancing.\" Nina explains. \"It's the art of expressing one's body in movement. I've danced since I was a little girl. What if I go in your place to the dance? All you have to do is ask her out. Or... I can do that too! It just means I should borrow your body a little longer. For this week. Maybe the next too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace, \"I don't think this is a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? In your body, I could also spend more time getting to know Tracy. She and I both work at the hospital, but she never wants to talk about her personal life. I could learn more about her while getting a much-needed break from work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your hands on your wide hips. \"But what about me? I don't know how to be a nurse! This is crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a nurse isn't so hard! You just have to take care of people and be attentive to their needs.\" Nina speaks quickly. \"How about it, John? You stay in my body for the next week, and I'll pretend to be you. I will learn more about my coworker and maybe even get you that girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina, in Stacy's body, looks down at you pleadingly. What do you decide?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just needs some rest and she\u2019ll be fine\u201d. \u201c Whatever you say bro, BtW do you still have the bowl with you cause I\u2019m also kind of thirsty\u201d. \u201c Yeah sure let me pick it up\u201d You say as you go grab the bowl from downstairs. \u2018 I could use this to my advantage as Carmen\u2019s body has become available to be taken.

What are you so unfit you can\u2019t even go up the stairs without going out of air?\u201d She mocks you as she takes a sip out of the bowl?\u201d \u201c Yeah laugh all you want at least I don\u2019t have any problems with boys\u201d. \u201c Oh shut up I\u2019m going to take a bath, a lady needs to stay clean.

You start to feel dizzy as you start to see to spots in your eyes. Your bedroom and the bathroom\u2019 Oh jezz it\u2019s really happening\u2019. You manage to think as you feel yourself wetter as your perspective has changed from sitting on your bedroom to laying on the bath as Carmen.

She then went on to take another sip but she suddenly began feeling a little lightheaded. She put the bowl down and her world started to spin. You knew something was happening, and deep down you hoped a swap was about to happen. From your point of view nothing seemed to change. But your older sister suddenly started looking down at herself and grabbing her boobs that were contained in her sports bra. \"What the fuck??\" she said, before looking at her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me young lady?\" your mother said, looking at Carmen, who looked confused. And just a few seconds later you heard a scream from upstairs, you stifled a laugh as Stacey came running downstairs and into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you screaming at Stacey? Are you okay?\" your concerned mother asked your younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...what's happened? I'm in...OMG...that's my body!!\" Stacey exclaimed, pointing at Carmen, who was just as shocked as she was. \"MOM...I'm Carmen! Me and Stacey have switched bodies!\" 'Stacey' insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't be absurd honey!\" your mother responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right mom! I'm...Stacey!\" 'Carmen' suddenly chimed up, looking at your mother. \"I'm in Carmen's body\". You could tell Stacey kinda liked being in her older sister's body with its bigger breasts, despite her shock. \"There...that bowl! John said it could swap people's bodies. Did any of you drink out of it?\" Stacey asked in Carmen's mature voice. Your younger sister's body nodded in response. \"Yeah...I did\" Carmen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was telling the truth! This is amazing\" Stacey then said, as she continued to feel her new C-cup boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, we need to swap back!\" Carmen protested, as your perplexed mother just stood and stared at the two of them, unsure what to believe. \"We need to drink out of the bowl again and reverse this\" Carmen insisted, but Stacey didn't seem as eager to swap back all of a sudden as she took another look down at her tanned, 22-year old body, which was dripping with sweat from her sister's jog.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mother then happened to glance at the bowl again... before glancing back at you. \"Lets find out shall we\" she smirked, picking up the bowl and taking a sip from it herself. She then handed it to you... and made you take hold of it. \"Now if this is all nonsense... nothing will happen when you drink from it right?\" she said, calling your bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shook your head in annoyance. \"This is ridiculous!\" you said, before peering into the bowl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew you were responsible, in fact... they all did. \"Okay, maybe this is all too ridiculous after all, and maybe you girls are just yanking my chain\" she said, addressing your two sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when Carmen stormed off into the living room and went to head upstairs, but your mother rushed after her. You saw that your mother had put the bowl down on the table, but since Stacey was still there watching you, you refrained from making a move towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Stacey suddenly mumbled in Carmen's sexy voice.

She then stopped dead in her tracks when she saw the water was still in the bowl, none of it had been spilled. \"That's...impossible\" Carmen mumbled, as Stacey shot out of the kitchen and headed upstairs to her bedroom to check out her older, sexier body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey...is this on the level?\" your gobsmacked mother asked your older sister, who just rolled her eyes as she picked the bowl up off the floor again. \"MOM...I'M NOT STACEY, will you listen for god's sake, I'm CARMEN!\" your sister screamed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is hard for me to believe honey, I mean...swapping bodies?? Come on!\" your mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chose this time to make an appearance, and Carmen immediately scowled at you. \"You're responsible for this aren't you?\" she spat angrily.

And Stacey's obviously impressed with being in your body\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is, she's got bigger boobs and is now old enough to do whatever she wants!\" Carmen said, as she put her hands on her hips. She then looked down at the denim shorts and ballet flats she was wearing and sighed. \"This is freaking weird!\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked over at your mother, who was giving you one of her best '<i>you should have known better</i>' looks. However, her annoyed stare was soon replaced by one of curiosity as she picked up the bowl full of water, amazed at what it could do. \"So...drinking this water can switch people's bodies?\" she asked, shaking her head in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it can... right Carmen?\" you chuckled, nudging Stacey's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you dipshit!\" Carmen snapped at you, making you recoil a little in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language young lady!\" your mother admonished your sister, clipping her upside the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! God can this day get any worse?\" Carmen groaned, slumping down in one of the chairs at a table, folding her arms. You couldn't help but chuckle, even as your mom continued studying the bowl. Neither you or Carmen saw her take a quick sip of the water.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ok now for the main attraction you think as you go up the stairs to Carmen\u2019s room with Stacy in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh the things I could do as Carmen: I could get drunk and blame it all on her, possibly get laid, show her as the bitch she is or just have some fun. You think as you finally reach her room. When you enter you find Stacy reading through some magazines and doing some push ups. Um sweety what are you doing\u201d? You say with your mother voice. \u201c Oh nothing mom just trying to get stronger I know I have a killer bod but still these baby\u2019s ain\u2019t enough\u201d.

MOM I DONT FEEL SO GOOD\u201d Stacy says in a agitated voice as you can tell the room shaking all around you. \u201c Wait I remember now that\u2019s the bowl that placed me in this body\u201d. She says trembeling. \u201c No you can\u2019t take me out if h..\u201d \u201cere, oh crap not now\u201d she finishes her sentence empty handed and in a new body.

You don't want to be walking around stinking of sweat all day do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile admittedly the thoughts of that wasn't all that appealing, the thought of having to take a shower and be...well naked inside your 42 year old mother's form was much, much worse, and you couldn't quite believe she was suggesting such a thing. Technically you might be her now and your positions might have switched around the house, but she was still your mother and you were still her son. Son's shouldn't be seeing there own mother's naked - it just wasn't right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom, I'm you now...\" you began, trying to think of a delicate way of saying this, before being quickly cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! You're me now, John, and you are going to stay that way until you've learned your lesson,\" she told you rather sternly, with your little sister's slightly less intimidating voice, \"Just the same as I am Stacy now, Stacy is Carmen and Carmen is you. So you're going to just have to get used to being inside my body and dealing with all the things that entails. You're 17 years old after all, and I'm sure you've seen your fair share of naked woman on the Internet before, so mine shouldn't be all that different.\" As embarrassing as this whole situation was, this last comment especially caused you to blush - your mother being fully aware of what you got up to on your computer when you were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, perhaps you might learn a thing or two while you're in there,\" she then added, giving you a reassuring pat on the shoulder as she headed past, before pausing and flashing you an extremely knowing little grin, \"...and who knows, maybe even enjoy yourself a little too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou face just about turn crimson right there as you realized what exactly she was suggesting, having never imagined she could be so blase about something like that, especially when it concerned her own son and her own body. Letting out a loud gulp as she then ascended the stairs behind you, chuckling softly to herself as she did, you stood there frozen for a moment in embarrassment, faced with the very real prospect of washing and showering your now 42 year old, female body. \"<i>Jesus. This is really weird...</i>\" you said to yourself, glancing down at the blue and white striped shirt that housed the two very large and obvious bumps that were now your breasts, feeling a very strange shiver of nervousness, excitement, repulsion and fear at the thought of seeing them - having never imagined in a million years that the first ever real life pair you'd ever see would be your own mother's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh well, better get this over with then</i>,\" you decided, after hearing your little sister's voice telling you to get a move on, followed soon after by the sound of your own body laughing. Turning then, figuring if everyone else can just get on with things as if this whole swapping bodies thing was nothing, you headed back out of the living room towards the bathroom, before suddenly remembering that your parents had their own en suite bathroom, complete with shower - meaning that you wouldn't have to share with the rest of your siblings. \"<i>Well that's one perk to all this at least</i>,\" you told yourself, changing course \"<i>No more waiting hours on end in the morning to actually use the bathroom!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcursions into your parent's bedroom being rare, you took a moment to look around before you headed into the shower, thinking it might be nice to have a double bed for a while - before remembering who your mom shared it with. Shaking this image out of your head, not wanting to think too much about this aspect of being your mom for now (not entirely sure what your dad was going to make of all this when he returned), you took a brief moment to compose yourself and try to come to terms with what it was you were about to do, before just going from broke, closing your eyes, grabbing the hem of your mother's jogging top, and yanking it quickly over your head, then doing the same with her sweatpants before you lost your nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh God - BREASTS!!</i>\" was the first thought that came to you as you opened your eyes, your mother's large mounds being even more obvious now nestled inside a white sports bra, their size causing the creamy tops to bulge out from the material, drawing your gaze into the space between. Below, although you couldn't see much else due to the obstructions hanging from your chest, you could now feel your mom's panties clinging tightly to your crotch, really emphasizing what it was you'd lost down there and what you now had gained... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just like I always do. There's nothing wrong with that. Nothing at all. No need to think about anything else right now other than that...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading inside and closing the door behind you, you avoided the mirror as best you could - after catching a fleeting glimpse of your rather nervous looking mother in nothing but her underwear, a sight which immediately turned your cheeks red - and instead marched straight over to the shower door, and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I can't believe I'm actually gonna do this. This is just so wrong!\" you groaned, feeling more awkward and uncomfortable than you ever had before as you realized that you there was no putting it off any longer - it was time to fully strip. \"Carmen's SO gonna pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes again then and taking another deep breath, trying to focus your mind on anything other than what was currently going on, you then slowly moved your hands down towards your now much wider, curvier hips and grabbed the waistband of your mother's panties, before quickly yanking them down your legs and kicking them back out in the direction of the still open shower door. Trying not to lost momentum, as well as avoid focusing on the sensation of your now exposed female genitalia, you then grabbed at the straps of the sports bra and tried to do the same, finding though that it was much more difficult, due to your mother's sweat causing it to stick somewhat to your skin. \"Oh come on! Come on you stupid thing!\" you shrieked through gritted teeth, as you felt your new chest being hefted uncomfortably around inside the tight material, wrestling with the thing for a good half minute before finally managing to get it off - feeling the full, unrestrained weight of your mom's jiggling breasts as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy that you'd got that part over with, you then scrabbled blindly around, looking for both the shower door that you still needed to close, as well as the actual controls for the shower (still feeling too weird to open your eyes, just in case you caught a glimpse of something you shouldn't). As soon as you gotten the shower turned on though and felt the warm water cascading over your skin, it became quite apparent that simply standing there with your eyes closed, pretending that none of this was actually happening, wasn't exactly going to get the job done and get you out of the shower any quicker. As freaky and as immensely embarrassing as it was, the simple fact was that you WERE going to have to wash your mother's naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well if she doesn't have a problem with it, why should I?</i>\" you thought to yourself, recalling what your mom had told you about maybe learning a thing or two (as well as enjoying yourself while you were at it). Everyone else seemed to be just going with the flow when it came to this whole body swapping thing - your mom was getting ready to go to your little sister's ballet class, Stacy was presumably enjoying the perks of Carmen's older body, and as for Carmen...well the less you thought about what she was up to in your own form the better. \"<i>Yeah, I'm a girl now. A woman!</i>\" you told yourself, opening your eyes again, \"<i>I mean, I may be mom but I'm still a woman. And God knows this is the closest I'm ever going to get to one in the foreseeable future, so I might as well just make the most of it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decided then, you cast away your feelings of embarrassment and grabbed the two large spongy mounds hanging from your chest, giving each one a squeeze, just as you had instinctively done the moment you'd first jumped into this body. \"Wow, these do feel nice,\" you grinned, examining every inch of your new boobs and getting used to this rather different perspective. For her age and having had four kids, you had to say, your mom's breasts were pretty damn awesome - full, round and still somewhat firm, with big, light brown nipples that you could actually feel growing larger and harder as you explored. This wasn't the only thing you could feel either, as further down below, past the big wobbling masses of jello like flesh, was a rather strange yet somehow familiar sensation coming from between your legs. Almost without thinking a hand left your chest and moved it's way down towards your new female crotch, brushing past a small patch of neatly groomed hair, till your fingers found the delicate folds of flesh that was your mom's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Holy shit! That's a pussy! That's an actual real life pussy!</i>\" you said with a gasp as you felt your fingertips brushing across the incredibly sensitive flesh, this discovery being pretty much like unearthing the Arc of the Covenant to a shy, sexually inexperienced, teenage boy such as yourself. Continuing on - almost in shock as you felt it gradually starting to become wet - your prodding fingers located the very hole that you yourself had once emerged from and you were once again hit by an overwhelming sense of just how wrong this all was. \"<i>That...that's mom's pussy! I actually came out of there!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing like a bucket of cold water and snapping you back to the awkward reality of your situation, you instantly pulled your probing hand away from between your legs, feeling rather guilty and disgusted with yourself for having actually been touching your mother's vagina (and enjoying it too). Returning again to your earlier state of denial, you quickly grabbed the shower gel, closed your eyes and set about washing yourself as fast and as efficiently as possible, trying to think about anything but as you did and pretend like nothing had actually happened...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once done, you hoped out of the shower and quickly reached for a towel, wrapping it tightly around your mother's dripping wet body, feeling somewhat relieved to have it hidden once more from view. Not that you were home free quite yet of course, finding that drying yourself was somewhat of an experience in itself, especially when the towel rubbed against your mother's large nipples and boobs, causing them to wobble all over the place, or when you had to move it back and forth between your legs. Instead of focusing on all of this though (as hard as it was to avoid), you tried to keep your attention on other things - such as your mother's long blond hair, which seemed to take a hell of a lot of drying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were happy that it was, or that you'd at least done a half decent job, you wrapped the towel around yourself again, knotting it in place like you'd seen your sisters do, and headed back into your mom's bedroom to get dressed. \"Okay. Now This is gonna be a bit of a challenge,\" you sighed as you glanced towards your parents wardrobe, having no real clue about women's clothes and what went with what, but getting the impression that your mom wouldn't be too happy if you simply put her jogging shirt and sweats back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing first then on underwear, you headed over to your mother's dresser and pulled open the top drawer, feeling yourself blush a little as you were confronted with the neatly stacked rows of her bras and panties. Trying not to dwell too much on this though, aware that as embarrassing an idea as it was to actually have to wear your mom's clothes, you were already wearing <i>a lot worse</i> already - and right now, anything was better than wandering around nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting the bullet then and gabbing the first pair of panties that came to hand, you quickly slipped them on and pulled them up your legs, feeling the soft cotton material press tightly against your crotch, once again reminding you what was now down there. Strangely enough, they actually felt quite comfortable, not that you wanted to admit that though - being woman's, as well as your mom's. Shaking this thought off and returning again to the drawer, this time for a bra (deciding on a matching black one for symmetry), you took a moment or two to examine the somewhat foreign, lacy item, having never really had any experience with one of these, other than the odd time you'd seen one in the wash or hanging out on the line. Though the straps were kind of small, the actual cups looked huge, and you couldn't really imagine having to wear one of these things everyday, thinking it would probably be somewhat of a nuisance. Well nuisance or not, you were going to have to wear one now, and so, taking a deep breath, realizing that putting the thing on was going to mean having to 'deal' with your mother's breasts again, you undid the knot in the towel and let it fall to the ground, leaving your rather top heavy chest once again exposed as you then set to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually getting the bra on proved to be a much trickier task than you had initially imagined, and it took you a good couple of minutes to both wrangle your big boobs into both cups, keep the straps from getting tangled, and actually get the thing fastened - finding the little hooks at the back to be rather bothersome to say the least. You somehow managed it though and felt a little twang of pride, as well as great sense of relief to be once again covered up - or at least partially anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the underwear now sorted and your 'bits' strapped in, you turned your attention to the wardrobe, which was full with both your mother and father's clothes (though your mother clearly had the majority). Looking through all of the various flowery dresses, blouses and skirts, you had to admit you were kind of lost - never having had quite the sheer number of options available to you before with your own clothes. You had always been a jeans and a t-shirt kind of guy, where as your mom seemed to wear just about everything and anything, her slim yet curvy figure looking good in most outfits. Deciding to go with what you know though, figuring that if you were going to have to dress as your mom you might as well be comfortable (not really liking the idea of a skirt or dress), you located a pair of jeans as well as a fairly plain green button-up sweater that didn't look <i>too</i> girly. This was of course a slightly different story once you'd actually gotten them on, forgetting for a moment just how differently shaped you were now that you were a woman. Far from being the loose fitting, body-disguising clothing you'd assumed they would be, the jeans hugged your mother's curvy thighs, long legs and larger butt almost like a second skin, while the sweater did little to disguise her impressive bust, as it bulged out from within the clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were half considering trying something else on, something that might draw less attention to the your new found femininity (if that were at all possible), you suddenly heard a knock on the door, followed by Stacey's voice calling out, \"Are you ready in there yet? I'm going to be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at yourself for a moment, realizing that what you were wearing would have to do, you let out a depleted sigh and replied, \"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second or two later and you watched as your mom in your little sister's body walked in the door and said, \"Good...\" before stopping quickly in her tracks when she saw you. \"<i>You call this ready?!</i> John, you haven't even got shoes on...or done anything with my hair! You look like you've been pulled backwards through a hedge for goodness sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to do something with my hair?\" you questioned, having not given your new blond locks any thought since you dried them - well other than thinking how annoying it was to have to continually keep brushing them from you face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have a lot to learn, sweetheart,\" she told you with a shake of her head, before leading you over to her vanity table and plonking you down. \"Here let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf things hadn't been bad enough as it was, you suddenly found yourself sitting their in front of the mirror, with your own mother's face staring at you, while behind your mother/little sister began frantically brushing away at your hair, muttering away disapprovingly to herself as she did. It was altogether surreal and more than a little awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had finished making you look 'presentable', she then turned her attention to your lack of footwear, retrieving from her wardrobe a pair of white heeled sandals, and telling you that \"Here, these will do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're heels! I'm not wearing heels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, please. They're only 2 inches. They're not very tall at all. Besides, it'll be good for you to get to used to wearing them, seeing as you are supposed to be me. I like wearing heels, which means <i>you</i> now like wearing heels. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it being pretty obvious that you weren't going to get out of this, you rather begrudgingly took them from her and squeezed them onto your feet, grumbling to yourself over how unfair this all was as you did and finding that when you stood back up again you were no longer quite so steady on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it,\" you mom assured you as you wobbled your way slowly towards the door, trying to disguise an amused little smile - obviously getting a kick out of your less than ideal predicament.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, you were pressed against the other side with your head tucked in your arms, letting out a muffled sigh. A playful honk of the horn later and you were placed for the first time ever, in the driver's seat of your mother's car. \"Are you sure about this?\" You felt compelled to ask, not at all expecting to experience this luxury at any point in your near future. \"Who am I to say no? I'm just a fifteen year old girl.\" Was her response, as well as a tidbit of laughter to follow. \"It feels strange saying that, but I guess it's true, huh?\" Her eyes became a bit soft, before hazing over once her thoughts took over. It only last a few seconds before she snapped herself out of it and continued where she left off. \"Anyway, It's better the cops see you driving than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that's true...\" You nodded, before taking a quick examination around the car. You felt nervous, as if you were taking an actual driving test. You did all the routine things you had practiced, but when it came time to adjust the rear-view mirror, you couldn't help but stumble. It was for lack of a better word \"off-putting\" to see your mother's reflection mimicking your obvious discomfort. Her rather thin lips were pressing against each other harshly, and her eyebrows were quirking down, furrowing her brow. You couldn't call your mother unattractive, in-fact she looked great -- to anyone but you. She had those high cheeks everyone always seemed to adore, and the only age on her face was that you could just barely see her skin beginning to sag by her chin. Not to mention her beautiful, but equally annoying blond hair was shimmering in the sunlight peering through the window. If only she wasn't your mother, the above might have been enticing. Yet, somehow or another, <i>this</i> was you now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook it off, the first tilt of your head causing you to witness your mother's fascination with your own fascination. She turned away as if she wasn't really looking, but it was obvious she was getting some sort of emotion out of all of this that you couldn't quite pinpoint. It wasn't important for right now, for now, you just needed to focus on the task at hand and not at all on who or why. \"Ten and two, ten and two.\" Your mother chimed in, as you readied the car for it's first departure. Though to the rest of the world, this was just another typical sighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were as nervous as could be as you inched yourself onto the road for the first time. \"Look left, be sure to stop at--\" The onslaught of comments from your mother just made it all the worse, then add on the fact you were forced to see these feminine hands at the wheel, equipped with bright red nails, and the amount of distractions became unbearable. <i>'Those are my hands, but their my mom's!'</i> This thought roared in your head, as my heartbeat just seemed to get louder and louder, but that only made you think about how it was your mother's heart in your chest. It was getting out of control...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out all of your breath in utter relief as the light turned red at this complicated intersection. You needed the time to think -- the time to compose yourself. You grazed both your hands though your hair, stared down at your ample breasts and took a long look in that mirror. <i>'Right, I'm my mother, get over it and focus!'</i> You tried to tell yourself, but you couldn't get passed how much it was bothering you that everyone who saw you -- even if it was only for a fleeting moment as you drove by -- was seeing your mother and not you. It just seemed wrong. However, once the light turned green, you sort of had no choice but to let it drift off into the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes, and suddenly you were feeling a bit more natural about it. Even your mother had stopped berating you with comments about what you should be doing. You also couldn't help but notice her doing what you were and taking a gander in the side-view mirror at herself. She was a lot more thorough than you were: contouring her face in a lot of angles, and picking up her long brown hair and gripping it into pigtails, ponytails, and anything else. \"Having fun over there?\" You asked, causing her to jump a bit. \"It's just a bit interesting, being my own little girl.\" Was her response. You couldn't think of one better other than \"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, you weren't exactly thrilled with any of this -- though that was obvious to everyone and yourself. However, you also seemed to be the only one who wasn't enjoying themself. <i>'Am I crazy for worrying about this so much?'</i> You asked yourself, but as visions of before came to mind, and how Stacy, be it on purpose or on accident knocked over that bowl, it was just too damn obvious how much could go wrong with all of this. I mean, living your mother's life was a crazy proposition on it's own, but heaven forbid that thing broke -- you'd have no choice in the matter. \"I'm going to give myself a damn heart attack thinking about all of this.\" You mumbled, causing your mother to immediately spout \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" You began, but it wasn't going to stop there, not when these thoughts were flying around your head. \"You're not serious about all of this, are you? I mean, we can't all just switch around like this, it's insane.\" You told her, looking away from the road to partake in her annoyed expression. \"Keep your eyes on the road.\" She first said with a grunt, then added... \"And of course I'm serious. You need to learn it's not easy being me, and the others -- it'll be a good experience for the family.\" You couldn't be less convinced, and immediately barked back with the best case you had. \"Aren't you a nurse? Isn't that a job where you're supposed to know what the hell you're doing? How do you think I'll fair? Really want me to get you fired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe murmured words that you could hardly make out told you that you had hit a winning argument -- thank god. \"Hey, I'll just switch the head of the hospital if that happens!\" She tried to laugh it off, but you weren't in the mood for it. \"That sounds like a <i>really</i> bad idea. Not to mention someone might die.\" You informed her as you brought the car to a halt. She let out a loud huff, untied her seat belt, and jumped out of the car, only to then scurry around to the driver-side window. \"Look, I'll think of something. Now, no matter how much you may not want it, <i>you're</i> me now, understood <i><b>Mom</b></i>?\" She seemed quite satisfied, with a smile and a giggle of delight as she called you that. It had the opposite effect on you, and you couldn't help but begin to think that this wasn't a punishment for you not respecting her, so much as she enjoyed seeing you like this. Granted, you don't think her life is anywhere near as hard as she puts on, but that's beside the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious, Mom.\" You groan, only to immediately feel a sharp pinch on your ear. \"Ah, h--hey!\" You shrieked, really bringing out an octave you really couldn't have reached before. She waggled her finger, and while she tried to remain serious, a smile just seemed to creep right up her face. \"When we are out and about, you will call me Stacy, understand, Mom?\" She told you. \"Yeah, whatever...\" You nodded halfheartedly and let out a long sigh. \"Now kiss me goodbye like you always do, Mom.\" She actually sounded serious, even as she tilted her head down to you, a finger pointed against her cheek. \"I'm not kissing my sister.\" You told her bluntly. She rolled herself back up to her normal height and pressed her hands disapprovingly on her hips. \"You will learn to, if you want to get back to normal. Now drive home safe.\" She turned about with a kick in her step, quite polarizing to her last words to you, which were quite stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out one more long sigh as you dropped her head limp onto the steering wheel. You couldn't help but look annoyingly at the blond hair which wrapped around your vision and tickled your cheeks. \"You're really getting on my nerves.\" You told them, as you picked at some of them as you reeled yourself back up. \"Soft as you might be...\" You had to add, as you found yourself rolling your hands through the luxurious feel of all of them. Your mother's hair was thick, soft, and gorgeous, clearly one of her finer qualities. \"Still prefer <i>not</i> having to deal with it myself though.\" You said as you glanced down at yourself, getting frustrated by the visage. \"Damn these things are big, I want my flat chest -- I want everything back, dammit!\" You shouted as you grabbed at those two lumps, as if to appease yourself and find some sort of joy from all of this. Everyone else was off having fun and you were left as your damn mother -- <i>'Short end of the stick!'</i> you certainly thought so.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just have to focus on the road in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you usual do while taking driving lessons you end up at the mall. The big building looms up in front of you, making you curious.

Nevertheless you want to see it lying in it's boxed cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a parking space for the car and step outside. You lock the car and make your way to the entrance of the mall.

Even with a bra on, you can feel them whenever you take a step. It's going to be a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the mall you make your way to the game store. It's then that you recognize one of your mother's friends sitting at a table. Joan, she's called, a real hottie or at least you think.

It was enough for you to literally be in her shoes, you didn't also want to be making the same friends as her. So you cocked your head, and made a turn towards something much more familiar. \"Ah...\" You exhausted in relief, as you inhaled that sweet smell of new plastic, coupled with a modest amount of B.O. Somehow, in one way or another, it was relieving, if not also a bit revolting. Still, it was something that was your own, unchanged by all of the happenings up until now. Same weird clerk behind the counter who always liked to push his opinions on you, and the same oddly laced blue carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your heels to that carpet and stepped inside. You spent several minutes just sort of browsing without much purpose, before finally picking up and examining the game you were actually interested in. \"God, this looks awesome!\" you joyously stated, as you brushed some of your mother's blond hair out of your sight without much of a care. Of course, then you thought about your lack of thought about it, and suddenly, you became a bit more self-aware about things. You looked around a bit nervously, and while only a few of the kids in here dared to keep their eyes on you, it became very apparent very quickly that... \"I'm really out of place here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blissful illusion that things were back to normal shattered as you took a look down at yourself. There was no hiding your feminine figure, even in your overly modest sweater choice. The fact remained, your mother's large breasts were still obvious -- heck, you were literally resting the game right up against them while you read the back of the box. You took one more glance around the place, confirming that you were undoubtedly viewed by everyone here as one of those mothers out to buy a game for her kid -- you know, the ones you didn't really want but felt compelled to say \"thank you\" for anyway? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is embarrassing...\" You mumble, and look dejectedly back down at the game you were eying. \"Can't even hang around my own place now because of this. This sucks.\" You flipped the box in your hand around several times, while you let out your frustrations. \"This really does look awesome though, I really want it.\" You declare, as you straighten your back, readying yourself for a long sigh of disappointment. That is until you feel the annoying tug of that purse that has been latched around your shoulder. Lips pursed with surprise, you pulled it up and began to dig around inside of it. Make-up, combs, brushes, change everywhere, loose dollar bills, and a whole bunch of other things were a part of the list, but it was one thing that caught your eye. \"Tracy Bouchard.\" You read the name on the credit card aloud. \"That's... me right now.\" You cringed as you said it, but you knew it was the sad fact; not a person here would -- or could question it. With a grin, you considered your options...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For someone ya know, I take it?\" He jumped right into his usual tone, his obnoxious heaving way of speaking already bringing me to a boil. \"No way, it's for me. I love that shit.\" I replied, which clearly threw him off a bit. \"And it's hardly over-rated, just because something got popular doesn't mean it's suddenly bad.\" You add, making it a point as always to demolish his hipster-ass. \"Don't get me wrong, the second one set the way for that genre, the third one was great, but then the fourth decided to become essentially the second one again. It was a lot more simple and bland.\" He debated, and you had to admit you were surprised by his tone and his words, he was sounding a lot less confronting about it. The reason was obvious as could be, as he could hardly maintain eye-contact with you. \"Yeah, yeah, just let me buy the game.\" You shushed him up, scurried him through the whole silent-buying process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the time came for you sign the receipt, you very nervously grabbed the pen. With what felt like an apple in your throat, you signed it... \"Tracy Bouchard.\" It embedded in you the same level of disgust of this situation as you were expecting it to, but at the same time, coupled with the knots in your stomach were... some butterflies. You were kind of excited, in-fact you had a smile on your face you just couldn't wipe off. You quickly grabbed the bag, the card and receipt and got out of there. \"Holy crap, I just forged my Mom's signature.\" You proclaimed in an airy admission. \"Or did I? I mean, I'm her right? So... I guess, I really didn't, right?\" You rationalized it as such for now, but couldn't deny the excitement you were feeling; the odd guilty experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mom, I admit there is <i>something</i> I like about this, I get your money and...\" You left the sentence hanging until you got back outside. \"...your car.\" You finished as you dropped into the driver's seat, with a smile staring back at you in the rear-view mirror. \"Well, this is a new experience.\" You told your reflection, as you touched at your cheeks, which for the first time ever were raised. You took a second to reflect on everything, sort of laughing a bit as you thought about it. \"Man, I can't believe the looks I was getting. Especially once I said it was for me. I mean, girl gamers are rare sightings, but an older woman -- especially one as hot as my Mom, yeah definitely a rare sight. Talk about being a minority!\" Your laughter over it shifted to embarrassment as you let fly that whimsical comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated to admit it, almost entirely because one, she was your mother, and two, she was the type of person who loved to talk about her looks. You can't even count the number of her stories of her youth that started with her saying \"When I was young, I was the most beautiful girl in school, and...\" and age hadn't shied her away from complimenting herself. Couple that with not a single one of your friends not outright telling you that they want to bang your mother, and yeah, you kind of built up an ill-desire to view her in such a way. The reality was that she was and is beautiful. Heart shaped face, slightly tanned skin, deep brown eyes, perfectly aligned white teeth with glossed up lips around them, gorgeous blond hair done in a bob stopping just at the bottom of her neck, and just an overall great body down below. \"In the words of my friends, she -- and I... am a MILF.\" You admitted. Though you would never give your mother the satisfaction of hearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now a MILF playing games --\" You stopped your own segue back to the previous topic with a gasp of genius, as an idea popped into your head. \"Oh man, I should totally go to a tournament like this. Lay some people out and see the look on their faces. I'd be like a minor celebrity going to an event like that looking like this, haha.\" You couldn't hold in the joy of the idea, and keep it noted for later. \"I look forward to getting him and practicing that new game then.\" You said as you picked it out of the bag and looked it over once more. Your thinking was interrupted by the rumbling of your mother's phone. You felt kind of weird about it, but picked it up and read the message. \"Don't forget to pick me up at 4.\" From Stacey, so, it was in effect from your mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now I'm her personal chauffeur.\" You sighed and looked at the car's clock for a time-check. \"3:23!? I must have really zoned out in there. Has it really been almost an hour and a half already?\" You blurted out, while thinking on how annoying it is that you have to drop her off, drive home, kill an hour or so, and then drive back to get her. \"What a nuisance.\" While saying that, you get comfortable and intend to kill time looking over the game manual.

I had no idea that I liked dancing that much.\" She beamed, as she swung the seat belt over herself before catching glimpse of the bag by her leg. \"What's this?\" She asked quietly before picking it up and examining the contents. Any innocence on her face was completely lost as she turned to you sharply. \"Did you buy this?\" She asked sternly. You weren't really ready for this confrontation despite putting it on yourself, but you went with it. You started off with a smile and a shrug, saying... \"What? You wanted me to be you, right? So I bought something I wanted and used <i>my</i> money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips curved inward, which made her look especially childish considering Stacy's face. \"I do <i>not</i> buy things frivolously like that, so you shouldn't either!\" She declared, which was an obvious lie, you had seen her come home with new clothes too many times to count. \"And on top of that, I don't like video games, which means you don't either!\" Her words this time really set you off, as they further added to this bizarre trend you've been noticing. \"Are you trying to turn into a copy of you or something? You don't like this, so I shouldn't? So should I start acting like you now too!? If that's the case, and you want us to literally play the part, then you're doing a terrible job as Stacy! She's too shy to get in my face like this. So go on Stacy, get into character!\" The anger rolled out of you very naturally, but it was only met with more of hers. \"You're not being me if you don't do what I do --\" You interrupted her. \"So I should walk like you, talk like you and do what you do? I'm <b>not</b> you! Are you really saying that it effects your weird little desire for me to be you, if in my free time I play games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does, because I don't -- Aaaarrgh!\" She threw her arms up in a tantrum before wrapping them tightly together. \"You know what, fine, waste your time with those stupid games when you have some free time. Just so you know though, I don't have a lot of free time, which means you don't now either.\" She spit back in your face. Stacy's image and voice being used by your mother really made the whole situation feel bizarre and awkward. \"And you know, once you get home, you're making dinner. I know you don't know how, but you're going to learn. If you don't, then you better damn well get used to being called <b>Mom</b>.\" It was an obvious threat; always trying to force you into things you didn't want, it was her parenting way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, it was a very bitter and quiet ride home after that. Following it, was a long lesson on cooking, where she taught you as if hadn't a clue what salt even was. Meanwhile, the real Stacy walked about with an occasional snicker. She tried to make it look like she wasn't just watching for the fun of it, but it was obvious. \"Are you listening to me!?\" Your mother shouted as you drifted into another state of discontent. There was nothing quite like being forced to learn, it really let everything sink in. \"Yeah, yeah.\" You replied, while Stacy finally approached you. \"I think you're doing great, Mom.\" She said to you, causing you to groan, a bit to her delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where Carmen is?\" You asked her. \"Right here, duh!\" She replied with a wide smile, her hands tucked neatly behind her back -- she was clearly happy and satisfied with this change. \"You know what I mean.\" She thankfully didn't tease you any longer. \"I'm not sure, she's been out for most of the day now. I think she said she probably wouldn't be back for dinner.\" Informed, but not at all delighted to hear it, you turned back to your mother's lesson with a sigh. It only went on for a few more minutes until another interruption came barging through the front door. Your father, home from work, and the only one, save for Erica, who was oblivious to all of the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, my little gem.\" You heard his words, saw his eyes looking right at you, but didn't even register that he was talking to you. That is until his arm was wrapped loosely around your waist, just an inch away from your butt. Your eyes went wide, matched only by Stacy who looked on with giddy anticipation, while your mother watched with a sadistic grin. Your whole body cringed as you felt his lips on yours -- it was just a peck, but the weird sensation of his beard against your face -- well, you knew you'd never forget it. \"W--what's with that face?\" He asked with a laugh. \"N--nothing, your beard just tickled me, that's all...\" You lied. \"All these years and you never got used to that?\" He laughed again, while planting his hand on your shoulder. \"Dinner smells good. I'll be back in a minute, I gotta get the stink off of me or you poor girls will suffer.\" While he went to walk away, you...</span></div></div>",

Come on.\" He grabbed her by the wrist and dragged her off. Stacy, who had been watching with an ogled expression up until now finally spoke up. \"O~o~ohoo~ You're so bold, bro.\" She said with a smile, before falling back into silence once your mother and father came back. \"Here you are, my dear.\" Your father said while handing you the bowl. \"Thank you very much.\" You replied in kind, and so he walked back off to his aforementioned activity. With a boom confidence, you turned your cocky grin towards your mother, while twirling the bowl pleasantly in your grip. \"You want me to be you, you got it. That means I'm encharge.\" You told her, only getting more of a high off this power trip as you saw her jaw hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then Stacy, you will go to your room and think about what you've done, or you'll be grounded for the rest of the week.\" You told her, a finger pointing off towards the stated room. \"Y--you can't ground me, I'm --\" Her jaw shut and rose to a scowl, but you were on a roll and weren't going to let this shift. \"I am your mother, and you will do as I say. This is what you wanted, you're Stacy now, and I'm your mother. I suggest you get used to it, because I'm the one who gets to say when any of you gets to go back to normal. Now march!\" Your body was shaking from the rush this was giving you, though you were also kind of scared at the same time, to be honest. Yet there she was, your mother, dressed in your sister's body, and her expression once more was that of complete stun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would listen to Mom, Stacy.\" Stacy said, which only made your mother fumble even more. \"I'll call you when dinner is ready.\" You told her as she finally went and walked off. \"So uh, <i>new Mom</i>, does new Mom care if I stay as Carmen?\" She asked as she side-stepped over to you with a mischievous smile. \"Like, on a more... permanent scale?\" She added later, with a hopeful smile following suite. \"You've been her for less than a day, and you've been inside all day. Why would you want to be her forever!?\" You felt compelled to ask. \"I know, I know, but she's just so pretty. Seriously, it's looks like this that can make me confident and not shy. Please, please...!\" She was practically begging you. Sure, Carmen was pretty, that's for sure, much like your mother, only with long brown hair and many years younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As tempting as it was to be rid of this scenario all together, you kind of had your own little operation going on now. So with a shrug you answered... \"I don't know about permanent, but I certainly don't care. Go nuts as Carmen.\" The smile from her was more than enough to tell you she was pleased, but the accompanying jump for joy also didn't hurt. \"You are the best, <i>Mom</i>.\" She said with a quick hug. \"Hey, don't mention it, <i>Sweetie.</i>\" You copied her tone of voice, but rather than laugh, she just quirked a brow. \"You're really getting into this, huh? I didn't expect you to like being Mom. That's kind of weird...\" Her comment definitely inflicted a weird tingling in your gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like is a strong word, but I'm having fun now that I know I can go back whenever. And she got what she wanted, so she can't even complain, right?\" You replied, it sounded reasonable enough for her to nod, and for you to believe. It wasn't like you actually <i>liked </i>being your mother, you just had a plan, and that was taking your beautiful mother's body to a gaming tournament for the glorious reactions. You nodded a few times to yourself, now that Stacy had left; off to ogle her new body some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meandered around the kitchen, sort of just eying everything as it was all more or less done. Mom did most of the cooking, but you do think you probably learned something, but it was only one meal. It's not long before you call everyone down for dinner. It was a bit weird, being on the end of the table, in the chair your Mom always sat in, across from your Dad, so he and her could bat glances at each other as if none of you would notice. The issue was that <i>you</i> were now the one getting the glances, and you sort of just went along with it, or ignored a few of them altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation was led by your father, who was left in ignorance about the whole thing, which did sort of really make you all feel like you truly had switched places. Seeing Stacy awkwardly answer questions about Carmen's life, or Mom talking about Stacy's dance lesson, it really was strange, and you think all three of you felt it. Obviously it was hard to tell because they hid it so well or their expressions just never really settled on one solid emotion, but you really wondered how either of them felt about this. Stacy was jumping for joy about being Carmen, but when actually having to pretend to be her in front of Dad, she actually looked nervous and like she didn't even want to be here. Mom too. You were no different, having someone around who forced you to truly play the role instead of pretending sort of made you a little ill. Especially as some gross thoughts came to your mind... <i>'Oh god, I'm in the body that -- I mean, this body has had <b>sex</b> with my Dad! I literally came out of here...'</i> You let out a loud \"Blagh!\" as you poked at your stomach upon reaching that realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" He asked. \"Oh, nothing, just a bad piece of meat.\" You played it off well enough, even the other two didn't really think much of it. You cringed again as you thought about it, and continued to do so until you were finishing up the dishes. \"That was good Mom.\" Stacy said with a smile and a thank you, before walking off. \"Yeah, thanks for dinner, Mom.\" Your mother followed Stacy's example, with her own addition of hesitance added to each word. \"Yes, thanks, my little Peridot.\" Your father said, as he once more wrapped his arms around you. He had a habit of pet-calling your mother with various gems or even just the word itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U--uh...\" You struggled a bit from his grasp, but, sure enough, his lips were coming to meet yours again. You cringed in the same manner as before -- your eyes too grossed out to look at him, and instead were peered over at your mother. The grin she had the last time this happened was gone, and now she was cringing just as you were. <i>'I'm stuck kissing my own father and you're uncomfortable!? Isn't this what you wanted? Or is it now that you've lost control you don't want it? You -- you know what, fuck it!'</i> Once you finished the thought, your restrained arms that pushed at your father's chest went soft, and your jaw which clung shut opened just so. Sure enough, his tongue went inside, and before you knew it, yours was intertwining with his. Yours eyes immediately went wide with shock; it felt so weird and gross, just from the concept of touching someone else's tongue with your own, disregarding that it was also your father's. Your mother couldn't even watch and ran off, just as you were hoping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over in just a second, but it felt like eternity, but while your mother was still in ear shot, you exclaimed \"Gerry, stooop, don't touch me there, haha!\" Your words were obviously in regards to his firm placement on your breast. \"Someone is playful tonight.\" He said as he began to slowly massage your breasts. \"A--ah...!\" You let out a pathetic little moan as he did so. To be honest, the breasts you wore had been nothing but an annoying weight that was strange to carry around all day, and because they were your mother's you hardly even touched them. It wasn't that they felt good, so much as your nipples did, as his finger continued to tease one of them. It tingled, and felt so much larger than you had ever had yourself, and with size came more sensation, you guessed. \"Want to go to the basement for a little private fun?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N--no, definitely not! Er... not today.\" Your body seemed to act on it's own as you pushed him away, though your breath was clearly still shaky. It was frightening to think about, but your father was... pleasuring you. Moreover, that kiss wasn't like a parent kiss -- no, he was kissing his lover; his wife. <i>'D--does that mean my first kiss was with my father!?'</i> You cringed yet again by your foul but truthful thoughts. He let out a sigh, before smacking you on the behind. \"Fine, but if you change your mind, let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I have to sleep in the same bed as him?\" You mumbled with a cold shiver twirling down your spine and into the tips of your toes. Of course, as the day came to a close, you had little choice but to do it. Thankfully, he seemed to have let it completely go. <i>'Thank god, Mom and Dad have a solid relationship.'</i> Were your final thoughts before you drifted off to sleep. (Of course, before bed, you also hid the bowl well, in the closet, tucked into a thick sweatshirt. You couldn't even feel it, if you grabbed it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you awoke with a startled gasp as you found yourself in your mother's bed, and further still, in her body. \"Shit, that was real...?\" You whispered in surprise, as you peered down at the buoyant breasts peeking out from the blue nightgown you were wearing, while a hand touched at your very altered face. Still alarmed by the reality, you went to check for the bowl, finding it still there, which let you breath a much needed sigh of relief. Feeling much more relaxed, you took a trip to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not nearly as shy as before this time -- about seeing your mother's naked body that is. \"She really is beautiful, huh?\" You openly admitted, as you admired her even skin tone, tight figure and flawless breasts. Once you were wet and then dried, you were stuck peering into that mirror all over again. \"Now how did she...\" You voiced your meandering thought, as you tried to recall how your mother had done your -- or you suppose, her hair last time, along with the makeup. She didn't need much of the latter: just some gloss, and a few dabs of whatever the brown vile contained over your cheeks, and you even tried to replicate her mascara job. Feminine as it all was, you justified it all under the bold statement that you needed to look the part of the beautiful mother, if your little joy-ride was going to have any effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were done, and dressed in a similar fashion as to before, though you cut the sweater for a more typical green shirt -- though with the frills, it was more of a blouse, you guessed. Substantially more feminine, but still covering everything up well enough. Once you stepped outside your room, you immediately hit trouble, as your mother was waiting outside. \"Morning.\" You said naturally. \"Yeah, morning.\" She threw it out just on reaction before hurrying into something else. \"Look, we --\" She stopped and eyed you up and down, her lips pursed with surprise. <i>'Impressed? I did it all myself and it was easy as pie.'</i> You thought, but didn't bother saying. \"I -- er, look, we need to switch <b>now</b>!\" She finally finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" You inquired. \"Because I have work in an hour, and you can't do it.\" Was her answer, but that brought back an earlier statement from her back to life. \"I thought you had an idea on how to have that go by just fine -- why not just switch with your boss or whatever like you said?\" Your words were hitting the mark as she couldn't do much more than open her mouth without any words coming out. After awhile and with a stomp of her foot she said... \"Look, I lied, I don't know how to do that. And you were right, I don't want to get fired over this. Now please switch. You can switch back right after work, I don't care.\"</span></div></div>",

This is serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not really Stacey,\u201d you say. \u201cI'm John \u2013 her older brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Sarah starts that obnoxious, snorting giggle peculiar to girls her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, this is serious!\u201d you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're John?\u201d she laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you respond with a heavy sigh. \u201cMy whole family has been playing with some crazy soul swapping bowl today. I found it in the attic and made the mistake of revealing its existence. Right now, the real Stacey is inhabiting the body of Carmen. You remember her? She's home from college right now \u2026 well, actually the real Carmen is now inhabiting my own body. Hell, she's not just inhabiting it \u2013 I strongly suspect she's jerking off with my body right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, you really <u>are</u> John!\u201d giggles Sarah. \u201cThe real Stacey would never talk this way. What's it like being a guy? Did you really used to have a you know. A penis and all that? You have to tell me all about it. Oh my god, this is like so totally cool. An older guy is trapped in my best friend's body! I totally can keep this a secret for you. I'll teach you about how to be a girl, and you can tell me all about your boy parts, back from when you used to have them and stuff. You really are John! This is so wild.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I'm really John,\u201d you say. The words sound crazy coming out in your sister's fifteen-year old girlish voice. \u201cNow keep your voice down. I don't need the whole flipping world finding about this. I'm John. I'm trapped in Stacey's body. And my stupid mom is responsible for all this. This is her insane idea of a punishment, and I have to serve out my sentence in Stacey's body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool!\u201d Sarah laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it really isn't,\u201d you moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is cool!\u201d insists Sarah. \u201cYou know what you should do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo hide under a rock in a cave on Mars until my mom cools off and agrees to change me back,\u201d you mutter, staring down with discomfort at first your breasts and then your smooth crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, silly,\u201d laughs Sarah. \u201cYou should totally _________________.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What!?\" You blurt out with uncontrollable flailing to match, as your mind tries to process your mother's suggestion. She then passes you a smug glance as she chuckles between her lips at your gawk expression. \"You can't just--\" You're interrupted by Sarah, who is jumping for joy already. \"Aaha, I get to be John!? Awesome, that's going to be aweesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I'm going to love having you as my bro, Sarah.\" Stacy says from over the couch's pillow, before the two fall into childish giggles about the future to come. Meanwhile you turn to your mother, a rage you can't quite hold back mounting from depths of your now female form. \"That's my body, you can't just give it to whoever you want!\" You can't believe just how pathetic you sound as your new voice masks your words in Stacy's rasping voice. You realize quick that you're just building your own grave, but you can't deny that everything you're saying is right. <i>'Someone has to say it!'</i> You convince yourself, but that is the easy part, as your mother seems anything but entertained by your outburst. \"I gave birth to you, and you live under my house. <i>I</i> make the rules, is that understood, <i>young lady</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, seriously <i>Stacy</i>, come on.\" Stacy herself says, with her friend riding her echo. \"Hehe, your mom is right, ya know. It's the same at my house.\" Sarah follows her words with words perhaps meant to console you. \"Don't worry, I'll take good care of your body John, promise.\" Hands pressed, eyes beaming, she says it all like it is actually something you want to hear. \"Why are you even going along with this?\" You curl yourself around the entrance to the other room where Stacy has made herself at home. She just lets her new glistening white teeth speak for themselves, with just a couple chuckles coming between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If it wasn't for Mom forcing it on me, I might not even object to Sarah being me. I'm not sure who I even prefer being me, Carmen or her. Right now they both seem like horrible choices.'</i> Thinking on it, you're reminded of that odd smile Carmen was wearing when she left. It doesn't sit well with you, but as you look over at how giddy Sarah is, you can't help but feel like she might even be worse than Carmen. <i>'If she's wanted to be a boy so bad, she probably has all sorts of ideas -- and she was so excited to be me. Does that mean she has a thing for me?'</i> You shake the thought off as pointless, and turn once more towards your mother, your rather rattled ponytail waving from the sudden twist. \"What about Carmen? I thought you already gave her my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother puts her hand to her lip. A few thoughtful pats against the side of her finger, and she answers you with a dropping hand gesture. \"There's a few things I've been meaning to punish Carmen for. A few adjustments in her punishment is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'In other words, you're just doing it because you feel like it.'</i> Your head sinks into your shoulders, as you realize that everything really is just designed to make you as miserable as possible. <i>'I know Mom would never admit it, but it's so obvious.'</i> You can't help but let out a long sigh, just as she probably wants you to. \"So, until Carmen gets back, Stacy, you are not allowed to leave the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuuh, why?\" Stacy, out of habit responds. The quick look from your mother reminds her quickly of who she really meant. \"Oh, hehe, right, you mean the <i>new</i> Stacy.\" Sarah laughs along with her, mouthing apologies to you in silence all the while. \"Understood?\" Your mother pushes her finger against your forehead as she asks. \"Yes...\" You respond in a whisper. \"I didn't hear that young lady, speak up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" You shout and turn yourself to any room that wasn't either of these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that plan ceases to hold effect, as about an hour later you find yourself pressed against the large grandfather clock in the living room, staring at your reflection. The glass was broken a long time ago due to a younger Carmen, and your less than stellar repairman of a father accidentally replaced the glass with essentially a mirror. If it hadn't happened so long ago, you would have assumed it magic, as what it showed you now just seemed impossible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" You groan as you feel the cheeks of Stacy's face. Her skin is pale, reddish patterns decorate her face in places, with freckles spotting the areas that aren't irritated. On-top of that her long night sessions of gaming or something keep a solid black line under both her eyes, while inside your mouth now is a semblance of metal, holding teeth of a far lesser shine than the new assortment Stacy now owned. Her currently uncared for dark brown hair dangles haphazardly at both sides of your face, while the ponytail bounces around all over the place. More over, a look down, and if it weren't for the slight bulge in your over-sized T-shirt, you wouldn't have even been able to tell you are a girl. You had seen Stacy's many forms of caring, there was her school look: very slight make-up, hair done and brushed -- her formal look: hair styled, lips glossed, make-up pasted -- and then there was her day-off look. Needless to say, Stacy threw the latter one at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She looks good enough when she needs to -- she's not great looking, but she's not ugly or anything, just really plain. But this is just lazy Stacy, seriously. How long could it possibly take you to at least put some decent clothes on and brush your hair?'</i> You feel a sudden push against the back of your shoulders. Turning you see Stacy standing by your side, ignoring you, instead placing her view on the mirror. \"Still don't get why I want this?\" She smirks at you for a moment before drawing your eyes back to the mirror. Needless to say it is pretty obvious. You look at Stacy, stood beside you in the mirror, and there is no comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glitter at you in the reflection, while you scan Carmen's features more readily than you ever have. Her thick lips, stolen right from your mom's side curl into a smirk, while your thin ones curve into each other and seem to disappear completely from your face. Hers shimmer from the light above you, while yours are just an off red, a jarring difference against your pale skin. Her hair is the same color, similarly styled though with bangs, and even after sweating from a run, looks softer, shinier and more managed than yours. Then her figure -- well, you can hardly even make out yours or lack thereof in the outfit you're wearing, but regardless, it is no compare to Carmen's pleasant bust, thin waist and mothering hips. Stacy on a good day is a 4.5 to a 5 at best, while Carmen even after a jog, is an 8 at the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever, so she's prettier. It's not like she's going to let you keep it.\" You regret to inform her, while you indulge in another fact as you turn to face her. She's taller than you, by quite a bit. Not surprising, considering Stacy is only 5\"4, while Carmen is 5\"10. \"So I've got to enjoy it while I can.\" She beams a white smile at you, placing her hands on her new hips and smirking even more. \"Sorry bro, but someone's gotta up and be Stacy.\" The words feigned as some sort of half-baked apology, while doubling down on her bullying of your new position. \"Maybe you'll like it.\" She tries to hype it up for you a bit, but fails. \"Not in a million years.\" You tell her bluntly. Her lips curl and she simply shrugs and fawns over her reflection once more. \"Whatever, at least I'm not the nerd with braces anymore.\" She smiles to herself and walks away from you, her tone a lot more cold this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm not getting stuck as you, not even for a day!'</i> You hype up the resolve in your head, just as Carmen makes her way into the house again, a mischievous smile on her face. Though it doesn't last for long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" Carmen screams as Mom tries to force the bowl down her throat, while an eager Sarah awaits patiently, her gaze on the goods she'll soon be having.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your hand is scuffing the rim, but that's as close as it gets before your mother's height takes advantage over you, and it raises high and out of your reach. \"<i>Young lady</i>, how dare you...!\" She takes her free hand and grabs you by the ear, pulling it strongly. \"Ow, ow, ow, ow!\" The noises fall from you out of necessity, while the nefarious laughter of the others come in through the other ear. You feel your cheeks begin to redden and an anxiety clipping at the edges of your stomach. Not because of being scolded, but by the method. Mom is never physical with you, she only scolds the girls like this -- and now you're feeling all too similar to them. Memories of Stacy being abused like this come bubbling to the surface, and when you have to imagine that image as yourself, you honestly begin to feel rather ill. <i>'I'm not Stacy, dammit!'</i> You scream in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen, calm from your intrusion suddenly has the bowl pushed upon her lips. Her last shriek in your voice ends with Sarah flying up from the chair she is in. \"Oh my -- Wow-w-w-woah!\" Your body begins to pat itself down with utter infatuation written on it's face. \"Noooo!\" Sarah's exceptionally high-pitched voice comes bellowing from across the room. \"Ew, ew, ew!\" It continues on, as Carmen also takes to her new body, unimpressed by her stick figure body. \"This is, oh wow, oh wow!\" Sarah's hands have no limits as she feels about your body with cheeks pushing red to it's limits. \"This feels awesome, Stacy. It's way better than I thought -- ho-ho, woah, this voice is so cool. Oooo, ooo~\" She runs to Stacy who both giggle, while Sarah plays with your voice like it were an instrument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this is stupid, what did I do!?\" Carmen rants, as you did before. You know how this goes. \"You think I'm dumb, lil missy? I know how much you've been going out partying against my permission.\" She wags her finger as she tells her. \"I'm twenty-two, I don't need your permission to do shit!\" The vulgarity catches Mom's ears, and Carmen's as well, as she cringes and takes a step back. \"<i>Excuse me?</i>\" She predictably says. Even if you know it might be hopeless, you hop to Carmen's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this is wrong. I'm John. It's my body. I don't care if you're my mother, you don't have the right to take that from me.\" Carmen immediately agrees with you, while Stacy plays heckler. \"Yeesh John, I never realized how whiny you were.\" It is a shot at her own body, but you can't help but be annoyed by it. Though you have little time to dally on it as your mother speaks up again. \"I gave birth to every single one of you, I have every right.\" It's the same spiel as before. \"Are you trying to tell me just because of that, I don't own a damn thing? Not even my own body? That's stupid. I've gotta own something!\" Carmen nods with you once more, while your mother grinds her teeth behind her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" A spark in her eyes seems to come, and with it a more methodical smirk. \"Fine, you want to own something?\" She asks you with a shrug, though she gives you no time to answer. \"You are Stacy.\" She points a finger at you. \"You are Carmen, you are John, and you are Sarah.\" Her finger spans the lot of us, each name spoke towards the body, not the true owner. \"John.\" She turns back to you. \"You are now the owner of Stacy's body. It's yours.\" You don't even have time to process the absurdity before she moves on. \"Stacy, the same is true for you. Carmen's body is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohoho~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elation in Stacy's expression is all consuming, while the devastation in Carmen's is equally so. \"Sarah, Carmen, that's true for you two as well.\" You can't even begin to fathom what she is saying, you have to question it. \"In what way?\" She turns to you once more, her hand shaking the bowl back and forth. \"Like I said, Stacy's body is yours now. If Stacy wants her body back, she has to get your permission, just like if you want to switch with Sarah and get your body, you have to get her permission.\" You understood it, but that only made your anxiety worse. \"Shouldn't I own my own body?\" You ask as calmly as you able. \"That is your body, Stacy.\" She retorts, oh so matter-of-factly. It's not hard to see now that you're not going to get any sort of sincerity out of your mother. \"Besides, it would hardly be a punishment then.\" With that she at least acknowledges in some regard that you're not Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid, Stacy is just never going to give me my body back!\" Carmen yells with her hands cupped in tiny fists at her sides, vibrating to her tension just so. The fear is justified in even more so, as Stacy bobs her head back and forth, and under her breath says... \"Yeah, likely.\" The confirmation leads Carmen to scowl back at her, which Stacy takes in with another teethy grin. \"For how long?\" Carmen asks, this time a bit more sincere, in hopes to not insight more of mom's wrath. Your mother carries her weight to another side and tilts her head to the side, letting her hair fall to a stop before answering. \"As long as it takes you all to work this out. Maybe you'll be stuck like this, if you you all keep having such attitudes towards one another.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that! It's my life, that nerd is going to screw it up!\" Carmen roars once more, all composure or care seeming to fall the wayside. \"She's never going to give it back if you keep talking like that.\" Your mother slyly answers, adding after... \"I'm not involved in this anymore, this is for all of you to work out. You just come to me if you both agree to use the bowl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what if this goes on too long and I go back to college!? She doesn't know how to do any of that, she'll flunk me out!\" Carmen rightfully points out. \"Stacy is a smart kid.\" Your mother answers. You agree, she is easily the best student in your family, but you know she can't possibly handle college classes. You've tried understanding some of the stuff Carmen has to read and it's all just gibberish to you. Not convinced though, your mother heads to the front door and rummages through Carmen's backpack which has been laying there since she got back home. She pulls out one of her recent books and tosses it at Stacy, who, getting the hint, begins to rummage through it. \"I have a few questions, but yeah, I mean, I haven't studied much on language, but this is just a linguistic course.\" She speaks as she flips through the pages. \"I already know most of the answers to these.\" She points out, as she holds up one of Carmen's recently scored tests, which has a worrying amount of red pen marks all over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way you know all of this!\" Carmen calls her bluff and begins to quiz her on the very material. Much to her dismay, Stacy is more than thorough with her answers, leaving Carmen speechless, instead choosing to hiss out of frustration. \"See, she's more than capable. If anything, she might be a bit more dutiful with your work than you are. You might even want to let her help you out. Don't think I haven't been noticing all those facebook posts you keep making when you should be in class.\" Mom berates her, and this time Carmen has no bite left to give. You're also at a loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pause leaves all of us save for one unsure of what to even do. \"So...\" Your mother begins, grabbing up Carmen by the shoulder. \"Sarah, will you be staying to have dinner with us?\" Out of instinct perhaps, the real Sarah responds. \"Oh, sure, I'd love to Mrs.A.\" Coolly your mother turns to Sarah and smiles. \"I wasn't talking to you John, and please, call me <i>'Mom.'</i>\" Sarah giggles the moment mom calls her by your name, and nods ecstatically. \"Sure thing, Mom. You're the best mom ever!\" You wonder if she would have said those words if her real parents were here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then Sarah--\" She is cut off by Carmen ripping Mom's hand off of her shoulder. \"I'm not responding to that name.\" She tells you all. \"You already did.\" Mom tells her back with a chuckle. \"I did not!\" She continues to fight it, but all of you but Carmen -- and perhaps even she -- knows how this is going to end. \"I don't want dinner, so bite me. I don't care anymore, you all suck.\" She states as her arms fold around her extremely thin frame. \"That is no way to talk to your friend's mother, another word like that and I will tell your mother.\" The threat falls to the wrong person however as Sarah steps forward, her words jittery with unease... \"H-h-hold on, ple-please don't call my Mom and tell her I did that.\" Mom ignores her of course, while Carmen's eyes light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Mrs.A!\" She yells out on a scale enough for the neighbors to hear. \"That's it!\" Your mom takes her by the ear and drags her off towards the phone, while Sarah holds her head in panic the entire time. \"Nooo...!\" She whines as she hears the comments your mother is telling hers, while Carmen for the first time finds a smile on her face. \"Don't worry about it, if that's how she's gonna be, we can just stay like this.\" You overhear your sister whispering into Sarah's ear, who mumbles back... \"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen is taken away shortly afterwards by Sarah's parents, being scolded harshly, while her mom shot apologies at yours. Stacy and Sarah move on up to Carmen's room, leaving you alone with either your mother, or the bare bones walls of your sister's room. You choose the latter, but only to simmer in silence.

There is no doubt in your mind they would just talk up a storm to make you feel as much a victim of Stacy's body as you undeniably are. So you stay in her room, and subside your hunger off of the few bit of snacks she has thrown about her room. \"Just yesterday I liked my sister.\" You say as you lay on her blue sheets, staring up at the clean white ceiling. It is hard for you to come to grips with everything that's happened. \"Is this for real? I mean seriously, Mom? I'm Stacy now, just cause I played a trick on them?\" You fume a bit as you raise up to a sit and fumble about with Stacy's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you begin to grab hold of the only two things in your current view that seem even remotely feminine. \"Huh...\" It's shocking, you think, as you find her breasts to not only be malleable pieces and fun to touch, but to also be quite the handful. \"These are a bit softer than I was expecting.\" You admit. It is your first time actually handling them, and though they <i>feel</i> great to hold, the feeling of them being held isn't quite as remarkable. It feels just like any other bit of fat on your body. That is until you take your two fingers and prick at her rather large nipple. A quick jolt tingles throughout it, escalating throughout your entire breast. Certainly it's a lot more stimulating than some cold air on your male nipples, that is for sure. You can't help but tease it again, and though it's not as strong as the first time, a pleasure likely more a result of your own inexperience and surprise than anything -- it is at least, still more potent than your own male equivalent. If nothing else, the soft molding of your hands into her breasts is fun and pleasurable enough on it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt kind of hits you for the first time that you are in-fact a girl, and though you hate the idea of being your sister, being a girl does at least have some surface value. \"It might be the only benefit I get from this...\" You murmur as you continue to toy with this body. You slide a hand down the sides of her body, feeling her rather meager excuse for curves yourself, stopping once you reach her bony hips. It becomes obvious quickly that if you want to stimulate yourself, it's going to have to involve only her more female parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to not be taken aback, you return to her breasts and lay back down on the bed. As you twist and turn them, you eventually begin to feel some odd sensation swelling up inside of you -- a heat for sure, but it's different and not at all focused in the same location you're used to. Nothing besides her nipples are getting stiff -- there is no guiding male sternness at your crotch sending you signals on what to do. No, whatever is happening to you now is a bit too weird for you to come to grips with right away. Then you turn your head and catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror atop your sister's desk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth open, braces glittering, tongue over her teeth, hands thrashing about from underneath her shirt, you...</span></div></div>",

Any attraction to the situation is immediately lost, and instead, it just makes you feel even more disgusted. Every inch of you begins to remind you of your sister's less than stellar qualities -- even as you cringe, your lips hit your braces and it sends a shiver of disgust throughout this frail body you've been forced into. You start to feel a little queasy as you think on just what is <i>actually</i> happening. \"Ugh, this is so gross.\" You say as you slither your tongue around your mouth, feeling the back of your sister's teeth, their current alignment, chips or otherwise. \"Yuck, my stupid sister's saliva is swirling around in my mouth -- this just got a whole lot more disgusting.\" Now that you realize it, you can't seem to wipe it from your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you can only find utter contempt with being your sister, at all. \"This is fucked up, I can't stand this.\" It may just be because you're really pissed off at her right now, but you find yourself judging your sister's appearance far more harshly than before. \"Fuckin'...!\" You curse as you the snapping of hair as you struggle to free your hand from her ponytail, which she may well have kept on even as she slept last night. Her face, your voice, her everything, it all starts to settle in as things you never want to feel this close to you. \"Ah... relax!\" You tell yourself as you get up from the bed, taking a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the mirror around and try to ignore everything about your current body. You pace the room, avoiding your own thoughts, which continuously pick at what you're currently feeling -- from your tiny feet stepping on the carpet, to the way your cheeks feel as your move your lips. \"Stop, stop...!\" You pound on your head, but it only shifts your worries from who you are, to who <i>they</i> are. \"What is she going to do with my body? What about my friends, she'll make a fool out of me for sure...!\" You hit your head again, sit down at Stacy's desk and try to fiddle away on her computer to waste time. No video, no bit of news, forum or otherwise can seem to shake the stress from you. The whole while your mother's voice keeps echoing in your head, repeating those horrible, perhaps all to real words... <i>\"You are Stacy... maybe you'll be stuck like this...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't be serious about leaving us like this forever and leaving this up to those two!\" You tell yourself as you smother yourself in a pillow, hoping you might suffocate face down on Stacy's bed. You stress about it all throughout the night, you feel like you might never fall asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you find yourself shooting up from the bed sometime later. \"Ah!\" You exclaim as you feel the oddness of this body overcome you, that your dream seemed to distract you from. \"N-no, this can't be...!\" Your heart races as you find it all to real a reality. You don't even need a mirror, you know you're still Stacy, that everything that happened was real. You look at the clock and find it's already 11AM, not surprising, considering you tossed and turned all night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the sensations of Stacy's body clinging to you, a more familiar one comes to the forefront very quickly. \"Oof...\" You say as your stomach rumbles something fierce. Your first goal of the day becomes clear, and so you make your way to the door. \"Mmm...\" You murmur as your hand slides along the doorknob like it is covered in something. That something you find, is just you. Your hand is all oily and as you touch at your hair, you find it feels even worse than it did yesterday, and sure enough, it's just as oily as your skin, if not even more so. \"Your body is so disgusting Stacy...\" You're not sure whether to resent her or pity her, but you move on regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way towards the kitchen, you feel a building anxiety form in your gut as you see your mother's figured behind moving about in-front of the kitchen counter. She turns to you with a bright smile and says... \"Good morning, Cupcake.\" You quirk your lips at her, resenting the fact she just called you by her stupid pet name for Stacy. \"Hungry?\" She asks, turning her body to reveal a plate of omelets. Her bright smile continues as she brings it to you and strokes your face as if you are a baby. \"I don't like omelets...\" You sulk as you sit down in-front of them. \"What are you talking about, they are your favorite. You ask for them all the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don--\" You realize pretty quick where her head is at and silence yourself. \"Just try it, you might be surprised.\" She insists, and quite frankly, you're too hungry to care what they are. A bite of it in hand, you bring it to your mouth, expecting the same bland taste, only to find your eyes perking up as it hits your insides. The second and third bites come immediately after. You can't believe how tasty they, and moreover, it's a kind of taste you really haven't ever <i>tasted</i> before. \"See, I know exactly what my little girl likes.\" She chuckles with a finger at her lip, her free hand stroking your tossed hair out of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Stacy?\" You ask. She simply points a finger at you. You are forced to rephrase. \"Where's John and Carmen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went out, I think they said something about going to the beach. They did swimswear, so that is probably where they are heading.\" You're happy to hear it's not someplace where your friends might be. \"Oh, and your friend Sarah said to meet her at her place when you're up.\" She informs you. Your first thought is that you don't even have a friend named Sarah, then it dawns on you pretty quick what she meant. \"I see, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure, my little Cupcake.\" She smothers your face in her breasts before kissing you right on the lips, something she only does to to girls. \"Mom!\" You flip out and begin to wipe it away. \"Oh relax Cupcake, I don't have any germs you don't have already.\" You simply grunt from her comment and go back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare at yourself in the mirror, in your ever more disheveled state, you...</span></div></div>",

The voice seemed somewhat familiar but you couldn't place it, so you were forced to look across the street at the girl. It was Jennifer Cheltham, one of the more 'stuck up' girls from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" you mumbled, knowing that Stacey hated Jennifer, and maybe with good reason. \"Hey Jenny!\" he forced himself to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking glamorous as always I see\" Jennifer scoffed, smirking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a look down at yourself, at your sister's jeans and flats, and her worn tank top that you had on. \"You ever heard of casual?\" you snapped back at Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's casual...and there's scruffy!\" Jennifer stated, putting a hand on a hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sighed. \"Fine, I'm a scruffy person, lets leave it at that okay, keep walking!\" you told the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we don't have to be enemies, and I can help you buy some cool clothes\" Jennifer started saying as she crossed the road towards you. You were naturally suspicious of Jennifer's intentions at that moment, as your sister would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get back home okay, thanks for the offer\" you mumbled, gesturing down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does mommy want you in for tea?\" Jennifer giggled, teasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you were close to 'blowing your top' through anger. But then you thought of the soul swapping bowl, and a little smirk appeared on your face as you thought about swapping Jennifer into someone else's body. It was a long shot, but you knew that Stacey (still in Carmen's body) would be only too willing to help you. Then again, you knew that sorting the 'problem' with your dad should be the first thing on your 'to do' list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I'm watching you, so don't try anything funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure this <i>is</i> something funny,\" you mutter as you take the bowl. Sheesh, how did you end up as the one who can't be trusted with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the kitchen and approach Jennifer. \"Say, Jennifer, are you thirsty?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you've got nothin' to drink in here,\" she says before catching sight of what you're holding. \"Hey, what's with the bowl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the finest for our guest!\" you say with your best fake smile as you present the bowl to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiight...\" Jennifer takes a gulp from the bowl and thrusts it back into your hands. \"Blech. Is that what nerds drink? I'll find something else, thanks.\" She goes back to rummaging around the room, ignoring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess. Now you just need to decide who you're going to swap her with. Well, taking a drink yourself and leaving Jennifer in Stacey's body would certainly be karmic. But you don't really want to end up stuck as her and have to go live in her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could switch her with that uberdork Sarah. Now that would really show her. And perhaps from there, you could keep Sarah from getting Dad's body... well, probably not. You're in the doghouse, so Mom wouldn't be likely to believe any lies you tried to spin. Most likely, that scenario would just end with Dad in Jennifer's body instead of Sarah's, which would be... well, you're not sure if it would be an improvement or not.</span></div></div>",

Then she moved to calm down Sarah in Stacey\u2019s body, since she was getting excited at the thought of finally becoming a grown man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later Stacey led your father into the kitchen, where you were all stood around, as if waiting for something to happen. \u201cHi sweetheart!\u201d your mother greeted your father with a kiss and a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a full house I see\u201d your father smiled. \u201cCarmen will you hang my coat up please\u201d he then said, handing his coat to Stacey, who stifled a giggle. \u201cHello Sarah, nice to see you\u201d he then said to Jennifer, who managed to force out a meek smile. However she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had the pleasure!\u201d your father then mumbled, turning to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to say something, but your mother stepped in. \u201cOh\u2026this is Jennifer, she\u2019s a friend of Stacey\u2019s and Sarah\u2019s\u201d she said, introducing you to your own father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026n\u2026nice to meet you\u201d you stuttered, shaking your dad\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo hug for your father honey?\u201d your father then said to Sarah, in Stacey\u2019s body. Her enthusiam got the better of her and she lunged at your father, hugging him tightly. \u201cHey\u2026nice to see you too princess\u201d he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at your mother, you saw she had got the Swapping Bowl from its hiding place and was preparing to make another swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you had to warn your father of your mother\u2019s plans.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your father sets his lunchbox on the kitchen counter and begins emptying it as your mother passes the bowl to Sarah. You want to remind him of your conversation earlier that day at the construction site, but he already knows about the bowl's powers. What more can be said, except he would become his own daughter as opposed to his daughter's best friend as you originally warned him? Neither are appealing choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer grabs your shoulder and silently mouths \"No\" with Sarah's slight overbite. Maybe it's for the best that your father doesn't have to become such a nerd; just looking at Sarah's scrawny body makes Stacey's seem tolerable by comparison. You have to fight down the urge to recoil from Jennifer in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he spins around with an embarrassed look of delight on his rugged face. He's holding the bowl now, and it's empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigod, omigod, this is totally awesome!!!\" He screeches, handing it back to your mother who disappears for a moment to put it away. Your father is practically hopping on his tip toes now, acting quite like the teenage girl now inhabiting his bulkier, manly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the devil?\" A throaty grunt comes from Stacey's body. Your father pats himself down, brushing long stringy hair out of his face and looking up at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Stacey?\" Stacey asks, intercepting him and pulling him away from Sarah, who by now is shamelessly stuffing her hands down her pants in wide-eyed wonderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the soul-swapping bowl, wasn't it?\" He replies. \"Good Lord, it's been a while since I've seen that thing. John told me he found it and you were going to swap me into Sarah's body over there.\" He points at Jennifer as your mum returns to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John did what?\" She put her hands on her hips, staring daggers at you. Words can't express the kind of hell you're going to catch now. Stammering in terror and preparing to defend yourself, when your father interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Tracy, go easy on the lad. I told him I was fine with it.\" Grabbing her hand tenderly, he thought about kissing his wife but realised she was technically his mum now. \"I'm sorry about our little argument earlier today. And as a token of good will, I'm going to live as Stacey and show you more of my sensitive side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother looks delighted about her husband's willingness to play along. Sarah giggles, \"So can I stay as Mister Anderson for now? Pretty please??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Gerry.\" Your mum addresses her directly. \"You can't exactly go to school with Sarah and Jennifer looking like that, can you? Those are <i>Stacey's</i> friends. Besides, I don't think the school would look approvingly on an older man hanging around a couple of teenage girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether the irony was lost on her, you can't tell. She adds, \"And do take your hands out of your pants, dear. We'll have plenty of time for that later.\" She grabs a handful of Sarah's new sculpted ass, causing her to blush and chuckle excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting her chin over at you and Jennifer, she asks, \"Speaking of the girls, do you think we should invite them to stay for supper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been content to stand in the background like a wallflower, but your mother pulls you into the conversation again. \"Wait a minute! I can't go back to Jennifer's house for the night! I don't know anything about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Your father glances across the room at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm John...\" You mutter. \"I'm in Jennifer's body, Jennifer is Sarah, Stacey is Carmen, and Carmen is me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father laughs. \"I kind of figured John had been swapped since I saw him at the construction site. He never would have greeted me with such affection. Interesting idea to put Sarah in charge for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I soooo appreciate it, Mister Anderson \u2014 uh, I mean, Stacey.\" Sarah titters, covering her mouth with a hand. \"I can't believe I'm my best friend's Dad! I feel so strong and confident now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it!\" Your dad beams, while you roll your eyes and try not to hurl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mum continues, \"Unfortunately, I don't think I've prepared enough food tonight for everyone. You should have told me you wanted to sleep over, <i>Jennifer</i>. Sarah is always welcome to stay however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair!\" You protest. This must be her way of punishing you, by making you live as Jennifer for the time being. You appeal to Jennifer, who seems relieved she doesn't have to go to Sarah's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't just my household, after all. What do you think, Gerry? Should Jennifer stay for supper?\" She asks Sarah, who has a mischievous grin on her face. She stares down at you with contempt, no doubt holding a grudge for how bitchy the real Jennifer has been to her and Stacey in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want her parents to worry about her. I'll escort her out.\" She says coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me!\" You sputter, backing away from Sarah. \"This is fucking crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such unladylike language...\" Stacey grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen is right. Be a good girl and run along so I don't have to call Mister Cheltham and bring him over here.\" Your mother reaches for the telephone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go, it'll be okay.\" Jennifer whispers. \"I'll see you tomorrow at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" You huff like a typical teenage girl. \"I'll show myself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so nice of you to visit!\" Your mother chirps acidly. \"But don't think I've forgotten about your misbehaviour today, young lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you storm out of the house, you pass by Carmen who is standing on the sidewalk in your body. She's dressed you in a pair of oxford shoes, faded jeans, and a black shirt underneath an unzipped red windbreaker. She's got your hair mussed up and she even smells of the cologne you hardly ever wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop in your tracks. \"What could you possibly be up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks over and frowns. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn well know I'm John!\" You screech. \"Dad switched with Sarah and they kicked me out of the house. So I'm headed to Jennifer's for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, too bad.\" She says, though you doubt she's sincerely sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" You ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going clubbing tonight.\" She drawls. \"I'm waiting for a taxi to pick me up. Who knows, maybe I'll meet a girl and get a motel room for us later on? I've had enough of jerking my cock and want to try the real thing. You would understand if you were a guy. Anyways, wish me luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a nightmare!\" You moan, finding everything so out of control. Not only has Carmen been playing with your 'junk' but she's going to use and abuse your body with God-knows-who tonight. You feel powerless to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do about Carmen's plans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was just teasing you, I'm not going partying tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs, \"Well, I'd certainly <i>like</i> to, but no self-respecting nightclub is going to let a guy like me in. I'm an underage boy now, just 17 years old. Come to think of it, I now have, like, the <i>best</i> fake ID ever. Too bad you're not a few years older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief. \"So are you gonna tell me where it is you're actually going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen's lips curl into a coquettish smirk. It's such a Carmen-like expression but it looks weird on your face. She replies, \"If you must know, I'm going shopping for a new car. And since everyone knows men are treated with more respect than women when negotiating with salespeople, I want to go in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that sounds more reasonable.\" You shrug, before Carmen's taxi appears at the curb. She climbs in and waves goodbye before you head off to Jennifer's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lives at the end of the next street over; all houses in the subdivision were designed around the same time, so they all look basically the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cheltham family is loud, chaotic, and rambunctious. Jennifer is the older sister in this family, having twin brothers Jordan and Jeremy who recently became teenagers themselves. Their mother, Jeanne, is a homemaker and their father, James, is hardly ever around. You've personally never seen him outside of photographs, as he apparently works some high-paying job that involves lots of travel. They also have a dog named Jewel... for some reason the Cheltham's love naming everything with a J.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come through the front door and Jewel woofs, bouncing up to you for some petting. Taking off Jennifer's sneakers at the doorway next to the others, you see Mrs. Cheltham in the kitchen preparing supper and the two boys shouting and cavorting upstairs in their bedroom. No doubt playing video games by the sound effects in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Jennifer play video games? She's always struck you as the more girly-girl type. A notion confirmed when you enter her room and see walls of pink and white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room is strewn with plush animals, jewelry with big gaudy rocks strung together, and posters of boy bands and male singers. A small bookshelf next to her bed has lots of fantasy and young adult romance novels. There are a few articles of clothing left folded on a dresser \u2014 a small pile of tops and knickers her mother probably set for her to put away \u2014 but it's mostly a clean room. And it's not a very large room either; you're impressed by how much Jennifer can fit in there. The room has a fruity perfume smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laptop computer is left open on her desk, but you don't want to snoop into her personal life too much. Not yet at least, if you can avoid it. Taking her body is enough. And you don't feel like inspecting it too \"privately\" at the moment either. After all, she's the same age as your little sister, even if she's a lot more developed in the chest and hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoredom sets in quickly, however, and the noise and laughing coming from the twins' room piques your curiosity. Knocking at their door, you listen carefully as they pause the video game and one of them calls out asking Who Is It?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's \u2014 It's Jennifer. Open up!\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys opens the door and stares at you awkwardly. \"What's up, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never actually talked to either of them before, so what to say? What kind of relationship do they have with their older sister? Rubbing your arm, you clear your throat and ask, \"Uh... I couldn't help but overhear you two playing video games...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy sitting on the bed pipes up. \"Yeah, sorry about that Jen. I told you to turn the volume down, you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy at the door spins around. \"Shut'cher face, butthead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go another round, tough guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy boys,\" You interject, throwing their attention back onto you. \"Actually, I was kinda bored so I thought I'd watch you two play for a while till supper's ready.\" Seeing their blank expressions, you ask meekly, \"Is \u2014 Is that OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy at the door shrugs. \"Yeah, sure. C'mon in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey scoot over and roll a chair out for you to sit on and watch them play. You press Jennifer's cushiony rear into the seat, fidgeting a little until you decide finally to cross your legs encased in her skinny jeans. It feels oddly comfortable, not needing to worry about squishing your balls as you cross her legs and place your hands in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys fall into their old style, at times forgetting you're with them, cursing and trash talking at their opponents and at each other. They're playing a multiplayer shooting game, one of your favourites in fact, a game which you have a lot of skill playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey, on the other hand, are amateurs. You could defeat them soundly on your own account, but it's funny to see them making mistakes and getting killed in game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't you go into that cave? Might be a weapon drop you could use in there...\" You suggest helpfully, and the boys look at you with scepticism. But one of them goes inside and, sure enough, finds a valuable battle rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beginner's luck!\" He sneers at his twin brother after getting killed again, this time courtesy of the newfound rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give pointers to the boys as they grow increasingly impressed with their older sister. One of them (perhaps Jeremy?) says, \"Wow, I didn't know you were into this kinda stuff Jen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothing out your long black hair, you chuckle, \"Maybe there's a lot about me you two don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan scoffs, \"I'll believe it when I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" You grin, \"Is that a challenge? I'd be careful challenging others given how you got smoked last round, ya big noob!\" It's probably something the real Jennifer would never say, but you're carried away at this point and just want to have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy's mouth forms an 'o' as he taunts his twin brother. \"Ooooooooh, you gonna take that from your big sis, Jordan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan looks at you harshly, shoving Jeremy's controller into your hands. Jeremy protests, complaining that the game wasn't finished, but he insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, miss Big Mouth, you're on! Best two out of three?\" Jordan declares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, giving off an impression of a haughty teenage girl. \"Ugh, this is <i>so</i> juvenile. But I guess I'll teach you dweebs a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new game begins, and you quickly subdue Jordan with a series of well-timed maneuvers. Your manicured fingernails dance and roll over the controller like a maestro, the muscle memory staying with you despite the alien feeling of everything else in this girly body. It's actually a good way to pass the time, since it distracts away from feeling her bra snugging up against the large breasts on your chest, or the long hair occasionally bouncing in your field of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just fifteen minutes, the score is not even close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it...\" Jeremy whistles. \"Since when were you such a gamer girl, Jennifer?\" He looks at you in awe, making you feel proud of yourself. At least somebody appreciates all the wasted hours spent gaming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that little demonstration right there?\" You preen modestly, having both of them practically in the palm of your hand now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta teach us your secrets!\" Jordan says, still a bit bewildered at how thoroughly he got trounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In good time, boys.\" You stand up. \"I think supper's ready, let's go downstairs! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You spent the next half hour with Mrs. Cheltham in the kitchen, helping her get supper ready. Jennifer's mother already did most of the work, but she wanted to give you a quick rundown on what she did to prepare the main dish. Just in case her 'daughter' wanted to impress any cute boys by cooking a nice meal at home some day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reaction is probably similar to what Jennifer's might have been, causing her mother to wink knowingly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupper goes smoothly, with Jeremy and Jordan thankfully doing most of the talking. You give a few generic comments about school as well as working on an upcoming 'project' with Stacey and Sarah, that might require some time at their houses. That way her parents might let you out so you can swap back to normal \u2014 namely, whenever your mom has had her fill of punishing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys clean their plates but otherwise leave the mess for you and Mrs. Cheltham to clean up. While rinsing the dishes with hot water and soap in the sink, she prods more into Jennifer's social life. Being really nosy about it, but you dodge several of her questions until she grows tired of pestering you. She means well, but maybe all mothers are like that sometimes. Kind of like how your own mom worries you endlessly about your fascination with paranormal events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack upstairs in Jennifer's bedroom, you stretch out on her bed and page through her smartphone. Using her thumbprint to unlock the device, you browse her Twitter and Instagram pages to learn more about her. What songs she likes to listen to. What activities she does with her friends. Endless text logs between friends, classmates, even a boyfriend she used to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friendship she used to have with Stacey and Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, that's interesting. You didn't know they used to be close. You'll have to ask them about that some day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer posted her school schedule in a Facebook group, which helps you get ready for tomorrow. You went to that school a few years ago and recognise some of her teachers' names. Hopefully it won't be too difficult to remember what you learnt in those classes. But keeping up with Jennifer's expansive social circle, on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up and prepare for school. The night before you brushed Jennifer's teeth (using her own toothbrush, which felt gross but should have been completely natural), washed off her makeup, did your 'business', and dressed into a set of hot pink pijamas. Opting not to touch her bra and knickers, you simply slipped into a matching set of pants and a camisole that fit snugly around Jennifer's endowed chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, faced with the spectre of washing her body before school, you hesitate for a moment. But Jeremy chides you to hurry up; normally she's the first one to hop into the upstairs shower because it takes her the longest. And you can see why, with all her hair tussled about after your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, biting the bullet, you close the door and fully strip down. Going about showering in as businesslike and impersonal a manner as you can muster. Having the benefit of washing up already with Stacey's body, it's not a totally new experience: feeling the soapy water cascading down your hair, breasts, and backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that's over, you wrap a towel around your chest and waist and spend what seems like an eternity blow drying Jennifer's hair. After that you step into Jennifer's bedroom and lay out her clothes for the day.  You slide a pair of spandex knickers up your legs, feeling them catch snugly against your flat crotch. That's followed by a plain nude bra, which you struggle to hook the clasps behind your back until you swing the cups around and hook them in front first. Finally you slip on a pair of capri pants, socks, and a short-sleeved top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to remember what your sisters did to get ready each morning, you return to the washroom mirror and add a touch of concealer to Jennifer's face, swabbing lightly with the pencil until she looks halfway presentable (by what you imagine to be her standards). Leaving the hair straightener alone due to time, you use her hairbrush to work through the kinks and tie it behind your head with a scrunchie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the teenage girl in the mirror, you admire your handiwork. <i>Not bad for a guy</i>, you think. Hopefully Jennifer will agree when you meet up with her later that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Jennifer's purse and books, you're just in time to catch the bus. Finding an empty seat, you bury your face in Jennifer's phone until you arrive at school some thirty minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've no idea where her locker is, so you opt to carry her books to first period. Thankfully, \"Sarah\" shares this class with you, and she pulls you aside in the hallway before class begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking her dishy pale-blonde hair behind her ears, Jennifer clucks her tongue at you. \"That top kind of clashes with those pants, and what's with my hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn't have much time...\" You clutch your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer shrugs it off. \"You did your best, I guess. I spent two hours getting Sarah to look like this, and I still look better than her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look eye-level at the body of Stacey's best friend. To Jennifer's credit, Sarah's hair doesn't look ratted and oily and her spots look muted beneath a generous layer of foundation. But Jennifer obviously had to make do with Sarah's plain clothing, overbite, and scrawny girlish figure. Not having the same womanly figure and curvy hips that her old frame has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look... good.\" You murmur, which pleases Jennifer quite a bit. No matter who she is, it seems, she prides herself in her appearance. You continue, \"I saw a copy of your school schedule on Facebook, so I know which classes you have. But I don't know where you sit for each of them, or your locker combination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer quickly writes down her locker number and combination on a note. She also explains where she sits for the first couple periods, suggesting when in doubt you simply wait for everyone else to take their seats and then sit next to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you ask, \"Hey, where's my Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean <i>Stacey</i>? She's pretending to be out sick today, after getting her <i>father's</i> permission of course,\" Jennifer rolls her eyes contemptuously. \"Your Dad said he feels a lot more energetic in Stacey's younger body, and that he'll finally be able to make some repairs on the house with his day off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, \"Yeah, that sounds like him. But he might find it more difficult without his stronger muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer waves her hands. \"Okay, whatever. Class is about to begin. Let me text you Sarah's number so we can chat throughout the day. If you have a question, let's meet behind the art building. Remember, I can't afford to be seen talking to Sarah for too long, so if we have to meet then keep it brief, okay?

Sitting on the floor Sarah looks directly at you with curiosity. \"So, tell me about being a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start thinking about what to say but realize you have no idea where to start. \"Well what would you like to know?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything.\" Beams Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you be more specific?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what's it like being strong and tall, and what's it like having one of those things hanging between your legs? Does it get in the way whenever you have to do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly scratch your cheek with a finger, not really knowing how to answer all of those questions. You take a deep breath though before finally telling her that you're not really that strong or tall. Sarah however says that's not true, as you can reach the highest cabinet in your house, and she's seen you lift some heavy things as well. You laugh a little at this.<br>\r\n\"Yes I suppose I can do that, but I can't reach above it, I still need a stool for anything higher than that. And I could barely carry some of those items. And no, my penis doesn't get in the way when I move or do anything really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stares at you quizzically. \"Eh?

You totally forgot about checking out the information Sarah wrote for you. With a whimper you step out of your bed and sit down on the chair in front of the desk. In front of you lies the information Sarah wrote for you, five pages long. And it's not in her handwriting, but in yours. You totally hate yourself for having such a small handwriting, the letters are so small you really have to stare deeply at them to figure out what you've written there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's around one AM when you've finally finished reading Sarah's information, she is way more in detail then you are. She didn't only write which classes she has and which teachers, but also where she sits, who she talks with, who she ignores. All of this you tried to remember and rehearse yourself, it was a tough job. But now you're done with it, you switch off the desk lamp, stagger off to your bed, crawl inside it and close your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the alarm clock sounds it feels like you've only been into bed for five minutes. You hit the snooze button and close your eyes again as you try to sleep. It then suddenly hits you it wasn't your old alarm clock that rang. You open your eyes again and look around. It all comes back to you, you're now inside Sarah's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she really has to get up this early?\" You ask yourself as you see it's half an hour earlier than you would normal wake up. You then remind yourself of Sarah's schedule. You crawl your way out of bed, hoping that you can sleep in it again soon. Inside the bathroom you don't spot anyone, Sarah's parents are up already or still asleep. You grab Sarah's shampoo bottle and wash your hair with it. When finally done, you hurry back to Sarah's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time to get dressed but in what? You would have chosen the same outfit Sarah wore yesterday, but you know that she wouldn't want it. So you settle on a white t-shirt with shorts.

Walking over towards the cupboards you grabbed a plate and began to serve yourself some food.

Told me it was way too embarrassing.\" Stacy said lying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you didn't even took a peek inside?\" You asked her. Here you were hoping that Stacy knew what Sarah was doing with your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that. Of course he didn't even realize that when he closed the door he could have just locked it down, so I took the advantage and peeked in anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see?\" You ask Stacy sitting almost at the top of the seat. Stacy leans over to you and whispers it to you: \"I saw him checking himself out, you know making bodybuilder poses in front of the mirror. Keeping on whispering how handsome he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" You shriek. You're not sure what to make of it, of course you and Sarah never made any rules about checking yourself out, but this was really weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to keep this a secret, alright?\" You beg Stacy. \"No way someone finds out about this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, best friend, I won't spill it. After all I want my other best friend back as soon as possible.\" She says giving a wink. After that unfortunate bit of news, you and Stacy talked about some other things.

I'll be waiting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely your secret admirer.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body heat up a little out of excitement as your cheeks started to turn a little red out of embarrassment. You knew the letter wasn't meant for you, but honestly this kind of stuff didn't normally happen to you, and the fact that it was targeting you, if only indirectly still made you feel a bit special. You put the note back in the locker and marched off to your first class of Math which happened to be Sarah's specialty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time you kept your eyes peeled out for who could be Sarah's secret admirer but you couldn't seem to find anyone. In fact you tried so hard to find who it was that sent the note that the teacher reprimanded you a few times to pay attention, not that you really cared. Sure Math wasn't your forte but this stuff was easy compared to everything you knew, and in fact when the teacher handed out worksheets you were among the fastest to finish. Too easy, you thought to yourself as you quickly turned it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of math class progressed pretty smoothly, you talked to a few of the students about random subjects, as well as helping out a few of them with how to solve their math problems. Overall it was pretty fulfilling and in a way kind of fun. You weren't normally the one people went to for help at your old school, not that you weren't smart or anything, just that there were usually much better options, so in a way it felt kind of nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Math class wrapped up you headed back for your locker only to bump into Stacey. \"Hey best friend.\" She said smiling, though you couldn't help but feel as if a small bit of it was teasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stacey.\" Was your reply as you walked over to her and talked to her about how your math class went while Stacey talked about her Science class. One thing that really caught your attention though, is when Stacey talked about the cute boy who had been staring at her in class, it reminded you of the love letter from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about telling Stacey about it, but then again was it really any of her business? Sure she was her best friend, but perhaps it would be better to tell the real Sarah first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react Stacey snapped you out of your thoughts and proclaimed that it was now time to head to P.E. class together. You nodded and began to walk with her, talking about girly things along the way, or at least trying. Keeping up with Stacey was kind of hard to do, and acting girly was taking a lot more energy and thinking than you thought it would. As you continued towards the locker rooms the thoughts of the love letter drifted into the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you tell Stacey?</span></div></div>",

She says excited. \u201c Calm down a bit I don\u2019t think my mother would allow me to have the bowl after she just punished me even for you\u201d. \u201cSo what can we do about it you said you would help me\u201d I never said there wasn\u2019t another way in and to get the bowl\u201d. Yeah and what is it? \u201c I could talk to \u00c9rica on the phone convincing her I\u2019m Stacy get the bowl, swap with her and make Stacy drink from it and then we swap\u201d. \u201c That\u2019s actually pretty smart good job Jhon\u201d. Well yeah of course, I\u2019ll call you back in a bit be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then arrive home and pull out Stacy\u2019s phone. As you are now her you have the ability to unlock it.

Could you please give it back to me?\u201d You say with Stacy\u2019s signature puppy eyes. Normally Erica would not do this kind of thing for you. But you were not you this time, you were Stacy. \u201cSure anything for my favorite sis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leaves you go and grab a bottle of water hoping that was enough for the swaps.\u201d Ok here it is why you want a boring bowl I don\u2019t know:\u201d It\u2019s not boring it makes water taste better look\u201d. You say as you pour some water and drink from it. Taste like Cherry\u201d. \u201c I don\u2019t know Stacy are you sure it\u2019s all right\u201d. Of course what kind of sister would I be if I wanted my big sis to get sick for work or for her daughter?\u201d She then thinks about it and drinks from it. The next few seconds your head feels woozy as you vision starts to fluctuate between locations. The next time you open them your chest feels heavier and you see everything is much shorter. You realized that you just swapped with Erica. Hey Stacy what\u2019s going on?\u201d Your sister asks worried. \u201c Oh I think we used the body swapping bowl.\u201d The what now!\u201d Yeah the swapping bowl it\u2019s no biggy another sip from it and we\u2019ll be back to normal\u201d. Wait do you know what that means?\u201d No not really\u201d You could give me some real vacations right now. Melody has been killing me recently and I could really use it.

Better drink it if I meet someone I want to become I just need them to drink it\u2019. You think as you end the remaining water from the bowl.

As the spinning stops you found yourself in a weird situation as your stand in 4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018 Well that solves who I just swapped with\u2019 That explained that you now inhabited your younger sisters body!

Your new ass, while not very defined still felt huge compared to your old one. Your legs and arms certantly felt weaker but slimmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah and this is what Stacy feels like imagine if I was \u00c9rica or Carmen then the difference would really be a step above\u2019 as you end thinking that you realize you could actually achieve it as with Stacy\u2019s body you could approach Carmen easier and Erica was always cool with the both of you.

Sheesh, John you're a kooky weirdo sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitantly hold the bowl to your lips and pause for a moment. Will it really work? Well, nothing ventured nothing gained.

And you'd better get used to it,\u201d says Erica. \u201cYou're a grown woman now. And you agreed to stay this way for at least a few days. Now, grown women don't go about groping themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d you say pouting. Secretly, you vow to get a good, up close and personal look at your new feminine assets as soon as you're in the privacy of your new apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I suppose I probably better teach you the basics of being female,\u201d continues Erica. \u201cWearing a bra, doing your hair and makeup, the fine art of feminine hygiene \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Back up there, Erica!\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're a woman now,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cDepending on how long you stay in my body, you're probably going to have your first period. It's a natural, ordinary thing. Don't be such a sissy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I just changed my mind,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late!\u201d laughs Erica. \u201cYou already agreed. And like I just said: it's a normal thing. Don't be such a big baby. It's no big deal. We women put up with it once a month. No, the main thing we need to discuss is baby care. Melody is a newborn, so she's going to be a lot of work. I know you'll manage just fine. But being a mom is a full time job. And speaking of that, you'll also need to know the nuts and bolts of how to do my job at work. Believe it or not, that's going to be an easier task for you than taking care of Melody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I'm in over my head here,\u201d you moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo changing your mind now,\u201d she grins. \u201cNow remember, this is just for a few days. A week tops, I promise! Maybe just a little longer than that if things go really, really well. We can play it by ear of course. But you can't tell anyone about it. This will be our little secret, okay? And I'll hide the bowl in a safe place so we can use it to change back when I've had enough vacation. And just think of the once in a lifetime experience you'll get to have, seeing what life is like for the opposite sex. After this, you'll understand girls so much better. Just think how useful that knowledge can be, after we trade back eventually and you're a guy again.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Erica is finally done talking, your head is spinning around trying to gather the information she just told you. It was almost about every little thing in her life, taking care of Melody, doing her job, taking care of her chores at her place, when to wear which clothing. If that didn't tumble your mind, she then talked to you about the hygiene aspects of her life. Doing her hair and make-up, wearing a bra and even The talk about the birds and the bees. You wanted to skip that section but Erica found it important that you would know it. And she warned you that if you would ever get her body pregnant, you would be the one popping her out. Realizing that you decide not to ever have sex with a guy, but just in case Erica explained about the different contraceptives around. When she was finally finished you wish you never heard any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got everything?\" Erica asks to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" You say scratching your neck, not sure if you would remember every detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would.\" Erica says as she rolls her eyes and that's why.\" Erica pushes a button on your computer and walks off to your dad's study. \"I thought this would come in handy.\" Erica hands you a few pages full of the various things she just explained. So that's what she was doing behind your computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me to remember every single thing?\" You ask looking through the various pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of them necessarily, just the basic stuff. And you can always call me if you need to know something. But only in emergency situations, the rest of the family can't know about this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" You say imagining already how Carmen would react when she would find out that you were a girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's that, the rest of it is just a matter of experience. Now you need to go. I don't want you to spend too much on the babysitter.\" She says grinning as she pushes you out of your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hey! And what are you going to do now?\" You ask Erica concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just finding out what separates the boys from the girls. Later sis!\" She says shutting the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph later.\" You mumble as you walk down the stairs. The jiggling of your breasts disturb you, so much in fact that you almost trip. It was a close one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Erica, all done upstairs?\" Your mother asks coming out of the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah, not anything I can use. So I'll guess I go now.\" You tell your mother grabbing Erica's purse from the table in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but come by soon okay?\" Your mother asks you standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, see you soon.\" You tell your mother. When she closes the door, you find it different the way she's treating you. Not like a kid anymore, but more like a grown adult. You like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you walk back to Erica's apartment. The walk is short, but feels different. You're suddenly aware of all the men you come across, looking at you like you are some piece of meat in the supermarket. When you began your trip you gave them some foul scowls back, but since there always more men looking at you, you decide to ignore it. Finally arriving at Erica's apartment you open the door and step inside. In the hallway you take off the sandals, happy that your feet are free from those things. Opening the door to the living room slash kitchen your heart flutters as you see your crush Brooke sitting there, keeping an eye on Melody while she lies in her crib. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Erica, back from your trip already?\" Brooks whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did, so how did things go with Melody?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things were great, I gave her the bottle, though I think she prefers your breast milk.\" She says with an innocent smile. <i>No way! I wouldn't need to give her.... </i>You shudder at the thought of it. Then I changed her diaper and now she's resting as you see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for your service again.\" You tell Brooke giving her the exact amount of money Erica ordered you to give her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, I hope that when I have children they will all be like Melody over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will become an excellent mother.\" You tell her though it sounded exaggerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Then I will go now, I'll see you soon.\" Brooks says leaving the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you close the door, you realize you're all alone now, all alone with Melody. You walk back to the living room and look at Melody. She's looking so cute, with those pink pajamas. You just hope you're ready for it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, this doesn't seem too bad. You take off Erica's heels at the door and walk through her apartment, having seen it before of course but never from this perspective. Everything seems so much taller... or rather, Erica is just a lot shorter than you. She's also pretty damn top heavy, you realise, feeling the weight of her pendulous boobs pulling against her back muscles. Feeling just as oversized as they looked due to the recent pregnancy with Melody. You rub your lower back and groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what's there to do around here?\" You ask to nobody in particular, getting used to Erica's voice coming out of your mouth. Turning on the TV and keeping it low enough so as not to disturb Melody, still sleeping in her cradle in the bedroom. On the kitchen counter lay an unfinished word search puzzle... a full laundry basket next to the clothes washer... a stack of textbooks from Erica's community college on the bookshelf next to the TV, where she had attended before becoming pregnant with Melody. Leftover pasta in the refrigerator, next to some low-fat yogurt, kale, and several bottles of baby food for Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn... how boring! No wonder she wanted out of this life. You plop down on her couch and surf through some channels of weekend daytime TV. Not needing to go to her dull office job until tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile idly running a manicured hand through your long, brown hair, you hear a piercing wail flooding from the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart drops. \"Oh shit, Melody's crying!\" You grunt, hefting yourself up to check on 'your' daughter. Sure enough, the wispy-haired newborn is bawling her little blue eyes out. You check for a soiled diaper, rock her in your arms, pat her back, coo at her in babytalk, measure her temperature. Nothing seems to stop her from crying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, how do you turn this thing off??\" You moan, afraid that Erica's neighbours will overhear the crying baby and think you're a bad parent or something. You place Melody back in the crib and fetch Erica's smartphone. Glad that she had the foresight to write down her password for you in the notes she gave you. You dial your old phone number and wait impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rings later, your old voice is on line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica, what's up?\" Erica asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear that?? That's what's up right now!\" You point the phone to her bedroom to pick up Melody's shrill bawling. \"How the fuck do you get her to stop crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica sighs. \"Can this wait? I'm in the middle of a game right now.\" Explaining how she had been playing Lethal Warfare 2 on your Xbox... and doing pretty well at it too! Briefly describing the high score of yours she beat on Multiplayer mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? Put down the game, I need your help!\" You shout into the phone. \"Your maternal instinct stinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica giggles, \"Oh, sis, you're just learning the difficulties of being a new mother. Melody is going to take up a big portion of your life from now on. Get used to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just tell me how to fix her please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes babies just cry because they need to.\" Says Erica. \"Nothing you can do about it except ride it out. Did you try rocking her? Is it too hot or too cold in my apartment? Did you use her pacifier? What about...\" And so she goes on, walking you through various ideas for calming down Melody. Some things which you tried already. None of it works, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have you tried breastfeeding her?\" Probes your eldest sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Erica, now's not a time for jokes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, John, maybe we've overlooked the basic idea that she's just hungry. She's too young for formula, and she's not used to feeding out of a bottle yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing a strand of hair from your face, you look down at Erica's bulging chest blocking your view of her feet. A very clear outline tracing the contours of her D-cups against the short-sleeved top. Again feeling her bra straps digging into your shoulders annoyingly. Feeling your fingertip sink into the cotton-covered flesh as you poke them curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh... Is there any other way to get her to calm down?\" You stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably, but what do I know? I'm just a teenage boy.\" Erica replies cheekily. Then, more sincerely, she adds, \"<i>You're</i> the mom now. Moms breastfeed their babies. It's what we do. There's nothing to be afraid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at Melody, who is still crying in her crib. Making you feel like the biggest piece of shit for not knowing how to make her stop. Being decidedly against the concept of parenting now that you are experiencing it first-hand. It seeming so much more emotionally draining than how it's portrayed in books or in the movies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica, you still there? My deathmatch round is starting up in ten seconds. I'll talk to you later!\" Erica cheerily hangs up, leaving you alone again with Melody. Wishing that you had never found that stupid body-swap bowl and drank from it. Motherhood sucks!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she did, she took the bowl with her, and the leftover water in it splashed onto the floor in her haste. She seemed really excited. Unbeknownst to you, when Erica went in your room, she quickly hid the bowl in a place she thought that nobody - including you - could find it. For her, this was too good to be true. She didn't have the responsibilities of being a mother, of working overtime, or of being the black sheep irresponsible child right now. Instead, she had male power, male privilege, and a chance to be young and reckless again. With this in mind, she stripped off the jeans you had been wearing and looked at her new penis with some curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, were alone in an attic.</span></div></div>",

Quick, put her on for me.\"  You hand the phone to Erica and as the two chatted away about how crazy this was you decide to take the opportunity to get a look at yourself in the mirror.  You looked like an older version of your crush Brooke.  Fairly tall for a girl at 5' 11\" with beautiful long brown hair.  Bri had already had a good sized pair of breasts, probably a C if you had to guess but with a baby on the way they seemed to have gotten up to about a D.  And even though she was obviously putting on a little baby weight she was still pretty hot, not as hot as her sister in your mind, but not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were considering toying with the idea of taking a quick peek at yourself when Erica hands the phone back to you, \"Okay, your sister told me why you want to be me, and while I think it's kind of weird I also think it's kinda sweet.  Brooke will be back home in about half an hour and you can talk to her to your hearts contents and then you come straight back to your home so we can swap back.  Just a couple of ground rules.  Absolutely NO alcohol, medications, coffee or anything at all that will affect the baby or I swear to god I'll find a way to switch you with a toad.\"  \"Yes mam,\"  You gulp, she really didn't sound like she was joking.  \"Number 2, I know that you're a growing boy and may be curious, but please show some respect to my body and I'll show respect to yours.\"  \"Can do.\"  You say mentally cursing at this rule a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And third, and most importantly...oh crap you're mom's home,  I think I have to go.\"  And suddenly the call was over.  <i>It was probably nothing.</i>  You think putting the phone back into the purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I have to go pick up Melody from the babysitter.  I'll talk to you later.  I'm going to want details.\"  Erica says as she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, looks like I have the whole place to myself.\"  You say to yourself as you take the opportunity to get familiar with Brooke and Brianna's place.  The first place you find must have been Bri's room due to a ton of bags of baby supplies, so since the room was yours for now, you go ahead and make yourself at home.  Curiously you open up a bag just to see what was in it and you pull out what you figure must be a maternity dress.  Slowly you rational to yourself with a grin on your face, \"Trying out this dress for Bri wouldn't be disrespecting her body, in fact I'd probably be doing her a favor.\"  And so you quickly and excitedly remove the shirt and pants you had been wearing, and after taking a few minutes to admire Brianna's taste in undergarments you step into the dress, and while the dress seemed to be more intended for when Bri was closer to bursting, the yellow dress still looked darn on the body you occupied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to look through other bags for more cloths to 'help' Bri try out you suddenly here the door open.  Excited to finally talk to Brooke you rush as fast as your pregnant body could to the living room where _______ was waiting for Brianna.</span></div></div>",

Before you can come up with anything to say to her she steps back and continues on, \"Wow you weren't lying when you said you got some greats dresses.  You are by far the hottest pregnant woman in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at a loss for words.  When you always imagined talking to Brooke, the idea of her calling you the 'hottest pregnant woman in town' had never entered your mind, but after the initial shock of this wears off you manage to say without thinking, \"Thanks, you too.\"  Then after an awkward pause you correct yourself, \"I mean you will when you get pregnant.  Eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke chuckles, \"Thanks, but that won't be for a long time like when I'm married.  I mean not that not being married isn't totally cool or okay!\"  Brooke quickly says fearful she'd offended her sister.  \"I just mean that...I just totally put my foot in my mouth and could you ever forgive me Bri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of coarse Brooke, I don't think I could ever be mad at you.\"  Then realizing you had another opportunity you add, \"Come and give your sister a hug.\"  Brooke smiles and obliges you and you once again feel a since of bliss as you hug your crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you just sit and talk for about an hour on everything from school to clothes (although you had to do alot of nodding on that subject).  You tried to see if you could gather info about whether there were any boys she like (particularly boys named John) but Brooke just blushed and danced around the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you felt as if you'd gotten as much out of this experience as you needed.  You felt like you could hold your own if you talked as yourself with Brooke without embarrassing yourself.  So getting up you say, \"I think I'm going to head over to see Erica for a little while, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you can leave Brooke also stands and says, \"But wait, don't you have a doctors appointment in just a little bit?  I don't know if you have time for that.  In fact you should probably go there now.  Hey I know!  How about I go with you.  Then after the doctor's visit, maybe we can go hang out some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know.\"  You say, you really should probably get back to your body.  And besides that you aren't exactly excited about going to the doctor as a pregnant woman.  But then again you would get more time to hang out with Brooke.</span></div></div>",

It certainly doesn't seem appropriate to be undressing Brooke before you've even started dating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just get it over with,\" Erica snaps, and pulls off your shirt. You quickly turn away from the mirror and fight to keep your eyes from straying downward, knowing Erica would be quick to chastise you for checking yourself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the jeans off as well,\" she says as she opens the wardrobe. You hastily do so, trying to spend as little time as possible looking at what you're doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be perfect.\" Erica reaches into the wardrobe and produces a sleeveless, knee-length dark blue dress, something obviously reserved for special occasions. You hesitantly take it from her and slip into it with surprising ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved at being decent again, you turn back to the mirror. Wow, you look... really pretty. If only you were seeing this from the outside. You gape at yourself until Erica speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what you really need me for,\" she says. \"Let's get some serious makeup on you. Hold still.\" Before you can question if that's necessary, she's brushing away at your eyelashes. She quickly follows that up with lipstick, and then applies some creams and powder to your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she stops, you finally get another good look in the mirror and see before you the picture of femininity, with thick eyelashes, full lips and smooth, unblemished skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's beautiful...\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean <i>you're</i> beautiful, <i>Brooke</i>!\" Erica laughs. She returns to the wardrobe and bends down. \"Okay, now you just need the perfect pair of shoes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not wearing heels,\" you state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of attitude is that? Don't you want to put your all into this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not wearing heels,\" you firmly repeat. \"I at least want to be able to walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fine. Here you go then.\" Erica takes out a black pair of flats and sets them down in front of you. You slip them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there you go! Looking good, girl!\" Erica pats you on the shoulder. You wince a little at being called a girl, even though you very much feel like one by now. \"I'm sure John will love it,\" Erica adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know that already,\" you say nervously, brushing your hair aside and gazing at the lovely image in the mirror once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Erica says, pretending not to know what you meant. \"Well, I'd better be going. Have fun on your date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better hope I do, or you're paying for this!\" you halfheartedly shout at her as she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I set up a date between John and Brooke.

You'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of resignation. Maybe you shouldn't have trusted Erica with the bowl. She does have a tendency to disregard what people tell her and come up with her own ideas instead. But then, those ideas usually do turn out well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at the time,\" she says, and glances up at the clock on the wall. You're pretty sure she couldn't actually see the time until after she started talking. \"I'll be losing money if I don't relieve the babysitter soon. Well, see you later! Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she goes, making her patented \"gotta get back to the baby\" exit. You always suspected it was sometimes just an excuse. You watch her leave with the empty bowl in her hand and begin to feel trapped in Brooke's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is gonna be all kinds of awkward. Well, better get started on learning to play the part.</span></div></div>",

You're lying down on your stomach and you can't really get up.  You feel as if you can only move in a clunky fashion and you don't even seem to be able to push yourself off the ground.  \"Here, let me help you out.\"  You here Erica say from above you and you suddenly feel a pair of massive arms grab you around your stomach and lifts you off the ground.  \"What the hell!\"  You try to say but it comes out as gibberish.  You find yourself facing Erica's giant face.  All of the sudden it dawns on you.  Erica just turned you into her baby daughter, your niece, Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a stream of angry swearing that ended up as just a load of nonsenses but Erica obviously got the gist of your message.  \"Now look here <i>young lady</i>.  I don't care if you are John you are in my little princess' body and will not act like your normal self, that includes acting like a perfect little princess do you understand me?\"  Erica says very sternly.  The tone of her voice seemed to instinctually shut you up but after a second of thought you decide to display Melody's little middle finger to show your disapproval.  \"Very funny John.  Now that you seem to have calmed down a little bit I'll tell you my reasoning.\"  Erica carries you and sits down and it's then you notice that you are both still in your house only just in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already called Brooke to take care of Melody for a few hours.  You get to spend some time with her in a no pressure situation so you can get used to her and hopefully you can muster up some courage to ask her out after I switch you back.  And Melody and I get something out of this, you can give me a little review when you turn back about how she did as a babysitter.  I trust Brooke, but my maternal instincts make me a little paranoid about that kind of thing you know what I mean John?\"  Erica asks and you give a nod.  Now that you've heard her logic you figure you can't be too mad at her, although you still weren't excited about the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go.  I'm glad your on board with me.  I'll hurry up and drop you off.  And don't worry about Melody messing up your body, I made sure she was asleep before the swap and right after I drop you off I'm going back to your room to stay with Melody to take care of her.  I'm sure it'll be tricky but I'm willing to do it as a favor to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Erica was strapping you into her pink baby seat in her car and one quick drive later you were at Brooke's door.  And you were soon placed into your crushes hands.  As your head rubbed up against Brooke's bosom you thought to yourself, <i>Maybe this won't be so bad after all.</i></span></div></div>",

If you want to sit with me we can watch some cartoons, that sounds fun right?\"  Brooke says taking you over to her couch and putting you in her lap.   <i>I really need to thank Erica for this later.</i>  You think as you sit with Brooke watching some educational cartoons on tv while cuddling with Brooke.  After a while of this you found yourself really relaxing, the weight of the world was off of your shoulders.  Here you were with the girl of your dreams and you felt no pressure whatsoever, and before you knew it you found yourself drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself back as yourself out with Brooke on a date at a fancy restaurant.  Things are going great!  The food is good and the conversation is even better.  Things are going great and just as Brooke leans in for the goodnight kiss she says, \"Uh oh, looks like somebody had an accident.\"  \"What?\"  You say before you are jerked awake by a feeling of being lifted up in the air and carried away.  All of the sudden your eyes open and you see Brooke once again towering over you and you remember where you are and what had happened.  \"Don't worry Melody, we'll have that wet diaper off in no time.\" <i>Wet diaper?</i>  You thought before suddenly becoming mortified at what had happened.  You had just wet yourself in front of the girl of your dreams.  Feeling really uncomfortable and more embarrassed than you had ever been in your life your face scrunches up involuntarily and you can feel tears starting to form.  \"Oh don't cry Melody it's okay.  You can't help yourself.  Let me just take that off, and....there you're all cleaned up with a brand new diaper.  All better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to get over the whole wetting yourself thing as you realize that you would never ever do that if you had been in your body with Brooke and all the tears go away, and you even find yourself laughing at how much you were overreacting.  \"There we go, there's a smile on my favorite girl.  You know, I hope Bri's baby is going to be at least half as nice and cute as you are.\"  And as silly as it was you felt really good hearing Brooke say this.  \"Heck, I wish I could meet a guy as nice as you, maybe that cute uncle of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cute uncle?!  That's me!</i>  You think excitedly!  <i>That settles it!  The second I switch back I'm asking Brooke out!</i>  You think so excited that your little body starts to move around uncontrollably.  \"Oh are we having a dance party?  Sounds like a good idea.\"  So you and Brooke share your first dance together.</span></div></div>",

If you had been by yourself all of this would have just been mind numbingly dull but with Brooke constantly at your side being so enthusiastic and so cute with her funny voices and expressions you actually found yourself having a whole lot of fun.  But despite the fun you were ready to go back to being yourself and having full control of your bowels and other assorted bodily functions, you were constantly looking at clocks and out the window wondering when Erica would arrive finally.  Eventually amidst an imaginary tea party where Brooke seemed more into it than you, her cell phone went off and she answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi Erica, are you ready to pick up little Melody?\"  <i>About time.</i>  You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you can't yet?\"  <i>WHAT?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you want me to hold the phone to Melody?  That's so cute.  I'll do that.\"  Erica then put the phone close to your ear, \"Your mommy wants to talk to you little angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to say \"What the hell is going on?\"  to Erica but of course it comers out a bunch of gibberish.  But Erica seemed to get the gist and whispered to you, \"I know you don't like hearing that, but Melody has woken up and is not being cooperative.  The family is also home and I don't want to leave your body alone with Melody in such a mood.  Now if you really want out of there I can send Carmen and Stacy over there and leave you in their care until Melody calms down, but I assumed you'd rather stay with Brooke.  I'll tell you what, you can kinda make vowel sounds right?  Say ah if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Now say 'ooo' again if you want to stay with Brooke and say \"ah\" if you want Carmen and Stacy to bring you home and take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think about it for a second, it would be nice to stay with Brooke for a little longer but you want to be as close to your body and the bowl so you can swap back as soon as possible.  Then again you've seen Carmen and Stacy take care of Melody and they aren't exactly as...careful with Melody as Brooke is.  \"I need an answer now John.\"</span></div></div>",

When you are done, you try burping but it won't work until Erica puts you on her chest and carefully pats you on your back until you give a loud burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a good girl you are.\" Erica says holding you in the air. You have to laugh a little as you look at her face. Then you point at your body who was still sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could swap you now back, but I think you are also tired . Want to take a little nap?\" Erica asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

Soon you feel yourself drift off into a dream and moments later you snap awake from your doze to see Erica rocking Melody to sleep in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!  I can speak again.\"  You say as you practically leap out of bed and enjoy the under appreciated ability of walking around on two legs.  \"Keep it down would you John?  She's almost asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry,\" you say bring your voice down.  You sit on your bed and Erica and smiles as she asks, \"So how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It, actually wasn't all bad.  I got to spend time with Brooke, who was just amazing.  The greatest girl ever.  You don't have to worry about Melody when she's with her.  Although I can't say the same about Carmen and Stacy.  You might want to reconsider letting them babysit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I usually don't have a choice.  Carmen is usually the only person available when I need a sitter who works for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\"  You ask.  Erica paused as she thought about it, \"I never really thought you'd like that sort of thing with you chasing down girls and studying the supernatural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off it's only one girl.  And second...with this bowl I've already found the supernatural.  I don't really need to look anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really appreciate it John.  Thanks so much.\"  Erica said, is that a tear in her eye?  She's had it really hard since that jerk of a boyfriend up and left her and mom and dad were the only ones who really talked to her about it.  You all of the sudden feel kind of guilty so you say, \"You know sis, if it would help you out.  I could move in with you, you know to help you out with stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No, you can't do that.  You can't leave home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only live a few minutes away, it's not like I'd be going across state lines.  I still plan to go to college after high school so I can just stay with you while Melody needs full time care.  That way you don't have to spend money on babysitters and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when I do hire Brooke you can flirt with her.\"  Erica smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't cross my mind.\"  You lie, \"Then it's settled, I'll explain it to mom and dad.  I'm sure they won't have a problem with it.\"  Erica stands up and carefully gives you a big hug to show her appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's the story of how you moved in with your oldest sister Erica and your niece Melody.  You kept the bowl hidden away in your new room where it stayed hidden until you next use it.</span></div></div>",

Can't you just tell them that you want to spend Spring Break with me?\"  You tell your now girlfriend Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Johnny.  I already tried everything I could to convince my mom, dad, and sis to let me just stay home but they wouldn't have it.  I have to spend the week with them, but you know I would love to be with you instead.\"  Brooke says leaning in for a kiss goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that there was probably no way around this.  Parents stubbornly wanting to spend time with their kids for a dumb family vacation seemed like an insurmountable obstacle.  If only you get find a way around it.  Suddenly you got an idea, \"What if you didn't have to go with your family?  Or hell what if I could go with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few months since your adventure with the soul swapping bowl.  After your time as your niece Melody you had moved in with your older sister Erica and helped her out with the house and with taking care of Melody.  And for you taking care of Melody was a snap, not only due to the first hand experience you'd had, but also because you had plenty of help from your new girlfriend Brooke, whom you had asked out the day after you swapped back to yourself and she'd accepted.  The two have you have been going steady for a few months and had seen each other at least once a day, but now with spring break around the corner her family wants to spend time with just their family before Brooke's own sister gives birth to her own kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never even touched the bowl since, but then again opportunity's didn't exactly present themselves for such an occasion, at least until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?  There's no way in hell you could go with me and there is no way my family is letting me stay here.\"  Brooke says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're going to think I'm nuts but...\"  And so you tell Brooke all about the bowl.  Well not all of it, you didn't tell her about how you used it to build the confidence to ask her out since you thought that might sound a little weird, but you told her about it.  However rather than be enthralled by your tale of the bowl liked you'd hoped Brooke just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a fun and silly story, and as much fun as using your imagination can be, aren't we a little old for that kind of pretend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds nuts but...let me just show you.\"  You say as you go to your closet and bring out the bowl and fill it with water.  You take a drink and encourage Brooke to as well.  \"Come on, just humor me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\"  Brooke says and drinks from the bowl.  Instantly you feel yourself become light headed and before you pass out you manage to lead Brooke so that the two of you passed out onto your bed.  Moments later you felt yourself come to and took a look down to confirm that you were now wearing Brooke's blouse and skirt along with the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!  You're me!  And you were telling the truth!\"  Your former voice said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you.  Now do you see what I mean?  Erica already knows, so I thought maybe either you could switch with Erica or we could tell your sister and I could swap with her and we could still spend spring break together.  We obviously couldn't make out or anything but we could still have fun.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a lot of fun.  Now we just have to decide who swaps for the week.\"</span></div></div>",

With you at my side the next week won't only be tolerable but may actually be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the plan.  I'll drink from the bowl now and you get someone in your family to drink it tomorrow morning before you guys hit the road, preferably after you tell them about the plan.  I doubt either of your parents will approve so your sister Brianna will probably be the best choice.  I'll go ahead and tell Erica about what we're doing so that she doesn't find it weird that my body is acting really differently all of the sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That plan actually sounds like it'll work.  But Brianna is about 8 months pregnant.  Do you really want to be her for a week?  It doesn't sound like it'd be fun for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week without you sounds even worse.\"  Brooke laughs at your over the top statement, but still gives you another kiss as a reward for it.  \"That was a little weird.\"  You said after being kissed by your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure was.\"  Brooke said.  You noticed that your body's cheeks were bright red.  \"Alright, let's do it.\"  Brooke said as she took a drink from the bowl and passed it to you.  You took a drink and one dizzy spell later you were yourself again.  A moment later you took another drink from the bowl and handed it to Brooke.  \"Be careful with this, remember, I'll swap with the next person who drinks from this bowl, so keep it secret and safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will John.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Although I figure you'll look a bit different.\"  She said with a chuckle and left the house with the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then went to your sister Erica and told her about your plan.  She thought it was not needed and insisted that a week apart would be good for you two but you didn't listen to a word she said.  She obviously understood that you weren't listening and simply wished you the best of luck and told you to have fun next week while she would look after your body and would make sure it didn't do anything too out of character while in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to get a good nights sleep knowing you'd soon be spending a whole week with Brooke, and sure enough when you woke up you recognized that you were in Brooke's house, but who were you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing you noticed after you regained your senses was a whole lot of new weight on many different parts of your body.  You recognized the feeling of breasts on your chest, you'd actually become pretty familiar with the feeling.  What you hadn't felt before was a whole lot of weight not necessarily on your belly, but inside of you.  It was like a big little...thing was sitting on your pelvis.  But taking a quick look at the reflection in the bowl reminded you that it wasn't exactly your pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend Brooke was looking anxiously at you, \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission accomplished.\"  You said giving Brooke a thumbs up, \"So, what did you tell Bri to get her to drink from the bowl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told her the truth.  I doubt she believed it but...that would be her now.\"  Brooke said picking up her suddenly ringing phone.  \"Hello <i>Johnny.</i>\"  Brooke said with a smile on her face.  \"Now, I know you don't want me to go <i>Johnny</i>, but I have to spend time with my family.  You understand.  Besides, you could use a little break away from things.  I'll talk to you later sweety, kiss kiss.\"  You could definitely hear your voice yelling coming from Brooke's phone but Brooke just seemed laughed it off and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a little mean.\"  You said, when a booming male voice came from behind you.  \"I disagree.\"  You turned around to see the large and imposing frame of Brooke's father Trevor.  In the time you had been dating Brooke you'd managed to make as little contact with him as possible.  You got the feeling he didn't approve of you dating his little girl, although he seemed the type to not approve of anyone dating her so you never took it to heart.  \"No it was the appropriate thing to do.  That boy is a little clingy if you ask me, a week away from him will do you some good Brooke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes daddy.\"  Brooke said while giving you a big smile as her father gave her a kiss on forehead.  \"Now finish packing girls, I want to be on the road asa and p.\"  Trevor said before surprising you with a kiss to the forehead of your own.  Your look of surprise obviously read because Brooke seemed to be doing everything in her power not to bust out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he left, Brooke and Bri's mother, Carrie, who was right behind him said to Brooke, \"Don't worry about him, he's just being overprotective.  This will probably be one of the last family trips we'll have together just the four of us,\"  You notice that Carrie was looking at you when she said that, and for a split second you felt like she was looking into your soul, when you realize what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, next time it will probably be the...five of us.\"  You say forcing a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie, like her husband, gave each you and Brooke a quick kiss and said, \"I'll see you out in the car in a few minutes girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she left you felt a bit guilty, \"Brooke, give me the bowl, I should switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't.  This is what we had planned, I want to spend the week with you and this is the only way to do it.  Besides I know for a fact that Brianna is getting sick and tired of morning sickness and really needs a break from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you say so.\"  You say trying to push the thoughts of morning sickness and other baby related issues you're going to have this week out of your mind.  \"Actually now that I think of it, I have no idea where this vacation is.  Where are we heading?\"</span></div></div>",

You're going to love it!  The whole family does, well except Bri, which is just another good reason for you to come instead of her.  She'd just be all mopey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\"  You say excitedly.  You've always wanted to go to Las Vegas but your family's never had any interest so you figured you'd have to wait until you were in college or adulthood before you could make a trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thoughts of Vegas in mind you helped Brooke finish packing for the two of you, although it was particularly weird you were realizing some of the skirts, dresses, underwear, and even a bikini were intended for you.  Soon after that you and Brooke's family were on the road.  This was the time you were particularly dreading as it would probably be the time where you'd have to make the most small talk with Brooke's family without any breaks to have asides with Brooke.  However, luckily for you Brooke's family was the kind of family that loved to play music throughout a road trip.  And not only play music but sing along as well.  Thankfully this simple act of communion was enough so that for the first time ever, you didn't really feel awkward at all with Trevor and Carrie, in fact it felt really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut eventually all the singing was getting on your nerves a little, but that time didn't last long as soon on the horizon you could make out the famous Las Vegas sign among the desert like landscape.  And before you knew it you had pulled into the hotel and were all checked into the two bedroom suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, you have the room on the left and your mother and I have the room on the right.  It's about 4 o clock now, and we've got some complimentary tickets to a show at 8.  That gives you 4 hours to unpack and do whatever you want.  We'll meet you in the hotel lobby at 7:30.\"  Trevor said before taking his and his wife's things to the room and shutting the door.  Brooke lead you into the room where the two of you would be sharing a bed for the next week and put her stuff down and said, \"So, what do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  You're the Vegas expert.  You suggest something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Brooke said giving it some thought, \"since we don't have all day to do something we'll just stay in the hotel.  You are old enough to gamble now, so I could watch you do that.  I've done it with Bri in the past and I've always had fun watching her and talking to the crazy Vegas characters.  Or if you want to we can go swimming in the hotel pool.  It's really nice and would give you a chance to do something kind of physical in that body that you can actually kind of do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe later choice sounded the most fun, especially since Brooke could actually really participate, although that would involve putting on a bikini and exposing yourself to the world.  As silly as it was you really didn't want to go out in next to nothing, even if (maybe especially because) it's not your own body.  But then again you've always wanted to go gambling, but that would feel like leaving Brooke out of the loop and that goes against the reason you did this crazy switch.</span></div></div>",

However Brooke simply laughed, \"Come on John, man up.  If I'm going swimming, your coming too.  And that includes putting on a swimsuit.\"  You must have obviously looked a little uncomfortable with the idea as Brooke soon added, \"I'll let you help me put mine on.\"  Less than a second later you had said, \"Sure,\" and was stripping off your girlfriends clothes.  Soon Brooke was stripped down to her underwear before she stopped you from going farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay  big boy, I think I've got it from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"  You stammer, but Brooke stopped you, \"Think of this as a sneak preview.  You've got your own feature to attend to.\"  Brooke said putting a swimsuit in your hands and directing you to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery downhearted, you slow march into the bathroom and start removing your own clothes.  When you get down to your own bra and panties you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror.  There stood a very attractive and very pregnant 6' tall woman with beautiful brown hair and a very large belly that had Bri's baby inside.  \"I've got a little person inside me.  Not weird or creepy at all.\"  You says as you unhook your bra and unleashed the large breasts for full view.  It was then that you realize something, \"I can't believe I'm going to see my Brooke's sister naked before I get to even see my girlfriend topless.\"  You say to the mirror, Brooke's voice then came through the door, \"Did you say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"  You quickly say as you took off your panties and examined the swimsuit to figure out how to put it on.  It seemed to be a light brown one piece, but it seemed to have too man holes.  \"This thing has like, 4 or 5 holes in it.\"  You say to the door.  \"It's a designer swimsuit.  Do you need help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can figure it out.  Just give me a minute.\"  You says as you finally figure out what end is up, you think.  You manage to stretch out the materiel and after a few missteps you manage to put both of your feet in the holes intended for them.  And after some struggling and alot of stretching you manage to find the arm holes and are able to pull the top up high enough so that it covered your breasts, although it left more cleavage than you desired.  After looking yourself over in the mirror and deciding you were satisfied with the results you go back into the bedroom where Brooke was standing there in her own red two piece bikini.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great.\"  You blurt out without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your chest is almost falling out of the swimsuit.\"  Brooke said coming up to you and helped adjust your suit, \"Bri wore this just two weeks ago and it fit much better then.  Her boobs must have gotten even bigger.\"  She then gave you a kiss on the cheek, \"And thanks for saying that.  Now grab a towel and lets head on down.\"</span></div></div>",

Just as you were preparing to call Brooke again there was a knock on John's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to expect you say, \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come in?\"  You recognized the voice as your friend and John's sister Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah.\"  You nervously say as you think to yourself, <i>Do I tell her who I am?

Ever since you had woken up at 6 AM you had been in the bathroom on your knees with your head in the toilet.  You were a little worried that you may be sick before you remembered 'morning sickness' and figured this must be what it felt like.  \"I can't believe I've set myself up for another week of this.\"  You groan as you take a good look at Brianna's body in the mirror.  After going to the pool yesterday and then going to a flashy stage show, Brooke's family had taken you to the hotel's buffet where you had gorged yourself.  After that you had been so exhausted from all the activity along with being stuffed full of food and a baby, as soon as you had gotten back to the room you had just stripped down to your panties and put on an extra large t-shirt (which Brooke told you belonged to Bri via an ex boyfriend) and gone to bed.  You hadn't even gotten the chance to enjoy the fact you were sharing a bed with your girlfriend.  Sure you couldn't really <i>do</i> anything since you were in her sister's body, but it would have been nice to at least spoon or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll do that now,\" you say with a smile as you look through the bathroom door at the still sound asleep Brooke, but before you left the bathroom your stomach started to rumble loudly.  \"But I don't really feel like doing that now, I'm starved.\"  You say suddenly overcome by a craving for food, which was really odd since you still had a taste of vomit in your mouth.  \"Man pregnancy cravings are weird.\"  You said as you snuck into the bedroom to grab some cloths to throw on.  You really began to curse your sister's choice in cloths for you as all you could find was skirts and dresses.  You decide on a blue maternity dress.  \"It's kinda like a really big and long t-shirt.\"  You told yourself as you looked at yourself in the mirror with the dress on.  You hurriedly jot a note to Brooke telling her where you were and left the room saying to yourself, \"Breakfast buffet here I come.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything laid before you looked amazing.  Flaky biscuits, greasy sausage, golden eggs, perfect pancakes.  You got a little bit of everything to go with a big glass of milk and sat yourself down for a little feast.  But barely a few bites in a voice came up behind you and said, \"Mind if I join you?\"  You turn around and see...</span></div></div>",

You seemed to be alone, and I'm alone and I thought it'd be nice if we could change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm here with my gir I mean, my family.  Yeah, my family.  But they aren't down yet, so...I guess.\"  You said, no need to be rude to the guy, but if he gets weird or something you could just say you saw Brooke and leave.  He sat down and you turned your attention to the bacon, you ate a slice and the guy said, \"My name's Craig by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Craig, I'm uh, Bri.\"  You said almost forgetting the name of the body you were using.  A few minutes of awkward silence went by as you stuffed your face and Craig sipped coffee and looked at the paper.  From behind the paper you heard Craig say, \"Damn, looks like Mencia is going to be a late scrub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously you looked up to see Craig looking at the sports page and figured he must be talking about the big boxing match that night between the champion O'Neil and the challenger Garcia.  As a big fight fan you couldn't help but ask, \"But the match is tonight, no way will they be able to get a legit challenger ready in time.  Damn, was looking forward to it.  It was going to be a blood bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig lowered the paper surprised to hear that kind of answer coming from a pregnant woman, \"They actually have somebody ready in the wings for a big fight like this for just this kind of situation.  Which is good for me since I already have non-refundable tickets for the event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\"  You said excitedly not even caring about the not so subtle brag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, well actually I have two.  I was supposed to go with my brother but he had to go home last night for an emergency.\"  Craig gave a bit of a pause before continuing, \"I don't mean to sound too forward, but would you like to go to the fight with me?  I don't want to go alone and I really don't want to scalp my ticket.  Plus I must admit I love the idea of going to a big fight with a lovely woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to blurt out yes, but stop when you realize that you were the lovely woman in the scenario.  And you were afraid that might be giving this guy an impression you really really didn't want to give.  You were about to reluctantly say no when Bri's cell phone buzz, you glance at a text message from Brooke that said, <u>Go for it and have a good time!</u>  You jerk your head up and see just a two tables away Brooke smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you do have your girlfriends blessing to go to this fight, after all she doesn't know how much it means to you, but then again it might just be awkward and weird outside of watching the actual fight.</span></div></div>",

See you then Bri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Craig was far enough away you lowered your face and put your hands to your head and muttered, \"Stupid stupid stupid.  I can't believe I did that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit beating yourself up John, you love watching those fights and a ticket practically falls into your lap?  I'd be annoyed at you if you didn't go because I know you'd regret it.\"  Brooke said, you looked up to find she had taken the seat across from you.  \"Besides, you're not cheating on me by going out with a guy, you're just hanging out with a fellow dude...who happens to not know you're a dude.  It's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but what if he gets the wrong idea.\"  You say meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke looked a little annoyed, \"You do what every grown woman does, say no.  Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you bend to the whim of man.  Is that what you think of women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly backtrack, \"No no no of course not, I'm just being paranoid and stupid, after all it's my first time going out with a guy.\"  You say with chuckle now laughing internally at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell him that, for some reason I don't think he'd believe you.\"  Brooke said while looking at Bri's pregnant belly.  \"By the way, if this guy actually seems to be a really cool guy, get his number.\"  You laugh at what Brooke said but she continued, \"I'm actually not joking, since her last boyfriend Bri's been having a hard time meeting guys, so if you could give her a bit of help I'm really <i>really</i> appreciate it.\"  Brooke put on her sexy voice for that last part which really perked you up, \"You would?!\"  \"I'll show you how much I appreciate all you're doing for me and my family on this trip when you get your body back and you can show me how much of a stud you are.\"  You were now blushing redder than the strawberry jelly on your toast as Brooke leaned over to give you a kiss on the cheek.  After the kiss she then whispered in your ear, \"Now lets go get you a new dress and put on some makeup for your date with Craig.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you stood in the lobby waiting for Craig, you look yourself up and down in the mirror, and you have to admit that Brooke did a great job. She'd sorted you a dress that flattered your figure (even with your huge pregnant belly), some lovely open-toed sandals, and plenty of jewelry and accessories. Although you looked the part, you still didn't really feel it - you were excited for the big fight, but nervous about dating a man in order to see it. Before you had time to fret any further, Craig walked over. He was dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and jeans, and you could see his shapely arm tone under the shirt material. It made you feel flustered, and your heart leapt into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Bri!\" Craig said, \"You ready for our big night?\". You grinned at him, \"You've gotta be kidding me, I was born ready\". As you walked to the arena, you chatted to Craig about his day, and you began to forget the weirdness of the situation for you and you just went with it. It felt good pretending to be someone else, in another body and another place - even if that other someone was a very pregnant sister of your crush. You waddled over to your seat and sat down. It felt good to relief the pressure - you found it difficult even for short periods of walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you felt a kick and a wriggle - Bri's baby moving around inside of you! You gave a happy little giggle and grabbed Craig's hand. \"It kicked!\", you laughed. He smiled back. \"Do you want to feel?\" you asked, grabbing Craig's hand. Before he'd had a chance to answer, you put his hand on your belly - Bri was a very impulsive person, and her habits had passed on to you.\"Ha, he definitely is! He's really going for it too!\" he replied. Something in that moment felt very...right, to you, which was odd. You weren't meant to be enjoying being Bri, only using it as a means to hang out with her sister. But during your time as her, it had become something more, and your mind had changed to accommodate your new reality. You felt what could only be described as maternal instincts towards your bump - the way you cradled it and held it were the giveaway - and somewhere in the back of your mind, you were starting to wonder if Craig might be good father material. Your old male self caught a hold of you at this point, and dragged you back, just as the bell went to signal the start of the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Craig really got into it - shouting and booing appropriately. The fight was vicious, and Craig was still surprised how much you enjoyed the sport. You kept stealing glances at Craig throughout the night - you couldn't stop yourself. There was no doubt - Bri's body, filled with hormones as it was, fancied Craig very hard indeed. Brooke was right - it had been a while for Bri, and the Bri part of your mind wasn't going to let this opportunity escape. You grabbed his hand, and he looked into your eyes and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the fight went past at a blur. At the end of the fight, as the final bell rang, something unexpected happened...</span></div></div>",

You quickly responded Craig's kiss with more intensity. This moment felt like eternity and you were loving every part of it.

Even though supper was a few hours ago, you're no match for Bri's pregnancy cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be \u2014 strawberry is Brianna's favourite.\" She smirks. \"So... tell me everything about tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the beginning was kind of boring as O'Neil and Mencia spent the first few rounds sizing each other up.\" You explain. \"O'Neil scored a few jabs but he wasn't able to get Mencia against the ropes. Everyone knows you have to change your approach when fighting a southpaw, which Mencia is, so I have to question whether O'Neil was ready to step in the ring tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke raises an eyebrow in annoyance. \"<i>That's</i> not what I'm asking about. Let's talk about you and Craig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuh. You rub the back of your neck, feeling Brianna's hair tickling your shoulders. \"M-me and Craig? He was... he looked fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looked fine?\" Brooke repeated sceptically. \"Come on, John. I could see the magnetism between you two earlier tonight. You may not admit it to me, but deep down Craig is a looker for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I \u2014 I don't know what you mean...\" You lower your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you do. You're blushing!\" She declares, causing you to shrink down in your seat. \"He <i>is</i> a total hottie, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that! And so what if I'm blushing? It's Brianna's stupid hormones.\" You grumble. \"But I do have to admit something weird happened between us. I don't know where the urge came from, but I placed his hand on my belly and it felt really good when he rubbed it. Then I got all these weird thoughts about me and him being together, about what our house would look like and where our children would go to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke looks delighted by your confession. \"Oh. My. God! You have it so hard for Craig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop putting words in my mouth!\" You pout. \"I'm just looking at him through Brianna's eyes. And he is a... a sweet guy, okay? Obviously he likes me so I didn't want to be a bitch and turn down his invitation to see the fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally,\" Brooks nods. \"It <i>was</i> a pretty transparent pickup attempt, don't you think? After all, how convenient that his brother had to leave Las Vegas for some emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be true.\" You shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke waves her hand, \"Anyway, he must be open to hooking up with Brianna despite the pregnancy. If I were him, I'd be checking to see if you had a wedding ring on. When he saw you did not, he must have accepted that he would be dating a single mother-to-be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense to me...\" You look down at your swollen belly, stretching out the silk maternity dress Brooke dressed you in earlier that evening. You still can't believe there's another life inside you, wriggling and kicking about occasionally. You feel full and heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's summarize,\" Brooke counts on her fingers. \"He's reasonably well off if he can drop tickets for marquee boxing matches, he's open to dating a single mother, he's a gentleman, and most importantly he's a tall hunk who would definitely rock Brianna's world!\" She grins salaciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that most important?\" You frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you weren't checking out his junk during the fight! How big is he?\" She opens her palms and spaces them apart, as if she were waiting for you to say 'stop.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff, \"I swear that thought never came into my mind. For all the crap guys get about talking dirty, you girls are so much worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks disappointed. \"Fine! It's not like I care who <i>Brianna</i> dates anyways, I have my own boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, taking another gulp of yoghurt. \"In that case, I think <i>John</i> is super sexy and whenever I see him I want to put my hands all over his hot body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke feigns outrage and folds her arms. \"Shut up, sis! Find a boyfriend your own age.\" She makes a face, sticking out her tongue at you, and giggles, \"I can't believe we're talking about boys like this. It's like I'm really with Brianna right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, in a way...\" You admit, glancing downward. \"Hey, can I ask you a couple of questions about Brianna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not ask her yourself?\" She retorts, then winces. \"Sorry, that was rude. Of course I'll answer to the best of my knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" You begin, \"Why do my nipples feel really sensitive? Not to mention my boobs have started to ache over the past several hours and I don't know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because Brianna is lactating, plus it looks like she's gained a cup size over the past week or two.\" Explains Brooke. \"Didn't you feel that way when you swapped with Erica? It's basic biology, pregnant and post-birth mothers have to deal with it. You don't think babies feed on steak and champagne right out of the womb, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it just feels weird is all.\" You cup your boobs gently. Finding it amazing that they were filling up with milk in anticipation of feeding the life inside of you. \"Question two: How did Brianna get pregnant? What happened to the father of this baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke frowned. \"I haven't actually asked Bri about that, but I've heard bits and pieces from Mom and Dad. Apparently the guy was some kind of deadbeat, with whom she had a one-night stand several months ago. When he learnt she was pregnant he dumped her and disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sucks,\" You grunt. \"So kind of like what happened with Erica and Melody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that happened to Erica too...\" Brooke replies softly, clasping your hand into hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had to look after Melody a few days last week while Erica interviewed for a new job.\" You tell her. \"She's trying to put herself through school while paying rent and raising Melody. I wonder how she manages to do it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke glances down. \"Yeah, that sounds difficult. But at least she has family to look after her just in case. You're a really great guy, did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into each others' eyes, lean in and kiss. It felt amazing finally getting to kiss your crush, up close enough to smell the flowery conditioner in her hair and taste her lips in yours. After a few seconds, you come up for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste like strawberries,\" Brooke remarks, wiping her lips with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanted some of my yoghurt, all you had to do was ask,\" You joke, before hefting yourself up. Resting a hand against your lower back, you run the other hand along your belly and sigh. \"Let's head back up to the room. I wanna get plenty of sleep for tomorrow. I might meet up with Craig again for more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more, sister dear!\" Brooke jibes playfully. \"You'll have to keep me informed about everything when you get back, just like we did here tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's gotta be 5 or 6 times your size.  You try to ask, \"What the hell happened?\" but all that came out of your mouth was a serious of barks and growls.  <i>Oh no way.</i>  You think as Brooke bends down and looks you in they eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that bowl doesn't work with animals.  But just in case...if that's my John in there bark 3 times in a row.\"  You let out 3 barks from what you now knew for sure was a canine mouth.  \"Damn damn damn!  I'm soooooo sorry John!  I was about to get Brianna to tell her about the plan and get her to drink it and I took my eyes off the bowl for one second and Luna just...I'm so sorry!\"  Brooke was even more upset than you were, she seemed to be nearing a mental breakdown.  You took a second to think about it.  Somehow Brooke's pet labradoodle Luna had gotten to the bowl and swapped places with you.  <i>No problem at all.  All I have to do is get a drink and then Brooke brings the bowl to my body to drink and we'll reset this whole thing.</i>  You think as you head over to the bowl but feel crestfallen upon seeing that there was no water in the bowl and the bottle of seemingly unlimited liquid was still in your room.  You give a reassuring yet stern bark to Brooke in order to bring her attention to the bowl in hopes that she'll understand what you want.  She seemed to but said, \"I'm sorry but we're leaving on vacation right now and I don't think I can let me and my dog go visit my boyfriend.  I'm so sorry.\"  You appreciated her apologizing, but it was starting to get on your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a booming voice you recognize as Brooke's father shouts out in the distance.  \"Brooke!  Hurry up and grab Luna so we can head out!  We need to hit the road now before traffic gets bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well fan-freaking-tastic.  I'm a tiny girl dog for the next week.  I guess I at least I get to spend the week with Brooke like I wanted.  Sure as hell didn't picture this week going down like this.  Oh, and to top that off my body has a dog in it.  I'm sure Erica's going to be happy about that.  Man am I going to owe her big after this week.</i>  \"I'm so sorry about this John.\"  Brooke once again says as she picks you up with ease and takes you to the family van where your spring break would commence.  <i>I wonder where we're going?</i>  You think to yourself as Brooke gently put you in her lap for the car trip.</span></div></div>",

Brooke tries to console you but surrounded by her family she is unable to do anything but treat you like a dog. She scratches you behind the ears, which feels nice but does little to raise your spirits. Somewhere out there right now is your body with a dog's mind in it. Goodness knows what it is up to, what damage it could be wreaking on your social life. If people it, they'll think you've flipped your lid, had a mental breakdown. They'll lock you up and throw away the key. You can only hope that Erica can keep things under control for a week and your body out of the public eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car comes to a halt and the engine dies. Brooke rustles your fur energetically. \"Cheer up, Luna, we're here! Can you smell the sea? Come on, you can play on the dunes like you always love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up, she steps out of the car, depositing you on the warm, golden sand. You blink in the bright sunlight. You can smell <i>everything</i>! The saltspray, the seaweed, the gulls, and the plants. The sensations are invigorating. Against your will, you give an excited yip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, Luna! Goood girl! Come on, let's check out the beach house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trot after her as she leads you to the weathered, wooden house that sits right up against the dunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooke! Don't just go wandering off. Help us to unpack first!\" her father calls from the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend sighs. \"Fiiine. Luna, you can go explore by yourself if you want.\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the dunes hold dangers you've never really had to consider before; there could be animals out there bigger than you, maybe other dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next quarter of an hour, Brooke helps in unloading and carrying the suitcases and beach supplies from the car into the house with you tagging along. It's a nice house all considered, bright and airy with maritime paraphernalia all over the walls. Wandering into the kitchen, you find a ragged, faded dog bed, a chipped bowl with the name Luna on it, and a few gnarled chew-toys. You turn your nose up at them. You're sure you'll be sleeping at the foot of Brooke's bed for the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last suitcase is brought in, Brooke's phone begins to ring. She pulls it out of her shorts. \"It's Erica,\" she whispers down to you before answering it. You fret nervously at her feet, able to hear only half of the conversation. You'd informed Erica that you'd be going away for a while, mentally, and that she should expect one of Brooke's family in your body, but obviously you hadn't told her it would be a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Erica it's Brooke... look, there's been some kind of a mix-up... yeah... you guessed that, huh?... don't worry, John's here with me, he's fine...\" Crouching down, she holds the phone out for you. You bark into it. \"...a labradoodle... uh, female...\" Even from your lowly perch, you can hear Erica's laughter through the phone. \"Soooo how's my boyfriends body holding up? You taking good care of it? I don't want any scratches on that bodywork... she did what?!... she did it where?!... why would she- but she's a good girl Put her on for me.\" There is a pause, evidently while your body and Erica's mobile are brought together. \"Luna, you listen to me,\" your girlfriend says sternly down the line. \"You do not poo in the corner. Nor do you poo in your owners shoes. That is a very bad girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me she's crapped in the corner already,\" Brooke's father groans, sticking his head into the hallway. \"Make her do that outside, for goodness sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, daddy,\" Brooke says, shooing him away. She returns to Luna. \"You will be good to your new owner, do you understand me? Oh... y-you do? You can talk?... How many words can you say?... That many, huh? Clever girl! Now promise me you'll be nice to your new owner, Erica. Very good. Listen, my battery is going but I'll call you back later... Love you too, Luna. Bye! Kiss kiss bye kiss kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositively glowing, Brooke hangs up. <i>Luna can talk in my body?</i> That's remarkable and... oddly unsettling. Yet it should be reassuring; it should make people less liable to notice the swap if Luna can at least pull off <i>some</i> human behaviours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke pats you on your head. \"You can relax, your sister's got it under control. She's keeping your body locked up in the house. I think Luna's having a hard time adapting, but she's learning words. She can say 'yes' and 'no' and ' I love you'. Isn't that amazing! And in such a short time too. In a few days we might be able to have a proper conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that, dear?\" Brooke's mother calls from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her baby is talking so soon? That's fantastic news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she'd overheard at least part of the conversation. In a small house like this, the chances of you being able to share a private conversation with your girlfriend are slim. Erica seems to realise that she almost put her foot in it, looking at you and pulling a zipper across her mouth. \"Best we try not to talk to each other too much, okay?\" she whispers.</span></div></div>",

Being \u2018Luna\u2019 has certainly given you a better appreciation for pets.  Your girlfriend Brooke did her best to sneak conversations with you when nobody was around.  Brooke quickly figured out that if she took you for a walk, it was easier to talk with nobody around.  The whole time you were wondering how your sister Erica was managing with Luna walking around in your human body.  Brooke\u2019s cell phone had died the first day.  Because she was hurried out the door when you accidentally turned into Luna, she had forgotten to bring her charger.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of being \u2018Luna,\u2019 you were anxious to get back to your normal human body.  After getting back to the city, Brooke took you back home.  When you walked in, you were surprised to see your sister Erica, and your normal human body watching TV.  Erica said, \u201cWelcome back!\u201d  Then your body stood up and walked up to you with a grin, \u201cWow!  This is really weird to look at my normal dog body with colored vision!  I\u2019m actually pretty cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke nodded and said, \u201cYea, I can see how that would be strange.\u201d  It took Brooke a second to realize how good Luna could talk now as a human.  Brooke looked at Luna and smiled, \u201cWow!  Your talking is amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica laughed, \u201cThe first day was a little rough.  Erica continued as she winked at Luna, \u201cEspecially when you had that \u2018accident\u2019 in the corner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna defended, \u201cCut me some slack!  I\u2019ve been a dog my whole life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica smiled, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding!  But seriously, after a few days of practicing words, Luna did a great job!  We even went out with my family for dinner and nobody knew anything was strange!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke asked Luna, \u201cHmmm\u2026So before you switch back, is there anything you want to say while you can still talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded, \u201cYes!  You need to go back to my old dog food!  The new stuff gives me a stomach ache.\u201d  You realize Luna is right.  You were wondering why you had such a bad stomach ache after every meal.  Luna continued, \u201cAnd if there is any way you could not lock me in the kennel when I\u2019m home alone, that would be great!  I learned a lot this week while I was human.  I promise to never chew on furniture again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke nodded, \u201cDeal!\u201d  Brooke then pet your back and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to change back to normal!  I\u2019m going to give you the biggest kiss ever!  I\u2019m still sorry about you having to spend a week as Luna!\u201d  Brooke tells Luna, \u201cYou two need to swap back.\u201d  Brooke then tells you, \u201cGo with Luna into the bedroom and drink the soul swapping water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Luna into the bedroom to drink the water. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m going to enjoy being human for a little longer.  Maybe at the end of the summer I will switch us back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in horror as Luna walks out of the bedroom.

Stop it!\u201d  Brooke then attaches a leash to your collar and says, \u201cI know its weird to be back in your dog body, but I thought you learned a lot this week?  Don\u2019t forget about what you promised to not chew on things!  I don\u2019t want to have to put you in your kennel all the time ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up stunned at Brooke.

Me and your brother have some catching up to do\u2026If you know what I mean..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica shakes her head with a giggle and takes the leash.

I'm going to miss our conversations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare at your sister knowing she has no clue it's really you still in Luna's dog body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica continues, \"It's too bad you were stuck as my brother though.  Since you are a girl dog, It would have probably been easier for you if you turned into a human girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica then gets a funny look in her eye and says, \"Hmmm.  Now that I think about it...We could swap places sometime so you can try be a human girl.  That way, I could understand better all those stories you told me this week about being a dog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica shrugged her shoulders, \"If you are interested, nod your head.  We could even swap now for a few days if you want!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't beleive you sister wants to swap bodies.  She of course thinks that Luna is really Luna.  As much as you don't want to be in your sister's body, it would give you a chance to be human again to fix this mess.  You decide to........</span></div></div>",

You will find out clothes are much tighter than the boys clothes you wore as my brother.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica then takes her shirt off and cringe seeing your sister almost naked. You realize once you drink the soul swapping water you will be her, but its still weird to see her like that.  Erica  takes her bra on and off explaining how they work. She still thinks you are really Luna.  Erica then goes through her dresser drawer showing you where she keeps all her clothes.  Next, she covered makeup.  She said, \u201cThe only thing you have to really worry about is never leaving the house without eyeliner on.  I\u2019ll show you how to put in on!\u201d  You painfully watch Erica give you a lesson on makeup.  All you can do is sit and nod Luna\u2019s head while she explains lipstick and eyeshadow.

It\u2019s at her lake house and should be really fun!  I have a new red bikini in my panty drawer that looks great.  The top goes on just like a bra.  Just try to fit in with everybody.

First off you could swap with Erica.  She already knows about the bowl so we don't have to explain anything.  Erica would get a week off of Melody watch.  Plus we'd be together practically 24/7.  But on the downside we couldn't really do much as we'd have to be on Melody watch the entire time, and without getting paid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't sound too bad, but who else did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I was thinking my buddy Bruce from school.  I know that he's staying home for the week too and won't have anything to do except hang out all week.  The only real downside I can think of is that, well, he's a guy and I don't know how you'd feel about him in your body and you in his.  On top of that I'd have to explain the whole bowl thing to him, and while I trust him, well you just never know.  I don't exactly want the whole town in on the secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, can I try something before I make a decision?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, take all the time you nee<b>mph</b>!\"  Just as you're responding, Brooke in your body practically jumps you with a big kiss.  Your first instinct is to push her away, you were being kissed by a guy's mouth and tongue after all, and your own to boot.  But then you remember that behind the male kiss is still your girlfriend so you return the kiss.

She was just putting on the laundry on the rack when you came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Brooke, too bad you have to leave right? Now my little brother is all alone with little old me.\" Erica teases you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we think about changing that, but it all depends on you.\" Brooks answers, she explains the whole idea to Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to switch places with me? I don't mind but there's one little thing. And that's for girls only.\" They shoo you away. You wonder what they're talking about, when you look back you see them laughing a bit about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're ready!\" Erica shouts.

Even with this?\" She grabs you and kisses you full on the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused and don't know what to do as she kisses you the same way Brooks does. Brooks looks a bit confused as well, but has to smile about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erica lets go, she shines as she looks at you. \"You are a great kisser, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to react to that when you hear a car horns.

And make sure you diaper Melody well.\" She whispers the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a peck on the cheek and leaves for the car.

It was one of the weirdest things to see your older, more matured sister lying against you like a young high school girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was even weirder. Brooks not used to cook made a disaster of the kitchen trying to cook. Luckily while with Erica you had to cook yourself since she would be late sometimes. So it wasn't that hard to whip something up nice and fast. While you fed Melody Brooks was enjoying her meal with just her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't sure I should feed you?\" You asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me.\" She told you opening her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to kiss her when you realized it's still your sister's body. It would be considered incest to kiss her like that. Brooks noticed the look in your face. \"Oh yeah, I don't exactly look the part sorry.\" She said with a sorry smile. You felt sorry for her, even though you were together she was still looking like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that uncomfortable moment you washed the dishes while Brooks took Melody to bed. You were wondering if Melody noticed the difference, if she did she didn't show it. She still giggled when Brooks pulled a face or would ask her questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now you are lying on the couch with Brooks against you. She notices your hesitation of holding her tightly like you used to. Then she makes a decision as she stands up from the sofa. \"Be back in a second.\" She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what she would do?</span></div></div>",

She suddenly makes a jump on you like a cat. Problem was that Brooks was lighter than Erica so when she landed on you, the air was squeezed right out of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" She asks you. \"Well I shouldn't say ask something as this feels fine enough.\" She suddenly undoes the waistband of your boxers and reveals your manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to object when she suddenly looks stern at you: \"Look John, I'm in the body of a 24 year old woman who's with has a little girl and probably didn't get loaded for sometime, so give me a break.\" Your objections are faltering, as you don't know what to say. Brooks removes the mask and looks down at your manhood which has shrunk some bit due to Brooks speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a notice, you suddenly feel your manhood inside Brooks mouth. Her hot tongue suddenly surrounds it, teasing it around. You have to admit it is good, if you weren't looking you would say Brooks was doing you now. But seeing your sister doing it, made it less erotic. So in order to keep Brooks happy and who knows what would happened if she wouldn't, you close your eyes and visualizing Brooks doing it. It seems to work as you feel yourself getting longer already. Brooks is now even teasing your balls, which makes it unbearable to stay like this. You can't hold it out any longer. \"I think I'm going to blow.\" You tell Brooks. She just nods and continues sucking you. \"I need to take it out Brooks.\" You tell her as you move back. But to your surprise Brooks keeps going on, she goes even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, Brooks I'm going to cum now.\" You can't hold it out any longer and blow your load. To your amazement Brooks sucks it all up, to the last drop. When she let go, she has a very erotic expression on her face which made you almost hard again. \"That was amazing, I never would have guessed it would taste that good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooks why did you do that? You're inside Erica's body. Have some respect.\" You're a bit mad at Brooks for doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have respect for your sister, her body likes the taste of it, so she didn't mind. And besides I always wanted to try that, and why not now?\" She asks a bit seductive. \"And look what I've got here.\" Brooks pulls up her skirt and points to her lower parts. To your surprise she was all wet down there, her panties had a very large stain in them and it was dripping on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I need someone to help me, since I'm this wet.\" She slowly removes her panties  and opens her legs. There was her womanhood, open for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's my sister, we can't do that.\" You argue a bit hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, this isn't your sister, this is your sister's body, it's me Brooks inside. And if you think that was just it.\" Brooks removes her top, revealing her bare breasts, D-cups, her pointy nipples staring at you. You hadn't seen such large ones ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much you could do, you were a bit curious yourself. And there was a sliver of truth in what Brooks told you, it was her you would be doing, not Erica. It wouldn't be incest at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly move closer inch by inch towards Brooks. She smiles victoriously, she knows she has you now where she wants you. You're almost there, when something happened.</span></div></div>",

The only thought in your head is that Brooks just look like your sister but it's really her inside. The thought somehow makes you feel more bolder. It's not long before you are kissing Brooks on her mouth. She is surprised as well, her eyes almost popping out. But she doesn't let the surprise take her as she moves her tongue inside your mouth.

They were kissing each other, both of them playing with each other's breasts knowing the other's weak spots. At the same time all three came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Erica and Brooks pulled away from you and  began making out with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really a turn on, seeing my body worming like that.\" Erica said while she kissed her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Brooks began to moan again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were ready for one final shot, and you pushed it inside of Erica. Erica looked a bit in pain as she felt herself being penetrated for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the punishment.\" Brooks said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there are more of those, I don't mind getting them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt how tight Brooks body was, even tighter than Erica. You then pulled out and pushed it inside Brooks again. The familiar tightness comforting you. You began to do both girls at the same time. Both girls enjoyed it and so did you. And at the same time all three came again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell down backwards too tired to do anything. Erica and Brooks lied down besides you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is how our live is going to be from now on, I can't wait for it.\" Brooks told the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, this is better than just normal sex.\" Erica agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then looked at you at the same time. \"We love you.\" </span></div></div>",

In the weeks after Erica and Brooks still double team you, but everyone stayed inside their own bodies. Brooks really has improved, and it's tie between her and Erica who can make you cum first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool has started again and so it's time to hit the books. Between studying, hanging around with your friends and watching Melody, you barely have time for sex. Erica has started to work more hours since you are at home, and so you barely see her some days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst part is that Brooks parents haven't agreed to let Brooks move with you. A few times Erica offered, but they haven't agreed to it yet. You figure since Briana is almost ready to give birth and she's staying with Brooks parents, Brooks is the perfect babysitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Friday dinner time when you and Erica are eating Brussels sprouts and Melody her baby food. \"If you think harder, that sprout will explode.\" Erica jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I don't think Melody would mind, would you?\" Melody giggles as you tickle her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's up? Still thinking about Brooks huh?\" Erica asks concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. \"Yeah, I had it all perfectly in my head. You know the four of us living here. Really nice, but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Brooks parents are against it, I can understand it.\" You raise your eyebrow a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right, you want to be together with your lover, but look at it from their side. You expect their youngest daughter to move into a house of a boy they barely know.\" Erica holds up her hand. \"I know, you wouldn't harm her or do anything , but I can understand them. Look at how Brianna turned out. She had a nice boyfriend too, now he has dumped her for some other chick just because she ended up pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that. You know me Erica.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you John, but they don't know you as well as me and Brooks know.\" Erica her eyes brighten up. \"Perhaps that's the angle you should go for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go what for?\" You ask raising your eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the problem is that Brooks parents don't trust you. In that case you should make them trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have that swap bowl, right?\" You nod. You put it underneath your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you use that to impress them?\" Erica suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might not be a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could do something different. You think Brooks parents want to keep her with them as some cheap babysitter right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will need to get Brianna hooked up. Look if Brianna was living together , then she wouldn't be in need of her sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could work too.\" You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go for..</span></div></div>",

So I thought we'd try something that might make you feel a little more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying the bowl you know what Brooke must be implying, but you couldn't quite grasp Brooke's logic.  \"So, let me get this straight, because I'm not comfortable being cozy with my sister's body, you think I'll be more comfortable being <i>inside</i> her body while being with you in my body.  Am I getting this right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\"  Brooke said, she seemed to be quite satisfied with her odd little plan.

I was putting you in an uncomfortable position yesterday by being affectionate to you in your sister's body.  I'm sorry about that.  But you were also being unfair to me.  I put aside my family vacation to be with you and you don't even seem to want to be in the same room as me.

I thought I'd put us in a situation where there could be absolutely no sexual tension between us whatsoever and we could just hang out, more like friends than boyfriend and girlfriend.  And what could be less sexual than a mother her baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a really really really weird logic, but you could kind of see where she was going with it, although you never would have thought of this solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry about Melody your body, I've got it sedated with sleeping pills and I'll check in on it every hour.  So what do you say we have some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a second and while you weren't wild about the plan, anything was better than the awkwardness that was yesterday so deciding you might as well embrace the weirdness you nod your head and give Brooke a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

Suddenly a cellphone goes off, it's Brooks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go pick that up mate.\" You tell Bruce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well geez sorry for having this phone around for just five minutes.\"  Bruce mumbles as he accepts the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Bruuuooks here.\" Bruce tells. \"Oh hi mom, well I'm just over at one of John's best friends. We're going now?\" He looks at you a bit scared. \"Yeah I'll be over soon.\" He tells Brooks mother as he hangs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your mother, I or you am leaving in  ten minutes.\" He tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, well enjoy the trip.\" Brooks says getting exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could tell me more about myself?\" Bruce asks Brooks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't, I'm kind of in the middle of something here.\" Brooks points down at her crotch again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you could talk me into it John.\" Bruce says fluttering his eyelashes. You're feeling hot seeing as this is how Brooks always persuade's you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John could you perhaps stay here, and help me deal with this?\" Brooks asks you giving you a wink. It's less attractive seeing Bruce doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help both of them, so in the end you decide to help...</span></div></div>",

But then you realized it was YOUR male body standing at the door.  Melody must have awoken from the drugs earlier than planned!  Even more shocking, were the words that you heard come out of your male body, \u201cOMG!  You were right Mommy!  I\u2019m totally adorable!  It\u2019s so strange to see myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica quickly corrected your male body, \u201cRemember honey\u2026You can\u2019t call me Mommy when you are in his body..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are even more confused after hearing what Erica said.  Erica then looked at you and said, \u201cI know this seems weird, so I better explain. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour male body picks you up and begins to coddle you.  Erica continues, \u201cIt turns out that the soul swapping bowl is more powerful than I thought.  It only took Melody a few hours in your older male body to develop speech and understanding.  She can talk and communicate at the normal level of any other guy your age.   While your sister was babysitting you, it gave me and Melody a chance to talk and really get to know one another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour male body gives a smile, \u201cYep!  It\u2019s really me in here.  It\u2019s so cool to be able to talk. I was able to tell Mom what kind of food I like and why I\u2019ve been crying so much lately.  As you probably can feel, I\u2019ve had some sore teeth lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrate on your mouth and realize Melody is right.  There is a slight pain coming from your gums.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica laughs and adds, \u201cThis also gave me a chance to let her know to stop being so fussy when I\u2019m getting her dressed.\u201d  Erica then thinks for a moment and says, \u201cHmmm\u2026We have another opportunity here to show Melody how frustrating changing a diaper can be..\u201d  Erica tells you, \u201cCan you do me a favor and struggle and kick while I try to change your diaper?  That way Melody can see how difficult being a Mom can be sometimes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, Erica has you on your back and pulls your tights off.  You get into the act and start kicking and fussing.  Erica tells Melody with a giggle, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a try at changing this one.  That way you will understand better!\u201d  You watch your male body attempt to change your diaper as you kick and fuss even more.  Melody is quickly frustrated but finally gets the job done.  You give her even more of a hard time as she tries pulling your tights back on.  Everybody gets a good laugh at seeing Melody change her own body\u2019s diaper.  Melody sighs after the experience, \u201cOk Ok!   I promise I won\u2019t ever be so fussy when we swap back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica then looks at you and says, \u201cThanks for being such a good sport about this.  I suppose it\u2019s time to use the soul swapping bowl and return you two to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are relieved hearing you will soon be back to normal.  Erica gets the soul swapping bowl and sets it on the ground.  She gives your male body a hug and says, \u201cIt was wonderful getting to know you sweetie.  Maybe I can talk one of my friends into swapping with you later so we can hang out again as adults.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You take a sip and wait for Melody to take a sip.  To your surprise, Melody stops before the bowl gets to her lips.  She makes sure Erica is busy in the other room and whispers, \u201cSorry..But I\u2019m not ready to get back into diapers.  After being an adult for the past few days and learning a bunch, I don\u2019t want to be a helpless kid again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shocked that Melody isn\u2019t going to go through with the swap.  If she keeps you as her infant body, there is no way you can tell Erica what really happened.  Melody then gets another idea as she sees their cat Fluffy walking by.  Melody puts the bowl in front of Fluffy for a drink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything goes black for a moment and you finally get your senses back.  Instead of being in Melody\u2019s infant body, you suddenly realize you have turned into Fluffy.  From your normal male body, Melody pets your back, \u201cSorry about this.  But having Fluffy in my body will be about the same mental acuity as an infant.  I can\u2019t risk you trying to communicate with Erica and tell her what I did.  Don\u2019t worry.  I wont keep you as Fluffy forever.  I\u2019m not sure how long I want to stay in your body quite yet.  But I\u2019m definitely not going back to diapers for awhile. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try pawing at her in disgust as she swats you.  \u201cAnymore of that and I will make sure you get a visit to the veterinarian get rid of these claws.  I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to spend a week in a kennel at the vet\u2019s office do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head no as Melody smiles.  \u201cOk.  Now be a good kitty and go play.  Anymore acting up and I won\u2019t even consider changing you back to normal\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in amazement as Melody picks up her former infant body and approaches Erica, \u201cWere done using the soul swapping bowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica smiles, \u201cSorry about making you try on all those dresses.  But I\u2019m glad to have my brother back!\u201d  Erica has no idea Melody is still in your male body.  Erica takes who she thinks is Melody in her arms and sees a look of confusion on her face.  Erica comforts her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry sweetie.  It might take a while to get used to being an infant again.\u201d  Erica has no idea it is really Fluffy in Melody\u2019s body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou purr to yourself wondering how to get out of this mess.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just really, really hope he doesn't get rid of the bowl beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you have far too much time to worry about how this could end. If you can't get the bowl back, you'll have to spend your life working Erica's crappy job and raising her kid, and she'll be stuck as the aging, much-loathed Mr. Finster.

It would be the perfect timing to let them drink from the bowl and swap with them. And since no better time is than the present you two decide to go this afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make plans for how to handle things, to whose account the money will be transferred to and how you will keep your bodies safe. In the end you two can't come up with a way to take the bodies of bank workers you two yourselves. Not without the risk of your old bodies leaping into trouble. You two will need to have an accomplice to perform the job. Your first suggestion is your buddy Sam, he's also low on cash and wouldn't mind pulling a heist. Erica however doesn't agree on having Sam, an outsider would have the risk telling it to others. The secret of the bowl must be kept safe. She suggests Carmen for the part. Carmen wouldn't want it, but the extra cash would be tempting to her. You aren't sure of it, with her being the sister you had the most arguments with, and you lay down one of your other plans. You two could do the job yourselves.

When you are done, Erica quickly goes home to look after Melody while you try to get some sleep before the big day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day is just like any other day of your holiday. Nothing to do and getting out of bed late. Except  for today you. You grab your bag pack and put the bowl in it. You take a bottle of water with you to fill the bowl up with.

Hopefully it will be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meet at the coffee shop early, you see Erica sitting there already. It wasn't busy, a few people were in there. You go inside and take a seat next to Erica.  Erica tells you she has dropped Melody at her babysitter. You nod and pull up your backpack to reveal the bowl. Erica has to smile when seeing the bowl and tells you she has to go to the bathroom.

She follows you into one of the stalls and takes out a length of rope from your backpack. You sit down while she ties together your wrists and ankles, and ties your body and legs to the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me the plan again, sis?\" You ask, trying to struggle out of the restraints once Erica finishes with each section. Quietly and, again, ensuring nobody else is in the washroom, she begins:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so... When I swap you into one of the banker's bodies, I'm giving you one hour to get to the bank, send a wire from my company's accounts, and make off with as much cash and monetary instruments as you can. You know -- cashier's checks, traveler's checks, money orders, and so on. You brought the other items we need, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Included in your backpack is a black garbage bag, a scrap of paper with the account numbers and routing number of the business she works at, and a Metro card. You're thankful that Erica used to work at a bank in high school; she seems to know a lot about this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I sending the money electronically from your company's account? Why not straight from the bank?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's much safer if there's no paper trail leading directly to us.\" Explains Erica. \"My company regularly makes deposits and withdrawals in millions at the bank. It also has a line of credit with the bank. Just tap into that line of credit, disburse the money through a dummy account I have already created in the Cayman Islands, and it will transfer from there into my actual deposit account here at home. The process is automatic once you send the international wire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we really get all this done in an hour? We could get into a lot of trouble if we get caught, sis.\" You mumble quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who wanted to swap!\" She replies tersely, then continues. \"Once you have the cash and leave the bank, take the metro to get back to our house and toss the bag over the fence. Then get back on the metro and get as far away as you can. Change lines too... if you have enough time. That way, when I swap you back, the banker will have no idea where you went or what you did. The metro card will have a record of where you stopped at, which is why you need to destroy it when you get back on. You understand everything you need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, no more talking.\" Whispers Erica, pouring some of the water into the golden bowl and giving you a drink. Then, she tears off a chunk of duct tape and presses it over your mouth tightly. You know it's going to hurt like hell to tear it off again, but it was a small price to pay for a successful heist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looks you over once more to ensure you're tied down. She puts the water bottle and golden bowl back into the backpack and zips it up. Another man comes into the washroom and uses the urinal, so she has to wait silently for him to finish and leave before she leaves as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes pass while you silently wonder where your sister is and who she might find to swap with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realize the first (and hopefully ONLY) crack in the plan. The stall door can only be locked from the inside... but with you tied up like this, you can't slide the lock! <i>Fuck</i>! You breathe heavily through your nose. The door is closed, but if anyone barges in on you besides Erica, things could get complicated. <i>Hopefully it won't take her long to find a suitab</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, drink it already!!!\" A familiar voice mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmffff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself choking and spluttering on liquid running down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone's hand is on your neck, pressing you against a hard counter top. You feel smaller and weaker. Long, brown hair is splayed over your eyes and face. Besides the contents of the golden bowl emptying itself into your mouth, you see bright, white linoleum lighting above. You feel yourself tottering unsteadily on heels and it's all you can do to stop from falling over, buttressed as you were against the counter top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision clears and Erica takes the bowl away from your face. Eyeing you curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? Is that you in there?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough again and wipe your mouth. Brushing strands of hair out of your face, you notice Erica standing opposite you in what looks like the women's washroom. She's taller than you now. She looks a little flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" You say, hearing a lilting, sugary voice coming out of your mouth. Erica's complexion changes to one of relief. She sighs, \"Whew. That woman really put up a fight. Good thing it worked. Why don't you take a look at yourself, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and are greeted by two ENORMOUS breasts ballooning out of YOUR chest. They are even bigger than Erica's, and constrained by a revealing white blouse. The woman whose body you possessed is also wearing a white suit jacket with gray pinstripes; a darker gray pencil skirt, 4-inch patent pumps, and (you could feel) a tiny thong stretched tight over your new luscious ass. A badge on her jacket reads <i>Laura -- Teller</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is her pendulous boobs that draw your attention first and foremost. Grabbing the melon-sized orbs and feeling the bra cups supporting them on your chest. Feeling the sensitive nubs of her nipples as you circle your new, petite hands over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way these are natural...\" You mumble in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time to find out!\" Erica says. She gives you the account information scrawled on paper, the Metro card, and garbage bag from the backpack, which you place in her purse lying on the washroom sink counter top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when you see yourself in the mirror for the first time. In the body of a complete bombshell. A Latina in her late 20s by the looks of it. A vixen with the God-given (or surgeon-given) power to pop boners in any man she passes by. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/gSihOfN.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/gSihOfN.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Laura Delgado. I recognize her as one of the tellers at the bank right next to this coffee shop.\" Mentions Erica. You inform her that the stall door leading back to your old body is unlocked, which she agrees is a risk worth keeping tabs on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pours you one more drink from the golden bowl before placing it into the backpack. As you drink, she adds, \"Remember bro: One hour. Don't call me or try to contact me in any way until then, or else it will look suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that!\" You nod, mincing out of the washroom first. Needing to hold onto the walls occasionally to avoid falling over! <i>Damn, how do women walk in heels these big??</i> You think to yourself... even though you do appreciate the extra few inches in height they give your new, smaller frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
