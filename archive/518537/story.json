She finishes and walks out of Casian's grandmother's estate waiting for her other two friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake is in the kitchen sampling some of Gram's mouth-watering double chocolate caramel cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasian is in the sitting room chatting with her Gram(who she lives with because her parents died in a car crash when she was three.)\"Well I better tear Jake away from your cookies or we'll never get to the mall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright darling have fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Casian! Jacob! Ryan say he will leave if you don't get out here!\" Leiah shouts from the bottom of the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasian and Jake come out and go down the steps. Meeting Leiah on their way down, they all get into Ryan's car (Jake and Leiah in the back and Casian sitting shotgun)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what too you guys so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan can you be anymore impatient?\" Casian asked buckling her seat belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways last night was really fun, even though it couldn't be a real sleepover because of these two guys.\" Leiah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I wonder why your Gram wouldn't let us all sleep on the livingroom floor together Cas.\" Jake joked. We all laughed, and Ryan hit the gas speeding off towards the Santa Monica westbound freeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready malls! Cuz' my credit cards are ready for anything!\" Leiah yelled out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was exiting the freeway to get to all of the major shopping centers in Los Angeles when suddenly things went pitch black........ <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More like a whole forest!\" Ryan exclaimed. \"Look through the windshield.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ryan was right.... stuck in the middle of a forest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay there are no forests in Hollywood or Beverly Hills!!! So where are we?!\" Leiah wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should all get out and check to see if we can figure out where exactly we are and what we can do about it.\" Casian says getting out of the smashed Beemer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good Cas.\" Jake agrees with her as he climbs out of the backseat. Ryan and Leiah both exit the car wordlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence lasts for minutes, but it seems like hours. When Ryan pipes up and says\" So are just gonna stand here or are we going to grab whatever we can carry and explore a little? Casian you usually know what to do so should be leave or go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should probably check for signs of life. you know get a lay of the land.\" She says thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You scared the crap outta Leiah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NO DUDE INSOLENT ONE!\" The voice belongs to a older man who sustains a very youthful aire about him. They all could tell he was not happy at you... \"I am Maltir the Wise, Seer of all things great, small, past, future, or present! No one has EVER spoken to me in such a tone, but because you four have the power to mold my beloved Esylla's future I shall let it pass. THIS ONE TIME ONLY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Maltir the Wise, what exactly do you mean 'powers' and 'shaping the future of Esylla' (did you call it)? It doesn't make sense with all due respect, sir.\" Casian timidly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face softens and he smiles looking at Casian in the eyes \"My dear intelligent studius wonderfully complicated Casian. You always ask the right questions and for that you have been granted the power of the Mystic. Leiah awaken!\" With those words she slowly wakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You my charming sophisticated one you are given the power of the Healer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan strong, swift, steady, and sure!

It was an incredible sense of freedom. You did not know if the others were feeling this freedom, but you were so caught up in the euphoria of it all that it didn't matter. The voice reaches your mind again, \"If you ever need me, I shall be here. All you need know is that the pendent is key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and notice  that each of you has different clothes on resembling what you would think of as hunting attire-Tunics, pants, boots, for you and Ryan. A dress, short cloak, and slippers for Leiah knee high boots. A mini-dress thigh high boots and a floor length cloak for Casian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso each is equipped with a weapon. Ryan has a broad sword at his hips.  You have a pair of daggars at your hips and a javalin.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You also notice five incredible purebred horses(you know this because of your equstrian nature, knowing purebreds carry themselves differently)  only a few dozen yards away. You immediatly fell in love with the Friesian, a very rare pitch black horse (origionating from the Netherlands.) You walked over to it and it nuzzeled against your chest. It seems as if the Friesian stallion, that you named Baron, wanted to be yours. Leiah claimed the Andalusian for her own, that breed being know for its noble, almost regal, Spaniah heritage, naming her Majesty. Casian made her way to the Golden American Saddleback, a bold and intelligent breed, coat the color of an untarnished gold coin, mane and tail that of creame, and a white marking on her forehead. She promtly named her Starburst, its namesake being that the white marking on its forehead resenbled that of a star. Ryan was usually timid with horses because he had been bucked off as a small child, but nonetheless he promtly found his way to the Salle Francais this breed that was known for being the epitome of the sporting horse: athletic stong and swift. Normally midnight black colored with hints of brown along the back, flanks, and legs this magnificent horse was no exception though it had a white diamond between its eyes. Ryan named him Chavallier (for Maurice Chavallier a french actor renouned for being the epitome of the french gentleman.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of you had chosen a horse for your own, but you realized that there was one more horse left unclaimed and on its back were traveling packs. You knew what type of horse this fine animal was at once, an Ardennais(yep french again guys.) You remember reading about this perticular breed it was Napolean's favorite breed due to it's incredible endurance. Chesnut brown coat and black mane and tail. Size much like that of a Clydesdale except it was quicker and bred for mountain life. Ryan noticed that Chavallier and this Ardennais were like best friends though Chavallier was acted as mentor to him. Ryan announced. \"I think that since these two are both friends, and the fact that that named my horse after Maurice Chavallier the most gentile man on the planet, my hero, this horse's name should be Grant, Cary Grant. The second most genitle man on the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hello Ryan this horse is not an american breed so you obviously cannot give him an american name! He is a french horse deserving of a french name. And besides the second most gentile man is not Cary Grant it's Louis Jordan.\" (sidenote- Maurice Chavallier was Jordan's Uncle in Gigi and Loius Jordan is the french actor who co-starred with Leslie Coron in Gigi, the best movie ever!) Leiah corrected him. \"Wouldn't that be cute Jordan and Chavallier, they were both in Gigi. The two most debonaire men ever know to grace a woman with their presence.\" With that she sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leiah you have a point these two are obviously French breeds and Jordan would fit this one perfectly.\"Casian agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled.\" You said. \"It shall be Her Majesty, Baron, Starburst, Chavallier, and Jordan. Our faithful companions!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\nYou guys realize by know, my love for horses right? lol.... back to the story........<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two paths one into the mountains eastward, and one going into what seems to be a another forest to the north.(south and west is the forest you started in)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSidenote: If you go into the forest, you will have to give up these horses, and it will be harder to travel without them and without Jordan's back to carry all your stuff. If you go into the mountain it will probably get colder, but the traveling will be much easier.  (Hint Hint: You want to go into the mountains...) </span></div></div>",

Including four leather backpacks that were attached to each of the claimed horses, a few changes of clothes, and in your left saddlebag you found what looked like pure gold pieces weighing quite a bit. You believed that each horse had a matching satchel of gold pieces. Jordan had supplies strapped to his back. You had felt a certain distain towards that magician when you first met him, but now you were eternally gratefull and thankful that he had taken an interest in you and your three closest friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already feel a special bond to Baron. It seems like he can read your thoughts. You mount him and ride over to where Ryan, Leiah, and Casian were. Noticing that they were ready, mounted and each looking a bit more confidant, though Casian could not figure out where to put her deadly looking staff. Leiah always being the perfectionist and noticing the details, pointed out a small button near the red crystal. Casian pushed it and the blade retracted and the staff seemed to shrink. It stopped shrinking at, what you would assume was, sceptre size. You got their attentin and asked the all important question.  \"So now that we're out of that stupid forest, do you guys want to go into another one or into the mountains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mountains.\" Ryan quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I'm going into another gross forest!\" Leiah announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majority rules.\" Casian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was settled you would set off eastward into the the mountains looming in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is: will you set off promptly while there are still a few hours of daylight left and plan on the way? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr wait until morning and plan your path tonight, and do some powers training (or trying out whichever you perfer?)   </span></div></div>",

The going is easy, but after a few hours of planning, thinking and riding, your  mind, mouth, and butt are ready for a rest. It seems you've been riding for countless hours, though the sun is just now starting to set behind you. At least you know the sun rises and sets the same on this planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan has been made: the group will work it's way into the mountains, until someone who can help is found, riding when it is coolest(for your sake and the horses), and eating as little as possible, not knowing how long the food strapped to Jordan's back will last. You stop when the moon(that you noticed was not the grey white color of home, but rather white with a blue hue about it) begins to make its climb towards the heavens.  You and Leiah set about getting a dinner ready, while Ryan sets up \"camp\", and Casian tends to the horses. The horses seem unwilling to be tethered so he lets the roam free a bit, then they decide that they want to sleep with the four of you. They make a loose circle (each closest to it's master except Jordan who slept nearer to Chevallier) about the camp, acting as if they were your guardian angels. You eat a dinner consisting of meat pasties, some fruit, and a clear cool sweet tasting drink, that you named Ambrosia because it was what you would think ambrosia would be like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are getting ready to sleep, when you decide to look in your Maltir provided backpack. You notice a cloth inside. You promptly open it and lie it on the ground beside you, then four pillows, four fleece blankets, and five horse blankets appear within its' borders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..?\" Ryan says looking at the space beside you. You shrug and then look at the edge of the cloth a note is attacted it reads: My last gift, it will sometimes give you what your heart desires, but it will always give you what you need. You read the note outloud. Your friends are speechless, but you disperse the pillows and blankets and cover each horse with a blanket that has his/her name engraved upon it.

However before you realize it, you are back to normal, \"Now that was cool!\" You say.<br>\r\n        \"Yhea, real nice dude, you turn into a dragon, put out the fire nearly trample us to death. Real 'cool'\" say Ryan mockingly. <br>\r\n        \"Stop it\" Leiah says before you two can get into a fight, \"We have bigger worries, look at the fire.\" You look down to see that the wood is burning incredibly fast and that the blue flames that came out of your mouth were flickering. <br>\r\n       \"Uhh... guys maybe we should\" At that exact moment the fire goes out and a piercing cry radiates through the forest. The only thing you could think of when you heard this was a raven that has survived for centuries just to feast on the dead rotting carcasses of the light. You don't know why you had this thought but you knew before the flame appeared in Leiah's hand that the creature was perched on the tree directly above you, it's black souless eyes staring at you, unaffected by the darkness that holding to you. And when the flame did appear you did not notice the shouts or the person clinging on to you but you saw it's eye's first and you saw it's beak joining with the head of a human, and you knew that before this quest even started you could all die here.<br>\r\n        \"Foolish children\" It said with perfect clarity but in a rasping cracking voice. Ryan was gripping the hilt of his sword with white knuckles but was too terrified to move. And your horror rose as the creature stood. The body was that of a grown man, bare chested and lean strong and taunt.  But its head was that of a raven, its black and mangled feathers continued down it's shoulders and down the back to form in to a pair of giant wings that it folded around it's body like a robe. \"The magician has blessed me by sending me such lovely play-things.\" He cackled mad laughter in that same shriek. You could now only think two words 'fallen angel'. <br>\r\n         He leapt from the thirty foot high branch and effortlessly and landed in front of your group. He look at each of your faces inquisitively and when he came to you you couldn't help but look away, it was those eyes, those black, animal's, eyes! And he would not stop staring, and to look into those eyes you knew what it was to die. At last Leiah stammered \"Wh-what are you?\"<br>\r\n         The feathers raised, you could sense that he was waiting for you to ask this question. What seemed to be a hundred voices spoke at once as his eyes turned red and this sentence chilled you to the bones more than any other, because it wasn't a trick, but it was voice<u>s</u> and they spoke from many miles. \"I am a small part of Legion and I work for he who goes to and fro' from earth, he who is belittled and by that he wins because he will not belittle himself with killing, he who was in the desert-\" You felt like arms were reaching from the groung and grabbing at you, hurting you \"And tempted He Who Never Was for thirty days.\" This fear was growing, you couldn't move, you couldn't fight it, you were fading, fading...fad- <br>\r\n\"STOP IT!\" Casian shrieks! \"Please stop it!\" Whatever trance this thing had you in was now broken and you could finnaly move but the fear remained. And your legs wanted to carry you into the forest. Stay- fight-your friends might need you, or find whatever saftey there might be in the forest. Yourself or them. Because you couldn't help it, when it's eyes turned red you forgot what it was like to die, but gained the knowledge of what it was like to go to hell.<br>\r\nAll this happened in less than a minute though it seemed a century.</span></div></div>",

I can't...</i> And you turn and did one of the hardest things in your life, stare at that creature, that horrid creature. <i>No </i> , you think, <i>That damned creature.</i>  <br>\r\n   Casian was the first to act and simultaneously lifted here arm palm facing the creature and yells \"Fire!\" The small flame in here hand earlier did not compare, this was a flaming mass easily half the size of you. You think this could be over before it starts. The creature however  was not phased, but rather the moment the fire was seven feet from him he flapped his wings once so fast that you could barley see them, and cry's \"Kee-en-ti-ti!\" Like a raven in that half growl half shrike. <br>\r\n   Before you knew what was happening Casian was on the ground shrieking (<i>like a raven</i> you couldn't help but think) with a giant black burn covering her entire chest and by the time you turned around Ryan was confronting the beast his double edged sword drawn. <i> This is happening too fast, what's going on!?!</i><br>\r\n   \"What did you do to her!\" The creature cawed laughter. <br>\r\n   \"I simply gave an example,\" His laughter tapered down as he slowly spread his wings to their full and imposing length of seven feet while opening his hands to reveal five inch talons where there should have been nails,\"an example as to the beginning of a long and painful death that each one of you will experience.\" This was the signal that started the fiercest one-on-one battle you had ever seen in your life. <br>\r\n   Ryan swung his sword sideways sideways so fast you could hear the air being cut, and the creature grabbed it in one of it's taloned hands. Ryan held on to the sword with one hand while turning forward and high kicking. The creature flapped his wings once to propel him back and dodge the blow. \"If I had not know your origins, I would have thought you were an elf by the way you fight.\" It snapped his beak \"A young and inexperienced elf.\" It once again used his wings, only this time to propel him forward with the speed of a bullet. Ryan rolled onto his back and when the Creature was directly above him he kicked both legs straight up catching the thing directly in the chest, but as the creature is sent flying into the air it sunk it's talons into Ryan's shoulders and takes him with him. You see the creatures black eyes and realize that it was enjoying itself. He then threw Ryan through the air as he took flight. Ryan landed square on his back. You thought surely he was dead, no one could survive a fall that intense, you had let him die but really you doubted the wizard's abilities. He stood back up and pointed his sword at the creature. This little feat served to bring you back to reality.<br>\r\n   <i>What am I doing?</i> You look and see Leiah putting her hands on Casian trying to heal her, and you see Ryan risking his life <i> and I'm just watching.</i> You know that if you confront the creature head on you will be killed, even Ryan with his enhanced abilities was losing. You have to think what can you do or change into to save them. You think of two ideas, the wizard said if you ever need his help simply use the pendant, but he never said how, or you could possible turn into one of these bird creatures and try trick the beast. But how would you do that either!?!</span></div></div>",

You can almost taste his anticipation for the road...and maybe even a battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that everyone is up you look to the crude map that was in the possesion of the dog faced creatures.  You head to the trail and Ryan pulls along side as you both discuss the best way to go and pass the map back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes on the trail turn to hours, you make a brief stop to share the last of the tasty treats found in Jordans pack.  As the last of the food is consumed the need for continuing meals is discussed.  Ryan and Casian say that they have already spoken about this and have figured that they could provide the next meal. You agree that given the obvious abilities that you 4 possess it should be little problem to find a meal.  Specially since there has been plenty of evidence of animal life along the trail.  Ryan adds that he believes he can sense water up ahead..fresh water.  Everyone is eager to find some and as you all mount up and get back on the trail.  As you crest the top of a hill you spot a thin trail of smoke comming out of the trees on the next hill top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell the others and you decide to:</span></div></div>",

As Ryan and I ascended the steep trail we observed the air begin to waver...you know like on a hot summer day.  Suddenly the very fabric of space itself ripped apart leaving a dark lined void approximately 8-9 feet tall, and who should come waltzing out, but Leiah and Casian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello boys\", they smiled \"You forget someone?\" and as the rip in the air faded away, Leiah and Casian were left standing on the edge of the trail.  \"We found a short-cut\", as Casian giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan cussed \"Damn it Cas, this could be dangerous.  I thought we agreed that you both would wait until be checked things out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasian shakes her head \"No...you boys argeed to that.  Not us, but don't you worry we girls can take care of ourselves.\" and as she finishes speaking she hold up her palm and whispers into the air as her hand is suddenly bathed in fire.  It looks almost like she is wearing a glove made of fire.  Leiah smiles and notches an arrow to her bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok..ok, but be careful\", I say as I pass by the girls and continue up the trail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to the top I could see that an attack had just taken place.  There were two carts overturned on the side of the road and one appeared to have been set on fire.  Three to four bodies laid about in the bushes and one in the middle of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan taking a quick apprasial of the situation road up and indicated that he would check up the road a little ways to make sure nothing would be coming back this way.  Holding his sword across his lap he galloped off the other side of the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon approaching the carts and seeing the bodies, Leiah dismounted and began checking bodies.  Soon she was calling for help, and her and Casian began tending to 2 of the fallen people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually they were more like big children in size, but you could see they were older.  Perhaps Dwarves or Gnomes.  I had never met any, but from the glow radiating from Leiah's hands it looked like I soon would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dismounted from Baron and bid him go back down the trail the way we had come and keep watch.  As he trotted off I somehow new he understood and would let me know if someone was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking cautiously around the hill top I poked my nose into all the dense underbrush to ensure we were not being observed, or had overlooked any victems.  Everything appeared to be clear, and just as quick Ryan road back up and stated than he had found nothing other than foot prints for over a mile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan dismounts and together we inspect the torn, bloodied bodies, finally stopping beside Leiah.  Her and Casian are leaning over 2 small bodies that appear to be breathing.  Noticing Leiah swaying on her knee's over the body you reach to see if she is alright just as she colapses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasian is quick and catches Leiah just before she hits the ground and cradles her in her arms.  As you all look at her in concern you can see that she is breathing, but appears to be sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then one of the bodies she has been leaning over moans:</span></div></div>",

We rushed up to the temples to see what had happened, and we were cut down by evil twisted creatures.  There were thousands of them in all shapes and sizes, and despite our best efforts we were forced to barricade ourselves in our city until they had left.  When it was finally safe to come back out it was found that the temples were still standing but the crystals were gone.  We sent teams out to find and bring back the sacred crystals, but few returned. Those that did told of a Fortress in the side of a mountain to the north where evil creatures roamed freely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn our darkest moment, when we were at a loss for what to do, we were visited by a wizard of great power.

One hero would have the power to Ward off Death, and be the protector of Light and fire.  Another would have the power of shape changing and be the Protector of Nature.

The Warrior would also have a kinship with water and all it's forms.\"  He smiled tentatively, \"and here you are, as foretold.

The four of you peer into this crater. In it there is a rose (that was blood red), an small blue knife(it looks a lot like a swiss army knife without the casing), a white crystal, and a small green leather pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiah and Ryan go down into the crater. \"You guys that probably isn't a very good idea.\" You hear Casian say. You and Casian look unsurely at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiah picks up the rose. \"Don't be such a prude Cas, besides you'd absolutly love this crystal it's exquisite.\" Leiah answers back. With that Casian slowly makes her way down into the crater. You watch her going into it with Ryan and Leiah, still too timid to go into it yourself.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Jake! This pouch thing-y is pretty cool man. You'd like it.\" Ryan shouts up to you. You take a deep breath and head down the side. Before you could get all the way to the bottom, the sky darkens and you hear a soft whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leiah hold the rose to your heart.\" It says softly but still commanding. Leiah does as she was instructed. The rose began to glow and then disappeared. \"You have so much untapped love, do not let it spoil and turn into hate. You are the Healer, protector of the Light and Fire.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan hold the knife in both hands.\" He does so, and the knife begins to enlarge and is now a full fledged sword the scabbard hanging around his waist. \"You are strong of spirit and body, you are the Warrior, commander of the Four Winds, Water, and all weather which comes forth from the two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Casian hold the crystal to your forehead.\" She holds the crystal to her forehead, and it attaches to her skin imbedding itself. She looks much like the Indian women with jewels in between their eyebrows. \"Intelligent, cautious, and unaware of all the gifts you have. You are the Sorceress, wielder of all magic and the minds of humankind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a small swift wind about you that tells you to get your item. You descend towards the pouch, the only item left unchanged. You pick it up. The voice then speaks again. \"Jacob hold the pouch up to the sky!\" You do so feeling very confused. A wind swirls around your arms and head. \"A true companion through and through, quick of wit, and full of soul. You are the Guardian of Nature and the animal kingdom.\" The air was quite for a moment before the voice spoke again. \"Use your gifts wisely, my children, and also use them fully! This world and all the works in it are now in your hands!\" With that the crater becomes deathly quiet and the sky lightens until all is normal once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you exit the crater and silently make your way towards the mountains in the distance.</span></div></div>",

She speaks again. \"Hello people look down at your clothes, have none of you noticed they are totally different and we each have packs on our backs containing God know's what. I have a freaking crystal on my forehead, Ryan looks like Atilla the hun, Leiah looks like she could fix anything, and Jake you look like you're royalty!

You are wearing a pain of chocolate brown shorts a cream colored tunic, soft black boots, the pack Casian mentioned, a set of daggars at your waist, and the pouch you found at the crater around your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Leiah, she was wearing a tight green blouse and beige suede looking pants, what looked like ballet slippers, a bow and arrows across her shoulders, and the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze reached Ryan, he had a white tunic much like your own, grey pants, brown boots, the sword sheathed in its scabbard at his waist, and a pack on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally looked at Casian you noticed how angry (or was it fear you saw?) she was. You also noticed her look had changed as well. She had a long black cloak on with a large hood attached, a light brown form fitting very short dress, thigh high black boots, a staff in her left hand (it had a crystal the same as the one on her forehead, except it was much larger), and of course the pack on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" You started timidly, looking around at the three faces of your best friends, you see anxiousness in each so you decide to continue. \"Why don't we check the packs, see if what that strange voice said was true, us having powers I mean, and look for a place to spend the night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sit on the ground, everyone else does the same. Ryan's pack yeilded a pair of sandels with a note attached saying: place them on your feet have no fear, to speed you on your way. Casian opened her's next in it was a small bowl another not: fill it with water and see what might be or what can still be changed, a vision to help you. Leiah's pack held an empty bottle a note was attached to it also: collect the wounds and use your love to make it pure, to heal you on The Journey. You opened your pack last in it there was a large piece of lined that resembled a tablecloth and as expected a note: open it and eat your fill, to sustain you and keep you strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this makes a lot of sense.\" Leiah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we try them out, see if what the notes said was true.\" Ryans says already taking his boots off. He finishes lacing the sandals and stands up and begins to walk around. \"Hmm... I don't see how this will speed-\" He is cut off by his own body movement. He is moving so fast he is barely a even a blur. Then you see him next to you stopped eyes aglow with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasian looks at her bowl \"Jake do you still have that Evian from Ryan's car?\" You look through your pack wondering if it had made it into there, it had... You hand it to Casian. She opens the bottle and pours some into the bowl, peers in. \"Guys I see a fortress of some sort nestled in the side of a mountain. Do you think this is a real place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be.\" Leiah responds, \"I can't try out my gift because no one is hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a papercut a couple of months ago will that work?\" Ryan asks. Leiah walks over to Ryan with the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... How do I 'collect the wound'?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe just hold the bottle to to the paper cut?\" You offer. She holds the bottle to Ryan's papercut, and his finger begins to glow softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes the bottle away and inside is a black liquid. She holds the bottle unsurely. \"I'm supposed to 'use my love'. Umm... I love you bottle.\" The black liquid swirls around and turns a pure white, a white you would expect only a unicorn would be able to posess. \"Well it's turned, but what do I use it for?\" Leiah says looking at the newly purified liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll just have to find out along the way.\" Casian states. \"Jake it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly begin to unfold the linen. You stand up and lie it on the ground. \"It said it to 'open it and eat your fill'.\" On the linen food begins to materialize, a feast fit for, well four California teenagers.                <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys wanna call it a night and eat or see if we have powers?\" Ryan asks</span></div></div>",

You raise your daggers, one above your head and the other, by your knees.  You crouch down and jump into the middle of a ring of goblins.  As you hit the ground, a ring of rock forms around your feet and knock down all of the goblins.  You raise both daggers above your head and a great spyre shoots up from the soil, knocking the goblins back even farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other goblins start to retreat.</span></div></div>",

Only the wize one knows for certain.\"  Eldrock begins walking slowly towards to the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all step away from the shrine and begin walking next to and behind Eldrock as he answers various and all questions that you have to the best of his abilities.  For the most part you learn that your current destination is a mountain fortress 2 days to the north.  There are rumored to be tunnels behind or beneath the fortress that lead through the mountains to a hidden land.  This is were the Crystals are believed to be taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be ever vigilant during the dark hours as we get closer to the fortress\".  Eldrock states.  \"Since the fortress fell during the mage wars over a century ago it is rumored that there are powerful scentient artifacts left in the darkest dungeons and high towers.\"  He looks around like a story teller weaving a ghost tale and checking its effects on his audience. He continues after a dramatic pause, \"The tainted items draws the dark things to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is quiet and lost in there own thoughts for the next few miles.  You hear Cas's thoughts poppin in your head a few times {You believe him Jake?\"}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot answering, you just shrugg your shoulders.</span></div></div>",

Man, where the heck do you think we are, and what is this <i>thing</i>..\" Your voice trails off as you notice the two still aren't paying you any attention, then you walk around them to see what has them so fascinated.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You inhale sharply. A humanoid figure is sprawled inside the cracked mettalic object, groaning feebly. It doesn't have skin. Instead, his body is coated in glossy, onyx black scales, overlapping and seeming to repulse light, making their owner hard to look at. A saurian head twists back and forth, trying to shake of a tangled restraint harness.  For a moment, you wish you could have scales so flawless, so tough looking and shiny... You snap out of it, partly due to a peculiar itching on your arm, you scratch at it irritably, shaking your head to clear it, but then notice that your skin feels hard, and smoother than before. A glance down-wards shows a multitude of little black dots, which shrink apart and into you and vanish while you watch. \"C'mon guys, we gotta help him!\" Yells Caisia suddenly, leaping forward. Both Ryan and Leiah also step forth. Still puzzled by the trance-like feeling you had had earlier, and by the mysterious markings on your arm, you walk up to the pod and look at how the <i>thing</i> is tangled. \"Here, he's trapped under a section here. maybe we can move it...\" You know it to be a false hope. The part is too big and too heavy looking for anyone too- Whet the heck?! Ryan reaches forwrad, and, muscles straining, wrenches the piece back. \"Get. Him. Out!\" He growls, obviously straining. Still unable too believe it, you pull the dazed reptiloid out from under it, while Leaih untangles him. Her fingers occaisionaly brush against his reptilian hide, and a gash on his forward startes to close. What on earth was going on? After finally freeing the now unconscious lizard-thing, you drag him over in the feild, and all sit down nearby to discuss what the hell just occurred back there.                 </span></div></div>",

Did you just say propose? I think that's the biggest word I've ever heard you use Ryan. Are you sure you know what that means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake continues to heckle Ryan, Leaih sidles over to you. \"I'm sorry, Cas.\" She murmurs. \"I' just scared and I don't know what to do. I guess I took all my fear out on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about.\" You smile. \"I understand. I'm just as scared and confused as you are.\" You assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't look it.\" She comments quietly and then turns, leaving you speechless. As she walks over to Ryan and links her arm with his, you catch Jake watching you. It dawns on you that he started teasing Ryan so that you and Leaih could make up and you feel grateful to have him as your advocate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk toward Jake, a voice snakes out from behind you. \"Are you the chosen ones?\" It hisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirling you prepare yourself, only to find Jake and Ryan in front of both you and Leaih. \"Back off.\" Jake growls as Ryan adds, \"You don't want to mess with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake-like creature just advances, paying no heed to their warning. When it's close, but still out of stricking distance, it shoots a ball of blue flame from it's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying in fear, you watch in horror as the ball hits Jake in the chest. Rushing forward you stand amazed as you notice that nothing has happened. You and Jake exchanged surprised glances as Leaih cries out, \"He's doing it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurriedly you spin, and out of instinct more than anything else, you make a scooping motion with your hand and then you shove your hand, palm out, in the creature's direction. The creature lights on fire and you watch as it slowly burns to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one, you turn and look at each other. What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Calronih, Chosen Ones.\" An equine voice says. \"I do you homage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA unicorn stands in front of you, with a bowed head. All around her stand other fairy tale creatures, wolves, tigers, griffins, dragons, fairies, and elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at each other and realize, You're not in Kansas anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly Jake stepped forward and bowed, and you all followed his lead. <br>\r\nAs they all stood up Jake said \"I thank you for welcoming us into your home.\" Then a little girl with amazing paper-like wings started to walk up to Jake, and reached for his hand, but an arrow shot the ground in front of her, surprising her, making her leap back. Just seconds latter, knights surrounded them, taking you and your friends by the arms and forcing you onto your knees, and you feel the cold steel of a knife on your neck. Jake put up such a fight that he ended up prostrate on the ground. Wow, you think, that was fast, the<br>\r\nIt is really loud as Jake yells and some of the creatures try to fight the knights, but all their effort was in vain.<br>\r\nSuddenly everything went quiet. A small gap was made in the circle of soldiers around them, and in glided a woman. So smooth and light was her motion that you think that she IS gliding. She was dressed in a dark blue dress with a roman style to it. On top of her head sad a diamond tiara; Sapphires, diamonds and pearls hung from her neck and ears, and were beaded into her dark brown hair. You look at her eye shadow and are surprised to see so much dark blue sparkly stuff surrounding her eyes. In a pattern all over her pale face were white sparkles, and her lips were a frosty white. You think that you have never seen a more beautiful woman in your life, and you look to Ryan, and can tell that he is thinking the same thing. You felt such a surge of jealousy rise in you, along with a genuine hate already for who ever this was. Luckly all Jake could see were her shoes!<br>\r\n\"I am the Queen of Eyslla, Hannaneel Poti-Phera.\" Her voice was filled with autority and power, and just from this statement, you felt like falling down and doing whatever it was that she asked out of fear.<br>\r\n\"Hariek, get them on their feet, I want a better look at these \"Cosen Ones.\" She said, in a moking tone. A man at her side showted orders ant the four soldiers were were holding you and you friends, and they volently pulled you up onto your feet, hands behind your back. The Queen walked up to you and looked at you in the eyes, and you thought to your self that you had never seen such blue eyes in your life. They were such a bright blue that you didnot beleve they were real. She walked around all of them, and then walked back the way they came, stoping to whisper something to Hariek, pointing to you and to Ryan, then she dissapeared into the gap between the soldiers.</span></div></div>",

And that wizard was nowhere to be seen. Standing up and stretching your arms, you played over in your head the events of the night before. Before the wizard had left he had said something. Behind you, the other three were still arguing and complaining, or complaining about arguing. Either way, it wasn\u2019t interesting you. You need to remember what he said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of you, be quiet!\u201d You suddenly turn on them, watching as they stare up at you, having stopped in mid-sentence. \u201cThat..

Maybe it is that great hat or the fact that I've always been fascinated with wizards and witches, fairies and dragons, spells and potions. This may be one heck of a great dream I'm in and I intend to explore the possibilities here in this strange forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk around with my hands behind my back as if I'm freakin Nancy Drew trying to solve a great mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Mr. Wizard, sir? You say we must pick a color of door to go through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods his head yes and his white beard, reaching his waist, bobs up and down. He waits patiently while the rest of the group are retrieved. I tell them not to be party poopers and for us to have fun with this, they reluctantly agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should pick the green door. Obviously, green means go, go through the door and red means stop, stop and think before you enter, duh, red, devil...something evil...yes, definately green. Are you guys with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shook their heads yes and we waited for the wizard to give us some great parting words of wisdom and he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go then on the path you have chosen but remember that things are not always as they seem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great, I thought, it sounded like we were about to embark on a strange through the looking glass adventure where babies wern't babies but piglets and giant cards would be chasing us. It couldn't be any worse than Fear Factor could it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go on.\", Jake snapped at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached out and turned the knob to the green door.</span></div></div>",

I stood there, stunned, when Leiah peered over my shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what sort of a joke is this?  All I can see are trees.\"  She sounded as if she were actually looking for something more.  I sighed.  Once again, I had to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because the door doesn't lead anywhere.\"  I stepped through the doorway and turned around to face everyone else.  \"See?  I'm still in this stupid forest in this stupid clearing with this stupid wizard, and did I mention that this just isn't fun anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeiah, looking puzzled, started walking around and through the doorway.  Ryan rolled his eyes and stepped over to me.  \"Doesn't it actually make more sense that it doesn't lead anywhere but here?  I mean, rather than teleporting us somewhere or revealing some monstrous creature,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, somewhat sullen.  He was right, of course, but I didn't have to be happy about it.  What I had really hoped to get out of the green door was answers--where are we? how did we get here? why are we here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jake had turned to the wizard--Maltir?--and his bad mood seemed to have become even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea?  I knew your whole 'pick a door' thing was . . .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done,\" Maltir cut Jake off (which did not improve his attitude).  \"You have chosen correctly.  Now I may serve as your guide and guardian if you so choose.\"  He made a sweeping motion with his arm and the two door disappeared.  Leiah jumped as the doorframe she had been examining disappeared.  Ryan grabbed her hand and brought her over to where I stood with Jake.  We all stared at the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?  That's what we get for choosing correctly?\"  I was beginning to feel rather frustrated myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Casian, it doesn't sound that bad,\" Ryan tried to soothe me.  \"After all, who doesn't need a 'guide and guardian' these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaltir nodded majestically, apparently oblivious to the sarcasm dripping from Ryan's words.  \"I will aid you, if you will have me.  Or you may simply speak the word and I will leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at us expectantly.  I glanced around at the others, only to find them looking at me.  Uh-oh--it looked like I would, once again, have to make the decision.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it is because the light is so beautiful.<br>\r\n\"I think we should open it\", you say. Before anyone can stop you, you lean forward and pull open the door.

The boys find their strength has been depleted due to the accident and getting out of the car through the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it is open, a strange, unusual and powerful odor overwhelms them.  They fall to the ground, gasping for air.  Their mouths are dry. Noses are running and eyes are burning. The odor  worsens and weakens them.  They are near to being unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey crawl away from the odor. Strangely, they are going deeper into the hole and don't realize it. At present, their only goal is to get away from that ghastly odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seems like days as they crawl along. The horrible odor decreases and relieves their senses gradually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are now able to sit up and gaze at each other.  They find their eyes are still cloudy and they can't focus on each other clearly yet.<br>\r\nThey can't hear any noise.  Breathing is still labored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reach over to each other and hold hands for support.  They shake and tremor as they grab each other. Everybody's skin feels like rubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey attemtpt to cry and scream in fright. Their eyes are clear.  They can all see each other. But nobody can hear anybody. They can see their mouths moving; but nothing is heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they look at each other and hope to hear their familiar voices, they hear animal voices coming from each other.  Each of them now can make sounds like horses, dogs, wolves, pigs, monkeys,birds.  They try to cry; but their tears are like animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir brains are functioning and know what is happening.  It is frightening to each of them; but they can't control the voices or texture of hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey try to stand and find they can't.  Their only stance is on all fours.  They all resemble animals walking around.  They all have the power to move around in the same fashion as any of the voices they use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave they regressed back into an evolutionary time? Is this punishment for their carefree lives.  Each still has control of his or her mind; but can't communicate the thinking process to another.</span></div></div>",

The hobbits in that movie did have awfully dirty feet, you remind yourself with a shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay what?\" you form your features into the pout that gets you anything and everything, and watch their glum faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Leiah,\" Ryan stutters, \"we were just...uh, talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" you ask, placing a hand deftly against your chin to lean on. You notice, not for the first time, how blue Ryans eyes are. Is it just you, or does he look a lot better of late? You dismiss the thought, its probably just the fact you've been flung into a world full of dirty little hobbit-elf <i>things</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were talking about the Crystals of Esylla,\" he says simply, tossing a meaningful glance from you to Jarth. \"Its why the villiage is plagued by the horrible grotesque things from the forest. You know, the things that looked kinda like you,\" he throws in as a small little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile sarcastically, nod with a smirk on your face and turn to Jarth. He might not look as good, but surely he can explain these crystals and the ahem, quote; \"horrible grotesque things from the forest\" a with a little more clarity than Ryan?</span></div></div>",

It was beautiful. There were blue silk carpets on the floor. I was standing there, in this white dress, silk I think, but it was sleeveless, and I had long gloves on. I had long white gloves on and my hair was really long, pulled up really prettily, with spirals hanging around my face. I had roses in my hair too. A woman entered, she looked like me, except with silvery hair and she looked older. Then three more people entered, one girl and two men. One of the men I seemed to be in love with. The girl, probably about my age, was wearing this white gown, plainer than mine, but still pretty. She had deep brown, almost auburn hair and it was pulled up completely, with a gold tiara, a plain one, in it. She had thick gold wristbands and gold anklets. At her waist their was a sword. She looked like a bodyguard, a feminine one.<br>\r\n    The men looked like knights, but were dressed a little nicer. With black cloaks. The ends of the cloak were connected with a silver chain. Then, the woman directed the three to stand in front of her. She started to say, \"Saranna, Sir Daylon, and Prince Alexander, I...\"<br>\r\n    \"Then what?\" Casian persisted. You gasp, Casian looked almost exactly like the girl in the dream, slightly different though, a little more modern...<br>\r\n      You sigh and continue, \"She didn't finish, suddenly there was a crash, knocking us to the ground. This motherly woman, she must have been a queen, gasped, not in fright, but in pain.<br>\r\n    I wanted to call her mother, I did I think. But anyway, this woman came out of nowhere. My mother-I mean the queen shouted for the three to protect me-ME and then this beautiful but evil woman broke down the walls, cursing everything around us. Many people in attire for a ball were screaming, many were already dead, as an army marched forth. Then she turned on me...\"<br>\r\n    You stop and look around, \"And then I woke up.\"<br>\r\n    Everyone kind of stands there, as if this is hard to take in. For some reason this seems familiar, as if this dream were Deja Vu. Then Casian speaks, \"How did that all happen in like ten minutes?\"<br>\r\n     You take this in, \"I don't know.\" you admit. Jarth looks like this is familiar also. He looks familiar somehow, like he was in the dream...<br>\r\n     \"Jarth?\" you ask.<br>\r\n   \"What?\" he is startled.<br>\r\n     \"Um, I saw you, or at least somebody who looked like you in this dream.\"<br>\r\n   \"Oh.\" he answered.<br>\r\n    Jake is staring at you, incredulous.

I mean - wait here.'<br>\r\nHe dashed out of the room through a door in the back. When he returned, he was holding a card. On the front, in black and white, was a family. They were clearly royalty. There was the king and queen, a handsome young prince, and there was... me?<br>\r\nI looked at the photo again. It was me! But how was this possible? 'I don't understand', I said. <br>\r\nJake and Ryan also looked at the photo, and started laughing. 'This is some messed up world if you're a princess', Ryan laughed.

He led Casian and I to a small twin room that was clean and comfortable. Ryan and Jake had a similiar room across the hall. <br>\r\nWe spent the rest of the evening chatting with Parnissus and his wife, and dined on some meat and potatoes. Ryan and Jake wanted to try the beer that Parnissus kept offering us, but Casian and I persuaded them that we would need clear heads in the morning if we were going to figure out what the hell was going on.

Normally midnight black colored with hints of brown along the back, flanks, and legs this magnificent horse was no exception though it had a white diamond between its eyes. Ryan named him Chavallier (for Maurice Chavallier a french actor renouned for being the epitome of the french gentleman.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you have your horses now what?</span></div></div>",
