Her parents are divorced and life just keeps piling onto her. Although the shops in Tokyo are closed, it would appear that even times of strife, this busty girl is able to get herself some comfort food. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Yuzu_Tanikawa\" target=\"_blank\">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Yuzu_...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidori Komaki \u2013 Known to the internet world as Dolly as a popular cosplay idol, she was in Tokyo for an event and couldn\u2019t get out before the barricades were set up. She\u2019s a firm believer of justice and has called herself a \u2018Hero of Justice \u2013 Magical Dolly\u2019 in order to save people from demons. How this spunky girl gains weight depends on where her path of justice leaves her. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Midori_Komaki\" target=\"_blank\">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Midor...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshino \u2018Haru\u2019 Harusawa \u2013 The vocalist of the indie band D-Va, and one of the most beautiful characters in the game, albeit she does try to commit suicide in the game for thinking that she was the cause for bringing the demons into Tokyo. She was given her songs by the band\u2019s former keyboardist, Aya, and even blames herself for her disappearance. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Yoshino_Harusawa\" target=\"_blank\">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Yoshi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore girls in the \u2018More girls\u2019 option.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a day like any other summer day in the Yamanote Circle \u2013 The sun blazing down on the streets as people of many ages and backgrounds went about their ways to kill the day. One such individual was a beautiful teenaged girl by the name of Yuzu Tanikawa \u2013 A young lass with medium long red hair held back by a pink headband (save for a good number of red strands in the front that flowed down the right side of her face). She was quite beautiful was endowed with a figure that could capture the hearts and eyes of every healthy young man (and the occasional woman) she passed, all contained in a pink blouse and blue/white striped tube top that hugged the wondrous mountains that she kept hidden. And the blue skirt and black knee socks showed off her finely toned legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was a day she would likely never forget, but as she walked through the streets, the young highschooler couldn\u2019t help but munch on a box of chocolate pocky that she had brought from home. She had skipped breakfast that morning in order to meet with a couple of her high school friends in the Yamanote Circle (something about one of their cousins wanting to speak to the group about something important). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, it was a reason for her to get out of the house, and possibly get some much needed shopping done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yuzu heard someone call out to her, the red-headed girl stopped and turned around to see a tall, handsome man behind her \u2013 he had combed down gray hair that lined his handsome features and was dressed in a black cloak that had green 1s and 0s on it (Yuzu was immediately reminded about an American movie she once saw, something called the \u2018Matrix\u2019 or something?). \u201cYou\u2019re Yuzu Tanikawa, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu was a little unsettled at the man knowing her name, and took a step back slightly. The man chuckled and lifted one of his hands up defensively, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so guarded \u2013 I\u2019m simply Naoya, the cousin of one of your classmates. You know the one guy with combed down messy blue hair, usually wears those goofy white headphones that make you wonder if he\u2019s listening or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! You\u2019re Tendoh\u2019s cousin?\u201d Yuzu questioned as the handsome man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, then you are one of his friends,\u201d Naoya replied as he lifted up his other hand, holding up a small, black handbag. \u201cI was hoping to run into one of you three, you see I have some matters to attend to and I won\u2019t be able to meet you guys at that time. But I needed to give you guys these things as soon as possible, so, I was hoping that you could give one of these to Tendoh and Atsuro for me in my place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu finished the current piece of pocky she had in her mouth and held her free hand up, \u201cSure I guess, it should be a problem. What exactly am I giving them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit of surprise,\u201d Naoya replied as he handed Yuzu the bag. \u201cYou\u2019re more than welcomed to look at them, and even keep one yourself. But I would be careful about a few of the aps on those devices \u2013 Some of them are still in development.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Yuzu replied, not really much of a fan of techno-babble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, well, thank you for your assistance Tanikawa-san,\u201d Naoya thanked with a slight bow of his head before he turned around and began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Is everyone in Tendoh\u2019s family handsome like that?</i>\u2019 Yuzu thought as she reached for another stick of pocky and slipped it into her mouth.<br>\r\nYuzu looked at the bag she was given, it wasn\u2019t too heavy, but whatever inside it did spike her curiosity. And being a young lass who thrived on curiosity, Yuzu couldn\u2019t help but peek into the bag. \u201cHuh? Are these those 3DS\u2019s I\u2019ve heard about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into the bag, Yuzu produced a small, pink painted handheld device and flipped it open to reveal a device that definitely fit the handheld video game system genre \u2013 Two screens, two control pads (one was a D-Pad), and a few other buttons that had various letters on them. Yuzu blinked a few times in confusion (while munching on her pocky) as she pushed the on button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen came to life and immediately read \u2018<span class=\"clred\">Communication Player\u2019 </span>and Yuzu\u2019s eyes immediately lit up, \u201cOh! These are COMPs! Wait, this is was Naoya wanted to give us? I know these things are expensive, but to call us out here just to give us these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the menu on the COMP began to appear, Yuzu blinked a few times at the number of different apps that were on it \u2013 Some of them didn\u2019t make any sense. Team? Group? And there was an even odder one \u2013 D-Possess. \u2018<i>As I thought, this is just for nerdy gamers\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1) Yuzu accesses the D-Possess application, which has her get possessed by a demon of lust and gluttony. Although she doesn\u2019t realize it, every time she indulges in food, she\u2019ll only crave more and more, and as a side effect, Yuzu will start to gain weight faster than normal \u2013 For her waistline\u2019s sake, she should lay off of the Pocky (unless you want her to blow up like a fat balloon lol (And we know you all do)).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2) Before Yuzu can access the applications, both Tendoh and Atsuro appear at the last second and stop her from doing so. However, after Atsuro takes his COMP to try to hack it, both Yuzu and Tendoh come across the Shomonkai, one of which is a heavy lady who\u2019s COMP has been infected by a demon that actually transfers fat from one person to the user. Having already completed one of the jobs, the demon access\u2019s Yuzu\u2019s and begins to mess with her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3) Starts off as the second option, however, instead of the rest of the second one, the Laplace Mail speaks about how some random women have been found in the streets massively obese, surrounded by tatters of clothing, have their faces covered with remains of various deserts, and found in a euphoric sleep \u2013 Apparently, there\u2019s a demon going around that\u2019s stuffing girls to the gills, will Yuzu\u2019s waistline be spared by this demon? (Probably not)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions 4 and 5) If you can come up with something else, go for it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly, Yuzu\u2019s thumb reached the corner of the screen, and even a touch of pressure was enough to activate the app that her thumb was atop of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD-Possess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the screen flashed slightly, Yuzu was still thinking of how she could use the COMPs to at least get a decent laugh out of seeing Atsuro freak out of how \u2018Yoohoo\u2019 was able to score three COMPs (when he was only barely able to get one). However, the attractive young lass was unaware of the text that immediately flashed on the screen that said <span class=\"clred\">\u2018Possession Complete\u2019 </span>before the entire device turned off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu was also unaware that her eyes glowed an eerie, if not beautiful bright green before they flashed back to their normal shaded color. For a moment, Yuzu just stood there before she shook her head. \u2018That was weird \u2013 Oh well\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconsciously, Yuzu began to gnaw on the stick of pocky in her mouth until she inhaled the chocolate covered treat. And like she was an automatic machine, Yuzu reached into the box of pocky, and pulled out two sticks that she quickly nibbled on. Not even then did she realize that she was already finishing off the two sticks of pocky she had in her mouth and was reaching for the box once more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Yoohoo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe well-endowed teen spun around slightly (not noticing that there was a little more bounce to her chest when she did) to see a familiar duo \u2013 The nerd who was usually dressed in his hoodie and white cap Atsuro and the blue haired, white headphone wearing Tendoh \u2013 walking towards her. \u201cWill you stop calling me Yoohoo?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s just a fun little nickname,\u201d Atsuro replied with a large smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d Yuzu retorted as she wagged a stick of pocky at Atsuro. \u201cMost of the teachers think that\u2019s my real name!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s funny!\u201d Atsuro replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTendoh sighed loudly, this was going to be a long day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd spent the last hour and a half at Mega Meals with his new girlfriend, Yuzu Tanikawa, who within said time had ballooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu had developed into a hourglass figure with a large chest, behind and a pudgy middle. Her breasts had reached the size of an average person's head and were testing the limits of her bra, to the point that it appeared painful. Yuzu's belly had swollen with food and fat, her stomach was stretched taunt and gave the impression she was months into a pregnancy. Both however failed to outshine the orbs that were her ass. Despite being well endowed in the chest prior to her blossoming, her ass had taken the spotlight and made itself Yuzu's largest asset. The twin boulders of flab stuck our like a shelf behind her and oozed across the booth seat. Her skirt had completely failed to cover a quarter of her ample behind and her pink panties were stretched across the expanse of her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking in the size of his new girlfriend, Tendoh went to pay for the meal while Yuzu finished the last of the food. A few minutes later Tendoh came back and the duo walked to the doors. However, Yuzu in either ignorance or forgetfulness hadn't taken her size into account as she very quickly found herself stuck in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Tendoh, could you give me a hand... my butt is too big for the door...\" Yuzu asked, embarrassed, her face a deep crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Tendoh replied and placed both hands on her large rearend, and pushed.

However, she was transparent, and no one seemed to notice the scantily clad woman who's hands were slowly hovering around Yuzu's body: Focusing around the teen's breasts, behind and her thin waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Such potential here. Such a weak will, one subject to temptation and my whims... And her body's quite nice. But she needs more... More...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transparent demon finally lowered her hands onto Yuzu, the brown haired girl unaware as Lilim grasped her breasts. \"More... She needs more of everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilim's hands slowly traveled south, and her hands began to knead Yuzu's trim stomach, \"Now... How should I do this? I could always do this the slow and classic way - A little hunger manipulation, metabolism as fast as a slug, and a lazy mindset...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, there's always the quick way: Magic. I could make her gain pounds and have her be oblivious until I wish it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I could be creative...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No change of clothes, stuck in the Yamanote Circle with no one that she really knew to help her in this crisis nearby, and worst of all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m boooooored!\u201d Midori moaned as she slumped up against one of the many buildings in the Yamanote Circle.

That was really cool! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a mini-laptop one could use in the palm of one\u2019s hands\u2026 And it played games too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, unfortunately, Midori didn\u2019t have that luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, pushing herself from the wall, Midori began to walk into the crowds in an attempt to find something to quell her boredom\u2026<br>\r\n________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeas:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Midori comes across a weird fortune teller that offers to play a game with tarot cards \u2013 As the game continues, Midori comes across a weird fortune that seems to curse her to gain weight steadily over the next seven days\u2026 And once she gets a comp, that curse seems to intensify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Midori meets with the main group earlier than what the game has set, and she seems interested in staying with them. As they go through the motions of the first day, Midori notices that Yuzu is a little puffy around the middle (not much of a surprise since Yuzu seems to have a sweet in her mouth every other minute) \u2013 Thus, Midori watches Yuzu as she steadily gets bigger. When she and Yuzu are alone, she questions Yuzu and touches the comp that Yuzu has accidentally \u2013 Making her get possessed with a Demon of Gluttony and get the same fate as Yuzu\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption three - five: Your choice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, I wanna point out that this story only goes with the first installment of the game since the first game is the only one in the U.S. at the moment. But if the second game comes to the shores of the U.S., then I\u2019ll edit the story so you can have girls from there gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there are a number of girls that you guys can choose from:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the well-endowed Yuzu \u2018Yoo-hoo\u2019 Tanikawa, to the playful cosplayer Midori Komaki, the exotic indie-singer Yoshino \u2018Haru\u2019 Harusawa, Amane Kuzuryu the maiden of the Shomonkai cult, the sexy nurse Mari Mochizuki or any of the numerous beautiful women that appear among the ranks of this JRPG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s this? You don\u2019t know who these girls are?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell then, head over to the wiki to check out images and to learn about the characters.

But since you\u2019ve got demons all over the place, feel free to use that, but here\u2019s the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tNo gains like \u2013 Yuzu ate a cupcake, and gained a thousand pounds<br>\r\n2)\tTry to keep the characters alive \u2013 Even if their Death Clocks say zero, they should be able to survive like they did in the story.<br>\r\n3)\tOnly girls get to gain in this, but please don\u2019t forget the guys that are in this.<br>\r\n4)\tYou can mention sex, even write about it \u2013 But don\u2019t be too graphic. That being said, the girls will grow out of their clothes, so you can have nudity going on.  <br>\r\n5)\tPlease be sure to have some proper grammar and spelling \u2013 They are actual functions on Writing.com, so use them please.<br>\r\n6)\tHave fun.<br>\r\n7)\tAnd as regards to the nameless protagonist, let\u2019s just call him Tendoh, which is the Japanese word for Heaven (once again, play the game and you\u2019ll get it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, let\u2019s have you click on that little link down below, and we\u2019ll enter this interactive!<br>\r\n</td>",
