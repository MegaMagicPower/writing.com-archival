He'd finally be Hokage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning madly, he took the device and sped off for the tower, wasting no time and bumping into people on the way there. Thankfully, he had infiltrated the tower several times during different pranks he had done, he knew the route well enough to the Hokage's office so that he wouldn't get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, when he got to the window he saw that Tsunade was fast asleep at her desk with a mountain of paperwork covering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!

The gray top exposed a great deal of his chest and the blue pants left most of his lower legs exposed. He felt the green robe over his shirt cover his arms, which would've been left exposed otherwise. He had to admit it was weird for him at first to see the heeled sandals on his feet, but that quickly changed when he noticed his fingernails and toenails were colored red. He felt his lips next and found them covered in red lipstick. Finally, he blushed at the feelings of wearing a bra over his chest (which his shirt covered up) and panties on his private area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade?\" Shizune's voice said, \"You shouldn't be sleeping on the job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up and struggled to contain his laughter. Tsunade, though still sitting behind her desk and now going about her normal business, was dressed in Naruto's clothes. The orange and blue jumpsuit fit over her body nicely, outlining every curve. Her feet were firmly fastened in Naruto's old ninja sandals. No makeup was seen on Tsunade's face nor was there any polish on her fingernails and toenails. Naruto's ninja headband was tied around her head, covering the diamond mark on her forehead. Naruto then snickered at the thought of Tsunade wearing his boxer shorts under the orange jumpsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" Tsunade said, catching his attention. \"I know you're here somewhere! Show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto emerged from his hiding place, he walked in front of the desk nervously. He noticed that he found it incredibly easy to walk in his new heeled sandals, but his focus was quickly back on Tsunade when she asked, \"What was so funny? What are you even doing here?\"</span></div></div>",

We'll help you out if you start feeling like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, girls,\" Ichigo responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked to school, Ichigo thought, \"This thing really works!

Sanji said in Nami's angelic voice as she unbuttoned the white dress she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white dress fell at her feet and she could see the bra she was wearing along with a thong that covered her vagina, she slowly began to see every detail of her new body, from her beautiful face, the tattoo she had on her shoulder and her beautiful hourglass-shaped body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he began to massage his breasts through the bra, little by little he felt how the pleasure flowed through his body, he slowly took off the bra and when it fell to the ground Sanji realized how heavy his new tits were. He continued to massage them little by little until her nipples were hard, he began to squeeze them and little by little he began to moan softly, he tried to see her vagina, but her huge tits prevented him from seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* I guess having huge, perfect breasts has its downsides too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she decided to sit in front of the mirror and through this see her new and wet vagina, slowly inserted one of her fingers inside it and let out a great moan, her body was reacting too well to pleasure and little by little she felt like her new Her body heated up, as each time her body demanded that she rub her tits harder and faster and as little by little she had to put her fingers deeper into her new vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* I didn't know that girls could feel this good. It doesn't compare at all to male masturbation. I never want to be a man again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the walls of her new vagina gripped his fingers and she had a great orgasm, the pleasure that Sanji felt was so much that he was passed out for a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes he regained consciousness and seeing that it was quite late, he decided to clean up the mess he had left a bit and go to bed. Reflecting a bit on what had just happened, he had realized that he loved being a woman, however, he began to doubt if he wanted to be Nami, he still loved to cook, he wanted to know the All blue, he was still the same and did not want to abandon everything. However, it occurred to him that he could simply give Nami her life back, he would keep her body or he could search for a new body.</span></div></div>",

Then he took advantage of the signal that life gave him and stealthily with no one seeing him enter through the window without her waking up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nReiju had saved his life as children, she had freed him from his father's prison and unlike his brothers and his father he did not hate her, however; she remained faithful to her father even though she was aware of that his father was wrong, for that reason he put her on his list, he also had her in front of him and he would not waste the moment. Slowly, without waking her up, he placed one bracelet on her and proceeded with her wish that she had carefully asked for: the wish to take her body, her name, change her genders \"version 1\" and all her wardrobes. All this with the small detail of maintaining the color of her blonde hair.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe flash of light occurred, Sanji when he opened his eyes he found that his plan had gone perfectly, he had taken the body of his sister along with her name, her gender so that everyone recognized him as a woman, her body and her clothing. Without abandoning her hair color, to clarify that this would be her body from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pm1.narvii.com/6361/251be33cf16e96b653df67e0f45564ad620f4588_hq.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pm1.narvii.com/6361/251be33cf16e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took advantage of the mirror in the room to look at his new body the shape of his face was very similar to that of his old self because Reiju was his sister, but far from disliking this he liked it since it somehow felt familiar, Not to mention that he had the same hairstyle with Reiju's headband with the blonde color that characterized him, he was wearing the typical Germa 66 suit but he did not have the 6 tattoos on his legs which made him happy since he did not want to have anything to do with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022 Thank you, not only did you give me freedom, but you also gave me your beautiful body, I will never forget this very charitable and stupid gesture I hope you do well from now on \u2018oni-chan\u2019. The new Reiju murmured in her sweet voice as she kissed her old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid misunderstandings, the new Reiju went the way she entered and quickly return to the ship. The ship was alone. Slowly she went to her room and noticed that this was a mix of her old room along with a certain feminine touch which suited her well.

She realized that she was shorter, but this displeasure enchanted her as it made her look more feminine.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe started with breasts which despite being a little smaller than Nami's, still prevented her from seeing down, however, she had a slimmer waist and a bigger butt which made her look even sexier than her partner I notice that his legs without those stupid 6 stood out much more, unfortunately even though he had decided not to change skills with Reiju he had got his resistance and his immunity to poison, at first he disliked it since he did not want to have anything coming from his family, but after thinking about it for a while I took it as the price to pay for such a precious body, also the wings made him look supremely sexy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAll these emotions had started to heather, just like yesterday she started rubbing her breasts, and she quickly realized that her body was much more sensitive than Nami's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022 My father's stupid experiments on 'me' have made me sensitive. How dare she, I will teach her a lesson when I see her. Reiju said with a sexy tone. Each word he spoke with his new and sweet voice made her heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly when the clitoris was touched, she came very hard and fell on her big legs. However, her body asked for more, she masturbated wildly in front of the mirror. Little by little he introduced his deepest fingers into her new vagina which clung to them so much that it was difficult for him to remove them to put them back in. All this made electric currents flow through her body and made her moan loudly. The dress she was wearing was soaked with vaginal juices and sweat from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022 This feels so good, this is 'my' body, I am the new Reiju. She said with a voice full of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this set of sensations made her ejaculate, the pleasure was so much that she was ecstatic for two minutes until she could regain her sanity. After the pleasure he realized the disaster that had caused in his room besides feeling sticky, so he cleaned it and then went to the shower where, far from cleaning himself, he masturbated again, his body did not get tired and he could ejaculate as many times I would like. She wiped off the sweat and put on her white one-piece dress along with her pink bowtie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peeking out from behind a bush, Ash could see May walking around their camp, Brock had gone into town to buy supplies, wearing his former jeans as if they had always been here. <br>\r\nAsh then took aim at May with the remote and selected the clothing option. As he had a target this time he was given the option of what article he would like to take and decided that underwear would be enough for now. He pressed the button and a blinding light shot out at May and himself. When the light had faded, Ash could feel a new sensation around his groin. He looked down and saw that his boxers were no longer sticking out, but he was now feeling somewhat uncomfortable from his new female underwear. What Ash didn't realise was that May had been wearing a thong which he could now feel creeping up between his cheeks, and that switching underwear also gave him Mays bra, which was now clinging to his chest with nothing to hold. <br>\r\nAsh stood up and straightened out his new thong, deciding that he would keep it for now as it was a unique experience to wear such an article. He stretched out the front of his new bicycle shorts and looked at the thong, finding that it had a pokeball pattern on it and that it had been adjusted to accommodate his genitals. While it would take some getting used to, Ash began to actually enjoy the tight feeling that his new underwear and shorts were giving hiZm. He liked the silky material his underwear was made of and liked the way Mays shorts hugged his body. As he repositioned himself to get a better view of May, his thong began to rub against his member, which began to give him an erection, which put a major strain on the skimpy clothing and left a noticeable bulge in his skin-tight shorts.<br>\r\nDeciding that he didn't want to stop here, Ash took aim at May and decided what he wanted to swap...</span></div></div>",

Aiming the device at May, Ash once again pressed the clothing option and this time he selected her top. Once again there was a bright light and when he could see again, he saw that May was wearing his t-shirt and hoodie. He looked down and saw that he now had on May's tight red t-shirt with the dark blue circle around his neck. Strangely this swap also gave him May's white micro skirt, which slightly covered his erection which had grown larger from his latest swap. <br>\r\nDeciding that he would finish things off now, Ash selected the accessories option as well as the shoes option, effectively giving him the remainder of May's outfit. With a flash, Ash was now dressed from head to toe in May's clothes. He looked down and could see her red and yellow sneakers on him, re-sized to accommodate his much larger feet as well as her black socks on his legs. He reached down to fix his new socks and saw that he now had May's blue and white gloves on his hands. He also noticed her yellow fanny pack was secured around his waist and could feel his new bandanna resting on his head. <br>\r\nReaching into his new fanny pack, Ash pulled out his trainer card and saw a picture of himself dressed in May's clothes, implying that reality had changed so that he had always worn May's clothes.<br>\r\nAsh felt that now would be the best time to speak to May and began to walk into their camp. He found that his tight clothing gave him a somewhat feminine sway to his step but this only made him enjoy the swap more. He adjusted his shorts and thong, put the Super Swapper in his fanny pack and strode confidently up to May who happily greeted him as if everything was normal. They chatted for a while about what their plan was while Ash played with his new outfit. While he was amazed that May acted normally about their new outfits, the part that surprised him the most was how she said nothing about the bulge which was clearly visible in his shorts. Realizing it was getting late, Ash faked a yawn and told May he was going to sleep for the night. They both said goodnight and gave each other a hug. As this was happening Ash rubbed his erection on May's leg which strangely got no reaction from her whatsoever. <br>\r\nAs soon as he was out of hearing range of May, Ash let out a small laugh about the situation he was in and how much he was enjoying it. The realization that May was oblivious to their changes made him even happier and gave him ideas for what else he should swap. He heard Brock arriving back to camp but as it was late, he pretended to be asleep rather than speak with him. Ash began to get changed out of his clothes and stopped when he was in nothing but his underwear. He knew that he could easily get changed into a pair of his new pajamas if he wanted to, but instead decided to have some fun with his new clothes and began his own private fashion show.<br>\r\nHe scrambled through May's (Well, his now) bag and pulled out several of \"his\" outfits. He found a number of things he recognized including \"his\" contest outfit, the orange and green outfit May had worn in Johto and a variety of swimsuits and other underwear as well as the outfit he would be wearing to bed.. Deciding to start with something basic, Ash put on the pink one piece swimsuit with the polka dots on them. When he first saw this on May, Ash was extremely aroused as it was so tight and showed off her curves beautifully and now that it was on him, it was all Ash could do not to ejaculate there and then. The one-piece was so tight and soft that any movement he made was like heaven for his penis, giving a feeling like no other he had experienced. Although he wanted to try on the other outfits he had found, Ash instead decided to remain in his new one-piece instead. He could hardly contain himself as he laid out his sleeping bag and managed to get his orange pajamas over his body all the while wearing the swimsuit. Laying down in his sleeping bag. Ash decided it was about time that he relieved himself  so he would be able to go to sleep. He squeezed his hand under his almost skin-tight outfit and began what would prove to be the most enjoyable night of his entire life. <br>\r\nHe began to caress his penis, slowly rubbing it up and down while building up a tempo. He knew he was about to reach the point of no return but didn't want to get his favorite outfit messy already. he searched through the pile of clothes he had pulled out and found what he had been looking for; one of May's old socks. He then went back to what he had been doing and when he finally came, he soaked up his mess with the small, silky sock. When he had calmed down from his excitement, a thought crossed Ash's mind. He began to realize that he never wanted to change things back to normal! In this new reality Ash was able to wear womens clothing without anyone saying anything about it. He also much preferred the way they felt on him compared to his old outfit and apparently didn't have to worry about people seeing, or feeling, his erections. Thinking it may have just been a spur of the moment thought, Ash decided to sleep on it. He once again reached his hand inside of his clothes and happily went to sleep in his soft new outfit...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Ash woke up refreshed and ready to get back on his journey. He climbed out of his sleeping bag still half asleep when he looked down and saw himself wearing May's clothes, reminding him of the events of the previous day and the power he now had in his control. Taking the Super Swapper out of his fanny pack, he placed it in his pajama pocket and climbed out of his tent, making his way to the breakfast table Brock had set up. He sat down beside May who had already gotten dressed into his former travelling outfit and began looking her up and down. Out of all of his travelling companions he's had to date, May was by far Ash's favorite and thought he would have the most fun if he continued swapping with her. Ash wasn't sure exactly what he wanted to swap as of yet, but he knew that he would eventually get bored of just having her clothes and would want to get even more from her. <br>\r\nFinishing up his breakfast, Ash returned to his tent where he changed out of his silky soft pajamas. Looking down at himself he realized he would have to change out of his one-piece as well otherwise he might run into another issue like last night while he is walking, and began to take it off as well. He still had a pile of clothes on the floor from last night, so he just rummaged through that to find what he would wear today. He settled on a lace thong as he felt it would be the most enjoyable underwear to wear, a bra with small ribbons on it as he enjoyed the sensation of wearing a bra, and then May's traditional red travelling outfit. He pulled the thong up his legs and positioned his member between his legs so that they would not be as noticeable. He then pulled up his biker shorts and his micro skirt, pulled on his black socks and his shoes. He had some trouble putting on his bra, but after several failed attempts he managed to get it on and then put on his t-shirt and gloves. He then tied one of his bandanna's around his head and fastened a fanny pack around his waist.<br>\r\nBy the time he had finished getting dressed, and playing with his new outfit and posing in front of a small mirror he brought with him, May and Brock had packed away most of their gear. He knew that May and Brock would be distracted with their jobs and thought that now would be his best opportunity to swap with May again without her noticing. He thought about starting with something small, but he wasn't sure what...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding that it would be fun to swap his head with May, Ash took aim with the device and selected to swap his head, voice and hair with her for fun. He pressed the button and was greeted with the usual blinding light. When he could see again, he was greeted to an amusing sight. He could see May's body in his clothes, but on top of her slim feminine figure was his own masculine head and bushy black hair. Trying to contain his laughter, Ash continued to take down his own tent while taking his mirror out of his fanny pack. What greeted him was a sight just as amusing, if not somewhat arousing, as he could clearly see a carbon-copy of May's head. He was amazed to see her clear blue eyes staring back at him, with her face mirroring every expression that he made. He reached up to brush some of his hair out of his eyes and felt that it was just as smooth and silky as May's actual hair had been. <br>\r\nAs he finished up his packing, Ash began humming to himself and could hear May's high pitch voice as he did so. This sent a shiver through his spine as he slowly became more and more aroused by the angelic noises he was making. He began whispering to himself to test out his new vocals, saying things about how naughty May is and how handsome Ash is, only adding to his pleasure. By the time he had finished up, the others had finished and were waiting to leave. With a spring in his step, and a very aroused penis, Ash set out at a run, loving the feeling of the thong rubbing against his penis and the tight spandex shorts riding up his legs. He yelled for the others to hurry up with May calling for him to slow down in his old voice. <br>\r\nThe group eventually came to a small town along the Hoenn coast where they could relax on the beach. They stopped off at a pok\u00e9mon center where they checked in and left their supplies. Ash went into his private room and got changed into one of his bikini's. Not wanting to wear his one-piece as he had more erotic plans for it, Ash got changed into one of his pink bikini's, making sure to tuck his penis away in case of a clothing malfunction. He then ran out with the Swapper wrapped in his towel and met up with the others. The sight he was met with however was surprising to say the least, as May was now sunbathing topless in a pair of his old swimming shorts, and surprisingly nobody was paying any attention. He lay his towel down beside her and picked up the Swapper. While he enjoyed seeing May topless more than anything, he felt that he would enjoy it even more to have her breasts to himself...</span></div></div>",

When he opened his eyes again, he almost burst out laughing as he could see May's sexy legs coming out from the base of his old body. From the waist up May had his entire body. Her once feminine torso had been replaced entirely by Ash's muscular body and her formerly dainty arms and hands were now hairy and broad like Ash's had been. Looking down at himself however, Ash was greeted by a much more interesting sight. His formerly empty bikini top was now filled out by his new breasts, making him feel much more comfortable in what he was wearing than he had before. He also now found that he was much thinner than previously and that his figure was much more slender and feminine as it was now in fact a girls. He rubbed his new dainty hand across his chest and found that he was now a lot smoother than he was in his old body. He then rubbed his hand across his breasts and let out a small moan of pleasure as they were a lot more sensitive than he had been anticipating. Luckily May had fallen asleep on her towel otherwise he would have to explain exactly what he was doing, avoiding a very awkward conversation. He could feel his penis hardening between his legs and decided to stop for now.<br>\r\nWhen May woke up the pair decided to go for a swim, with Ash putting the device in their beach bag. They ran down to the shore with Ash's breasts bouncing the entire time on his chest. He dove in as soon as the water was deep enough and when he resurfaced, his long brown hair was covering his eyes causing him to brush it away. Ash could feel the pressure being taken off of him from his breasts as the salt water kept them afloat. As the water was somewhat murky, Ash began to play with his breasts beneath the water, rubbing his penis at the same time giving him twice the pleasure. Luckily when he realized he was about to cum, a large wave crashed over the pair as Ash released his load, mixing it in with the backwash from the wave. Not wanting May to find out somehow, Ash told her he wanted to get out and, after readjusting his now flaccid penis, the pair returned to their towels to dry off. While they were swimming Brock had gone off to chat up some girls on the beach, so Ash was safe knowing he wouldn't have seen anything. <br>\r\nAs he was lying down, Ash looked down at his hairy legs sticking out from the end of his bikini and the ever-present bulge at his crotch. He came to the conclusion that he would look a lot better is he were to swap his lower body with May and looked through their bag to get the Swapper.</span></div></div>",

He rolled over to get a better look at his ass which had now become plump and more womanly. His hips now curved in to his lower body in an hour-glass shape which he found arousing on other women and now that he had that figure himself he was ecstatic. He felt himself becoming aroused again while looking at himself and could see a bulge rising in his pants... Wait, a bulge? \"Crap\" Ash thought to himself as he realized he forgot to swap the most important part that had been bothering him all day. He was now a carbon-copy of May apart from the most crucial detail, her womanhood. He sat up from his position on his towel and looked at the growing bulge in his bikini bottom. He reached once more for the Super Swapper only to realize that the batteries had died in it! He told May he had to get something from his room and ran back to the center as fast as his new legs would carry him, proving rather difficult to run with his bouncing breasts and his fully erect penis.<br>\r\nHe unlocked his door and quickly ran inside, hoping he would have some spare batteries in his fanny pack. He unzipped the bag and thankfully found a pair of the right batteries. He opened up the cover and replaced the now dead batteries and prepared to go back out to May. As he was walking towards the door, Ash caught sight of himself in the bathroom mirror. What he saw was a person who looked identical to May in one of her skimpiest bikini's, looking incredibly aroused with a large, very noticeable bulge in her pants. <br>\r\nSmirking to himself, Ash turned around and lay down on his bed, realizing that this was the first time he had been truly alone in private since he found the device. He took off his bikini top allowing his breasts to lay freely on his chest. He then reached his hand underneath his bikini, feeling the soft material with his hand as he began to stroke his penis. With his spare hand Ash began to massage his left breast while sucking on the other. This sent an incredible wave of pleasure through his body like he had never felt before. He began to moan loudly, the sound of his new voice only adding to his arousal as the sounds were so sensual and erotic. Ash soon ejaculated from pleasuring himself, with the majority of it landing on his chest without him noticing and as he was still licking his breast, a large amount of it went into his mouth. Ash began to gag and ran towards the bathroom to spit out the fluid but before he did he saw his reflection once more. This time, he could see May's face looking surprised and innocent with semen dripping out of her mouth which, had he not just done so, would have caused Ash to ejaculate all over again. Instead of spitting it out, Ash decided to swallow the semen all the while staring into the mirror to give him a memory to think about in the future. Ash cleaned his chest of, tied his bikini top back on and grabbed the Swapper, finally making his way back out to May who he found was back asleep. He fired the beam once more, swapping their genitals like originally intended.</span></div></div>",

He silently rejoiced as he could finally move around without having to worry about his penis escaping from his bikini or other people seeing it. He lifted up the front of his bottoms and could see May's former vagina in place of his penis, making him even happier and somewhat aroused. Realizing that all he has seeming done since acquiring the device was masturbate, Ash decided to not do that for now and would instead enjoy his time on the beach. As he lay there, a number of attractive women walked past, with several of them looking him over. This made him realize that he was still seen as a man, meaning that Ash would still attract women and not have to worry about men trying to make a move on him. Beside him, May woke up with a yawn and Ash could clearly see her morning wood. Strangely, this caused Ash to become aroused with the idea of his former penis causing him to become wet. That was a rather strange thought for Ash, but he simply passed it off and continued looking at the other women on the beach. <br>\r\nAs he lay on his towel, Ash slowly drifted off to sleep. While he slept, Ash began to dream about winning the Hoenn league but rather than his own body, he saw himself as May. The dream then skipped to the celebratory after party where Ash was wearing a beautiful ballgown. He then was brought out to dance with Misty who was dressed similarly to how he was but when they went in for a kiss, Misty's appearance suddenly changed to that of his own, but still in the dress. All around him the girls he knew were beginning to morph into him in various states of dress, some wearing ballgowns, others like Dawn, Serena and Iris were still wearing their own clothes but had his body. As the dream became more hectic he saw his reflection in the mirror and saw that he was now pregnant in May's body. Time skipped again and he was now somewhat older and his children were running around with his body but with May's clothes as well as various other girls he knew. The most disturbing image by far came when he could see that his children had erections which were straining against their outfits, particularly the one dressed as Misty, as the tight shorts could barely contain the child's penis.<br>\r\nWith a jolt Ash woke up from his dream, worried about everything he had just seen. He looked down at his crotch again and could see that he still had a vagina and was not pregnant. He checked the Super Swapper to see whether or not it had been the cause but found nothing unusual about it. He decided that the sun must have caused him to think like that from too much exposure and told May he was going to lie down inside. He entered his room and took off his bikini, not even bothering to play with himself now. He got changed into his pajamas and ordered room service. He lay there watching TV for several hours, not even realizing that he had been watching chick-flicks the entire time. What Ash didn't realize was that while he may not have swapped anything else with May, the hormones in his body were causing him to think more femininely, making him act slightly more like May would. Ash then got into his bed for the night, making sure the Swapper was safe beside him and hoped that he would have no more strange dreams...</span></div></div>",

He climbed out of bed, straightening out his pajamas and looked at himself in the mirror. He checked out his body, feeling his every curve and jiggled his breasts for a while. Realizing they had been on the road for several days, Ash went into his private bathroom and started up the shower. He climbed in when the water was hot enough and began soaping up his body. The sensation of running water on his new body felt incredible as it ran over every curve. He then began to wash out his hair, finding it much more difficult to wash it than his old hair was, but was enjoying it far too much to be annoyed. Feeling a bit naughty, Ash pulled down the shower head and placed it between his legs. The rush of the water pressure felt incredible making him weak in the knees. He started rubbing his breasts again with his other hand and found it difficult to keep his balance. He soon reached an orgasm which made him collapse all together on the floor of the shower, but whatever way he fell, the shower head became lodged in his vagina. Having the flowing water going directly into his body was unbelievable, causing Ash to scream out in pleasure, bringing about several more orgasms before he finally got the water shut off and the shower head unstuck. With his legs trembling, Ash slowly made his way out to his bed, where he <br>\r\ncollapsed in ecstasy for several minutes on the brink of passing out.<br>\r\nDeciding it was time to get ready for the day, he pulled out a pink pair of panties and a matching bra and slipped them on. Since the weather was nice out again, Ash decided to try out a new outfit. He pulled up a pair of bike shorts and then a smaller pair of white denim shorts over them. He then put on a tight black undershirt and an orange tank top over that. He then pulled out a bandanna and tied it around his hair in a new fashion which would make his head cooler during the day. He looked in the mirror again and another strange thought crossed him mind. \"Does this outfit make me look fat?\" Ash said to himself, looking puzzled and beginning to worry that he should change out of the tight top. Shaking his head, he put the thought out of his mind and slipped his shoes on his feet. Not wanting to wear his gloves, Ash took out his new makeup kit from his fanny pack and began painting his nails. He settled on a light shade of pink and managed to get a light layer of makeup on his face, not even questioning how he knew what to do so easily.<br>\r\nHe then made his way to the reception desk where Brock and May were waiting for them and the trio made their way into town, with Ash bringing the Super Swapper along in case he wanted to make any further changes.</span></div></div>",

Deciding that clothing and body were too much at the moment, Ash clicked into the life subset and ended up swapping his personality with May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light dimmed Ash shook his head momentarily, feeling weird in his clothes, as if they were made for someone else. He looked himself up and down and realised that something major was wrong; he was wearing May's clothes, aside from her biker shorts that is. He ran into his campsite where he found May was also flustered about what she was wearing. \"Hey, that's my outfit!\" Ash yelled at May, as he saw she was wearing 'his' clothes. \"You're right! I can't believe we were wearing each others outfits, I mean yours is so girly compared to mine\" May said, fidgeting slightly as her outfit felt so tight against her breasts. \"Well why don't we swap then? If we both feel so awkward why don't we just change clothes so that everything is normal?\" said Ash. \"That's not a bad idea, I do feel kind of exposed in your clothes, no offence but they are almost skin tight.\" The pair then made their way behind two bushes outside of their campsite (as they didn't want Brock to know what was happening) so that they could witch outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh pulled his hoodie over his head along with his undershirt, finding it too be far too hot and stuffy compared to what he thought he was used to. He then pulled his biker shorts off his legs and took off his boxer shorts; along with his shoes and socks. Behind another bush, May squeezed out of her shirt, finding it to be far too tight on her chest, barely being able to get it over her much too large breasts. She then struggled to take off her bra, fumbling with the strap before she eventually got it off. She then pulled off her jeans, finding an incredibly skimpy and tight thong over her groin which she pulled down around her ankles, unfastening the straps of her shoes and rolling her socks down her ankles and taking them off before throwing them over to Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being hit by a bundle of May's clothes, Ash sorted through the pile and began dressing himself. Pulling out a bra from the bottom of the pile, Ash fastened the much too tight undergarment around his chest, feeling a sense of relief despite not having any breasts for it to hold. He then slid the thong up his legs, squeezing his penis between his legs for it to fit somewhat comfortably, despite being far too small for him and built for a girl. while also pulling it tight between his ass, loving how it fit on him along with the silky texture that it had which was much softer than his old boxers.  He then tugged on his socks and shoes which. We're several sizes too small for him, the pressure on his feet making him lose all feeling in them soon after, but keeping them on regardless. He then struggled into her t-shirt which was tailored for someone of a much slimmer build, barely getting it over his new bra despite it holding nothing whatsoever. He managed to get it on however, finding it a bit hard to breathe but still thought that he looked great with his figure regardless, despite having no curves and a major bulge which made his womanly figure even more masculine. He then slipped on May's gloves, bandanna and fanny pack which were by far the easiest to get on (although the gloves were incredibly tight on him). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he had finished dressing, he found that May was wearing his outfit which looked rather baggy on her slim frame and seemed as if it was about to slide off her at any moment. Still thinking like each other, Ash and May made their way back to their camp where they began thinking of what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not thinking anything of it, Ash put the remote away in his bag to look over at a later point. That night while in his tent, Ash began to investigate the remote, finding a number of buttons labelled with various different words such as clothing, personality and body. Not knowing what it would do, Ash went to sleep, trying to work out what the remote could possibly do.<br>\r\nAsh awoke the next morning having dreamt that he had used the remote to swap his traits with Dawn. Not knowing what else to do with the remote, Ash decided he would at least try it out on Dawn, not expecting anything to really happen. He made his way out to their portable breakfast table and began tinkering with the remote again. Shortly after, Dawn came out of her tent still in her pyjamas carrying a towel and a set of regular clothes, about to make her way to the nearby river to wash up and get ready. Before she could get out of sight, Ash quickly pressed one of the buttons at random to see if anything would happen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not knowing what had changed, Ash glanced around to see if he could find any major changes. Rather quickly, he noticed that Dawn was no longer wearing her pink pyjamas, but was instead wearing the boxers and t-shirt that he had worn to bed. This looked rather odd on Dawn, as usually she would wear much more feminine clothing compared to the boyish outfit she was now in. Realising that if she was in his outfit, Ash must in turn be wearing Dawn's pyjamas! Looking down at himself Ash saw that he was in fact wearing her pyjamas! He was now adorned in her tight pink full body pyjamas that were much snugger than he would have expected. They seemed to be made out of silk or a similar material as they were incredibly soft and nice to wear, Ash could also feel Dawns underwear constricting his genitals, which felt odd yet strangely nice as they were made of a similar material. Ash felt a bit embarrassed to be wearing such a girly outfit, but since Dawn wasn't freaking out he assumed that everyone would find this normal. He ran his hand up and down his body and loved how soft everything now was! He decided to head back into his tent to get changed, bringing the remote along with him. As he walked, the soft material of his pj's and his new, tight panties began to make him feel slightly aroused, blushing slightly as he was being turned on by wearing Dawns clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed into the tent only to find that the clothes he had left out to wear had been replaced by Dawns as well! His entire wardrobe had changed, not just what he was wearing at the time! Slightly thrilled by this, Ash sat down to consider what he'd do with the remote. As he did however, whatever way he sat down made his panties shift slightly so they were now slightly up his butt crack and pulled even tighter around his member! Something about this made Ash shudder in pleasure, causing his already semi-erect member to stand at full attention! Not wanting Dawn to come back and find him with an erection, Ash quickly decided to masturbate while still in the pj's. Putting his hand down his pants, he quickly began to jerk off, finding that the soft, somewhat tight clothes were really helping him along! The more he jerked, the more that his panties found their way between his ass, which was seriously turning him on now. Reaching a climax, Ash released his load inside his new panties, making things quite uncomfortable and sticky. Feeling a bit ashamed of himself for masturbating in his best friends outfit, Ash quickly stripped and got out of his panties, finding a fresh pair in his bag, he put on a skimpy pink thong as when his panties had crept into his ass he got incredibly turned on, and wanted to experience that feeling even more. He then wrestled with a bra, eventually getting it onto his chest, although it was quite uncomfortable since he had never worn one before. He then put on one of Dawns white undershirt and black tank top. Sighing slightly, he then pulled up Dawns short pink miniskirt, finding that it hardly covered him, and that his slightly hairy legs were clearly on display. He then slipped on her knee high black socks and her pink boots, as well as slipped on her pink and white beanie while securing the gold clips into his hair, although they didn't do much other than make him look a bit silly. Bending over to pick up his bag, Ash gasped slightly as he could feel his thong slide between his cheeks even further! Trying to straighten them out only proved to make things worse as the material shifting around just made the feeling even nicer for him. He could feel himself getting aroused, but still felt spent from his previous session so tried to ignore it. Standing back up, Ash could clearly see a large tent in his miniskirt which made him blush since he'd have to speak to Dawn soon. Gradually the erection went away, but every movement he made would reignite it, making him worry that he'd have to change out of the thong, or perhaps switch with Dawn even more... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then made his way out of the tent just as Dawn was arriving back, seeing that she was now dressed fully in his outfit. Strangely she acted as if everything was normal, even complimenting him on how he looked. Looking over himself, he didn't like how his hairy legs looked in the skirt and he could plainly see the bulge in his skirt, and began to consider switching with Dawn further...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seven year old Nobisuke Nobi woke up early that morning, wondering why his mother and father were not awake yet.  But his father, Dr. Nobita Nobi had been up all night trying to finish a major robotics project for the Tokyo Police Force.  His mother Shizuka was still dressed in her street clothes when she came home the night before and passed out on the couch.  The meetings she had to attend and the late subway ride home completely wiped her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobisuke was still hungry though, he thought of waking his mother to cook breakfast, but the last time she did she was so tired she put the egg shells in the pan with the eggs.  Suddenly he saw a robot cat walk into the room, it was Doreamon whom Dr. Nobi had rebuilt to try to guide his son toward good behavior.  It was not an easy task for Doreamon, as the robot cat was very trusting and Nobisuke was very sly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doreamon!  I'm hungry, you got anything to eat!\" Nobisuke cried.  \"No, you ate all the cupcakes the other day.\" Doreamon scolded him, the robot was hungry as well.  Thanks to the 22 century technology that built him, he could keep going on foodstuffs like any normal creature.  However he had no idea what to do about their situation as both their hungry bellies rumbled for more food.  \"Doreamon, don't you have some sort of gadget that we can use to make breakfast?\" Nobisuke asked him.  \"Hmm... let me see.\" Doreamon said as he dug into his pouch the infamous gadgets he kept in the pouch.  As he dug, a metallic wrist band fell out on the floor.  \"Hey what's that?\" Nobisuke asked.  \"Oh, that's the Super Swapper!\" Doreamon said as he continued to look in his pouch.  \"How does it work?\" the young boy asked him.  \"Oh, it's real simple.  I'll show you.\" the Robot Cat said as it picked up the metallic band.  He put it on his right wrist aiming it at Nobisuke.  \"Hey!  What are you doing!\" Nobisuke protested as a ray of energy struck him from the metallic band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was instantly disoriented then realized he was standing in a differnet place.  Before him stood Doreamon, who strangely had his face atop of the body of a young boy.  In his confusion, Nobisuke looked down at his hands, and realized they were robotic, but cat like.  \"Hey, you switched heads with me?\" he said at the Robot Cat head that smiled at him from his body.  \"Yes, you did.  The Super Swapper was therapeutic device where in the 22nd century poor people are paired up with those with disabilities and those recovering from serious injury.  The Swapper allows them to share bodies so that they both gain self confidence to recover from their situations.  Poverty is seen as a disease in the 22nd Century?\" Nobisuke recalled with out knowing.  \"More of a condition that people must recover from\", Doreamon added.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobisuke thought of  the strange metallic band realized suddenly it had the following functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Super Swapper was the metallic band Doreamon was wearing on his around his right wrist. Even though in became invisible when worn, only those with another Super Swapper or 22nd century robotic sense could see it. The device cannot permanently attach itself, however it can be taken off like a wrist watch.  The Swapper actually adjusts reality locally after each swap so that everything seems normal, explaining how a boy's head could be attached to a robot cat's body. Any swap can be noticed by anyone else wearing another Super Swapper. If they remove their Super Swapper from their wrist, they will still be aware of the the swaps that happened while they wore it, but will not notice any swaps that happen while they aren't wearing it.  The Super Swapper only swaps between it's user and the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobisuke was able to see the device on Doreamon's wrist.  He noticed it had 5 buttons that correspond to the 5 categories of reality alteration it could do, it had a screen on it that displays the options for each swap,  2 arrow buttons to scroll the options on the screen, a button to approve each part of a swap, and the activation button.  The Swapper could alter it's self to make more buttons appear and disappear, but that wasn't important now.  Nobisuke was to fascinated by the information filling into his brain about the Super Swappper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke aloud, \"It swaps of any of the 4 categories can be all at once or only one or a few.  When doing a swap, you select the options before hand, then aim at the target and press the activation button. Whoever it is aimed at when you press the activation button will be swapped with, whether it was the intended target or not.  When using the Life and Personality options together, if you switch lives with someone, and then switch personalities with that person while still in their life, you will receive their own original personality instead of the personality of their current life.\"  \"Interesting being Robot isn't it\" Doreamon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though they will be completely aware that the swap happened, switches that affect them mentally such as Personality and certain Life options will have full effect. They will know that they have switched, but how they now act will seem perfectly normal to them.  The Super Swapper only works on living things, and certain options do not work on animals.\"  Nobisuke said.  \"And it works on robot cats like myself  from the 22nd century, because it was made to do so.  But not on real cats\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caution:  Very hard impacts, and electrical surges to the device will cause the device to temporarily malfunction, and the device will not always perform the intended swaps and it may choose random options instead. This malfunction does not change how the device works.  The Super Swapper shall not swap with someone else with a Super Swapper without their permission.\" Nobisuke said as he became more fascinated with the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Super Swap may swap body-parts by charging Clothes with reality alternating energies, so the user can obtain the body parts of the person who last wore the item.  In this way the following body part swaps may be made.<br>\r\nSwap Torso - Shirts<br>\r\nSwap Legs - Pants, skirts, shorts<br>\r\nSwap Feet - Shoes, socks, or any footwear<br>\r\nSwap Heads - Glasses, hats<br>\r\nSwap Reproductive Organs - Any lower Undergarments, also bras will cause replacement of chests  (Nobisuke blushes when he said this aloud)<br>\r\nSpecial swamps can be made charging Earrings, Makeup, and other accessories making minor body part swaps.  Earrings can swap ears with previous wearing.  Eyeliner can swap eyes with the previous user.  Lipstick will swap lips with the person who last used it.  Tattoos maybe be swapped by charging them on the targets' skin and placing your skin on the tattoo to swap it.  Oh that sounds so cool!\" Nobisuke exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of these swaps will work on animals as it's against programing\" Nobisuke continued.  \"That's right\" Doreamon said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Body parts maybe directly targeted and highlighted on the screen.  The following swap maybe done.  Full Body swaps, Head swaps which replace everything below the user's neck with the target's body.  Hairswaps to move the hair from the target onto the user's body, leaving the target with the user's hair.  Eye swaps may also be used, though care must be taken to know the target's ability to see.  Facial or body hair swaps with targets the user can also execute with out trouble.\" Nobisuke continued as he smiled.  He thought to himself, \"Now I can get a mustache or a beard like dad's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The swapping of target's torso, arms, hands, legs, feet, reproductive organs (almost burst out laughing), voice, and skin may easily be done with this device with the user.  None of these Body swaps will target animals\" Nobisuke said.  \"Why is that Doreamon?\" he stopped to ask the Cat Robot head with his body.  \"People did too much mischief in my time.  So they made the Swapper where it wouldn't select animals as targets.\" Doremon asked as continued to patiently listen to Nobisuke rattle off the abilities of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another ability of the device is Lifeswap.  With the reality altering power of Lifeswap, the user may swap first names with a target.  Swap skills, such as mechanical, artistic, or mental skills.  Swap relationships with target persons to swap placement in families.  Swap social status with others.  Swap occupation with others as it pertains to work or school.  All these swaps may take single, multiple or whole swaps with target.  These abilities are to help the user learn valuable lessons and encourage them to see that they have the ability to direct their life.  Also Gender can be swapped in two different ways, either the user may actually physically be altered to become the gender of the target he choses, or the user can swap Gender perception where all in the local area will see the user as the opposite gender despite keeping original physical form.  Age perception is also available, where others will see the user as the age he obtains from a target person.  Also possession my be obtained with this device, provided you have another possession of the same size and weight to swap out with it.\"  Nobisuke said as he listened to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Read this to understand who the characters are))<br>\r\nDoreamon(Manga)<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://doraemon.wikia.com/wiki/Doraemon_%28manga%29\" target=\"_blank\">http://doraemon.wikia.com/wiki/Doraemon_...</a><br>\r\nBased on The Last Episode of Doreamon(fanfiction)<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.kejut.com/doraemon1\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.kejut.com/doraemon1</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Seems you can't target two targets and swap between them.\" Nobisuke asked Doreamon again.  \"That caused even more trouble than the animal swaps.  A person with a device capable of that could cause city wide havoc.  In the city of Akita, it was once nick-named \"Headswap Town\" because a boy misused that device.  Any sudden loud sound could cause the populace to suddenly and randomly swap heads.  Took years to fix that.  Also notice, you can only swap objects with another object.  It used to be able to swap bodyparts for objects, but criminals started stealing bodyparts from innocent people.  So that was disabled as well.\" Doreamon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personality, Interest swaps, or mannerisms such as posture, way you walk, or speech inflection can be swapped wholly or partially.  Wait I am getting this image of Dad as a boy on the body of a GoGo Dancer?\" Nobisuke said as he crinkled his face at the image.  \"Um, that's enough.  Let's swap back.\" Doreamon said as he activated the bracelet restoring their heads to their perspective bodies.  \"Let me have that bracelet.  I've got an idea how to get breakfast\" Nobisuke told the Cat Robot.  \"Really!  What's the idea\" Doreamon said as he trustingly handed over the bracelet.  \"You'll see\" Nobisuke said as he put the metallic bracelet on his wrist.  \"You aren't gonna target me?\" Doreamon asked nervously.  \"No, someone that make breakfast!\" Nobisuke replied, as he walked over to the couch where his mother was passed out.  \"Poor Mom.  She's so tired.  I got an idea how to let her sleep\" he said as Doreamon looked closely at the two of them.  \"What are you doing?\" the Robot Cat asked.  Nobisuke sat next to his mother on the opposite side of the couch, then pointed the Super Swapper at her and fired it.  Suddenly Mrs. Shizuka Nobi's sleeping head was resting on her son's body on the couch.  Nobisuke's head and the bracelet transferred over to the rest of Mrs. Nobi's body.  The son, now physically his mother from the neck down got up out of the couch.  \"Ow!  Mom's body is so sore!  I hope I never get this old!\" he said as she stretched his mother's body in an effort to ease the pain.  Doreamon rolled his eyes at that comment, Nobisuke would get that old and older according to his records of the 22nd century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobisuke took off his mother's black coat and walked over into the kitchen.  He started to prepare the stove to cook.  \"You sure you should be using the stove!\" Doreamon objected.  \"Relax.  I swapped over he ability to cook.  I know everything she would know\" Nobisuke said as he rapidly put his mother's body into motion to make breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Nobi awoke to the sound of the stove going.  He got dressed and went down to get breakfast.  There he saw his wife Shizuka cooking breakfast still clad in her black blouse and blue mini skirt, wearing an apron over them as she worked the fry pan.  He walked over and kissed his wife on the cheek, completely oblivious that his son's countenance was now crowning the top of her neck.   \"Morning Dad, err...  Nobita\" Nobisuke replied, he really strained to remember what his mother called his father.  \"Morning love.   You work so hard, then come home to cook breakfast.  How did your deal with Kiba Tech go yesterday\" he asked her, who was really his son.  \"Um, it went well I think.  I'll know later.\" Nobisuke said, figuring that was convincing enough.  \"Alright dear.  I know those deals go.  Hopefully you will luck out and we can go out and celebrate this week, you know together.\" Dr. Nobi said as he reached an arm tightly around his wife's waist.  Nobisuke made an pleading face to Doreamon, he felt very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobita!  How are you this morning!\" Doreamon spoke to the Doctor.  \"Ah!  Doreamon, old friend.  Ready to tell me the nature of your current mission this time?  I was so surprised when you showed up at our door about a month ago.\" Dr. Nobi replied  \"It's good to see you too Doctor.  I was very appreciative of your help, it was no fun laying there with my battery drained out.\" Doreamon replied.  \"No, I should thank you.  Your predicament taught me I had to get off my duff and study.  Thanks to you I am the Roboticist I am today.  I only wish that you can do the same for our son, right love?\" Dr. Nobi said turning back to his wife.  \"Um right...\" Nobisuke said uncomfortably as he realized his father was totally fooled by the device into thinking that Nobisuke was his mother Shizuka.  Well technically from the neck down he was, but that was another story and one he was beginning to regret as he continued to make breakfast.  \"Um, why don't you guys go over to the table to talk?  I am almost done cooking here.\" Nobisuke told them, realizing the advantages of his borrowed identity.  \"Let's go to the table, Doctor!\" Doreamon asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Nobi and Doreamon sat down as Nobisuke served them with precision of food serving he borrowed from his mother along with her body.  \"Say, where is Nobisuke!  He should be enjoying this breakfast!\", Dr. Nobi said as he began to tear into the food.  \"I'll go get him!\", Nobisuke said, taking advantage of the fact that the Swapper had fooled his father into thinking he was his mother.  He then walked down to the sofa where his mother Shizuka's head was still asleep on his body.  He sat down next to her and with a quick operation of the Super Swapper, he restored his mother and himself back the way they had been.  Nobisuke then walked back to the table, now in his own body, and sat down to eat.  \"Sleeping a little late?\" Dr. Nobi chastised him.  \"A little.\" Nobisuke said, deciding he would take the blame for oversleeping for his mother today.  Then Mrs. Nobi walked over, her eyes still bleary, \"Oh!  Who made breakfast?\"  \"Um, you did dear!\", Dr. Nobi replied to his wife.  \"I.. I did?\" she asked as she searched her memory for any evidence of this, but it was really too early in the morning.  She carefully sat down and stared at the eggs she was told she prepared.  Her memory of the eggshell incident or the time she was so tired she accidentally substituted Garlic Powder for Parmesan Cheese, the memories of those culinary disasters made her apprehensive to eat.  Seeing her husband and her son were enjoying it made her have the courage to try it.  It was quite good, just like she would have made it.  \"I must have been sleep cooking!\", Mrs. Nobi remarked as she shoved a mouthful in and began to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Nobi, Mrs. Nobi, and Nobisuke got ready for their day.  Nobisuke could tell despite the break he gave to his mother earlier, she was still tired and sleepy.  She had a big negotiation with Lex Corp, which was suing Kaiba Corp for patent infringement.  She always complained when she had to be present at a meeting between Seto Kaiba and Lex Luthor, today would be a long day for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Nobi had much programming to do, his work on the new \"Laborer\" Project interested Nobisuke, though he disliked his father's assistant Eichi Hoba as he never wanted to talk.  He learned from his father, Eichi had been to America and attended Texas A &amp; M.   He had little good to say about America, though Nobisuke learned he kept with the Texas A &amp; M Football through his father.   Eichi had an icon dedicated to the Fightin' Aggies hanging in his office.  Today his father would be getting a visit from a from Magnus Robotics today, and he stayed up all night preparing for presentation for them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobisuke touched his bracelet, he realized he could impersonate either of his parents if he did it right.  But maybe he should think of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Read of Laborers and Eichi Hoba)<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.freewebs.com/jamesreview/patlabor.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.freewebs.com/jamesreview/patl...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Read of Lex Corp)<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.tgdaily.com/entertainment/55257-stock-and-trade-lexcorp\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tgdaily.com/entertainment/552...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Read of Kaiba Corp)<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/KaibaCorp\" target=\"_blank\">http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/KaibaCorp</a></span></div></div>",

Veemon, though, is not as comfortable as he thought he would be, (understandable, since the clothes are designed to be worn by a human of Davis' hight, not a lillte Digimon like Veemon), so Veemon quickly hands the clothes back to Davis. However, Veemon then takes out the Super Swapper and swaps Davis' clothes to himself, so that the clothes now fit his Digimon body perfectly, and leaving Davis naked.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>DemiVeemon stretched and yawned. He had just woken up from a very pleasant dream, involving a thirty-foot tall stuffed Thanksgiving turkey, just for him. He yawned again and looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the Digidestined had defeated MaloMyotismon just a few months ago, his partner, Davis, had actually matured a little. Before that, his room was usually quite messy; with old chips bags, some dirty laundry, ect. just laying everywhere. Now, his room was relatively clean; the only things laying around now being his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Davis, he was currently still sleeping on his bed, snoring up a storm. Davis' newfound maturity had also extended to his attire; instead of the yellow pajamas he used to sleep in, he now wore a white T-shirt and a pair of dark blue boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his partner, DemiVeemon thought: 'Ever since MaloMyotismon bit the dust, Davis has been more chipper than ever. He doesn't even slack off as much in school now. He's really enjoying everything he can.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemiVeemon sighed. 'You know, it must be nice being a human. Going to school, playing soccer, hanging out with your friends...' He sighed again. 'Sometimes, I really wish that I could be a human, like Davis.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further thoughts from DemiVeemon were interrupted, because at that moment, the screen on Davis' computer started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, what's with the lightshow?' thought DemiVeemon, as something came out of the computer screen. When the light died down, DemiVeemon saw what it was. It looked like some sort of armband with a bunch of different buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the heck is this thing?' thought DemiVeemon, as he reached out to touch it. The moment that he did touch it, he could feel himself getting stronger and bigger. When the feelings stopped, he had digivolved into Veemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is going on here?' thought Veemon. 'How did I suddenly digivolve without Davis' help?' Veemon spun around to see if Davis had noticed anything. He hadn't. Davis was the kind of guy who could almost only be woken by his alarm clock. In fact, a herd of stampeding elephants could have passed right by him, without waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back towards the armband, Veemon reached for it, thinking: 'Now, what exactly are you?' When he touched it this time, he could feel his mind being filled with information about this new device. When he regained his bearings, he held the device up to his face, going over all of the new information in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, this thing is called a Super Swapper,' thought Veemon, as he studied it more carefully. As he mentally went over the functions of the Swapper, he smiled as realization dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is perfect! This is why it caused me to digivolve; so I could used this thing easier!' thought Veemon, as he put the Super Swapper on his right arm. 'Thanks to this little humdinger, I can not just become a human like Davis; I can actually BECOME Davis!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards his still sleeping partner, Veemon aimed the Super Swapper at Davis and prepared to push the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

'I can't swap bodies with Davis; I don't know the first thing about actually BEING a human! Sure, I know that the Swapper alters reality to make it seem normal, but even so, other people might get suspicious if I end up acting more like a Digimon than a human.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his hands, Veemon started to think things through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, I could just swap knowledge of how to be human with Davis, but that would be too easy. I want to experience being a human, while still being 'me' mentally and keeping things otherwise normal. Hmmm..... what to do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an idea popped into his head. 'I've got it! I'll simply make due with just swapping one aspect of being a human, between Davis and me! That way, I can get used to that one thing, before I swap another! Yeah, that's it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon once more looked over at the sleeping Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, what human aspect should I swap with Davis?' Veemon thought long and hard about this. Finally, he thought he had an answer. 'What about if I swap clothes between Davis and me? Wearing clothes is something that I've never tried, so that would be something I would have to get used to. Plus,' Veemon sniggered, 'watching Davis go about his day in the nude, without anyone finding it weird, is just too funny to pass up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Veemon choose?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Yeah, I think getting used to wearing clothes takes priority over other things,' decided Veemon. Aiming the Super Swapper once more at Davis, Veemon got ready to press the 'clothes swap' button. However, before he could, another thought occured to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hold on! According to the information about the Super Swapper, if I press that button, then I'll get Davis' clothes. The problem is, that the clothes will be altered to suit me perfectly. That won't do! I want to become a human, sure, but I don't want that drastic a change right now. If I want to get used to wearing human clothes, then I shouldn't alter them. Otherwise, they would be Digimon clothes instead of human clothes. Besides, it just wouldn't be as funny! No, I'll have to think of a way to get it as I want it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon thought hard about his little dilemma for about five minutes. Then he got an idea. Fiddling a little with the buttons on the Super Swapper, he finally found the setting he was looking for. He then aimed the Super Swapper at Davis and pressed the button he'd found. When the flash from the swap died down, nothing appeared to have been changed; Davis was still sleeping soundly in his bed, still wearing his clothes and Veemon was still standing on the desk, pointing the Super Swapper at Davis. But Veemon really had swapped something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep Davis' clothes from being altered to suit him, Veemon had instead chosen to swap simple ownership of the clothes, with Davis. That way, the clothes all stayed at their regular size, yet they all now belonged to Veemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his arm, Veemon heard Davis' alarm clock ringing. 'Whew, just in time!' thought Veemon, as Davis began to stir. 'Now, if all went according to plan, even though they are still human-sized, Davis should think that all of his clothes are really mine now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Davis sat up, groggy from having just woken up, Veemon thought: 'Perhaps I should call Davis out on him wearing 'my' clothes and see his reaction! Then again, it just might be funnier, if he was allowed to notice it himself!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Veemon choose?</span></div></div>",

He thought: 'I hope that Super Swapper worked,' before he continued pretend-yelling at Davis: \"Would you mind telling me why you are wearing my clothes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking about Veemon?\" said Davis sleepily. When Veemon simply pointed down in respone, Davis looked down at himself. It took a few seconds for him to properly register everything, but when he did, he jumped up with a yelp of shock, all traces of tiredness completely vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahh!!! You're right Veemon!\" exclaimed Davis. \"How did I end up wearing your clothes?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you know; that Swapper-thingy worked!' thought Veemon to himself exitedly, while out loud, he pretended to still be angry at Davis, by yelling: \"I don't care how you got them on, just get them off, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, Veemon!,\" stuttered Davis, as he frantically began to take off the T-shirt and boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Veemon looked angry on the outside, on the inside he was doing cartwheels out of excitement. 'It really worked!' he thought. 'Thanks to that Super Swapper, Davis' clothes are now all mine and no one finds it weird at all!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Davis had managed to take off both the white T-shirt and the dark blue boxers, leaving him completely in the nude. Still pretending to be slightly miffed at him, Veemon said: \"Now, could you please explain to me why you were wearing my clothes in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly have no idea, Veemon,\" said Davis. \"I'm certain that I went to bed as normal last night; so I don't know why I was suddenly wearing your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know why,' sniggered Veemon mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can figure out how this happened, later; I have to get ready for shcool,\" said Davis and as he threw the T-shirt and the boxers over to Veemon, who caught them, he added: \"You'd better hurry and get dressed, Veemon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh! They are your clothes after all!\" said Davis and crossed his arms. \"Besides, it just wouldn't be decent of YOU to stroll around naked, even inside the house. Don't you remember the time when you tried to go out naked like me, and all those people ended up calling you a pervert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right! I forgot!\" Veemon played along. But secretly, he was impressed with just how much the Super Swapper had altered reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hurry up and get your clothes on, Veemon; I have to get ready for shcool,\" said Davis, still buck-naked, before he walked into the kitchen, leaving Veemon, still holding the T-shirt and boxers, alone in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Veemon stood for a minute, still holding the T-shirt and the boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should I really put these on now?' he thought. 'Thanks to that Super Swapper altering reality, all of Davis' clothes have become mine now, so I suppose I should put them on.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon thought more about it, before he made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nah, it can wait,' he thought, letting the clothes fall to the floor. 'I'd rather observe Davis as much as possible before he leaves for school. I don't want to miss one moment of this funny situation. I can put on the clothes once Davis leaves.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon walked over to the door and peeked out. He had to cover his mouth with his hands, so he wouldn't end up laughing loudly at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis was sitting buck-naked at the kitchen table, eating his usual breakfast cerial. Veemon of course knew that this was normal for Davis in this altered reality, but that didn't stop it from being funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Amazing!' thought Veemon. 'Davis is just going about his morning rutine as always, exept that he's now naked and he thinks that's perfectly normal for him! This is hilarious!!!' Veemon had to really restrain himself from bursting out laughing. 'It's a good thing that Davis and I are the only ones here at the moment; otherwise I'd never be able to get away with spying on him like this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Davis and Veemon were currently the only two individuals in the apartment. Davis' mom and sister were out of town at the moment, visiting a sick aunt of theirs. Surprisingly, Davis had actually managed to follow the instructions that his mother had left quite well, even as far as the food went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of food, Davis had finished eating his cerial. He walked over to the dishwasher and put his plate in it. Veemon then observed the naked Davis walking across the room and entering the bathroom. Judging from the sounds coming from in there, Davis was in the middle of brushing his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still can't believe it,' thought Veemon, still trying his best not to laugh. 'Davis is walking around completely naked and he doesn't find anything odd about it at all! That Super Swapper is really impressive!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon ducked back inside Davis' room, when he heard Davis finishing up in the bathroom. A few moments later, Davis walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Veemon!\" he said when he saw his partner. \"How come you're still not dressed yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Just haven't decided on what outfit I should wear, I guess,\" fibbed Veemon. He found it harder and harder to bite back the laughter, but he managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just don't take too long,\" said Davis, as he found his school-books and made to put them in his backpack. \"I don't want to come home and find that the police arrested you for 'public indecency', Veemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words, Veemon had to quickly cover both his mouth and nose with his hands, to prevent a laughing-fit, although he still let out a definite snort of laughter. Davis didn't notice however, as he was busy staring at something in his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Davis?\" asked Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked at Veemon with a slightly guilty expression and said: \"Uh... Veemon? I swear, I have no idea how it happened, but...\" He then pulled out several things from the backpack; a red T-shirt with a white number '18' on the back of it, a white pair of shorts with a red stripe down the side, long white socks with a red stripe near the top, and a pair of red, white and black sports-shoes. It was Davis' soccer uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis continued: \"Honestly , Veemon, I don't know how your soccer clothes ended up in my backpack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My soccer clothes?\" Veemon was confused. \"But I don't play soccer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, of course not!\" said the naked Davis as he put on the backpack. \"But, you do like to wear them at all of my soccer matches, right? So you can better 'live myself into the game'! Those were your words, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, of course! I was just messing with you,\" lied Veemon. He seemed casual enough, but as soon as Davis turned away from him, Veemon had to grab one of the pillows from the bed and giggle into it. The whole situation was becoming so ridiculous, that Veemon almost couldn't hold back his amusement anymore. Quick as a flash, he placed the pillow back on the bed, before Davis turned back towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm off to school now,\" he said. \"Just don't forget to put some clothes on. Okay, Veemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it, Davis,\" said Veemon, straining to keep up his calm facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\" said Davis as he walkedout of the room. \"See you after school!\" Veemon heard the front door open and close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon quickly ran over to the window and looked outside. It wasn't long before he could see Davis walk out into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Veemon, the entire scene was absurd; although Davis clearly passed by a bunch of people down at the street, not one of those people as much as lifted an eyebrow, when the 11-year old nude boy wearing just a backpack, passed by them. Everyone in the world, apart from Veemon, just found it perfectly normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing this, Veemon could no longer restrain himself. He fell on his back and roared with laughter as he rolled around on the floor, guffawing hysterically like he had just been told the funniest joke of all time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'UNBELIEVEABLE!!!' he thought between bursts of laughter. 'Not one of the humans down there spared a second glance at Davis; even though he was walking around buck-naked!!! I love this Super Swapper!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally composing himself, Veemon got back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, that was fun,' he thought. 'But now that the fun is over, I'd better get down to buissness. Because I used the Super Swapper to alter reality, I'm the one who's supposed to wear clothes now.' He looked at the many articles of clothing scattered around the room. 'The only question now is: What should I wear?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Veemon choose?</span></div></div>",

It Looked kinda like a watch but way more high tech, like something out of a sci-fi anime. Curious she crouched down and picked it up to give it a closer look. seven buttons and a screen. Clothing, Body, Life, Personality, Activate, and two arrows pointing opposite ways<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of watch is this?\" She murmured hitting one of the named buttons only to have the screen read 'Device Locked. Please wear before activation.'... She looked around briefly on the empty side street for anyone who may have dropped it but she was the only one there. Unable to halt her curiosity she rolled up her sleeve and placed the metal band on her wrist and it fastened itself on securely. 'Device Lock Lifted. Awaiting Input.' the screen read for a moment before going blank. With a curious noise she began fiddling with the buttons and looking through the options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swapping... This keeps talking about swapping things. But these options aren't working... No valid targets? \" she stood up fully and looked around. \"Does that mean I need to pick another person and... swap with them?\" that would make sense... what didn't was many of the options she'd seen on there... swapping body parts? Lives? personality traits? it was just so unreal... Maybe it was just some toy from an anime or something? There was only one way to find out really. \"Oh shoot, I need to get back home to get ready for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the run, her mind was dominated by the possibilities and what ifs. The metal band feeling heavy on her wrist with the possibilities. Arriving home to the smell of breakfast cooking she greeted to room with a cheerful. \"I'm back!\" Receiving a nod and a smile from her father and grunt of acknowledgement from the Panda across the shogi board from him. Nabiki offered a blearly wave, still waking up from a late night doing whatever she got up to... Kasumi peeked out from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took a lot longer with run then usual.\" she said sounding somewhat concerned. \"Breakfast is nearly ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a little sidetracked sorry.\" she said with a slight flush of embarrassment. \"I'll just have to skip my morning training in the dojo for today. I'll just take a quick bath to clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the heads up.\" She smiled as she watched her sister turn and head back to the stove... her mind turned back to the device on her wrist. Her gaze shifted between the kitchen and the front table. She pulled her sleeve up and bit her lips. Now she had some valid targets...</span></div></div>",

It seemed it was limited to who was in visual range as Kasumi wasn't appearing among the valid targets despite being just a little ways off in the Kitchen. She settled on Nabiki and after a moment's hesitation confirmed her option. Reality seemed to skip for a moment before she felt hair tickling the nape of her neck. pulling a lock in front of her eyes she saw brown hair.... it worked. Then that would mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeks around the corner to see her sister drowsily reading a magazine, her own short cropped blue hair on her head. Moreover no one seemed to notice the change. Her father, ever on to overreact to the slightest thing, was looking right at Nabiki before going back to his game with no reaction at all. Akane looked down to the wrist device with wonder and a small bit of fear. She could swap anything this watch would let her... and no one would even know? She swallowed heavily and quickly swapped her hair back before skulking off to the bathroom, mind buzzing with possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe changed out of her clothes, too distracted to even lock the door behind her. Slipping into the bath she sets the watch onto the sid eof the tub, staring at it. Should she tell someone? If the others found out it would no doubt turn into a Chaotic mess as it usually did when magical items got involved... so should she just use it than? It could solve so many problems... but it could cause just as many.</span></div></div>",

Be sure to check out his version. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same as his, but instead in the world of anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Super Swapper<br>\r\n-It is a metalic band worn around the wrist. While worn, only those with another Super Swapper can see it. The device is not attatched, and can be taken off.<br>\r\n-Reality adjusts after each swap so that everything seems normal. Swaps are only noticed by those with a Super Swapper. If they take off the Super Swapper, they will still be aware of the the swaps that happened while they wore it, but will not notice any swaps that happen while they don't wear it.<br>\r\n-Swaps are between the user and the target.<br>\r\n-The device has a 5 buttons that correspond to the 5 categories, a screen on it that displays the options for each swap, and 2 arrow buttons to scroll the options on the screen, a button to approve each part of a swap, and the activation button.<br>\r\n-Swaps of any of the 4 categories can be all at once or only one or a few.<br>\r\n-When doing a swap, you select the options before hand, then aim at the target and press the activation button.
