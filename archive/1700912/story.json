YOU ARE PHYSICALLY BATMAN!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched atop the northeast corner of 'Wane Tower', you tune your earpiece into a distress call of a pilot for the national guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayday, Mayday! C-130 Alpha-one-niner is going down over the city!\" the pilot strains, \"Request permission to drop payload to maintain control of the aircraft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a *crackle* and *buzz* on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you copy?! Over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the plane headed strait for your perch, and hear the pilot make an urgent command to his crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it! Drop the load, NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of large crates spill out of the ass end of the plane and tumble towards the city streets below. You watch as the plane makes a hard turn to avoid the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Get the rest of that shit off plane! We're still losing altitude!... Oh, SH**crackle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last transmission you hear before the plane crashes into another tower in a huge fireball. The next thing you hear are screams followed by a louder than normal laugh coming from the opposite direction of the crash. 'I best go and check it out.', you think to yourself as glide down to the direction of the screams. Upon nearing the source of the sound, you see a giant figure reaching inside one of the large crates. 'Giganta', you mutter to yourself. You land on a building closest to her face and watch her stand to her \"normal\" size of 50 feet with a large than life, pink crystal in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you up to, Giganta?\", you growl to catch her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello, Bats!\", the giant chimed gleefully; almost seeming cute. \"I'm just recovering what is rightfully mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I feel that is not rightfully yours, you over-sized bimbo.\", you return sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You silly, little man\", Giganta smiled and brought her massive face closer to yours, \"I wasn't talking about the crystal...\", she whispered before returning to her upright position. You notice the crystal begin to glow. \"I was talking about the world!\", she grunted. Throwing her arms into the air you begin to hear a faint creaking sound as you watch in horror as the once easily defeat-able villain slowly stretches skyward. With the expanding woman moaning in pleasure with the increase of power, it rapidly becomes apparent that her support garments will soon their meaning if her growth continues. Thankfully her clothes remain in tact, but only just, as her growth halts at a hight of 100 feet. The crystal, now being empty of power and color, is released from massive females' grasp and collides with the pavement below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwwahaha! Nothing shall stand in my way as I ascent into my new role as goddess of this earth!\", the behemoth bellowed, placing her hands on her hips and refocusing her eyes on you. Her pink dress covering only half of her building wide ass and exposing a pantie clad vagina which looked now like a plump, wet pair of lips being forced to fit into a child size pair of undies. The top of her dress only covered up the tips of her nipples leaving the rest of her mammaries to spill out over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly a game-changer, Giganta! I will still take you down!\", you shout to the empowered female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget, Batman, that there were multiple crystals on that plane...\", she bends straight over your building creating a 90 degree angle with her body and sticking her nose gigantic nose in your face, \"and now with my increased stature, finding the others will be a sinch!\" The self acclaimed goddess poked you with her finger causing you to stumble and fall back. This amused your gigantic foe as she giggled and snapped quickly back to her full hight which caused her massive boobs to pop out from her dress. This didn't seem to bother monster as she started heading for the next crystal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your next move? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Giganta doesn't even do you the honor of  acknowledging your attempt to stop her; she just laughed to herself and strode onward to the next crystal three blocks away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll never catch her on foot' you think. You know that your Bat-pod is parked two blocks in another direction and if you were to get it you might make it there in time to use your rockets to take her down.

Without another thought you race to get ahead of the long stride of the tall red-head. She was moving slower than you thought, with the reason being her arrogance toward the fact that she could not be stopped, and you made to the same block when she did. Giganta took a left, not knowing where to find the crystal, and you turned right and found the crystal due to Alfred telling you were to find all of the crystals throughout the city. The crystal was much to heavy to lift by yourself so you called on the help of some bystanders to move it. With Giganta still looking the wrong way, you throw some smoke bombs to cover your escape. The smoke makes a hissing noise as it escapes the canister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she hear it?</span></div></div>",

Your helpers stare up in fear and their gaze is met by Gigantas grinning face looking down her long body. The men flee it terror as she crouches over the grey mist. Giganta puffs up her cheeks and blows away the smoke, much like a three year old blowing out birthday candles, and discovers you doing your best job of guarding the crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gasp* My wish came true!\", she cheered. A massive hand reaches over you to grab the crystal and you start to beat at her fingers. She pretends not to notice you, even though it did hurt a little, and grabs up the crystal, and without hesitation she starts to grow from her crouched position. The giantess grew more rapidly this time as she doubled her size! Her clothes snapped away in an instant allowing her crotch to expand closer to you as she grew. The feminine odor you smell is almost unbearable! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the smell, Speck! But I haven't showered in a while!\", she wiggled her crotch, \"On second thought I'm not sorry!\", she said tapping her chin as if pondering her last comment, and with that you see her butt hole open as she farts on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you retaliate or head to the Bat-cave to regroup? </span></div></div>",

It was a hot day prior to nightfall, and even though her flatulence had cleared her sweaty crotch smell was more than you could handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiganta rose to her new hight of 200 feet still staring at you as you rise to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Batsy... what is your next plan to stop me?\", she scoffed; tapping her foot while in wait of your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had blown your chance of stopping her yourself, that much is certain. 'I should have went to the Bat-cave straight away when I had the chance. Now my only hope is to get to the cave and call in The League for aid.', you think to yourself.
