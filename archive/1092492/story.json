One beast she could fight easily, slitting its throat and gouging its blood red eyes before it could reach her mind.  But a nest, that would be a challenge even with her ninja training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have let the bloodsucker go, but for Malachi's challenge, that she was getting lazy and not getting her share of drone kills.  He acted like he was the only warrior in the city; alone in keeping the above-ground safe for the daily worker drones as they went about their business, oblivious to the teeming life below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence ahead, the beast had disappeared.  Eve slowed her approach, listening with all her senses, feeling her way among the litter of castoffs and trash in the intermittent light.  She had to be near a nest.  There was a pit with two rungs of a ladder visible near the top straight ahead, with the main tunnel a short jump across.  A rustling, sloughing sound, in the narrower tunnel to the right, the scent of rain and a sound of water running in the passage to her left, silence behind her.    </span></div></div>",

Standing she made her way to that side of the tunnel leaning against the cold, dank wall. Alert, creeping along and poised for action she spotted a shadow ahead and tensed, ready for battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw a flash of the creatures blood red eyes flash very close to her and she STRUCK with both hands knives flashing so fast you couldn't see them. The creature writhed with the impact and the sound she heard was insidious, a dull, sickening crack. Eve knew she hit bone and she twisted her knives in further waiting for the creatures dying hiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied it was dead she pulled her knives out, and kept them ready to strike again. Still creeping along the tunnel wall she came to a divide, kept to the right and heard more creatures. Looking beyond the dark with her ninja skills she leaned forward and this time hit two of the creatures! More glorious killing sounds and as she pulled her knives out she turned to see Mary behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"About time,\" Eve smirked. Mary only smiled, put her fingers to her lips and said, \"Shhh, follow me.\" Eve stepped over the dead bodies and quickly followed Mary. Looking back she shuddered  and watched the creatures slimy disintegrating bodies disappear.</span></div></div>",

The water was an added boon, promising protection at least from this type of creature as she scouted about. Slowly she moved toward the sound of water, keeping an eye out behind her until she felt the rain from above falling through a grate and landing on her clothes. It was a heavy downpour and in a mere moment her clothing was drenched. That did not bother her as much as it once would have, before she started fighting these demons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water ran around her calves fiercely, clean and fresh, at least until it got farther down the line. Eve breathed a slight sigh of relief, looking up through the grate once more and failing to notice a slightly glowing shape in the water, moving silently toward her then disappearing. She gasps as her head slams into the wall behind her, her feet held in a vice like grip and yanked from beneath her. Struggling she forces her arms behind her and pushes up, one hand reaching for the dagger at her hip. By now her feet were going numb and there was a hot stabbing pain radiating from where the thing grabbed her. Grunting she grabs her knife and reaches down, hacking at what was on her legs until the pressure slowly faded, leaving nothing but the pain. Carefully she pulled at the thing to see what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was long, fat, and a greyish brown color with shiny yellow and blow streaks. On the top it looked harmless, if dead, but when she turned it over she saw rows of black tipped spikes and rows of vicious circular mouths all along the spongy flesh. Great! The bloodsuckers were seeding the water with their bane-leeches, and apparently the leeches were eating well because this one was the larges she had ever seen.She was going to have to tell Malachi about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the leech corpse aside for a moment, she looked down at her legs. Her feet were regaining feeling but that was not a good thing, they hurt like hell and  her pants were practically gone from the knee down, leaving torn flesh. The area around the multiple bites was turning purple and a little yellow. Great, now she had to worry about poison in her system. Ah well, she was resistant to most of them, and as for physical damage, the bleeding had stopped so at least she was not going to bleed to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was safely out of the water but close enough to discourage the other beasty she had been chasing, she looked around and took stock of her location. Biting her lip but not hoping for much, she checked her cell signal. Nope, nothing, In her mind she imagined the Verizon guy down here, and out loud she said \"Can you hear me now?\" and let out a chuckle. Oh great, she was going loopy, she needed to get out of here fast. She could of course go back the way she just came, but she had mixed feelings about that. On the one hand there could be untold bloodsuckers back there, but that is the way she knew for sure she could get back to the others. She could also continue to follow the tunnel with the water in it, but who knew how many leeches were housed in that deceptively safe liquid, and she only had so much blood to spare. The other option she had was to try and scale the slippery wall and go up through the grate, it did look pretty loose, but she had NO idea where it would take her or if it would get her even deeper in trouble than she was now.</span></div></div>",

Not truly understanding what the hell was happening, she stayed there waiting for her chance to run. She looked at her tight form fitting t-shirt. It was her favorite Misfits t-shirt, the one that said Die, Die My Darling. She wore it often, but now regretted it, she didn't want to get any blood on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw her chance when the demon turned his head hearing a baby cry. Gwen didn't like it, but she had to think of herself right now and get a weapon. Her long blood red hair followed close behind her as she darted, her converse shoes kicked dirt up in the air in a cloud. She knew that she would be caught if ever the demon even heard her. Running so fast, she never even noticed the person who was slinking from shadow to shadow, feeling so stupid when she took a header.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both ended up on the ground. both were dazed now and any demon could've killed them, but luckily there were none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did she smack in to?</span></div></div>",

He didn't budge more move at all no matter how hard she pulled. \"Dude, we gotta leave! There's a monster back there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at her for a moment then looked in the direction of the screaming woman and crying baby. He roughly grabbed Gwens wrist and forced her off. \"Stay back.\" He ordered in a deep voice. \"Hide and don't come out until it's safe.\" He then calmly walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared after him. \"Are you crazy!?\" She hissed after him. \"You'll die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a perfect angle of him and the monster. The demon was holding up a woman and her child, screming for her life as they dangled over it's gaping mouths. She watched at the man pulled out a sword from his leather jacket. He was walking at a slow pace, and then in a blink he was on te other side of the demon, standing still. The monsters eyes went wide as its arm slowly slid off. The mother screamed as they fell to the ground, but a blur rushed by Gwen and caught the arm and jumped back by her. Gwent stared wide eyed at a woman with short black hair as she effortlessly pried open the fingers and helped the mother out of the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go!\" She said happily in a British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you!\" She shouted and ran off past Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stared after the  mother and child. \"That was...\" She stared back at the strange woman and man. \"Amazing!\" She breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster roared and stumbled back, holding its bloody arm. \"Oi! Malachi!\" The woman shouted. \"Put the bloody thing out of its misery, would ya? The thing sounds like a dieing cat and is making my ears bleed.\" She grumbled and twisted a pinky in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalachi turned his head slingtly. \"Right.\" The moster roared again as it lunged for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for the last moment before he spun around, swinging his sword at the demon. He seemed unfazed as the heads rolled past him and blood splashed on him. He took a step as the body fell to the ground in front of him. He then calmly pulled out a napkin and cleaned his sword and face. The woman rushed up to him as he tossed the wadded napkin to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Gwen slowly came out of her hiding place as she stared at the two. \"You guys are...\" She could say a full sentence she was so shocked at what she saw.

Thankfully it was busy digging for the unfortunate humans. She hated just leaving them, but what could she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh- hey!\" The girl shoved Gwen. \"What the hell is your problem! You should really watch where you're going, you know?\" She snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen blinked at her in bewilderment. Is she serious? There's a monster behind them! \"Listen, person, we have to run!\" She hissed. \"And stop shouting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't boss a stranger!\" She snapped. The demon stopped and twisted its heads around, looking for the sorce of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen began to panic as she saw the monster sniffing around. \"Girl, seriously! Shut up and move it!\" She stood and grabbed her arm, forcing her to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your problem!?\" She yanked her arm back. \"You know you're not very good at inroductions. Just what's the ma-\" She went wide eyed and screamed at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen whirled around and made eye contact with the monster. It grinned as acid dripped from both mouths. \"Run!\" She shouted and dragged the girl behind her as the monster raced after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that thing!?\" The girl shouted as they ran for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know!?\" Gwen snapped back as the monster caught up to them. Gwen egarly looked for a way out and spotted a narrow ally way. \"This way!\" She shouted and pulled the girl along with her, the monster just missing them in its jaws. They quckly squeezed themselves in and rushed towards the back. The monster pounded and roared as it tried to break open the space wider to get to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to kill us!\" The girl shouted in fright. \"Run!\" She egarly pushed Gwen along and shoved her in another ally way that veered left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly made their way down, but eventually the space was to tight to continue. They went as far as they could and stopped to breath. They could hear the monster roar in anger and continue to pound on the buldings. The girl was muttering somthing as Gwen sent a silent prayer to the heveans. After a while the monster stopped and gave a final roar. They stayed silent until they were sure the monster had left.</span></div></div>",

They'd both be dead! \"What the bloody hell are you doing here?\" She snapped annoyed and stood up. \"Don't you know there's a demon here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwens brown eyes widened, and then she quickly jumped up and covered the woman's mouth. \"Please be quiet!\" She hissed. \"The demons right back there!

You want some food!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the heads turned around and grinned at them, acid dripping from it's mouth. \"We're going to die!\" She muttered to herself. \"Are you crazy!\" She shouted at the woman. \"You've killed us both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax.\" She waved her off and smirked as the demon turned and charged at them. \"This bloke's nothing but a warm up!\" She then ran at the monster and jumped in the air, doing a spin kick in on eof the monsters two heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first head she hit colided wit the second and the demon stumbled. Gwen stared in awe. This woman was unreal! The woman then jumped and kicked the monster again, sending it to the ground. She grabbed it's arm and twisted it behind it's back. The monster shouted in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" She shouted with some effort. \"Say uncle! Say it!\" Then with a little more force she broke the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heads roared in pain and anger then twisted their heads to glare at her. Its massive tail lifted up and swung down at her. The woman spun around and grabbed the end of the tail easily. She hopped off its back then begun spinning around. Soon enough the creature was off the ground and whirling around in the air in a blur. Gwen blinked as she released the thing and sent it crashing heads first into the wall. The wall broke and crumbled, rubbled falling onto the dead monster. The woman dusted her hands off, looking satisfied, and then turned as a woman holding a baby ran out from their hiding spot towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you!\" The mother cried as the baby was finally quiet. \"You saved our lives! How can I ever repay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman cracked her knuckles. \"Well you can get out of here for one.\" She replied. \"There might be more around the area so you better get moving.\" With that she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I will.\" The mother bowed. \"Thank you again! We owe you our lives!\" She called and ran in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stepped out of her hiding place and stared at the dead demon in a daze. That woman just obliterated that thing like it was nothing! She looked at the woman then at the mother and child. What does she do now?</span></div></div>",

Averadge height,slim build, dark blond hair with light blond highlights. She is usually wearing something in the way of hip hugger jeans and a pink tank top, or some variation.
