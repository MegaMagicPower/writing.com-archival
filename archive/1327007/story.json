Armed to the teeth with 25 dollars worth of quarters with the biggest arcade in the state in front of you. Time Crisis, House of the Dead, Galaga, Gradius, DDR, even skeeball, you're primed and ready for a fun day. But first, you need a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly head on over to the soda counter and plunk down a dollar bill for your favorite soda, which the girl is more than happy to offer to you. As you pop open the drink with a 'fizzle', you wander back to the arcade floor, looking around. To your left is a row of DDR machines. Straight ahead are a bunch of the popular shooters. To your right is the soda lounge. And that's about as far as you can see. There's a bunch more beyond your line of sight, proving just how huge this arcade is. You do know that there's a new, popular game in the back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drink the familiar soda, something feels strange as it passes over your tongue and flows into your throat...it's almost strange, tingly, and bitter...and it's making you sick. Nausea is setting in. Quickly you look at the expiration date, as you've had problems there before, but the soda still seems to be fresh. What's wrong with it then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even begin to think about a refund, your vision suddenly goes blank. You never even feel yourself hit the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later (you don't know how long it could have been) you wake up on a thick, colorful fuzzy surface. It almost looks like an expensive carpet, except...it's huge. And there's a rumbling noise around you...BOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gigantic, pink and white wall, no, a sneaker, lands in front of you. Mere inches away...putting two and two together causes you to realize that...well, you have been shrunk. And you thought the arcade was big before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't act fast, you will be erased. Stepped on by unsuspecting passerby, like a bug. There is only one course of action...get somebody's attention!</span></div></div>",

Making your way across the massive landscape of the arcade you're wary of the sky above you, yes the sky, at the size of a insect the ceiling of the arcade may has well been the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou duck behind every exposed edge you get a chance too, the clipped end of an arcade machine; an overturned box of some random candy. You stagger back into the Soda lounge area and the first thoughts on your mind would of course have to be talking to the clerk you had spoken to when you first received your can of soda that left you in your current minuscule state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you steady your legs and take in a deep breath to continue your movement across the floor a thunderous clash erupts right before you. A cup of soda filled to the brim with ice and grape flavored liquid sugar smashes down inches ahead of you. With the tsunami of fluids afterwards you're lost to the flow and a  sometime later you resurface. Your head was bleeding slightly, you must have been knocked silly by a cube of ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unaware of how long you've been out but the arcade is still extremely active and...and...and you can't move! Twitching your limbs madly you find you've become stuck in a dried lake of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure with enough squirming you could free yourself from the holds. Around you ice cubes still tower as they slowly melt into the pool the water seeping out over the soda covered floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatters get worse for you however when a group of titans sit at the table before you, a mighty pack of them with feet that could turn cities to dust in seconds and you, an insect before them continue to squirm in your soda binds...or do you...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You couldn't see their faces from where you were now, but you could still see their feet as they as you lifted your head up a slight bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl closest to your right had flip-flops on and had red nail polish on her toes and seemed to be shifting her feet around a lot. The girl closest to you on your left had cowboy boots on and looked like she was trying to remove them. Then the other two at the far end who were still close enough to reach you with their feet were both wearing sky-blue flats with lose white socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So girls, are we all set up for the sleepover later tonight?\" You could hear the girl to your right say as her feet slid near your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet! It'll be loads of fun.\" The girl to your left said as her boots slammed down next to your body. Sending a shock-wave that loosened you up just a tad bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure don't mind spending some more time with the new girls.\" The girl to the far left said as she bent down to lift up her socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They're so easy to get it on with.\" The last girl on the far right said as she pulled her foot out of her flats and put them back in over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You two sure do have a one track mind don't ya?\" The girl to your right said as she slid her feet back away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up Megan. Don't tell me you don't like having your brains fucked out by a woman?\" The girl to the far right said as she lifted her foot up to her chair it back down and slammed it back down. Sending a smaller shock-wave that didn't have any effect on getting you loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet Ashie! Do you want the whole town to know about us?\" The girl to the far left said as she half stood up and leaned over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine sis. But I'm just saying, it's not like any of us have had any sort of chance getting it on with a man.\" Ashie said as she lifted her foot up to the chair once again. But this time reached down just to scratch it. She scratched it until her sock got caught on her fingernails and she flicked them off. Causing them to land right on top of you. The sock was wet with sweat as you were forced to smell them until she went to retrieve them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's sad that no man ever wants to go out with us. Other women are so lucky i guess.\" The girl to you closest left said as she finally took her sweaty, wrinkly feet out of her cowboy boots and placed them right over the sock you were under. Now you had to bear with the pressure of this girl's feet as they rubbed you around. The only good news was that her feet rubbing you around was loosening you up rather well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it Yuna.\" Megan said as her feet slid out of her flip-flops and moved under the sock you were under. You could only watch as Megan's toes pushed you further to the left. But as soon as they stopped, you realized that that one push was what you needed to be unstuck. But you were still trapped under a sock with Yuna's feet overhead. And Megan's toes were nudging you every two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on girls. We still have each other. Isn't that what matters most?\" You head Ashie say. But couldn't see what her feet were doing at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You're right! To Hell with men. It's us girls for life.\" Then the other far off girl said as you felt Yuna's foot lift off of you. Allowing you to get up quickly and stand up near the hole of the sock.

After a while, your body had been worn down too much to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your dodges was just a second too slow, and the girl's foot came crashing down on top of your legs. Your legs from the knees down were now completely crushed beyond recognition. As you screamed out in agony, the girl's foot came down again. This time, your entire left arm was smashed into paste beneath it. The pain was unimaginable, and you desperately tried to drag yourself off of the mat using your good arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even move an inch, the giggling girl's foot came down upon you once again. Without even knowing it, the girl crushed your remaining arm right beneath her foot. It quickly became obvious that you weren't going to make it out of this situation alive. You had no more arms, and your legs were destroyed half way down. This oblivious girl was unknowingly taking your body apart with each stomp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply rolled over onto your back and watched as the sole of the beautiful girl's massive shoe slammed down on you once again, this time grinding your stomach and all below it into pulp. You knew that the next impact would end your life once and for all. By now, you had given up all hope of escaping this situation alive. You embraced the fact that this girl was going to end your pathetic life right here and now. You watch in unimaginable agony as her rubber sole lowered down and pressed on your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's shoe encompassed your entire body, and without any real effort on her part, your miniature body popped like a grape beneath her unrelenting foot. She didn't feel a single thing as she had unknowingly ended your life, as your body put up little to no resistance against her massive strength. The two girls finished their game without even noticing your existence. As they walked through the arcade to decide what to do next, the girl who crushed you began to notice her foot sticking to the floor a bit as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Lindsy, I think that I stepped in some gum or something. Do you have a tissue that I could use to get it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Amy, hold on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl handed her a tissue from her pocket, and she scraped your mangled remains off of the bottom of her shoe without a second thought. Throwing the tissue into the garbage can, the girls continued on their way. They remained forever oblivious to the tiny life that they had just ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her first thought was to crush it under her sole, however, fate once again made her take a closer inspection. \"Hmm, wait a minute. That is no bug. In fact, it looks like a small man!\".

How did you get so small?\", she asked, flabbergasted at the fact that her lifelong best friend was now a helpless bug in the palm of her hand. \"I...I don't know Dianne\", Zak managed to sputter out, still shocked by the entire situation. \"Wait. I did see one thing. It was a broken green bottle filled with some liquid. I got some on my leg by accident, but I really didn't pay it much attention.\", Zak said rememberingly. \"Well, my mother is a scientist, so maybe she knows something about that liquid and what happened to you. Thing is, she's on a work trip, and she doesn't get back until this weekend\". Those last words rang in Zak's mind like a bell. He had to be shrunken for an entire week! \"Don't worry Zak\", Dianne said, as she interrupted his crisis. \"I'll keep you under my protection until she arrives. And I know how much you like feet. Especially giant ones!\". Zak's heart sank. Not only was he shrunk, and he had to endure it for an entire week, but his lifelong friend had known about his foot fetish this entire time! How could this day get any worse? \"Yeah. I've pretty much always known. You always stare at them, and I'm neither stupid nor blind!\", she said while laying on the couch and placing Zak at her feet. \"I've even caught you smelling my shoes and socks.

After all, you are looking for someone who will look down and notice you, and hopefully take more than a few seconds to inspect you before deciding what you are. Not that you expect much help. Still, you felt it was necessary to try. If you can get someone's attention, maybe they can help you track down the girl who gave you the shrink potion and find an antidote, or hope that it wears off on its own after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you dash from one covered spot to another, watching as titanic feet crash to the ground from above, just people going about their day, none of them really caring much about what they might squash beneath their shoes. Which was just as well. At your size, you doubted anyone could tell you were a person from the floor. You were going to have to find a way to get closer to their faces. Someplace either high, or something they would pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grow closer to the food court, you begin to notice a drastic change in the type of person you were seeing. When you'd shrunk near the bathrooms you'd encountered mostly older and family types, people about one and half to twice your own age, but as you got nearer you goal, the ages of the people you were seeing began to level off at about your own age. Not that that didn't make sense. After all, the arcade was right off the mall, and most parents tried to keep their kids away from that place, if at all possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of walking, you finally make it to the food court, and look around, seeing no one you recognize, though studying their faces, or at least, what you can see of their faces, you begin to realize how different things look from this perspective. No one looks right. Not really foggy, like things in a distance, just, distorted. You can see every fault and flaw in their skin, and the images seem to move like liquid, probably a trick of the light at your size, as your eyes hadn't fully acclimated to your present height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you start into the food court, looking up from under the edging to try and find some friendly face you recognized. Good thing you were looking up too, as someone suddenly dropped a pocket full of change, coins larger than you were clattering to the floor, dimes, pennies and quarters rolling around like huge wheels for a moment, before falling with a horrible metallic clang sound on the tiled floor of the food court, a sound you knew was not nearly as loud to the people above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see a hand coming down to pick up the change, and get an idea. Probably not the greatest one you'd ever had, but then, drinking that potion wasn't the best idea either. Looking toward a quarter nearby, you figure you can grab onto it, and then get the person to notice you. But what then. If they see you, they may just shake you off, and even if bugs can survive falls like that, you're not so sure you could. Looking up, you see the hand growing closer, and take a deep breath before....</span></div></div>",

Not that you can get that loud, considering your size, still, them movement, while the person is looking down, is more than enough to attract their attention, as they stare down at your tiny form, and then gasp in shock, pulling back their hand like they thought you were poisonous or something, and then stumbling back into someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this meant they probably thought you were a bug, which meant you should run for cover as fast as you possibly could. Unfortunately for you, however, the hand they had been holding their change in opened up, and with that open palm came coins flying everywhere, loose bits of change slamming to the ground all about you, seemingly with enough force behind them that they could smash you into a flat little smear on the tile, making your scream even more frantic as you ran for cover, only to trip on a fault in a tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus are you doomed, as a quarter rolls toward you, the face of the nation's first president spinning as it comes closer, and closer, until, at last, it hits you. You would expect there to be pain, and lots of it, but with shock, you feel nothing from it. Rather, there is a moment where you can sense a great weight, and then there is nothing below your waist. This fact makes you reluctant to open your eyes, as you lay there on the tile, feeling a warm puddle forming beneath you, but at last, you have no choice but to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see is....well, exactly what you expected. Your waist has been severed cleanly. A small line of smashed flesh still exists where your pelvis and everything was, and below that you can see your legs, twitching a little even after being cut off from you, as between the two parts a small river of blood is already beginning to run to the floor, the warm puddle coming out of there, as you simply stare incredulously at the remains of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get to stare long, however, as a shadow soon comes over you, and you turn your head from the horrific scene, to stare upward right into the skirt of some girl, who where's flat soled shoes. \"Oh, poor buggie. He lost half his body. I suppose it wouldn't be right to let you try and live like that,\" says her voice, still sweet and rich, if very deep to your tiny ears, as the shock takes any edge off her tone. Smiling up at her, you almost seem to nod as her foot comes to fill your sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flat sole means there is little time as her weight crashes down upon you. Even the pain killing properties of adrenaline aren't enough now to block the whole of the experience, though it's not too bad. Your ribs take the first brunt of the assault, your head being turned, so a few nano-meters shorter. Her weight crashes down on them like a titan, snapping them all at once, and sending them through you, long sharp points tearing into your inside, ripping through your organs, as shrapnel is sent everywhere, literally shredding your internal organs, adding to the pool of blood beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head goes next, and for a moment, you feel the enormous pressure of her mass on it, stretching it out as she smashes down on your hard, causing your eyes to bulge, your nose to bleed, and soon, your tongue to fall out as the blood vessel behind it bursts, giving you one instant of intense agony, before everything goes dark. You aren't conscious as she twists her heel, and you become a smear, unrecognizable as a human, on the sole of her foot, which is then cleaned off with a napkin, and thrown into the trash, where little bugs like you belong.</span></div></div>",

Your former friends, and some enemies, could quite easily crush your tiny form and chances are, they wouldn't even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picture yourself helplessly flailing your arms at the titans and then disappearing under a school regulation sneaker, only for the foot to shift revealing a small red mark where you were.

Smiling slightly you MIGHT have a shot after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your friend Trini at the lane closest, the normally petite asian had forgotten her gym sneakers so the teacher was forcing her to run in her black socks.

Her silky dark hair sways in front of her titanic face as she gets ready to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Trini's left you see a blonde giantess, Maria. Now, maria was a bit ditzy, the girl living up to the very stereotype of blondes, but she was basically a good person. Your eyes fall to her feet, where you see she's got her sneakers on but, as usual, they weren't tied properly. Instead She kind of has them tucked in, but the ends fall over the side, brushing against the dusty gym floor slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have time before the teacher starts the laps to choose one of these potential saviors. Would it be easier to cling to a giant sock? Closer to the ground but not so secure. Or perhaps you'd try the dangling laces of the sneaker? It'd be harder to pull off but you could secure yourself easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime's running out, what will you pick?</span></div></div>",

Looking at this as an opportunity, you notice one of the strands falling nearby.
