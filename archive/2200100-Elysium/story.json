As much as he wants to do what is right for his family, he yearns to make something of himself, idolising his older brother who left to become a Paladin in the neighbouring kingdom. As another long summer draws to a close George dreams of running off and seeking a new life, though he knows he'll never have the courage to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun begins on another long Wednesday afternoon. George sleepily stretched against the warm bark of a willow tree. He'd spent all day in the barley field and his body was paying for it dearly. His muscles were sore and he could feel the little prickle of insect bites start to make themselves known all down his forearm and neck. The height of summer in the countryside sounds idyllic to those who reside in the cities, but it's certainly no holiday for those who have to work the entire time!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was already tired but knew the lingering hours of daylight would be put to good use by his ever present father, who would no doubt have a long list of things that \"needed\" to be done by nightfall. Going back to the farmhouse would surely result in another hour or so of drudgery. </span></div></div>",

The little flies were simply replaced by swarms of biting midgies and moths which were drawn into houses and around campfires. The best way to escape these pests was to dive into fast flowing water, and as luck would have it the nearby creek tumbled down a narrow canyon not far away, which sped up the flow and stopped the insects fro gathering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge clambered nimbly down the banks that lined the creek, taking great care not to slip and fall on the crumbling clay. Whilst the steepness of the bank made it difficult to navigate down to the water, it kept away both prying eyes and any farm animals that would otherwise come down to drink. In all the times he'd swam here he'd never encountered a soul, and it provided him with some much needed solitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick glance around just to double check nobody was there, George pulled off his sweaty farm clothes an stepped into the cool water. He instantly felt more relaxed, and wader in deeper till the water came up to his waist. This was as deep as it got at this middling section of the canyon, which was the shallowest part. Downstream it broadened out into a nice, deep pool, perfect for relaxing in, whilst upstream the water churned across several small rapids, treacherous for the inexperienced but a lot of fun to explore if one was confident in the water and knew the area. </span></div></div>",

Beside him stood two grinning. unshaven men, wearing overcoats and brandishing a sword and a rather crude hatchet. <i>Bandits </i> George realised. He was clad in nothing but his shorts, and had no weapon to speak of other than his fists. Not exactly ideal against two armed criminals. <br>\r\n\"A little lost aren't we?\" The shorter one of the two said, leering at George. He was short but broad, and could probably stand his own ground, nevermind the axe he was carrying. He wore a similar long coat to the over man but also sported a cap with a very faint \"CC\" on. <br>\r\n\"None of your business\" George spat, realising that he sounded more pathetic than tough. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n\"Play nice\" The taller and older man said, raising his sword and half heartedly waving it in George's direction. \"We're just out for a stroll, just like you. Nice little hidden spot you have here, peaceful and alone\".<br>\r\nGeorge shifted slightly on the spot. He had no possessions to rob, and the men clearly knew it, so perhaps they were just messing with him and he'd soon be sent on his way, a little scared but otherwise unharmed. He'd just have to play along with whatever stupid game they wanted to pull on him, as the only other option was to jump back down the waterfall, risking being crushed to death on the hidden rocks below. And by the time he managed to swim to shore they'd probably be all over him anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a big strapping lad like you doing out here then?\" The older man said, eyeing up George's arms. \"I'm guessing you're from one of the farms around here and decided work was getting a bit too hard?\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right\" George replied flatly, not wanting to give them anything they could use against him.<br>\r\n\"Lazy git\" The little one said. \"When I worked on a farm I always made sure the work was done before I ever thought of bunking off. I wou-\"<br>\r\n\"Give it a rest\" The older bandit said, rolling his eyes. He rummaged in his coat pocket and pulled out a cap similar to the one the other bandit was wearing. \"Don't pretend like you loved it till I rescued you\" He continued. \"This young fella here probably hates it just like you did, and I have to say, he looks physically better suited to the life we lead than you ever have!\" The younger man just scowled but George felt compelled to ask.<br>\r\n\"What are you going on about?\" He said. \"Leave me alone and let me go, I have no possessions and nothing that you could possibly want\".<br>\r\n\"Oh but you do\" The bandit said, stepping forward. \"You see we could use someone with your brawn on the road. Always coming up against farmers who want to resist, and we're not exactly the biggest guys. And in return you'll love the free life of a criminal, no more slaving away in a hot field for fuck all, just as much loot and beer as you want! What do you say?\"<br>\r\n\"Fuck off\" George spat. \"I'm not a petty criminal\". He tried to push past the elder bandit but he was too quick, and he rammed the new hat onto George's head quickly and forcibly. <br>\r\n\"Oh, but you will be\" He said, laughing. \"Join us mate\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Item acquired: </b><i>Cap of Criminality</i><br>\r\n<b>Item use:</b> Turns the individual into a petty criminal who loves to swindle, drink, and fuck. The character will lose traits regarding lawfulness and acquire ones that promote criminality and dubious behaviour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge gasped and fell to his knees, clutching his head. His head was filled with the voices of the two bandits, urging him to give in and join them. His cock began to harden as images of him, glad in an overcoat and with a beer in one hand and cigar in the other, enjoyed all the loot he'd acquired from robbing dumb travellers he met on the road. A life of freedom, luxury, and the ability to fuck whoever he wanted, whenever he wanted. All he had to do was stand up and shout out that he was a happy, dumb, bandit. Just do it mate, the man had said. Why not? Why the fuck would he go back to his controlling father when he could be a famous highway man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge's high lawfulness <b>(9) </b>has blocked Item: <i>Cap of Criminality!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge yelled and ripped the cap off, throwing it over the edge of the waterfall.<br>\r\n\"Oi, that was my last one\" The tall bandit shouted. \"You'll pay for that boy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dull smack as the but of a sword smacked him in the back of the head, and George fell forward, his world rapidly becoming dark.</span></div></div>",

He was covered in a rough blanket and his legs and arms were bound to stop him escaping. The combination of heat, exhaustion, and the blow to his head overwhelmed him again, and he found himself blacking out once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe low noise of various male voices brought him groggily to his senses, and he was aware that the cart had stopped under the shade of a copse of lime trees. The trees looked familiar, but his blurred mind couldn't work out where from. He could hear men arguing about the price of something. It took a moment to realise they were bartering over the price of <i>him</i>. The bandits had captured him and planned on selling him as a slave. Before he could process this properly the smaller bandit had approached the cart.<br>\r\n\"Good, you're awake\" He said, flashing George and evil grin. \"Shift\". He roughly dragged George off the cart and marched him down a dirt track. The farmboy was too weak and thirsty to offer much resistance and stumbled along, overwhelmed that this was happening. <br>\r\n\"See, look at him, he's a strong one\" He heard the taller bandit saying. \"Definitely worth the price we're asking\".<br>\r\n\"He is\" A man replied.

Johnny's holdings weren't very grand, just totalling the valley in which lay George's family farm and a dozen or so others, coupled with the hills ringing it where pastoralists grazed their flocks. But given that neither his nor George's family had left the area in centuries he was something of a revered figure. He'd only met him a few times and each time was intimidated, despite not really having a reason to be other than his high status. He bowed his head slightly as Johnny's steely gaze looked him up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Johnny said, turning to the taller bandit. \"I'll take him, take this and go\" He said, throwing a sack of coins at him. The bandit greedily snatched it up and nodded toward the other, who aggressively pushed George forward before cutting his bonds. <br>\r\n\"Enjoy your new life, boy\" The bandits laughed, pocketing the coins and heading on there way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge tried to catch his breath, his head spinning after all that had happened.

You're a good family and it would be horrendous to see you end up as someone's slave. Let this be a lesson to take more care in future\".<br>\r\nGeorge could hardly believe his luck. \"T...t..thank you, Sir\" He stammered. Johnny didn't react, but made a gesture to seemingly no one in particular. Within seconds a servant was by their side, providing George with a clean set of clothing. He heard shouting from the road and looked up. Several of Johnny's retainers had stopped the cart just as it had left the gates of the manor. The bandits jumped down and started yelling at the swordsmen. Without hesitation one of them slashed his shortsword across the neck of the taller one, letting him crumple to the floor in a heap. The shorter bandit screamed and tried to make a dash for the trees, but a hail of arrows from the other men saw him crash to the ground as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was horrified. All he had wanted to do was enjoy a cool dip in his favourite pool yet he'd been enslaved and watched his captors be brutally slain all in the space of a couple of hours. One of the guards ran up and threw the back of gold back to his lord. Another presented the bandit's horse to George. <br>\r\n\"A gift\". Johnny said winking. \"Now get home, and don't ever go wandering off without a weapon again\".<br>\r\nGeorge hastily clambered up onto the horse, \"I can't thank you enough\" He exclaimed, grabbing the reigns. \"Let me make it up to you, my Lord\".<br>\r\n\"Johnny smiled. \"You are always welcome here again anytime\". And with that he and his men walked back to the manor house, dragging the cart and bodies of the criminals with them. George felt something rise in him at those words. He longed to get on his knees and beg Johnny to let him make it up to him properly, show his lord just how grateful he was. Maybe another time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sped home, not worrying about the pain caused by riding without a saddle nor the speed at which he took dangerous corners and gullies. All he wanted to do was return back to his farm and safety. He skidded into the stables and put the new horse away, hoping it wouldn't cause a fuss in its new quarters. He managed to creep back into his room as darkness began to fall, grateful that his father was not around to question him. All he wanted to do was sleep.</span></div></div>",

He'd definitely earned it with all his work on the farm over the last few weeks, and the little town was only a short walk down a muddy track. Promising to himself that he wouldn't stay out too late, he set off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was fortunate enough not to encounter anyone as he passed by his family fields. He felt quietly guilty already about heading off anyway, so there was no way he'd have been able to come up with a decent enough excuse if he had bumped into anyone he knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small town of Wyrm lay only a couple of miles down the road, and it was a pleasant walk now that the sun was starting to set. Town may have been a bit of an exaggeration; Wyrm's population could have been no more than a couple of hundred people at most, and primarily served as the marketplace for the hundreds of farms and hamlets that dotted the surrounding barony. Small, rural, and peaceful, it was one of many petty states that lay in the triangle of land named Byland that was nestled between the Brythonic Confederacy, Kingdom of the Alemmani, and Diocese of Strasburg, left alone because they always had been, rather than due to the prowess of their warriors. Nothing ever really exciting happened amongst these fields or rolling hills. George remembered coming home from school one day, his head buzzing with stories of monsters and heroes after being told by one of his friends that her dad old her that the town got its name from an ancient beast who was slain their hundreds of years ago, the church being built on the land where its body had fallen. But George's dad immediately told him that this was all a lie, saying that Wyrms never existed outside of fairy tales (\"Have you ever seen one?\" He asked, \"No\" George had to admit), and that the real story was that the town was named after the winding river that ran through it. He told him to stop day dreaming about monsters and get ready to help on the farm. And that had been the end of that discussion. <br>\r\nThat was how things had always ended whenever George had brought up the possibility of an existence beyond the green fields of Byland. It was only his sense of duty to his work that had stopped George going mad with boredom a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daydreaming had carried him to the edge of the town, and he was surprised to see so much of it was still awake despite the darkening sky. The traders had long departed but the rest of the townsfolk were trying to get the last of their chores done before the darkness set it, as Wyrm wasn't a town wealthy or large enough to afford the expense of street lighting. As he picked his way down the main street he noticed the familiar sign of The Black Dragon Inn swaying in the gentle breeze. To the left stood the blacksmiths where he knew he should inquire on the cost of fixing his plough. To the right sat a beggar, down on his luck. </span></div></div>",

He wandered easily, the ground under his feet so familiar that he was almost unthinking as he walked home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the yard and approached the house, he saw his dad talking to Mason. His dad, seeing him first, gave him a wave; at least he wasn't annoyed about him skipping work. He felt his heart skip a beat and he found himself jogging, without realising he wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason! You're here! You look incred- I mean, you look goo- you look well,\" he stammered, finishing lamely and trying to ignore his dad's knowing chuckles. He could feel his cheeks grow warm, thinking about the last time he had seen Mason. He had the same cheeky but lazy grin now that he had then, just before pushing George onto his back, and the blacksmith's apprentice then started sinking slowly but confidently onto his-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George. Back with us,\" his dad teased, shaking his shoulder. Mason was holding out a package, smiling sweetly, explaining it was delivered from the blacksmith, \"For services rendered, as promised\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge took it reverently, not missing Mason's fingertips brushing against his own just longer than he needed to. He reverently unveiled the simple sword and shield inside: the rose of his family crest was stamped on both. George whooped loudly as Mason hugged him happily, and his Dad had a bittersweet smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good timing for that, lad,\" Mike said proudly. \"We received the letter today,\" he explained.\" \"You were accepted. You've been summoned to the Order of Arthur, just like Joe.\" His dad clapped his shoulder proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say your goodbyes in the morning to your mum, Jacob and me. You have a good night tonight,\" he said, winking and turning back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge found himself staring reverently at his new sword and shield until he heard a light cough, and he looked up. Mason was already shrugging off his tunic and running back into the meadows of wildflowers, the stars blazing in the clear night above his head. George grinned and gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full village waved him on his way to the coastal road, and he felt warmed as he left, but he couldn't contain his excitement. He was officially off into the world to make it a better place. He wandered the road to Cantabria lightly, camping under the stars and idling the time with daydreams of himself in the Grandmaster's Paladin armour. After a week he found himself in Aylsham, a quiet fishing port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mayor took one look at his sword and shield and grabbed him insistently. \"Thank god you're here. We need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge felt his breast bloom with pride and excitement. Finally, he was on his way to becoming a hero. \"Tell me what you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissing fishermen. Missing rescuer of the missing fishermen. Easy: investigate the road, see what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was barely half an hour out of town when he saw him. The road swept over the cliffs high above a bay below, and a young man with dark hair was waving frantically in the middle of it, pointing towards the bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! Please help me! Look - he's in trouble!\"</span></div></div>",

The deep blue waters of the cove lapped gently against the cliff, but nothing else. There was nothing there. So what was all the guy's fuss about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh</i>\", though George distantly as he felt himself being pushed and saw the water rapidly approaching and his vision turning black, \"<i>it was as trap</i>\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself being dragged along the wet sand, with many hands groping his body as he was pulled along. Distantly he was aware of a malevolent giggling as he faded out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge woke with a gasp, struggling and chest heaving with harsh pants, but finding his arms and legs loosely chained to the wall behind him. He forced himself to be calm, taking deep breaths: he was going to be a Paladin. He could do this. Think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly took stock. He was in a dimly lit cave, and below the rocks he was standing on he could see the seawater-filled main chamber with a water-worn marble dias. His shirt was open and his hairy chest exposed, still damp with water. Thank goodness even in the cave it was an unseasonably warm day. He almost cried out in relief when he felt his sword still at his belt on his side and his shield at his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis relief was short lived as a loud splashing noise filled the cave. Five slender but muscled guys, looking slightly younger than George, had arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blonde head popped above the rock into site, and then the rest of his toned body as his captor pulled himself onto the ledge. <br>\r\n\"What have you done with the fishermen and the adventurer?\" George demanded instantly.<br>\r\nThe man grinned happily at George as he ran his hand over George's arms, muttering, \"Oh yes. I like you. You'll do.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll do for what exactly? What do you want with me?\" George demanded proudly.<br>\r\n\"My name is Jack,\" the man said, continuing to ignore George, \"and you've already met Tom. Chris, Daniel, and Ross are here too.\"<br>\r\n\"They're Nereids!\" a voice to his left shouted imaptiently. George craned his neck to the left and saw a muscled, shirtless man similarly chained to the cave wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realisation that struck George must have shown on his guileless face as Jack pouted, sighed, then twisted George's right nipple painfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Fine, yes. We took the fishermen to lure warriors like you and Ben here,\" he said, moving to rub Ben's bicep and George's bicep at the same time, \"and we lured warriors because we want a Champion.\" His jovial grin became taught. \"Ancient and evil entities are abroad in the world, and we have to protect ourselves. We need a Champion for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's demeanour became more relaxed and verged on arrogant as he squeezed his prisoner's biceps again and became distracted.<br>\r\n\"We're preparing the ritual now. You two will fight, and the winner will be our Champion. You will protect our cove, and you will service your new master's <i>every </i>need. And we're quite insatiable,\" he added, grabbing their bulges, smirkling lewdly before turning and dropping into the water below. Moans and giggles from below suggested their captors were distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, mate, we don't have much time. I can see you've still got your sword. You wouldn't be able to angle it to cut your chains - but you can use it to cut mine. You get me out, I get you out, and we take them together.\" George turned to look Ben in the eyes. He seemed like he was telling the truth, but what if he just cut and run, leaving George to his fate?</span></div></div>",

He trusted Ben would do the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jerked his sword from his waist sharply, making a faint whistling sound as it cut through the air and severed the chain on Ben's right arm with a clink. Ben took the sword gingerly with his right arm, then freed his left arm. George held his breath as Ben turned to him, bringing the sword down in a quick slice - that cut both his chains, before George was reunited with his sword and shield. Ben took up his sturdy looking Great Axe, looking determined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peered over the ledge cautiously and saw an orgy below them on the marble dias. Tom was being fucked by Jack H and sucking off Ross, while his own cock was being sucked by Dan, who was in turn being fingered by Ross. Ben and George both stared, awe struck and getting hard. Only Jack L was outside the dias, leaning against the rock and lazily stroking his own cock, while moaning George's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen them use this while I've been down here. I think I have a plan. When I give you the signal,\" Ben murmured in his ear while handing him their cut chains, \"drop on the nymph below and bind his hands. You'll know the signal when you see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge nodded and sat, poised. The only sound in the cave was the waves breaking gently outside and the lewd moans and noises from the arrogant nymphs. Suddenly, Ben landed heavily in the water in front of the dias, before slamming his hand down hard on an ornate slab on a pedestal in front of it. Blue light flew up from the edges quickly, trapping their dazed, then rapidly incandescent, captives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was quick to land heavily on Jack, tying his hands behind his back. The nymph thrashed furiously but futilely as he was bound by the two warriors. <br>\r\n\"Tell us where the fishermen are, or you'll pay,\" George threatened. Jack responded by trying to grind back against his bulge. <br>\r\n\"I'll tell you hero... if you help me.\" George hesitated, and Jack seemed to sense it and pressed home his point. \"The tide is coming in soon...\" he said innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe veiled threat was clear; time was of the essence to save the villagers. And, truthfully, George was still achingly hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly pulled his tattered shorts down and bent over the captured nymph, before roughly slamming his cock inside the nymph's tight arse. He set a quick, brutal pace, grabbing his hips hard enough to bruise. \"I'm fucking you just like you wanted, now tell me where the villagers are!\" He emphasised his demand by squeezing Jack's balls, causing the nymph to keen and buck back harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen seemed to notice them and deduced quickly what had happened. He immediately waded across the cave and shoved his hard cock in Jack's waiting mouth. The defeated nymph was trapped uselessly between the two heroes, impaled and powerless, moaning louder and louder until he came hard. George and Ben soon followed, pumping the nymph full of cum before Ben grabbed him by the hair and pulled his cock out of Jack's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you where they are,\" Jack admitted. George and Ben high-fived; their first win as heroes!<br>\r\n\"The villagers... are at the village. We let them go when we captured you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge and Ben's celebratory grins became confused scowls.<br>\r\n\"But you said... the tide...\" George said helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was already moving, gracefully slipping free of his chains and moving to the dias. Each of the other nymphs had came watching the display in front of them, scowling at Jack jealously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is coming in,\" Jack said shrugging as he lowered the field, \"and we have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winked at George, promising \"I'll see you again!\", before he and the other nymphs disappeared in the crest of a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge and Ben stood, naked and dripping cum, before yelling triumphantly and hugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Ben asked happily. </span></div></div>",

George faintly remembered him mentioning a dangerous local ruin, and he gazed up at the bleached white standing stones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged bravely into the ruins... right into a haze of purple gas. He coughed as he staggered forward. It was getting harder to think. He had a mission. He was a hero. He-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge looked up and saw a naked young man, one of the most handsome he had ever seen. He wanted to abandon his quest and stay here, kiss every one of those freckles and- where had that thought come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised with horror the young man was attached to many tentacles;  former adventurer and now host. They raced across the ground towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust give up hero,\u201d the man called. \u201cStop worrying. Go blank. Join us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to resist the voice and the gas. Oh god, he wanted it though. More than anything. More than the need to get off, more than the urge to rut up into whatever was in front of him. He was starving for those little soft affections. It touched something inside of him that he didn\u2019t think existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he whispered, though what he was now begging for he couldn\u2019t rightly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d As soon as the word was out, a thousand tiny vines slithered into Ford\u2019s armour. They writhed and crawled and snaked their way across his skin, ripping and tearing at his armour until finally he was naked. He was still bound and suspended, though only his limbs stayed covered with tentacles. His torso, arse, and cock lay bare, cock hard and slicked over with precome and chest heaving with his panting breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even shiver from being exposed to the cool air, the creature had slid into his space. They were so close he could almost feel him, hovering on the edge of his skin\u2019s awareness. He strained forward, needy for any touch he could get, but a tentacle wrapped around his throat. Tight, but not so much that he was in danger of choking. An accompanying thick tentacle forced its way inside his tight arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. You stay put.\u201d The creature\u2019s voice was firm, but his demeanor softened. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you. For right now. For as long as we can. But you have to stay still. I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I don\u2019t want you to hurt me, either. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\nFord nodded furiously. Yes, anything would be okay as long as he was being touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small voice in the back of his brain was screaming about The Mission, but it was completely drowned out by the feeling of fingers trailing down his chest.<br>\r\nSlowly, strangely soft hands explored his body. The creature\u2019s curious eyes roved with his fingers, taking in every quiver, every gasp. He traced along his collarbone and down to his left nipple. The little bud was already hard and tight from far too much teasing. When the creature\u2019s thumb rubbed over its firmness, Ford cried out. A fresh gush of precome dribbled out of his pulsing cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that good?\u201d The question seemed sincere, as if the creature genuinely didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\nFord nodded violently. \u201cSo, so good. Please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny smile quirked at the creature\u2019s plush lips. \u201cYes?\u201d He ran his thumb over George\u2019s nipple again, back and forth. Then he circled around its perky hardness and then paused to gently squeeze. The bruises from earlier abuse by the nymphs had already faded, so the careful force caused nothing but pleasure. George strained and twisted and moaned. He was on fire and it was glorious. Another spurt of precome shot out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm. This...\u201d The creature squeezed both of the his nipples and carefully stretched them out. Arching into the pull was impossible with how he was bound, but George tried anyways. \u201cThis is good, yes?\u201d<br>\r\nGeorge nodded again. He wanted to come so badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t really about potential humiliation. Gorge knew he would be helpless until rescued, whether he came or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t make things much easier for him. He still had to ask, needed to ask.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease. I need it.\u201d Everything was hot and tender. His throat was dry as a desert but he couldn\u2019t stop panting.<br>\r\nThe creature just tilted his head sideways. \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about humans. Just what my creators showed me. You\u2019ll have to tell me what you need.\u201d He leaned forward just a touch, enough so his breath was on the Ford\u2019s neck and his stomach caught the very tip of the George\u2019s cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so good, so close to what the Paladin needed. A massive shudder slithered through his body. He tilted his head back again, giving the creature access to his neck in a primal show of submission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me I can come. I want it so bad. I\u2019m so wet for you, full and ready. Please. Please.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d the creature said. \u201cYou have permission to do that. You can come. As much as you like, whenever you like.\u201d He licked a stripe up George\u2019s neck and sighed into it. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. My creators tried this with me, but I never wanted it like I do with you. Why is that?\u201d He pulled again at the George\u2019s nipples, alternating tugs with rolling the stiff flesh between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, ah, ah, please!\u201d George gasped and moaned with every movement. He wished he could roll his hips, twist and turn so the tentacle inside of him would help rub him off, but he was stuck. All he could do was take whatever the creature gave him and beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pleas seemed to fall on receptive ears, though, because the creature moved closer, slotting their hips together. Not only did it give Ford the additional skin contact that he craved, but it also meant he could feel the creature\u2019s hard cock next to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enough that with one more pull and pinch, George was cumming. He threw his head back as far as he could and moaned. Cum flowed out of him in huge spurts, painting up both of their stomachs. The creature never stopped rubbing and pulling on him, teasing his sensitive nipples and dragging their dicks together.<br>\r\nGeorge lost track of things for a few moments while he rode the pleasure. When his orgasm finally started to taper off, he recognized the creature\u2019s voice in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. That was good. So lovely and tasty and sweet. You\u2019re so needy and ready. So beautiful. You did so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery word of it went straight to his dick, still hard and impossibly still leaking fluids. A happy warmth coiled up inside of him with the praise. He was almost never praised. Never touched so softly, like he might damage if handled with too much vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. Oh, fuck, yes, thank you.\u201d Words tumbled out of him in a soft babble as George relaxed back into the tentacle\u2019s hold. His chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath. Everything was good and warm and oh-so-light. Like he was floating on a cloud. The burning need inside of him was still there, but it had dialed down for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentacles moved all around him, massaging his limbs and readjusting where his weightload sat. As they moved, a few brushed against the tentacle in his arse. The muscles there had long since stretched out to the point where it was firmly settled into place, but the feeling of those tentacles rubbing against it made him tighten up for a moment. He moaned a bit at the solid fullness inside of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more tentacles wrapped around him. His mind was empty. Maybe this was for the best. He wanted to join and be the new host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis quest had ended, but his new life with the hive had begun.</span></div></div>",

The man looked trustworthy... but George just couldn't risk it. He could feel his courage faltering, and with it, his strength and will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head apologetically. \"Sorry Ben\", he said, \"I've already been trapped once today.\" He tried to pull his sword free, tilting it just so, closer and closer to his own chains - when it clattered to the ground uselessly below him. His sword and shield looked dull and tainted in the gloom of the cave; a silent rebuke as Ben howled in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymphs appeared then, clearly drawn by the noise. \"If you boys just can't behave, then we'll start now,\" Jack grinned. He made a pulling motion with one hand and both warriors were pulled from the cave wall onto the marble dias below. A faint azure blue glow surrounding the edges told George what he already suspected: they were both bound here. No escape until the spell was lifted. Trapped until they obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen must have arrived at a similar conclusion because he charged at George, spearing him in the gut with his shoulder and knocking them both to the floor. George, well practiced in scrapping from growing up with two brothers, instinctively brought his hands down to club Ben's back as they fell. George used the element of surprise to roll Ben onto his back, straddling his chest, landing a quick succession of punches. Ben soon used his superior weight to throw him off, and return the favour with a series of heavy blows of his own. George scrabbled out from beneath his foe and circled him warily, each trying to grab the other's tunic. <br>\r\nThis must have frustrated the nymphs, and with another tug of a hand all their clothes were ripped from their bodies except tight, white jockstraps. Ben lunged forward and picked George up by the waistband, and George groaned in agony as his heavy balls were tortured. George could feel Nymph magic starting to tingle at his temples, and he gave into instinct. He landed another ferocious flurry of punches at Ben's head, forcing the bigger man to drop him. George followed it up with a swift knee between Ben's legs, and a rapid headlock as he bent over to take him down forcefully. George kicked him over harshly and stood, victorious, flexing over his vanquished equally naked opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt... <i>good </i>to win. To be powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was distantly aware of hands on his body. Lips at his neck. A tight, fat arse rubbing against his now hard cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy, George,\" a voice heavy with command whispered, \"now flex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge did as he was told. His nipples were being worshipped, his pits, his balls, his hole. He was appreciated. Worshipped. He was a hero, finally, and being recognised for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to panic as a metal helmet was fitted over his head; his vision filled with flashing colours, but only distantly, as if he was speaking underwater.  He was aware of a flash of pleasure as a tight warmth sat on his hard cock; Jack. <br>\r\n<i>Obey, George. Serve us. Flex. Obey. Cum.<br>\r\n</i>He came, hard as commanded. A second nymph climbed on him.<br>\r\n<i>Obey, George. Serve us. Flex. Obey. Cum.<br>\r\n</i>More, and more. It felt so good - George couldn't believe it.<br>\r\nHe lost track as his body was used, his cum dripping onto his prone and vanquished opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to think of the last time he felt so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason's smile, bashful but sincere as he lay naked in the pale moonlight in the wildflower meadow appeared unbidden in his head. His voice, telling him he'd be a hero for all of Elysium one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge felt his courage rise again, blooming in his chest like a snowdrop after the last frosts; small but resilient. He stretched out his arms and cried out to the Founders; the helmet split in two and dropped to the ground as his sword and shield flew into his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymphs were in a wave of foam and water, and George was left alone in the cave with the unconscious Ben.</span></div></div>",

He hastily pulled on the woolen underclothes and armour that the nymphs had removed from him, and secured his sword and shield at his side. He took one last look at Ben's unconscious body, before turning away, trying to ignore the surge of guilt that overtook him. It felt so wrong, even if he knew he couldn't help him.

George watched as they began to drag him over the side, down into the water below. <br>\r\n\"You won the fight, we wanted you\" One chanted.<br>\r\n\"But you've ran away, so he'll have to do\"<br>\r\n\"We'll train him up, give him powers\"<br>\r\n\"But one day soon, you'll too be ours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were all gone, in a swirl of sea foam. The magic in the air seemed to vanish, and the cry of the sea gulls returned. With the sun beaming down and the waves crashing upon the rocky shore, a new visitor to the area would have no idea of the dangers, and pleasures, that lurked beneath the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge heaved himself back up onto the cliffs and made his way back to the main path. As he was approaching the village he had a sudden thought, what if the mayor had knew all along what was happening to the fisherman? Surely such a cove with those nymphs had been ensnaring men for generations? Ben looked like an out of town adventurer, and so was he, could it be that the townspeople tried to offer adventurers up to the nymphs in exchange for letting their own men sail freely?</span></div></div>",

He had to go back to the mayor and tell him what he knew, and see if he was as innocent as he had acted. He walked back to the town, trying to wring the seawater out of his clothes in order to look remotely presentable. The town was picturesque but small, and there couldn't be more than a couple of hundred people living there. It was oddly quiet, and the streets were mainly deserted, but he could sea lots of activity up in the fields overlooking the towns cliffs, which wasn't unusual at this time of year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way into the centre and entered the unimposing townhall, becoming of such a small town. Nobody was there but the door wasn't locked either, which is probably indicative of the overly trusting mentality of the townsfolk. George coughed nervously, and the mayor came scurrying out from an ante room. He wasn't too old, George guessed he was probably only in his late 40s, but the white beard and moustache made him look older. As his eyes came to rest on the dripping warrior in front of him he gasped and ran forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright\" he exclaimed in surprise, \"Did you fall into the sea? What did you find?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\" George said, waving him away. \"But I discovered what's been happening to your missing sailors. They've been taken by a group of nymphs that have made the bay their lair. And they're not exactly going to be willing to move on easily\". From his reaction George could see that the mayor already knew this information. He was suddenly filled with a white hot tongue of rage, as he'd nearly lost his life because of the sneaky antics of some mayor of a hovel. \"Tell me the truth\" He spat, brandishing his sword at the Mayor's throat. \"Why didn't you tell me about them. You clearly knew what was really going on down there.\"</span></div></div>",

The feel of the warm earth between his toes; the breeze that ghosting across his naked body like ghostly fingertips; the soothing sound of the brook bubbling nearby; the distant beauty of the far-off stars mirrored in his own eyes. For Thomas, self-appointed protector of his village, moments of solitude were rare and cherished things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why the large unnatural <i>crack</i> that split the air was so particularly unwelcome. He spun quickly, snarling as the heavy aura of old magic charged the atmosphere and made the hairs on his arm stand, like the ominous wait before a Northumbrian storm. His vampiric powers meant he could pierce the night much more ably than any mortal could, every muscle straining as his yellow eyes scanned the gloom of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a beautiful, slim young man panicking and scrambling through his forest but moving with unnatural grace and speed; he had an obsidian necklace around his neck contrasting sharply with the vines curled around his chest and crotch to a makeshift short tunic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man caught a stray branch as he came into the clearing and launched himself into the air, landing on his stomach directly at Thomas's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sitting sprawled on the ground, his hair a soft blonde where it wasn't closely shaven at the sides. He looked up, panicked, his eyes strangely bright and gold with the reflection of the starlight. He was pale and shaking. Thomas hid a small smile as he realized the young man's gaze seemed to linger on his half-hard cock, even as his dozen-strong pursuers burst into the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d he demanded and the men- hunters by the looks of them- jerked to glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d one of the hunters asked with a scowl. \u201cMind your own business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything that happens in this land is my business,\u201d Thomas answered, his voice friendly but with an edge like steel. \u201cWhat are you doing with this man? Let him go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe caught him fair and square,\u201d one of the others said, dropping his hand to the hilt of his sword. \u201cHe\u2019s ours to do with as we will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man looked up at Thomas, his eyes full of fear and longing, like he was pleading for Thomas to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Thomas said slowly. \u201cThis is your last chance. Let him go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters laughed. \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d the first one asked. He reached into his cloak and brandished his necklace; Thomas recognised the black Ankh-like symbol instantly. The Order of Saint Belisarius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're here at the bidding of our Lord.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeard he's been gone for a while. You might be a bit late. I heard the Founders having turned him into ashes,\u201d Thomas said with a cocky grin and baring his fangs, as he saw their faces widen in surprise and realisation. \"Oh yes,\" Thomas said, \"I've been to the dark corners of the world. I know exactly who the Order serves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the hunters spit on the ground in disgust and drew his sword, rushing towards him. Thomas used his superspeed to doge and land a vicious punch in one fluid motion, catching the man in the shoulder. He stumbled and fell and then the others were coming at him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dodged another thrust before kicking one of the men in the chest. The rest was a flurry of battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with his powers it was all he could do to fend off the men coming at him, slashing wildly. In desperation he clawed and punched kicked. When there were only three hunters left standing they broke and ran, dragging their injured fellows along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, run!\u201d Thomas yelled after them. His heart was pounding with adrenaline, blood rushing through his ears. The fighting, the heat, the <i>smell of blood in the air</i> was thrilling. He could feel his cock twitch as he revelled in his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the young man still sitting on the ground and everything went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man flinched and turned his face away, his lower lip quivering as Thomas knelt beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Thomas said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s alright- I\u2019m here to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man didn\u2019t say anything and Thomas frowned at him. \u201cI promise- it\u2019s alright, you're safe now. Are you hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas's mouth went dry when the stranger looked at him. There was something odd about him- something Thomas couldn\u2019t immediately quite put his finger on. He was so beautiful, more beautiful than a man had any right to be. His eyelashes were long and  impossibly lush as they framed his golden eyes. Understanding started to form in the back of his mind and he knew he had to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Thomas repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger nodded and slowly moved the blanket, revealing his soft cock, locked in an elegant silver cage in the shape of the Order's cross. Thomas frowned as he stared. Who would waste perfectly good silver on such a thing? Who would waste a perfectly good cock?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set his hands carefully on the stranger\u2019s thigh- hissing with how hot he was to Thomas's undead touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few deep breaths he gritted his teeth and- the cross snapped with surprising ease and he threw it in the lake. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded and Thomas pulled firmly, the cage sliding easily off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man gasped and reached out to take Thomas by the shoulders, pressed against his naked and sweat-covered body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas jerked back, out of the man\u2019s hold. As he moved backwards he saw the stranger\u2019s hands, except- he had talons and his fingers seemed oddly dark. As he watched the darkness spread up his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Thomas demanded, grabbing him by the neck with fangs bared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man- the- the- thing tilted its head to the side, watching Thomas curiously. How had he ever thought it was human? Its eyes were glowing gold, its skin was oddly smooth and pale. Its lips were strange too- no human man had lips like that, so perfectly plush and pink, so soft looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature blinked a few times, and then it opened its mouth to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI owe you a debt, Thomas Muller,\u201d it said, its voice honey-sweet. \u201cWhat do you need? Ask me for anything and you shall have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shivered, his breathing coming faster until he was practically hyperventilating. What had he done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature smiled. It should have been ominous but it seemed profoundly kind instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, answer my question, Fae. Are you of the Seelie or the Unseelie Court? Is your allegiance to the Summer King or the Winter King?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature continued to smile unspeaking. Thomas felt uncomfortable, but knew what he had to do, for his own safety and the villages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me a debt, creature of the Great Woods. In the name of the Old Gods and the Strasbourg Laws, I demand you fulfil it by telling me your name and allegiance.\" His eyes flashed yellow as he allowed his teeth to scrape the creatures neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name... is Joshua... Kimmich\", the fae ground out as if compelled to speak,\"of the UnSeelie Court. Now that you know my true name, you have power over me. My mind, my body, and my magic.\" He looked Thomas's body up and down shamelessly, hand resting on Thomas's long cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, <i>Master</i>... what would you have me do?\"</span></div></div>",

In the grounds of him his servant had prepped his favourite horse Hengist ahead of his journey into the darkness. He pulled on his heavy cloak and strode over to his waiting page. <br>\r\n\"If everything goes to plan I should be back before sunrise\" He said, checking that everything was packed in the saddlebag correctly. He didn't trust his servants at the best of times, and nothing could be left to chance tonight. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want any assistance my lord?\" The servant asked, watching as Toni heaved himself up onto the horse. \"Your guard are ready to mobilise at a moments notice\". <br>\r\n\"No\" Toni said forcefully, grabbing the reigns and steadying himself. \"No one is to follow. If anyone asks I have retired for the night and are not to be disturbed. No exceptions. Understand?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir\" his page said, standing back as Toni kicked his stallion into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raced out of the main gate of his manor, heading down the dark driveway before making a sharp turn into the dark forest a few hundred metres down the path. It had been years since he had last been to this wretched place, his home for many years when he was a teenager and banished from his parents coastal estates for plotting. But he remembered all the secret passages he'd created, all the hidden forest caves and grotto he had scouted out, and the local monk's dark secret that he had found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Order of St Belisarius was set up to allegedly provide funds and employment for the myriad of peoples left destitute and wandering after the collapse of the Old Empire, a noble cause indeed. But it seemed to have an endless supply of gold, which it used to buy property and land in a myriad of places, most of which made no economic or strategic sense. Their base here near the manor of Kroslin was no exception. They had approached Toni's maternal great grandfather and asked to buy some of his hand, moderate in size, but on exceptionally poor ground. The forest was extremely dense and would require extensive manpower to level, and the soil quality was too poor to support any real level of arable farming, but still they insisted, and had paid a fortune for it too. The family had been glad of the extra funds and only too happy to rid themselves of such poor land, inundated with weeds and sinkholes that they'd never really paid much attention to what had been going on there. But Toni had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis horse suddenly juddered to a halt, neighing and jerking wildly. He'd picked Hengist out as a goal due to its sensitivity to danger, and its ability to feel things that no other creature could. They had that in common. Toni clambered down and unsheathed his short sword, reaching back to reassure Hengist but keeping his eye on the dark foliage ahead of him where Hengist was whining toward.

Through the darkness Toni could see its enormous form moving up and down slowly as it breathed, its foul tongue lolling out as if it could already taste them. It must be over 8ft tall and looked like it was made of pure muscle. The short sword grasped in his hand suddenly felt as useful as a letter opener. He had one advantage; both of them could see each other, although it didn't know he could. But how could he turn that to his advantage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf charged. It smashed through the undergrowth and was upon him in seconds. He didn't even have time to raise his sword in readiness before it had flung him into the air like a rag doll. He crashed onto his side but scrambled to his feet quickly, the only thing damaged being his pride. The wolf had wheeled around and was preparing to charge again but he fired off a stunning spell from his left hand, knocking it off balance temporarily. With his right he began to tame it, trying to unlock the secrets of its mind with a spell of his own creation. He only had a few seconds before it recovered its senses, but he had charmed and hypnotised many a man before. Just not an 8ft, furious beast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. He could sense nothing. This was unexpected. He had expected to feel the man beneath the beast, for he knew this had to be a werewolf. The size, the gait, the fact that it knew he could see it and changed its plan accordingly. This wasn't a normal wolf. But he could feel nothing. Perhaps the man had simply been in the form for weeks, months, years and had lost all humanity, which explained why he had charged him so violently. Or perhaps his magic just wasn't good enough afterall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt charged again but slower this time, slightly concussed. Toni was able to nimbly dive to one side and back again quickly, slicing his sword across its abdomen. He cursed himself for not bringing a silver weapon as the wolf howled and turned to face him again. This time it was quicker than him and managed to lift him clean off his feet, tossing him into the undergrowth. Winded, he could do nothing as the animal quickly strode over to him. It placed one foot on his left arm, snapping the tricep in an instant, sending unbearable pain racing across his body. The wolf crouched over him and he could smell its rancid breath on his face and hear it grunting and panting in victory, and realised in horror that he was about to die, torn apart in the woods. He slammed shut his eyes as a scream echoed across the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy weight of the beast was thrown off of him, crashing onto his mangled arm, causing him to cry out again. He opened his eyes to see the beast half lying on top of him, trying to swat away Hengist who had rallied and was now striking its head with his hooves. His body surging with adrenaline, anger, and magic, Toni grabbed his blade and stuck it hard into the werewolf's unprotected neck. Howls immediately turned to gurgles as it thrashed around, yanking the sword out of his hand but allowing him to pull himself free. Standing over it he pulled his sword out of its neck and began swinging and hacking with abandon, each cut producing a whimper from the beast that grew quieter and quieter. Eventually it stopped moving and Toni stood above it panting, one arm dangling uselessly. Suddenly the corpse began to spasm and sizzle as the flesh, muscle, and finally bone began to dissolve as if it were dropped into acid. As it did so Toni's arm began to re-heal, flesh and bone rebuilding itself until it looked and felt like nothing had happened. The \"werewolf\" had been nothing more than a summoned creature, a fake, a guardian intended to kill anyone who got too close. But it had failed. Its intended victim was not only victorious, but incredibly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni turned to face the path where the beast had come from, his eyes gleaming orange and his blade flickering with a flame. He would give no quarter now. </span></div></div>",

They'd be doing their best to hide the secrets he desired, and fortify their defences. He had to move fast. He allowed the rage to take over him, and his eyes flashed yellow whilst his sword ignited in crimson flame. No need to mask his approach now, they knew what was coming for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of humanity crept back into him as he comforted Hengist, and asked his loyal steed to stay there, hidden in the undergrowth. But it soon passed and he was marching through the thick bracken, sword singeing the bushes as it went. He only had to walk a few hundred metres more before he noticed an orange glow in the distance. Fire. The monastery complex was on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke into a run. He was here for all the information stored in the complex's libraries; it was no used if it was burnt to a crisp. He skidded to a halt as he reached the treeline ahead of the clearing in which the building stood. Surveying the scene before him he saw that every single building was burning. This had been done deliberately; clearly they weren't strong believers in their own defences. He raised his sword in readiness and waited. Nothing. Not a single soul emerged from the flaming inferno to take the field against him. Where were the monks of the order? Their laymen? Even the horses in the stables had gone. They must have fled into the night like the cowards they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the clearing, his boot crushing flaming ash. The flames igniting from his sword were dwarfed by the enormous conflagration raging above, devouring hundreds of volumes of precious knowledge every second. But his goal had changed. The knowledge couldn't be gleamed from the records anymore, but it could be taken from someone who was here, alive. Someone was here and waiting for him.<br>\r\nHe smiled, sensing the man finally emerge from the ruins to confront him. \"Ah, one of the old Masters himself. I'm honoured that you'd face me, rather than run and hide like the rest of your snivelling order\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Master Frank's bearded face was grim and determined; he was a veteran of many battles and he wasn't going to be intimidated by any upstart dictator. <br>\r\n\"Where's the rest of your Order\" Toni snarled, flipping his sword in his hand and assuming a ready stance. \"Don't tell me you waited her alone, to try and stop me?\" <br>\r\n\"They are long gone\" The Master replied calmly, \"They are beyond your grasp, as are our records\" He gestured to the flakes of burning paper that fell amongst them like hellish snow. \"Our sacrifice here is for the greater good. There seems to be no end to your evil schemes\". <br>\r\n\"Spare us the heroes monologue\" Toni said, grinning. \"I don't want to kill you, you know this. Step aside and let me get the knowledge I need. You can then carry on your miserable existence\".<br>\r\nThe Knight raised his sword and took a step forward. \"You know I can't do that\". He said. \"Your appetite for cruelty and destruction knows no bounds. To stay that you'll stop here and remain in your little principality is such an obvious lie that I'm surprised you even wasted your time saying it out loud. There once was a time when you'd have made a good public here, but the others were right to reject you, it is plainly obvious now\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white hot rage filled Toni and he fired off a fire blast, snarling as he did so. It impacted the knight head on but harmlessly dissipated into nothing. He immediately felt very embarrassed and foolish. He shouldn't have allowed the Master to provoke him as easily as that, he should be calmer and not let his enemies get a rise out of him with comments about his background, In the future he would be better. He had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attacked again, firing off a blast of air that sent the knight staggering back a few feet. Much better. Keep focussed and he is yours, Toni said to himself. The master charged forward and the two were soon locked in an intense sword fight. The masters heavy Zweih\u00e4nder would knock Toni back a little each time he brought it to bare, but it was less maneuverable than his classic longsword. Stamina and energy would be the key decider in this battle, as both men were accomplished swordsmen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni sought to exploit his superior agility by attempting to tire his opponent out. He darted amongst the burning ruins, throwing spells with every chance he got, ignoring the burning air that was choking his lungs. He forced his opponent to keep running to catch up, always just behind the more nimble and aggressive youngster. But he made mistakes. He nearly fell from a burning piece of floorboard into a wine cellar that had become a burning pit, only being saved at the last minute by hearing it start to give way beneath him. He was also cocky, and underestimated his opponents ability to produce a quick burst of speed, bringing his heavy sword down on his with such force as to nearly snap it in two like a twig. After a few more rounds of combat both men were beginning to tire, not helped by the fact that the very air they were breathing in was incredibly toxic, and was burning their throats. The hunger in Toni increased as his stamina decreased however. He needed this. He had to win this. It was his birthright. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toni knew he didn't have the brawn to beat Frank in a melee battle, but reckoned his knowledge of magic would be more than the knight could handle. Panting, he withdrew slightly and waved his sword, grinning, goading his enemy to charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Magic Check!</b><br>\r\nToni's magic level is: <i>8</i><br>\r\n<b>Magic check passed!<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nIt worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuoyed by how easily Toni was beaten back Frank charged. He swung his two-handed sword and struck the Prince hard in his breastplate, producing an impressive sounding thwack, accompanied by it cracking all the way down to his waist. Frank grinned, and raised his sword again, sensing victory was near. But Toni was grinning as well. He raised his left hand and shouted, sending a wave of dark energy soaring toward the defenseless knight. Frank only had time to yell before he was thrown backwards several metres, crashing into a pile of rubble, his head dazed. Through his scrambled vision he could see the victorious Prince slowly moving toward him, his sword still primed, ready for any last attacks. But he had neither the desire or energy to resist any longer. He had failed. With his last strength he attempted to summon a telepathic message to the council. <br>\r\n<i>\"We have underestimated him. He has grown in power more than anyone could have predicated. Summon the allies we have and march on his capital, for if he is not stopped now he wil-\" </i><br>\r\nHis message was silenced as the advancing Prince closed his fist, his magic overwhelming anything the exhausted knight could offer up. Frank looked into the eyes of the boy that could have once made a fantastic member of the Order and only saw the blazing yellow of someone bent on domination and control. His eyes rolled back and he began to pass out from the force of the devastating spell cast against him. But he would not get the respite he so desperately wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni pulled Frank toward him with an effortless flick of his wrist. The knight slid forward, coming to rest by Toni's feet, his head lolling. With another flick Toni had Frank's face gazing up at him. \"Much better\" he said, his eyes blazing with power and hatred. \"A Master of the Order has fell to me, quite the story. You'll make a fantastic addition to my Praetorian Guard\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his right hand and a small ball of black energy began to form, drawing in power from the surrounding air. \"Open your mouth\" He said. Frank could do nothing but obey. Toni unzipped his pants and pulled out his cock. Pumped full of adrenaline and success it only took a few strokes from his hand to bring him near to climax, and he fired his hot load straight into the awaiting mouth of the dazed knight. \"Close your mouth, stand up, do not swallow\". Frank obeyed, his eyes beginning to glass over. Toni pulled his zip up and brought the now considerable black ball into both hands. He began to mould the almost liquid substance into various shapes, until it eventually settled on the style of helmet his most loyal bodyguard used, complete with face mask. He looked upon Frank's face for one final time, and noticed with pleasure that his cum had splattered all across his beard. He reached over and forced the helmet onto his head, ending his time as one of the Master's of the Order, and welcoming him into the eternal servitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the clearing Toni pulled himself back up onto Hengist, pausing to cough as another wave of  black smoke drifted toward him from the flaming wreckage. The archives were lost but the mind of the old Master was more than he could ever dream of. Once they returned to his manor he would be able to access all the information he could ever want. Spell construction, weapons research, troop deployments, they would be all his. But for now he'd have a little fun. He glanced down at Frank, stood completely naked save the helmet, and waiting patiently for commands. <br>\r\n\"You know where to go\" Toni said. \"It will take you 4hours. Run\"<br>\r\nFrank obediently set off jogging in the direction of the manor house, guided by the dark helmet that now controlled him. Toni managed a laugh before setting off on his horse, easily taking over his latest acquisition. He had reached home just as dawn was breaking over the trees and waved away all attempts at assistance from his servants and drones. Finally reaching his chamber he did not even bother to remove his sweat soaked underarmour, instead collapsing into a long, badly needed slumber. </span></div></div>",

In the dawn gloom he saw a grinning face pressed against his and he reacted automatically, summoning his sword from the bedside table into his hand. Midway through its flight it was grabbed by the person who loomed over him, and he felt the cold press of steel against his neck. The person above him laughed and he recognised it instantly. <br>\r\n\"Felix\" He said, sighing in relief, sweating profusely. \"Why did you do that\"<br>\r\nHis brother grinned, clambering off the bed and tossing Toni's sword away. \"It's funny\" he said simply, shrugging. \"Besides, I like to remind you that my reflexes are faster, even after all your training. Toni smiled and sat upright. From the open window he could see the pink dawn was giving way to the blue of the day, and the muffled sounds of workshops and stables starting up were beginning to creep through from the other side of the complex. He loved this lodge more than most of its other properties. His rooms were set back away from the main work areas, providing him with the silence and peace of the forest, but he was close enough to his men to feel involved in everything they do, and not live as some removed feudal master. It was important to him that he was seen as one of them, someone who wasn't afraid to get involved in hard labour or fight in the front line, whatever his rank or situation. <br>\r\n\"You came home late again last night\" Felix said, watching his brother get dressed. <br>\r\n\"I did\" Toni said, washing his face in the basin next to his bed. <br>\r\n\"And you came home alone\" Felix said. \"You didn't take any of your guardsmen with you, and when I asked your page were you'd gone he told me that if I followed you I-\"<br>\r\n\"You'd be flayed alive and your head would be stuck on a pike\", Toni finished, drying his face. \"The same thing I tell them to say all the time. Don't worry, I may not have taken any guards out with me but I brought one back\".<br>\r\n\"So I saw\" Felix said, coming over to his brother and placing a hand on his back. Toni felt something deep inside him clench as his brothers hand touched him. Not out of revulsion, but because of something else. Something he'd repressed long ago. \"I'm worried about you\". He continued. \"Let me come along, you need me\".<br>\r\n\"I do brother\" Toni said, pushing him away gently. \"If something happens to me I need you to carry on our work here. The men will listen to you.<br>\r\n\"Your work\" Felix said, raising his eyebrows and smirking slightly. \"This\" he said waving his hand in the air \"Is all your idea. The men believe in you, not me. You know exactly what you want to achieve, I know nothing. I don't even know why you went to the monastery last night, nor what you plan on doing with the prisoner\".<br>\r\nToni nodded understandably. \"I admit I've been distant, too focussed on planning and plotting rather than making sure everyone actually understand what I want to do\" He said. \"But now's your chance. Come with me and let's see what knowledge our little friend from the Order has in his head\". <br>\r\nThe brothers made their way down to the guard barracks of the main courtyard. \"And I suppose you have a plan for when the entire Order comes marching into our little nation in retribution\". <br>\r\nToni turned around and winked. \"Naturally\". </span></div></div>",

The man that used to be one of the orders Masters was still naked save the helmet, and his muscular body was covered in cuts, burns, and bruises from his battle with Toni and then run through thick woodland and moor. Most of his wounds were now bandaged, and none looked too severe. He'd recover fully and make a fine addition to the guard. Felix was always uneasy whenever the Praetorians were involved. The face guards of the new recruits creeped him out, and it was even worse once they'd fought in battle and were allowed to remove them, and their soulless eyes were visible to the world. Whatever his brother did to them to make them so obedient was unnatural, and he didn't like it. He'd disband them all if he were ever in the position his brother was in, but his brother seemed to view them as indispensable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stopped before them both, bowed, and knelt on the ground. Toni approached him, squatted down, and opened the face guard. Frank's face looked as if nothing had happened, except he was staring straight ahead of him, ignoring his masters presence and gaze. At least he still has something behind his eyes, thought Felix, shivering as his made eye contact with the guard standing straight across the courtyard from him. Toni traced his fingers down Frank's throat, gazing at his quarry with a look that was approaching lust. He suddenly gripped his throat, and forced him to swallow. The cum that his servant had obediently kept in his mouth for hours was now gone, and he was free to talk. Toni raised his right palm and a gentle beam of yellow light emanated from it, entering Frank's mind. His eyes unfocussed and his jaw hung open, as Toni was allowed inside. Toni reached behind him and took ahold of his brother's hand. Gently he guided Felix so he was kneeling beside him, and made him lock his hand around the back of his own. Felix felt the surge of magic pass through his brother and into him as well, and the two of them felt themselves being yanked forward into a flash, falling into a white vortex that was the mind of the Master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers found themselves standing amongst the monastery that the Master used to run. It was intact once more and ghostly flashes of people wandered between the rooms and porticos, their chatter indistinct and confusing, as though it was coming from underwater. \"Stay close\" Toni said, taking his brother's hand and guiding them up a marble staircase. \"Memory access is dangerous at the best of times, and with two people in at once, one who's never done it before, something might go wrong\".<br>\r\n\"Now you tell me\" Felix said, half listening. He gazed in wonder at the shimmering walls of the monastery. Everything gleamed brightly, as though bathed in a holy light, but on closer inspection it was almost as if it shone to cover up the lack of detail. Everything looked almost unfinished, or as if one was looking at it from far away, through a broken spyglass. Memories didn't hold detail on backgrounds and characters not central to the creator, Felix realised, so this is basically a mirage, the Master's mind filling in what he thinks was there at the time. He followed his brother up the main flight of stairs, allowing apparitions to pass straight through him as if neither of them were there. He couldn't feel any heat nor smell anything, not until they approached the Master's chambers, when things changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was much clearer here. There was a pleasant smell of a wood fire and polished furniture. Books that filled the shelves had some of their titles on, and the paintings were mostly decipherable. Felix paused to inspect the Master's old armour that stood propped against the bed. It gleamed white in the light thrown from the candles. He'd never wear it again. The grey of the Praetorians would suffice from now on. <br>\r\nToni began thumbing through documents on the table, looking for anything that would help him get an idea on the plans of the order. <br>\r\n\"What are you looking for?\" Felix asked, joining him. <br>\r\n\"Magic and weapons research mainly\" Kroos said. \"The Order is years ahead of us on developing new spells and techniques, but our only saving grace has been that they've been lured into being complacent. Without any external threat they've pretty much stopped inventing and coming up with new things. We have a narrow windor of time to catch up before they realise the threat we pose, and mobilise their massive resources. Aside from that, anything on troop deployments, castle plans, diplomatic texts. Anything you spot that you think we give us the edge in the upcoming conflict\". Felix nodded and began to look through the volumes that were scattered around the room. Every so often he heard a soft whooshing noise, as his brother magically absorbed the knowledge from any tomes he deemed valuable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the study opened, and in walked Frank. He was without his helmet, but remained completely naked, his body still baring the scars from his battle in the forest. \"My masters\" He droned, bowing low. He walked over to his desk and began producing several documents from thin air, before handing them to a gleeful Toni, who absorbed them quickly. <br>\r\n\"You're serving me well already\" He said, stroking his latest recruits thick chest muscles. \"Oh how quickly you've turned against your old side. You'll find ours is a lot more suited to your talents.\" Toni pulled Frank in and the two began to kiss passionately, the old Master lifting the young Prince up into the air, and pinning him to his body. As they did so the world began to shimmer and collapse in on itself. Felix only had time to grasp Toni's shoulders before the world went black and they fell back into the courtyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni pulled himself up to his feet, and with a rush of embarrassment realised he'd came in his pants. In front of him Frank remain kneeling, having blasted his own load. Toni helped pull Felix to his feet and patted his brother down, grinning. \"Did you enjoy that?\" He asked. <br>\r\n\"Not really\" Felix said, looking green and swaying on his feet slightly. He glanced up at his brother and realised his smirk had been replaced by a serious look. <br>\r\n\"Summon your subordinates\" Toni said, putting his hand on his shoulder. \"Have everyone assemble in my study by 4pm. We need to move quickly\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only a show of brute strength would win the day, and cement his victory over the Order and the Master that now stood in his way. Toni channelled all his inner hate and anger, his will to dominate, and his greed at acquiring all the land and treasure that lie ahead, let it build inside him, and charged. He swung his sword upward, sending the Zweih\u00e4nder flying into the air and into a burning patch of debris. His body shoved hard into that of the Master's and he heard his enemy yell out in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Strength check</b><br>\r\nToni's strength level is: <i>4</i><br>\r\n<b>Strength check failed!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni pushed hard against Frank's heavy body armour, every sinew in his body flowing with power and desperately trying to shove the massive knight ahead of him to the ground. But with a great yell Frank grabbed Toni's sword hand and crushed it effortlessly in his mighty grasp. Toni cried out and dropped his sword, his hand now hanging uselessly at his side, his fingers crushed. Before he could react Frank smacked him across the face, throwing him to the floor. His head hit the ground and he saw stars, very nearly blacking out. He felt the heavy weight of a foot on his chest, and throw the acrid smoke he saw the panting knight above him, victorious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anger and hatred are not emotions that produce victory\" He said, staring down with a cold glare. \"You could have become something the Order would have been proud to tutor and nurture, but you chose this path instead. It has led you to defeat\". Toni spat in anger and tried to roll out of the way from Frank, but it was no use. The knight raise his other hands and Toni felt his limbs slam close to his body, leaving him trapped and at the mercy of the knight that stood before him. \"Foolish boy\". Frank said firmly. \"I would be within my right to kill you, for all the pain you've caused. But no, I will be merciful. You will live, but your new life will be very different from the path you've taken so far.\". He raised his hand and pointed his palm at the cowering Prince. A beam of white light shot from it and enveloped the both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2 months later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank walked into his rebuilt chambers, throwing his fur coat to the floor, not taking his eyes of the latest briefing from the central council. He let out a shrill whistle \"Boy, he shouted gruffly. Toni emerged from the next room, at least it used to be Toni. He was completely naked save for a bow tie and tight black underwear, and staring straight ahead, his bright blue eyes glassy as if he were artificial. Wordlessly he bowed and picked up his masters coat, placing it in the appropriate place. Frank sat down and gazed over the latest report, and update on how the rebuilding of the Principality of Pommerburg was proceeding after the defeat of the Dark Prince and the liberation of its oppressed populace. The council held him in high esteem ever since his victory of the prince, slaying him and preventing precious information from falling into the hands of the enemy. At least, that's what the official reports said. Nobody else knew that Toni didn't die that night. Masters of the Order were supposed to eschew worldly goods, and they certainly weren't supposed to ever engage in slavery, a cardinal sin. But that boy was too good to pass up. He was too devious to be brought to trial, and too pretty to waste and kill. No, he was working in the role that suited him best now. <br>\r\n\"Down\" He said, still not looking up.

He handed the log to the guard taking over the watch from him and yawned.

They had giggled like teenagers skipping class as they stole out of the palace and the city, and their spirits are buoyant. Sven and Lars laugh and joke as they hike, the late summer son warms their backs as they climb up into the dusty hills above the ancient capital. Both are dressed in simple, short cream-coloured togas. Lars' arms are thick and bronzed from a summer in the sparring fields, Sven notices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going again?, Lars asks casually.<br>\r\n\"The temple ruins at Arima,\" Sven replies, forging ahead confidently. \"It's the Palace complex supposedly built by the Founders: where they grew up as farmers, and where they won their last battle against the Punic Magocracy,\" he explains happily, \"and thus where the Empire was born.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expects a teasing remark, but Lars nods thoughtfully and looks interested. \"Why was it so important?\", he asks earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the last attempt by the 13 Blood Mages of Palaetyrus to bring the Continent to heel. Winner takes all gambit: they sacrificed 500 corruption stones and 5000 slaves to summon the Dread Beast. It took all the strength and courage and magic of the Founders to overcome it.\" They crest the last hill and at last see the ruins in the valley below. It truly is impressive: among the largest and the finest Elysian architecture, and even half ruined, the Temple soars into the sky with its proud bone-white columns and imposing statues. Shrines and houses are scattered around it, but a paved avenue to the steps is still visible. They walk with heads craned up, soaking in all the details as they approach, Sven reciting softly as he approaches:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They thundered hard and mightily: and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above, and the sea and Ocean's streams and the nether parts of the earth. Great Oranous reeled beneath the divine feet of the Consuls as they arose and earth groaned thereat. And through the two of them heat took hold on the dark-blue sea, through the thunder and lightning, and through the fire from the monster, and the scorching winds and blazing thunderbolt. The whole earth seethed, and sky and sea: and the long waves raged along the beaches round and about at the rush of the deathless gods: and there arose an endless shaking. Antonious trembled where he rules over the dead below, because of the unending clamor and the fearful strife.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLars pauses a moment. \"But they won\", he quips, climbing the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they enter the temple Sven cries out and sinks to his knees as the force of the latent magic hits him. Lars has his sword drawn instantly, guard up, as he pulls Sven to his feet. \"What's wrong?\" he asks, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something... massive... happened here,\" Sven grounds out. Sven's eyes glow golden as he takes Lars' hand, and he watches as his magic makes his twin's eyes light up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\", Lars utters. They watch hundred and hundreds of thousand of swirling pinpricks of golden light accelerate and coalesce into fleeting scenes: of  marauding Alemmani setting it alight; of priests worshipping at the vibrant altar; of a terrible beast against a blood-red and black sky being overcome; and finally of a bucolic homestead. Two figures, a golden mirror of Sven and Lars, naked and kissing passionately under a blazing sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Lars demands, awestruck. \"Something false, that once was true\", Sven whispers in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the figures turn, as if they know they're being watched and sink into the bodies of the twins. Sven stares into Lars' eyes, blazing golden fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them can help it. They kiss passionately, bodies pressed against each other, as tunics are discarded and their twin cocks rub together, leaking precum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven finds himself compelled, sinking to his knees, swallowing his twin's cock to the hilt. He smells of sweat and precum and Lars, and the taste is intoxicating. Lars can't resist, no longer in control of his body and cradles Sven's head with his hand, thrusting lazily but with force. Sven moans and wanks his own cock furiously. Lars pulls him off and slaps Sven's face with his cock, before turning him around and forcing him to his knees. Sven moans as his brother's tongue teases and rims his hole, body juddering with pleasure. He feels his muscles relaxing as if by magic, becoming slick with conjured lube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exchange no words as Lars takes Sven's hips and impales his brother slowly on his cock.  They start slowly, but fuck harder, and harder, and harder. The echoes of music long past is in the background, but all Sven can focus on is the rhythmic slapping sound as his brother powers into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLars reaches round and squeezes Sven's balls, and Sven can't help it: he cums onto the grass moaning, and just gets louder as warm load after load pulses into his used hole. Lars whispers in his ears, kisses him softly, and then the magic disappears. They're left back in their senses, naked in the silent sepulchre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exchange no words, just kissing softly and shyly as they dress, but Sven looks troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Lars asked. \"Is it...\" he trails off, gesturing at their naked bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Sven says. \"I loved that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what 'you' said to me right before we came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lars,\" Sven says, \"I think we need to go to the ruins of Palaetyrus. Whatever they were - and I think they were the Founders...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lars, the corruption stones are being rediscovered.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dark jagged towers stood guard on either side like corrupted sentinels. The light was weaker here; the shadows longer as they raced down the abandoned city streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe whole earth seethed, and sky and sea: and the long waves raged along the beaches round and about at the rush of the deathless gods: and there arose an endless shaking,\u201d Sven whispered again to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear that?\u201d Kasper asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI only hear the lap of the surf,\u201d Sven replied.<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.

Its pyramid shape loomed over the blackened and charred tombstone. The air was heavy with the taste of black magic, even millenia later; Sven tried to ignore the phantom sensation of the coppery taste of blood as he crossed the elaborate threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had come out in a large hall supported by a forest of pillars all along its length. The weak sunlight behind him couldn't penetrate the thick gloom, but unnatural green deadfire burned in a series of braziers. Most of the floor was empty, a space for worshippers to stand or kneel, but at the other end of the room was a carved stone basin, and behind them a single solid wall panel reaching all the way up to the ceiling. The basin was empty now, but Sven had once seen something like it in the his grimoires, and knew it had likely been used to hold the blood of slaves and sacrifices. Statues of hydra and other, stranger beasts stood in alcoves or nestled between the pillars\u2014dragons and sea serpents and things Sven had no name for, but that instictively raised his goosebumps. They flickered with an uncomfortable facsimile of life in the gloom of the fire. <i>I wish Lars was here</i>, Sven thought, <i>to be brave for me.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the other end of the hall, the deadfire light fell across the panel behind the altar. A dark gleaming obsidian, it was covered in ancient scenes. Of battle, of celebration, of wild sex and sombre rituals: all with the all-powerful Magi lording over and abusing their handsome young musclebound slaves. He took out a small silver knife and made a short cut in his hand, and the drops of blood trickled into the basin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Magic Check: 6</b> - Successful<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\n<b>Trait Check: Mage</b> - Successful<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was: the wall dissolved. Gaps in the pillars led onto a long walkway that circled all around the main hall, and around the opposite side of the corridor they found dozens of tiny rooms, little shrines and worship spaces, each one dedicated to a different family of the Magi. Some of them had space only for a statue and a single kneeling supplicant; others were larger, big enough for a few people to stand comfortably and view the murals that decorated their walls and ceilings. A few had deadfire inscriptions, but the didn\u2019t spend long on those: much like the ones upstairs, they were mostly fragments of prayer and impressions of worshippers\u2019 devotion. All of the family names were struck off, as if blasted and hacked vengefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a long, winding, smooth spiral led him to the cavern at the dark heart of the mountain. <i>Caelum</i>, he whispered, and orbs of light flew from his hand in a starbust of white light. The terror of seeing the cavern light up with petrified statues of adventurers almost took his breath away. Only the familiar warmth of the glowing light - <i>reminded Sven of Lars' hands, soft and firm on his shoulders while he took him</i> - stiffened both his resolve and his cock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was doubly true when he realised two young mages were trapped near a large ornate gateway. Suspended in mid-air, clothes torn, they clung to each other. Their preservation spell was almost running out, Sven could tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could make out fragments of words on the portal. He read aloud, even as it felt like ash on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Intelligence Check: 7 </b>- Successful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The darkness of night falls [around] my soul<br>\r\nAnd [the hunter] within loses control...<br>\r\nEmbrace the darkness...<br>\r\nNo [hid]ing in the shadows...<br>\r\nWickedness consumes [me? all?]...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCircles within circles started to move in the portal as the ornate jewels pulsed with purple and green light, then all light an unnatural blood red. <i>Please</i>\u2026, a voice like icicles whispered in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease what?\u201d hr murmured, before she could stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There\u2019s no hope\u2026 no hope\u2026</i>, the voice said\u2014or another voice, maybe. It was hard to tell. <i>Save me\u2026 save us\u2026 please! </i>There was a scream, and then the whispers cut off suddenly, all at once<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark, obsidian diadem moved out of the darkness. A massive corruption stone glowed proudly as its centrepiece, pulsing malevolent power. He could take it, and study it. Find a way to destroy them all magically -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked mages behind him cried out. Their eyes turned the same blood red as the corruption stone took hold, draining their lifeforce. They started to rut and kiss and cum, the stone draining their magic for its own power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven didn't have a choice. He summoned all the power he could reach and his eyes flashed as a golden beam shot directly at the stone, shattering it into pieces. The boys staggered to their feet, humiliated but looking gratefully at Sven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a low, undead groan sounded in the distance. Then more. Then a terrifying chorus, as the statues shuddered into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to go!</span></div></div>",

The complex was ten stories high, and seemed to go off for miles in each direction; the simple grey stone was enchanted to be harder than diamond. In the heyday of the Magi, slaves would work day and night to create monstrous weapons of war for their armies and dreadships for their navies. He turned his head as a familiar voice called his name. Lars waved from the dock as Sven hopped down to greet him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were two men in the temple in strange robes, but they fled when I approached. Couldn't get past the temple wall. Fucking Mages\", he teased, winking at Sven before pulling him in for a kiss, groping his arse. \"But I do love fucking mages. What are you doing here?\" he asked as they walked from the drydock to the central plaza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting,\" Sven said, \"for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weak daylight faded from the empty windows around them, and the room seemed to light with an eerie glow. Slave after slave appeared, phantom apparitions that worked endlessly where machines and ships existed a millenia ago. Large naked men wandered around unseeing and dazed like drones on their phantom tasks. Lars cast off his cloak, revealing his shining gold and white armour. He gripped his sword tightly as he followed Sven to the control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had reached the point furthest from the entrance by then; the room where the Magi would look as their navies took to the sea through wide windows cut high in the ceiling. Sven looked inside and had to stop, blinking in surprise, for there\u2014tethered to the wall by chains as insubstantial as he\u2014was the first slave ghost they had seen who wasn\u2019t just a dumb drone.<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t look like anything special: just an elven man in a ragged loincloth, but his face was serene, the press of his lips firm and resolute, the curve of his spine not dejected but poised. His cock hung proudly between his hairy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also looking directly at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen any new faces,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice rang clearly in Sven\u2019s mind, but the words didn\u2019t match the movements of his mouth, and he made no sound that could be heard by his ears. Feeling oddly like he was trying to listen to something underwater, Sven shook his head out and stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can see us?\u201d Lars asked.<br>\r\nThe ghost nodded to him, but his eyes lingered on Sven. \u201cI can. The others are lost in despair, but my mind remains clear.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we were wondering about that, actually,\u201d Lars said, the tension in his body belying his casual tone. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir souls are trapped,\u201d the ghost said. He was still looking at Sven. \u201cThey paid the ultimate sacrifice, but it has brought them no peace. If you have any pity in your hearts, please: set them free.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s keeping them here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey have given up hope,\u201d the ghost replied. \u201cHope must be restored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Sven said. Lars flexed his hand around his shield. His fingers were very cold, and his breath was appearing in the air.<br>\r\n\u201cDespair feeds on them,\u201d the ghost said, his voice heavy with disapproval. \u201cIt must be destroyed, and fear destroyed, before they will be safe from the great hunger they are fleeing.\u201d His black eyes bored into Sven. \u201cFree them, Consul. Their own masters have abandoned them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven\u2019s eyes widened, and he breathed slowly in and out while Lars shifted uneasily at his side. \u201cHow? What do I have to do?\u201d His breath steamed in the air before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSven,\u201d Lars said, his tone urgent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Magi were taught by the elves to cast magic,\u201d the ghost said. Fingers of frost were spreading across the stone walls, reaching for him. \u201cThey took our sacred stones and filled them with blood and power of my people. Bring hope back to the darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Sven demanded. Why was he so cold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSven! Demon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast of frigid air swept through the room like a tomb being opened. The ghost vanished, and Sven turned to see the doorway occupied by a horror out of nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast looked like a man grown from a lion. Eight feet high, it towered above both brothers. It had fearsome claws on both hands. It\u2019s obscenely large cock drooled precum, and Sven could see a cock ring lined with corruption stones. The demon roared through its fangs, hitting him with another cold blast of air, but Lars braced and leaned into it, lifting his arm and using his shield to protect . Then the wind died down, and he threw himself forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d had no time to make a plan, but he and Lars had fought and loved and lived every waking moment together. He knew Lars\u2019 body as well as his own. He raised his hand and watched as time slowed for everything but the two of them as Lars dove for the Demon; Sven wove a layer of shielding around his twin\u2019s body and sharpening his senses. Lars often described it as a feeling of tight warmth, like when their limbs were wrapped around each other in bed. Sven grinned, thinking about Lars\u2019 cock hardening as he charged into battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLars hacked at the demon with his sword, piercing its hide and tearing holes in its tattered cloak. Shrieking its response, it turned its claws on him. The demon shrieked as it tore at him, but the sound was distorted, out of step with their heightened speed. Stubbornly Lars ignored the cold that emanated from it, wounding its tough furred hide. It screeched again, bringing its fists down towards him, but he was already somewhere else, her blades biting into its side. The demon\u2019s eyes glowed a malevolent red as its own magic started to push back Sven\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair whirled after Lars, catching his armour with its powerful claws as he started to slow. Lars hit the wall hard, his chest and crotch exposed, trying to fight through the flare of pain to stay on his feet. The demon and the Paladin stood, glowering at each other, cocks hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon started towards her, only for a golden glow to appear beneath its feet, freezing it in place. Sven moved defiantly in front of his brother, straining with the effort of keeping the evil creature in place. It's eyes glowed a blood red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was the point</i>, an insidious thought seemed to ask in his head. They had no hope of winning this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSven!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of his twin forced Sven to clear his mind and carry on. His and his twin\u2019s eyes flashed gold and they stood naked, hard, and haloed in golden power. Sven thrust one hand forward and chunk of stone tore itself out of the wall and hurled itself at the demon, shattering against its heavy balls. Just the distraction Sven needed. Waves of golden power lapped at Sven\u2019s feet, and he cried out from effort as it took hold over the demon and lifted it into the air. Lars soldiered forward and struck decisively, breaking the black cockring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon let out one last defiant screech, cumming load after load after load over both twins, and Sven watched as its possessed body was drained of power. A naked, exhausted man covered in ancient symbols lay in a puddle of his own cum, before dissolving as Sven\u2019s power finally broke the millena-old curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold in his hands melted away like it had never been. He let out a breath, and along with it seemed to exhale a tension from his shoulders that he hadn\u2019t even been aware of. Lars was on him instantly, hugging him close and kissing him soundly. Lars had him on his back with his legs in the air. Sven grinned as his twin forced his cock harshly into his waiting hole; he loved post-battle rough fucks, when Lars held nothing back. They would return to the ship soon, but first they'd celebrate victory together.</span></div></div>",

The dying rays of the summer sun bathed his naked body in a warm glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCesar felt his cock stir into life as he stared at Mount\u2019s pale and rounded arse. He jogged through the wheat field shedding his own clothes, picking up more speed as he dashed up the hill. Mason turned around and yelped in surprise, scrambling to escape. Cesar tackled him to the soft grass, pressing their bodies together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you calling old man?\u201d Cesar demanded playfully, rolling his hips against Mason\u2019s. The young human reached up, and Cesar willingly allowed himself to be flipped over by the young human. <br>\r\n\u201cYou, old man. Just because you\u2019re an elf doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not middle aged.\u201d<br>\r\nMount took his hand and caressed the side of Cesar\u2019s face tenderly, stroking from his pointed ears to the small scar just above his neck. Their cocks, pressed against each other, pulsed at the familiar gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason looked distant as he traced his other hand down Cesar\u2019s torso, matted with hair and a criss-cross of scars and near-misses. <br>\r\n\u201cDo you miss it?\u201d Mount asked curiously. He touched Cesar\u2019s scars reverently, as if committing them to memory. He had never thought that he would make it out alive from the war, much less that someone could love his scarred body so intensely. <br>\r\n\u201cI miss the people, sometimes. The adrenaline. But not the fighting, or the blood. I don\u2019t miss it, no. Besides...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waggled his eyebrows lewdly to break the sombre mood, slapping Mason\u2019s arse.<br>\r\n\u201cIf I was still a mercenary, I\u2019d never have found a lost farmer on the road trying to get to Cantabria.\u201d<br>\r\nHe reached up and brought Mason closer.<br>\r\n\u201cNever have found you fighting those bandits.\u201d<br>\r\nHe shifted so his cock slid into the tight, familiar, heat of Mason\u2019s arse. The farmer started riding wantonly, his head thrown back in a dumb grin. <br>\r\n\u201cNever have saved you. Kissed you. Fucked you right there on the road.\u201d<br>\r\nHe grasped Mount\u2019s hand in his, the matching golden bands glinting in the last rays of sunlight. <br>\r\n\u201cNever have made you mine.\u201d<br>\r\nMason dropped closer and Cesar kissed his neck just as harshly as he had the first time, as they both came. They lay together, comfortably and content, as dusk finally settled.<br>\r\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t bandits,\u201d Mason mumbled sleepily against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFireworks exploded in bright and wonderful colours overhead as Mason sat with little Andrew in his lap. Perched high on the great branches where the Cealc made their homes, his husband pointed out each new vibrant display while the neighbour\u2019s toddler clapped gleefully. Cesar felt something tight in his chest at the sight; that his clan had trusted a human so much, yes. Cesar couldn\u2019t shake the thought that they might one day have a child of their own. To teach archery and football to, to go camping, to love unconditionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head slightly, and watched proudly as the clan chanted and danced at the shrine, reaching the climax of the festival: the totem opened, and a vibrant green light shone out. The idol levitated, bathing the clearing and the village in pure magic. He heard distant screams start to rise up from all around and with the sharp pain of blunt steel against his head, the world went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to struggle to his feet as flashes went by. Screaming. Fire. Pain. Everything was red. What was happening? He raised his head in time to see a sight that stole the breath from his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason stood, emotionless and clad in black with the idol in his hand. Four men in similar uniforms were stood next to him and their conversation could be heard over the inferno. His husband\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Kepa. I\u2019ve spent enough time with the fucking knife-ears-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not very inclusive of you for an Elf lover-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you Holland, I-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk you three, we\u2019ve got it in the chest. Let\u2019s go. Kroos will be glad to see you\u2019ve succeed, Mount.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the best there is for as reason, Tierney.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of twinks started to leave, flanked by large men with frightening metal face armour. Cesar had one thought as he slipped back into unconsciousness. He needed...</span></div></div>",
