As you watched them drive away, you drove back to the jewelry store and turned into the woman, wedding gown and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of your car and grinned, walking inside, with a gun strapped to your new sexy leg, which was hidden from view thanks to the dress. When you reached the counter you took out the gun and smashed them all in with it, which was held by dainty, manicured hands and a new wedding ring. You stole as much as you can, hopped in the car and drove away, smiling at the loot you got. You were smart enough to park where there were no security cameras, so the car you're in would never be tracked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled up to your house, still in the wedding gown, and drove into the garage, closing it behind you. From there you removed the plates in the car with new ones, just to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shapeshifted to a early 20s brunette woman in professional wear (a white blouse, black pencil skirt, and black high heels) and stepped outside through the side door and went to your mailbox, grabbing mail which was all addressed to \"Megan McFadden;\" bills, news magazines, pointless credit card offers, and a few magazines, namely Teen Vogue, People, Women's Health, and the new Victoria's Secret catalog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped inside, but not before waving at the friendly elderly couple tending to their gardens next door. You sighed. \"Finally home,\" you said to yourself. You tossed all the mail in the garbage and sat down to watch some football, kicking off your heels and sitting on the couch like a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of this home? Megan McFadden. Who was she? She didn't exist. Well, she does in a way. You're her. Your real identity, Andrew Chadwick, already has a warrant out for it's arrest and you couldn't risk buying a home under that name. To further keep up appearances, you subscribed to mail \"Megan\" would normally subscribe to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who was Megan? Sure, she didn't exist, but who was she? She was a 22 year old receptionist at an office that doesn't exist, which explains why you would always shapeshift into her in professional wear when going home. You couldn't risk ever robbing or committing crimes in this form, as without it you're homeless.</span></div></div>",

There was a good looking blonde woman in her mid thirties, silky smooth hair past her shoulders, and she was wearing a white top, a pink cardigan, khaki capris and a pair of heeled sandals. \"Look honey, just take the kids and head to the plane okay, I'll catch up\" you heard the woman say to her husband, who was leading their two children around by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" you chuckled, \"And...kind of careless too\" you added, when you saw the woman rest her tickets and purse on the counter while she crouched down to adjust her right sandal.

A quick glance back at your doppleganger brought another smirk to your face, and then you disappeared from view, leaving her there. \"Ready honey?\" you said to the woman's husband, patting him hard on the ass as you past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new husband frowned a little, and then ushered his kids onto the aircraft after you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have learned about his whereabouts for several months now and you managed to infiltrate the school, posing as teachers, school staff, and students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that he had created a false family to settle down and avoiding the spotlight. You took the pleasure of knowing that Justin was totally oblivious about you. You even tried to disguise yourself to get close to 'Jennifer'.  There were at least three times you tried to approach her as someone else. First as a jock named Martin who accidentally met Jennifer in a club. Then as a nerd who approached her at the city library  when she was researching for school paper and then as Jennifer's various friends at the school. Jennifer's besties in the cheerleader squad are your favorite choice. You have become Maria Peretti,the petite raven-haired cheers; Yumiko Namada, one of Jennifer's closest confidante and Elizabeth McEnroe - or the notorious Libby. She was the wildest girl out of all the gang.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Libby, you managed to establish good relationship with 'Jennifer'.  With Yumiko and Maria, you went to concerts and held pajama parties together. With meticulous planning, you found it easy to juggle between identities. Sometimes you became Maria and hung out with Yumiko  or posed as Yumiko and study together with Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you got closer to Jennifer, you found out that sometimes, - whenever Justin/Jennifer was busy with his other identities - you could turn yourself into Jennifer and go out with the real Libby. It started with visiting the mall together, then you went to parties and even to other cities. In one of those trips, Libby told you that she was pregnant and she wasn't ready for the consequences. She said that her parents would have her fly abroad. When you learned about this, you consoled your friend and told her that everything would be alright. As you hugged Libby, you already concocted a plan to impersonate her while she's gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice your evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same smile flashing on your Hannah Pritchett's face as you emerged from the toilet It just took seconds to walk back to your seat, where your 'family' sat. But in those seconds, you have recalled a brief summary on your life as characters around Justin Webb/Jennifer Wesker. Justin/Jennifer never realized that you have been very close.  If you wanted, you could create a lot of troubles in his life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it can wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you just enjoyed this plane ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt an interest in her, unaware it's because she was also one with special abilities just like yourself. Despite your usual spree of negativity, you actually wanted to befriend her. The very idea of this disgusted you as you didn't need friends, but at the same time you were fond of the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find a way to get close to her...\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat in your car you watched the principal of the school leave the school building and off campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou morphed into an exact copy of him and went into the school building, knowing exactly what you plan to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the principals office and sat down at his chair, looking around the room for a way to learn more about her. Seeing that the computer was logged into the school system, you looked up the girl's license plate, knowing it would be in the school system since students need a permit to park on school grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer Wesker...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up her school schedule and extra-curricular activities and saw she was also a cheerleader. \"Damn, you just keep getting more hot,\" you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew if you wanted to get close to her you'd need to become a student yourself. You looked up the attendance list of the school and saw there was a girl who hasn't showed up in weeks. Curious as to why, you called up her parents (under the guise of the school principal to find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir, it's just...she ran away a few weeks ago. She left a note saying she ran away to New York City to start a new life for herself.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,\" you lied. You hung up and started looking up her information and saw she had a lot of classes with Jennifer and was also a cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the girl's photo once more, and then again at the name. Macie Johnson. You smiled and shapeshifted into an exact copy of her, crossing your legs as you leaned back in the principal's chair. You were now wearing a pink shirt, a short denim skirt and black high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brushed your new blonde hair out of your face and left the principal's office, but not before writing down the address of your new home. Teetering in your new shoes, you decided to sneak into the gym lockers first. You found a locker that that open and stole a pair of flats from it and slipped them on. \"Ha, be more careful with your stuff,\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the school building and, half an hour later, found the address you had written down. You walked towards the door, your heels in your hand and the paper with the address on it in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rang the doorbell and the girl's mother opened the door. She saw you and her eyes widened. She called her husband over and they both stared at you with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad... I'm home.\" you said with a genuine smile.</span></div></div>",

There was no convincing her or duping her easily.<br>\r\nYou walk closer, smiling. It was her meek, timid look you would take on. If you tried to remain as Jennifer Wesker, you might be putting yourself in greater danger.<br>\r\nBut how could the government have found you? Why so suddenly? Why play that card now? What was going on, dammit?!<br>\r\nYour powers had never gone wrong before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense the bones and muscles in your jaw crunching and grinding together into the form of Emily's sharp chin. Cracking, snapping, clicking, silently. When this happened three years ago, the effects were absolutely excruciating. Not anymore. You nestle your chin into your solar plexus and breathe slowly and deeply through your shrinking lips and mouth. Your swollen tongue becomes thin out and you suck back the sudden rush of saliva.<br>\r\nYour heart rate gradually rises and falls within your chest. What was once large, heavy chest. The balloons had been deflated. The fat, muscle and glandular tissue all flatten out by a most gradual and minute increment. The nipples themselves stay roughly the same size, you feel under Jennifer's large bra. You ignore this and look up at the breathless, horrified Emily. She seems to be growing taller until you realise that your head and perpendicular line of vision was shrinking as your heights matched. You feet become smaller, yet calloused and much firmer and more rigid than before. You need smaller shoes. Emily had done ballet to a high grade when she was younger, her feet would have to have been deformed slightly from that.<br>\r\nYou blink.<br>\r\nArms and legs shrinking. Becoming weaker. Emily's arms and legs.<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to a display of crazy colours swirling around in your vision, like intensified hypnogogia.<br>\r\nYou blink again and its gone. You resume approaching Emily, unfazed.<br>\r\nYou adapt to the new sensations remarkably quickly, though a little disconcerted by the growth of a small bush of pubic hair under Jennifer's boy-shorts.<br>\r\nYour smile returns and you begin to giggle in a higher-pitched faster giggle than was customary for Jennifer. The air vibrates in her little body at a faster rate. You were not as good-looking as before. That was a fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily Darke was an academic prodigy. She excelled in all her school subjects and, despite being a first year student, there, had only turned fourteen recently. You could not even hope that you would be able to pretend to be Emily in class. But, she had not many real friends except for you, and it would be easy to mimic her mannerisms in hallways.<br>\r\nYou had a plan that would not involve that at all. You had a plan that involved a new trick that no federal operative would ever see coming. You had a trick that would enable you to easily escape forever, leaving behind no trail at all.<br>\r\nYou were still wearing Jennifer's clothes: her sports bra, boyshorts, pink shoes etc. You think about it for a second and the boyshorts melt into your thighs. Feeling Emily's bushier pubes presents a temporarily sensual experience, but you focus yourself and get back on track. Your concentration now was paramount.<br>\r\nThe real Emily prepares to scream. It was too late, though. You launch your newer, daintier hand onto her shoulder and almost faint...<br>\r\nInstantly, you are wearing Emily's clothes, attracting them onto your skin with DNA flux, while transferring your own clothes onto where Emily's body had been. However, moving from your hand was pulsing, luminous tissue. The colour changes from a sickly green to the colour of skin, specifically, Jennifer's skin. The tissue stretches across Emily's body from your hands until it encased her completely, a cocoon of Jennifer's image. If you broke contact, however, you knew the skin would retract and the girl would become Emily. She would regain consciousness some time after you let go. <br>\r\nYou bend over, paying attention to the different ways your new body handled such motions, and scoop the Jennifer-shell Emily and begin to move, as fast as you can despite the immense weight of that burden and your reduced arm strength.<br>\r\nIn order to go faster, as you move, you convert subcutaneous fat into muscle. Thus, in a very small amount of time, you barge past everyone and into the nurse's office.<br>\r\nThe resident nurse at the school was a very hot way out for you.<br>\r\nShe was in a winter nurse's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse's main turn-on was her height, roughly three-quarters of a foot taller than your host, at about the same age as Justin Webb really was. Most of that heigh in her unnaturally long, pale, skinny legs which became tiny at her delicate feet and ankles, but wide at the hips and upper thighs. Her white skirt was just hovering above knee length. She never wore tights though, always keeping her nice legs on parade. In fact, she was never seen to be wearing any form of sock at all under her modest little flats.<br>\r\nFrom her somewhat noticeably curved pelvis, her belly was noticeably absent, as if that of an underweight model or something like that. Yet her breasts had to be fake. Padded. Fake. No woman had such large cups, easily an E or F cup, not unlikely a size larger than that either.<br>\r\nHer hair was dyed ash blond and tucked into a fishnet bun under her white hat.<br>\r\nHer face was very small and round, with an understated grin often on her face corresponding to her fun-loving personality. She wasn't as slutty as some of the jealous girls in your year seemed to suggest (subjectively).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou presumed that because your powers may have been affected by an external interference, you ought to take precautions as if the FBI had found you and were after you. As you were carrying Jennifer, anyone looking for you that were trained to identify the bodies you had previously used. You needed another. Emily's was the easiest to take and you deftly used that body and confusion around it to your advantage, by disguising it as the body the authorities would be searching for. Therefore, if you came across anyone taking too much interest in unconscious decoy-Jennifer, they were definitely FBI sent after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plan was to copy this woman's body, knock out the old version and hide her and Emily away in that room somewhere so that they would come to when you were long out of there in Nursey's car. There, you could find a new life and make records and start over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop Emily on the table, begin to copy the nurse's body and pick up a tranquillising syringe. You hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if nobody was after you at all? What if it was all in your head and the powers, the side effects of those chemicals, were naturally fading and using the aforementioned powers only made you more liable to lose them at a more sudden rate??<br>\r\nIf you had no powers, then what? Then it was game over, all because you had strained yourself over some dumb fantasy. Maybe the coin was the butterfly effect nudging you over the end of some tether and setting off a delayed chain reaction. Chemistry, that was all this was, un-researched Chemistry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The driver previously stole a truck that contained newly found chemicals in the back. The crash leaked the chemicals onto the site of the accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe FBI cleaned up everything and erased the very existence of you or your family in order for them to research what the chemicals did on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the chemicals resulted in death to everyone, and somehow temporarily put your body into a state that perfectly mimics death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScientists gave up on the project and got rid of the bodies. Before they can dispose of you, you woke up and ran from the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing that the government is on the hunt for you, you started hiding out in empty houses. It was at one house you were squatting in that you learned these chemicals gave you an ability unlike any other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had the ability to shapeshift. You could turn into anyone just by thinking about it, right down to the DNA structure. The clothing you wore even changes as well, and whatever they had on their person. Peoples wallets and purses would be perfectly replicated, leaving you to have everything they had without them even knowing you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ended up using this to your advantage and built a new life for yourself. It's been three years and you're now living a life ten times better then you recently had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe government has given up on the search for you and have declared Justin Webb to be deceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now live in a nice two story house in the suburbs, blending in with everyone else.<br>\r\nYou even made a new identity for yourself, which you came up with after dozens of trial and error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now Jennifer Wesker. 17, and a sophomore in high school. You have average grades, nothing spectacular. You're even in the cheerleading squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to not make yourself stand out, you created a new family for Jennifer, and periodically go out as an adult male, female, or a 14 year old version of the real you, to make it seem like a family does live there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now living a normal life, and everything seems to be perfect, save for the average teenage drama you get to enjoy again.<br>\r\nFortunately, the government doesn't even know of your actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, something that, for some reason hasn't crossed your mind, is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to the drunk driver?<br>\r\nWell, let's just say you're not the only one with the ability to shapeshift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your story.</td>",
