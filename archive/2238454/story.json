The son of Walter and Wendy, and a smart and kind but cowardly toddler. His fears include bullies, thunder and lightning, and the rabbit who sells batteries on television. Nonetheless, if one of his friends is being bullied, he will put aside his cowardice long enough to save them. His goals in life are to be a brave hero and to be toilet-trained before his third birthday. Ryan takes after his father, Walter, in both looks and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brad Hunter</b>, age 2.5. The son of Stephen and Ashley, and an adventurous toddler who is Ryan's best friend. Brad is a lot more adventurous than Ryan is, and often tries to talk him into going on dangerous adventures. He does care a lot about Ryan, though, and is often quick to defend him if someone is trying to hurt him physically or emotionally. Brad's interests include sports, video games, and sports-themed video games. Brad takes after his father, Stephen, in personality, but his mother, Ashley, in looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alice Finklemeyer</b>, age 2.5. The daughter of Hector and Helen. Alice is beautiful as she is kind. Her favorite toy is Orville, a teddy bear she got from the mall in her old home on her second birthday. When she first moved in next to the McHiggins' house, she won the hearts of Ryan and Brad with her beauty, but the three settled on being just really good friends with each other for the time being. Ryan and Brad are extremely loyal to Alice, and will protect her from Butch at any costs. Alice is afraid of spiders, and will freak out if one gets near her.</span></div></div>",

The other one? Walter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stephen Hunter</b>, age 25. Brad's father and Walter's best friend. Stephen has an extensive knowledge of video games, which makes him the ideal employee at the local GameShop. Although he's very good at his job and he's willing to help out his wife and son whenever he can, he spends a lot of his spare time playing video games, and is also more of a softy when it comes to disciplining Brad. Stephen and Walter have been best friends since childhood, and their friendship lives on through their sons, Brad and Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ashley Hunter</b>, age 24. Brad's mother. She spends a lot of her time taking care of Brad, and she's also much more strict than Stephen is when it comes to disciplining him. Underneath her motherly exterior, she enjoys video games and is always happy to be Stephen's second player.</span></div></div>",
