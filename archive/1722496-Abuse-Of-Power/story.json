He landed with a sickening thump just in front of one of the warehouse walls. For a moment, he didn't move, but then he began to get to his feet, somewhat groggily. \"Fuck!\" he groaned, as he checked himself to see if he was hurt, miraculously...he wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" came the next obvious answer Carl asked himself. He hadn't noticed that he was now completely sober, all effects of the alcohol he had drinking all night had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back over to the meteor, Carl saw that it was no longer glowing, however he still refrained from touching it again. He circled it a few times, wondering whether to report the occurence, but he decided against it. Hating the police as much as he did, he wanted nothing to do with them. Glancing at his watch, Carl noticed it had stopped. \"Great!\" he sighed, letting his arm slump back down by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck this, I'm going home\" he then told himself, deciding to leave the area...and to leave the mysterious, other wordly object where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl headed down the street towards the direction of his apartment, taking little notice of the people around him. It was 10:47pm and after what had just happened, he just wanted to get home and hit the sack.</span></div></div>",

He walked slowly through the night as the breeze drifted through the trees and the quiet streets of the neighborhood.  Few in the part of town were out this late at night; this was the type of place where unpleasant things happened at this hour.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at his apartment building, Carl ascended the stairs, each step a chore Carl seemed to undertake with a resounding absence of grace and poise.  As Carl walked noisily up the beaten-up wooden stairs that creaked below his weight, he reached into his pocket and fiddled about with his keys, one of which was to his own apartment.  He pulled them out and looked through them hastily.  \"Which fucking one is it?\u201d he asked himself, \"let\u2019s see...this one\u2019s to the mailbox,\u201d he said as he ruled out one key.  \"This one's to the safety deposit box...here's to he damn storage unit,\u201d he went on, \"ah ha!  Here we go,\u201d Carl said as he shoved the key into the lock and opened the door to his home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the mess of an apartment, tossing the keys roughly on the table right next to the tower of beer cans and the nearly filled ash tray.  The harsh aroma of cigarette smoke hung thickly in the air.  Carl's flicking on a light switch illuminated the place a bit, though the light was on its last legs and so flickered a bit.  He lumbered slowly over to his favorite chair, brushed it free of potato chip remnants, and plopped himself down in it in front of the television.  He grabbed the remote and turned on the TV.  Carl sat in relative silence as he flipped through the channels, his only noises being the curses he hurled at the refs in the Ohio State basketball game that didn\u2019t turn out as he wanted.  Slowly though, Carl's long day got the better of him, and he dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl awoke suddenly as he heard three loud knocks at the door.  Dazed, he looked about the apartment go get his senses about him, the time required for which brought three more loud knocks.  Carl stiffly stood up out of the comfy chair.  \"I'm comin\u2019 dammit...hold your fucking horses,\u201d he said as he headed to the door.  After undoing a couple locks, Carl pulled the door back gruffly and beheld the person who dared disturb his slumber.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight before Carl\u2019s eyes made him wonder whether he should be excited or scared.  On one hand, it was a cop; on the other hand, she was HOT!  \"Carl Edwards?\u201d the woman asked in mechanical voice, seeming devoid of personality.  \"U...yeah,\u201d he said as he stepped back to behold the woman before him.  My, she was a sight!  This woman had curly blonde hair that hung down past her shoulders.  It framed a face that suggested this woman was in her mid-40s; a wrinkle appeared here and there owing to age, but she still looked spectacular.  Farther down on this woman\u2019s wonderful body was a set of very large boobs that strained against the tight material of the police uniform.  Luckily for Carl, the officer had left the top few buttons of her uniform undone because of the heat of the morning, thus allowing him to see the tops of the wonderfully full, jello-like mounds that adorned her chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer had a full body...farther down there was a belly that seemed to be a little bit bloated, with a bit of flab sticking out.  For a woman of her age, it was to be expected, as were the wonderfully wide, motherly hips and accompanying mom-butt, that beautifully full posterior few younger women had.  All this was encased in a tight-fitting police uniform that accentuated every curve, every jiggle, and every beautiful bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Edwards?\" came the woman's voice as Carl stood numbly and looked her over lustily.  \"Uh....yeah...sorry.  What?\u201d he stammered.  \"May I enter?\u201d she said.  \"What an unusual way to ask to come in,\" Carl thought as he stood aside and motioned the busty officer inside.  \"Sorry about the mess,\u201d he told her, \"I didn\u2019t expect I'd be getting a visit from the city's finest,\" he said, somewhat irritated at the sight of a cop, even one as beautiful as this one.  The officer entered, though her movements were somewhat strange, awkward really.  The cop's boobs jiggled with each clumsy step.  Now in the apartment, she closed the door.  Strangely, she also locked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Edwards,\" she began, \"my name is Brenda Nelson.  There was a...disturbance...in town last night.  Do you know anything about it?\" she said, crossing her arms across her beautiful and full chest.  \"Nope,\" Carl said, not wanting to be hauled in to answer more questions about what he saw, \"I ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019.\"  \"Are you certain of that, Mr. Edwards?\" Nelson said in her still-emotionless voice, tilting her head to the side in a quizzical but almost robotic fashion. She began to move toward Carl, and he began to back up.  \u201cUh\u2026yeah sure.  I was home watchin\u2019 the game and havin\u2019 some smokes,\u201d he said, wondering at Nelson\u2019s rather aggressive moves in his direction, and having some trouble keeping his eyes from her jiggling chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Nelson reached out and grabbed Carl by the throat, squeezing his neck hard and lifting him clean off the ground, leaving his feet kicking in mid-air as he struggled.  \"What the fuck?!\" he managed to squeal as he tried with all his might to pry her tightened fingers from his throat, but to no avail.  He looked down at Nelson to see her face was teeming with rage.  Then, Carl saw something even more strange.  Nelson's eyes seemed to glow green for a moment, and she opened her mouth, letting out a slight hissing sound as a strange lizard-like tongue snaked its way out and tasted the air.  \"What the hell are you?!\" Carl struggled to get out.  She spoke, \"I am the thing sent to retrieve the technology you stole; I will pry those powers from your lifeless corpse, human!\" but the voice that came out was not hers alone.  It seemed a strange amalgam of Brenda Nelson\u2019s voice and that of another entity...something...alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powers?\u201d Carl grunted, \"what powers?\u201d  \"Do not deceive me you little worm!\u201d  she said angrily, her voice still strange, \"I have spent enough time here forcing my way into this pathetic human body and enduring the advances of the males of your pitiful species.  The mammary glands on this body's front seem to be very important in your culture, but I care nothing for them.  Now, tell me what I want to know!\" she demanded.  Thinking quickly, Carl reached into his pocket and brought out the lighter from the night before.  He lit it and held the fire close to the hand that clutched his throat.  Nelson held fast for a moment, but then the intense heat became too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaarggghhhh,\" the creature said, as she let Carl go, letting him drop roughly to the ground.  The creature recoiled, holding her hand in pain, her eyes glowing green again.  Carl hit the ground rather ungracefully, staggering back.  Because he was already near the edge of the room, as he staggered back, Carl put himself through his own window.  Hearing the crashing of glass behind him, Carl then felt himself falling.  \"Oh shit!\" he screamed as he crashed through the glass and into the open air, beginning to fall.  Carl fell through the air, flailing about as his vision was filled alternately by buildings, the ground, and the sky.  Suddenly, Carl slammed into something below.  \"Awww fuck,\" he groaned as he felt pain in his back.  He looked around and saw broken glass about him.  He rolled over and got his feet back on the ground, realizing that he had landed on the officer's police car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tCarl finds somewhere to hide.  <br>\r\n2)\tA middle-aged woman driving by runs up to Carl to see if he's all right.<br>\r\n3)\tThe officer jumps from the window above and lands near Carl, still determined to pursue him.<br>\r\n4)\tA female postal worker runs up to Carl to tend to him.<br>\r\n5)\tHe wakes up in a hospital.       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s got some pain in his back and legs, but he seems to be healing quickly.  \"Crazy bitch!\u201d Carl exclaims to himself as he runs over to the side of the building, expecting Officer Nelson to come bounding from the building in the next couple minutes.  He hesitantly opens the lid on a dumpster next to the building and dives in to save himself.  In among the stench of rotting food, Carl peers out from the partially opened lid of the container, wanting to wait until Nelson...or the thing inside her...has left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up to the window, and he sees Nelson still up there, simply looking down into the alley.  \"What the hell is she doing?\u201d Carl muses to himself in genuine confusion.  Then, officer stands up in the frame where the window used to be.  Bracing herself, she leaps from the building!  She flies through the air and hits the ground rather gracefully, causing a wonderful jiggle in her full and voluptuous body.  \"Holy shit!\" Carl exclaimed as Nelson just stood up and brushed herself off very quickly, seeming to be in no pain.  She looked around a little, the lizard-like tongue protruding from her mouth again.  Finding no one and with her car now demolished, the officer set out on foot.  She walked, hips swaying beautifully, down the vacant alley toward the open street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too damn close!\u201d Carl said to himself as he climbed from the dumpster and wiped himself off.  Fairly certain he could not return to his apartment, Carl needed to find somewhere to decompress.  He walked through the alley, surprised a bit at how quickly the pain had seemed to go away.  He walked through the throngs of people, always afraid that Officer Nelson would be the next one he saw, and who would see him.  The sun shone down brightly on the crowd as Carl made his way through it.  He crossed the street to another apartment building and entered, walking up another set of creaky stairs and down a narrow hallway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to apartment 4C, one inhabited by a friend of his, and knocked.  After a few moments, someone fiddled with the locks on the other side, and the door opened.  Standing before Carl was his long-time friend and partner in crime Phillip Kellerman, or Phil for short.  He was a short man, only about five feet six inches tall, with a rather plump build (thanks to too much beer and pizza), thinning black hair, and an unshaven face.  The door opened, and Phil smiled, \"Carl dude, how\u2019s it go...\u201d and he abruptly stopped, the smile quickly dropping off his face.  He put his finger to his nose to pinch his nostrils shut.  \"Dude, don\u2019t take this wrong, but you fucking stink!\u201d he declared, backing away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Phil, that's actually kind of what I'm here about.  I had to hide in a damn dumpster from a psycho-bitch cop!  This chic is seriously messed up...can I crash here?\" Carl said pleadingly.  Phil paused.  \"Sure,\u201d he said, \"but you're taking a damn shower!\u201d  Phil stepped back as Carl entered the apartment and made a b-line for the bathroom.  He quickly disrobed and looked himself over, amazed at the absence of cuts and bruises, or even really pain of any kind, from his fall.  Carl quickly showered and emerged smelling much better.  He put on a set of clothes belonging to Phil's brother Jim, a man of about his own size.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No answer.  \u201cPhil!\u201d he tried again.  Still no answer.  Carl drifted over to the counter, strewn upon which were beer bottles and Twinkie rappers, as well as a note.  Carl bent over to read it.  \"Carl, ran across town to see my ma...something about needing a new ceiling fan put in.  Back whenever.  Phil.\u201d  \"He'll probably be a while,\u201d Carl thought.  He paced about wondering what to do, realizing soon that he sorely needed a rest.  His slumber had been unduly interrupted by Officer Nelson, or whatever thing that was inside her body.  Now was perhaps a time to get some shut-eye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl plopped himself down on the couch, folded his arms over his chest, and closed his eyes.  As he drifted toward sleep, Carl felt strange.  He felt...lighter, almost as if he were drifting out of his body.  Thinking this feeling was odd, Carl opened his eyes and looked about, realizing that he now was above the back of the couch for some reason.  He turned his head to glance down only to see his own body lying there!  \"Holy shit!,\u201d Carl said in disbelief, and he suddenly fell to the floor, rolling sideways a bit right off the couch.  He slowly picked himself up off the floor and glanced at what he thought was the impossible:  his own lifeless body there before him.  He snapped his finger a few times over his own head, as if to wake himself, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am...am...am I dead?\u201d Carl asked himself as he staggered back in amazement.  Carl put his hands to his head, trying to make sense of the rush, of all the things that had befallen him today.  \"What the hell's going on!?\u201d he demanded, as he began to run toward the exit of the apartment, just needing air. It was only after Carl was in the hallway of the apartment complex that he realized he'd completely phased through the damn door! \"Oh...oh my god,\u201d he said, starting to breathe quite heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Carl heard footsteps nearby.  He looked in the direction of the noise and saw its source.  Down the hall and close to the stairs was a woman.  Her name:  Leah Hernandez.  She was about 40 or 42 years of age, having come from Mexico as a fairly young child.  She had long black hair that ran down to the middle of her back.  She'd had three children; this, combined with the fact that she now approached middle-aged, meant that her body had begun to give way a little bit.  Carl looked at her face and saw the beginnings of a wrinkle here and there.  Her body was...full.  Leah had a voluptuous and curvy form; she was not fat by any means, but she certainly had some meat on her bones.  Her breasts were large and jiggled beautifully, much to Carl's pleasure.  Her belly had a bit of flab, but not too much, and her hips were wonderfully wide.  Attached to said hips was an absolutely beautiful ass, one that swayed back and forth with her every beautiful step.  Her legs were smooth, but thick and meaty at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's main concern was talking to her...he needed help.  He ran up to her and beheld her spectacular body.  She was wearing yoga clothes, clothes that hugged every glorious curve of her body.  \"Mam, can you please help me...I...I think I'm going crazy or something,\u201d he asked, panicked.  The woman said nothing; she just opened her door and walked into her apartment.  Desperate, Carl followed her in.  \"Lady, please...please I just need to talk to somebody here!\u201d he implored, but the result was the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to her table and bet over to write something down, thus exposing her wonderfully full ass encased tightly in the work-out clothes.  Looking at the table, Carl could see she was writing a grocery list.  \"Answer me!\u201d Carl shouted as he went to take her hand.  As he did, the strangest thing happened.  Carl didn't grab her hand...his hand phased into hers!  Leah seemed to be trying to write, but her hand just did not cooperate.  \"Holy crap...\u201d Carl said, amazed at what he was seeing.  He thought this might be a way to communicate.  Leah was obviously distressed, unable to control the actions of her own appendages.  As she grunted and gritted her teeth, her hand scribbled something on the paper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carl was done, he removed his hand from hers, and they both stepped back in exasperation.  Leah approached the notepad pensively and gazed at it.  Scrawled upon the paper in Carl's handwriting was the word \u201cHELP!!!\u201d  \"Oh dios mio,\u201d Leah said, and her jaw dropped.  She stepped back in horror, and her pulse quickened.  Carl was desperate.  Then a thought struck him.  \"...may have to go for broke here,\u201d Carl said.  He slowly stepped up behind Leah Hernandez so that his posture matched up with hers.  She stood there breathing heavily because of the thing that had just freaked her out.  Slowly, Carl inched closer and simply stepped into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was a bit rough.  Leah's voluptuous body shook and convulsed a bit as she struggled for control.  Within mere seconds, though, Carl took over.  His vision cleared, and he brought up his hand to brush beautiful locks of black hair from his field of view.  In so doing, he looked as his dainty, womanly hands, a few shades darker than he was used to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my go...\u201d he began, only to be cut short by the strangeness of his higher voice and accent.  He put his hand to his mouth in amazement, which led him to poke and prod at his smooth skin.  Gone was the stubble of a beard, replaced with the beautiful, full, blemish-free face of a middle-aged Latina woman.  His hands probed farther down.  There was an odd but undeniable weight on his chest.  Glancing down, Carl noted two very large globes protruding from his chest.  He smiled in delight.  Carl grasped he low-hanging collar of his work-out shirt and pulled it forward enough to reveal the two gorgeous mounds.  He jumped up and down in delight, eliciting a beautiful jiggle from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands continued their journey down to his slightly flabby middle and his wonderfully round ass and wide hips.  He slapped his new body on the ass, feeling a wonderful shaking as he did.  \"This woman is...perfect,\u201d he said as he looked himself over and glanced into the mirror at Leah Hernandez's reflection, smiling deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tHe hears Phil walking down the hallway looking for him\u2014Carl, that is.<br>\r\n2)\tOne of Leah\u2019s kids comes home.<br>\r\n3)\tHe hears Officer Nelson just down the hall asking questions!      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw the police officer...or whatever was inside her, leap from the window and land on her feet not far from him. Despite the drop, she seemed completely unharmed, and even the other people in the street couldn't believe what they were seeing. Carl just set off running as he saw officer Nelson's eyes again glow green...a look of anger etched on her face. She wasted no time in pursuing Carl as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowly avoiding being hit by several cars, Carl stumbled...did a front roll...and then clambered back to his feet before darting into an alleyway. The creature inside Brenda Nelson's body kept its pace as it ran after Carl, the huge breasts of its host bounced heavily with each stride, and it didn't think twice before knocking into other humans who got in its way...sending them flying several feet through the air. \"You can't escape from me human!\" \"Brenda\" shouted after Carl in her strange sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm gonna fucking try believe me!\" Carl thought as he tried to draw breath and kept running. The 'officer' behind him didn't seem to tire, at least not at first, no ordinary woman of Brenda's age and build would have been able to pursue him for nearly this long and he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolting into another busy road, Carl went tumbling over the front of a car and then picked himself up, taking a brief second to draw a much needed breath before resuming his attempted escape from his pursuer. When the creature emerged into the street it leapt up onto the front of the car and dented the hood...before leaping a full 20 feet through the air and into another alleyway after Carl. By now, both Carl and Brenda's bodies were perspiring heavily, but Carl was the worse for wear. The years of smoking hadn't done anything for his lungs and he decided to head into a cheap looking hotel after rounding another corner. He slammed the front door behind him and ran straight past the receptionist and up several flights of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the top (7th floor), Carl started trying all the door handles, and eventually found one that opened. He didn't hesitate before barging into the room, closing the door behind him and sliding down the door. He didn't know if \"Brenda\" had followed him inside, he had no way of knowing unless she came banging on the door. He just winced in pain as he held his back, and he tried to keep his heavy breathing as quiet as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Around him is a curtain, that in a way, makes the space his bed and the medical equipment, like the heart rate monitor and the bed pan, occupy, much like a makeshift room. The space above the curtain allows the ambient noises of a ward in a hospital enter his space. All of a sudden, the curtain parts and in comes a male nurse dressed in the iconic scrubs followed by two male police officers. They stare straight into his open eyes, but to his surprise, Carl notices that the officers are ignorant to his wakefulness. This is probably the first time he has been this close to a policeman and not have to assume the position, not that there would be any need for a full-body search in the hospital garb the staff has dressed him in. One of the officers, the one who was Caucasian and had somewhat of a beer belly, spoke up, asking the nurse, \"How long has he been in this state?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Edwards has been like this for close to two days, with no significant changes, officer,\" the nurse answered. \"We've been running tests, but the results say he's perfectly healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's not going to wake up anytime soon?\" the other officer, who was black, asked. \"This just means I'm getting off from my shift early, right Albert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right you are,\" the other officer replied. \"Thanks for your time.\" With that done, the two officers exited past the curtain, leaving the nurse alone with Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming the officers were ignorant of the fact that he had his eyes wide open the entire time, Carl didn't the nurse was oblivious to him being awake. But the nurse started to act strangely. Before, when the nurse spoke to the two police officers, he spoke with a masculine voice, but once they were gone, the nurse now spoke with a feminine voice, but with the huskiness of a man Carl knew all too well. Being a criminal, he's had his share and taste of most of the illegal activities of the city, especially in the taverns and the stripclubs in the red light district, This nurse reminded him of one night he'd like to forget, but can't find the mental strength to do so. She, Carl thought, was actually a he ... and a prostitute working streets no less. This nurse had a similar, if not the same crazy personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you are so fine underneath this gown, Mr. Edwards. No wonder those two officers couldn't keep their eyes off of you,\" the nurse said, in a combination of casual voice and whisper, so as not to expose himself. Suddenly, a hand gracefully placed itself on Carl's inner thigh, and Carl could feel the whole thing. The freshly manicured hand snaked its way ever so slightly up to a very private place. One second, Carl had no control over his physical body, but then the next he mustered enough strength to break away and get to his feet, but the sight before him was even more disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood beside his bed watching the upsetting scene unfold. There he lay, motionless, disadvantaged against the perverted advances of this gay nurse. \"What the fuck is happening?!\" Carl exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is rather disheartening, I'd say,\" a somewhat feminine, ghostly voice speaks. Startled, Carl looked left and right, and then eventually behind him, finding no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a dream?\" Carl continued with the questions, asking them due to the shock of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly,\" the voice spoke once more. Carl looked around again, to no avail. Where was this disembodied voice coming from? He looked at the nurse, to see if he was the one responding to his questions. <i>Nope,</i> Carl said to himself. The nurse continued to speak his own perverted speech all the while inappropriately touching the body that lay on the bed in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's talking?\" Carl asked, this time directly at the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" the voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Carl continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am like you, a fugitive, a criminal. That said, I guess you can say that I AM YOU,\" the voice mockingly said. Whoever owned the voice sensed the concern on Carl's face and apologized. \"Sorry, I was just fooling with you, human. This ... is ME.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the curtain, a female nurse, dressed in patterned scrubs, appeared. Once seeing the gay nurse groping the helpless patient, she scolds him, \"What do you think you are doing Mikey?\" Mikey quickly removes his hands from the body, stashing them behind his back. Startled, he tries to defend himself, but only manages to stutter and choke on his words. \"You're lucky you have me as your supervisor today. If the doctor was here, you would be fired. Would you like that, Mikey?\" The gay nurse shakes his head. \"Get outta here. Beverly needs changing in 412. I suggest you get to it then.\" With that the male nurse briskly removes himself from the scene. Carl, who witnessed the whole thing unfold before his eyes, only looked on with wonder. <i>I thought the voice was going to show itself,</i> he thought. Just then, the nurse rounded the bed and approached Carl, her eyes looking straight into his. In disbelief, Carl tried to look elsewhere, but upon seeing no hand at his brow, which he habitually did to hide his face in large crowds, he found that there was no hand there. He would try to look at the rest of his body, but all he found was thin air. Carl looked back at the nurse, who wore a smile that lurked between sinister and angelic. The nurse spoke, \"How was that, Carl? Still think this is a dream?\" Carl shook his head and he looked on with wonder how the woman knew he was indeed shaking his head, when in his own perspective, he couldn't see himself. \"Want me to explain so that your human psyche can understand?\" Carl nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two nights ago, you came into contact with ... something you saw fall out of the sky. You touched it and hours later, you were visited by a woman, but her strength was like a superhuman. You fell out of your apartment, crashing into a police car parked down below. That woman left, but I can no longer sense her presence. A pedestrian called 911 and the same two police officers found your body on the car. Even though you had minor cuts and abrasions, you were perfectly fine when you arrived here at this hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the truth. What you came into contact with was my craft and using my life force, imbued my soul into you. This is why you can hear me, but are unable to see me. With my soul, I have given you powers, which wasn't mine to begin with. I am an alien from a faraway galaxy. Like you, I am a criminal, a fugitive, somewhat of a rebel. I stole the technology that gives you my powers and how the technology works or looks like is even beyond my intelligence. But in your hands, you can use them to your advantage. Imagine, robbing a bank without the use of intimidation, violence or firepower. All it takes is to use your powers and you leave with the riches. Right now, you are using one of my powers. In a limited distance, you can leave your body and inhabit the body of another. The rules are, you must leave your body in a safe place, for if your physical body dies, you die while in your invisible form. Another drawback is that you are more exposed when not in a body, so keep this in mind when that woman, the one who is looking for the technology I stole, is around, for since I can see her, she can see you too, so be careful. Fortunately, i don't sense that woman around, so go out and try my powers for yourself. Don't worry, I'll let you know if your body is in danger or if they move it somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl tried hard to listen to the explanation of the specific power the voice was telling me about. It sounded simple, but the rules made it complicated. <i>So, I can possess anybody within a certain distance of my body?</i> Carl asked himself. There are several individuals within the immediate vicinity. Who should he try his power on first?</span></div></div>",

With a loud groan Carl then relaxed back on his bed as the Head Nurse carried on with her job, seemingly unaffected by the event a few moments ago. Carl gave some thought into taking the Nurse's body for himself...just for a quick spin, but he decided against it. He glanced to the entrance to the ward, hoping that the gay nurse wouldn't return. Just then the bell ran that signaled the start of Visiting Hours, and several family members of other patients began flowing through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl inspected each person as he or she came through the door, and then he turned his attention to the other male patients around him, most of whom were not visible due to a number of drawn curtains. There were two other men about the same age as he was, one with a broken leg (Carl knew he was obviously of no use) and one with some kind of head wound, covered by a light, crepe bandage. But Carl's eyes soon turned to the woman sat by the man's bed, obviously a female acquaintance. There was nothing special about her, in fact she was quite ordinary in appearance. She was pretty for sure, and stood just over 5' 3\", her light brown hair was tied back in a ponytail and she was dressed in a lilac-colored, shoulder-strap top, a pair of jeans and a pair of brown leather ankle boots with 3-inch block heels. The most notable thing about was her breasts, Carl estimated their size at a 30G (U.S size).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nice rack!\" Carl mumbled as he studied the woman, who looked about 30 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you would like Mr Edwards?\" the Head Nurse suddenly asked Carl, snapping him out of a trance. When he didn't respond, the nurse waved her hand in front of his face and smiled. \"Hello...earth to Mr Edwards, is there anything else you need sir?\" he repeated her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er...no, I'm fine thank you!\" Carl grunted in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well just give me a buzz if you need anything, and if Mikey comes back...let me know\" she smiled, before disappearing from the ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just let out a deep sigh, then turned his attention back to the other patients and visitors. He wanted to use his new power, but he wasn't sure how to go about doing it. After several minutes of thought, he just decided to try and focus on just one individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that individual was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carl stands there baffled, confused at what Dagger is referring to. Carl shakes her head and says, \"Do you got my stuff.\" Dagger laughs and replies with, \"Oh, I got something for you, babe.\" Carl turns to get some money and realizes she spent it all last night. \"I'm running short. Can you front me a week\", she says without turning? \"Baby, if Carl isn't home I'm sure we can work something out where you won't have to pay at all.

This puts all thoughts of fighting back out of Carl's mind. Her legs nearly buckle when Dagger finds her clit. \"You want me to fuck you, don't you babe\", Dagger say with a sneer? Carl's male mind is revolted by the thought of having a cock inside her, but her body wants more. If just playing with her clit and tits feels this good Carl can only imagine what it would feel like to go all the way. Just thinking about it nearly causes her to orgasm. </span></div></div>",

Right as the thought rolled through his mind Dagger gave him a push from behind. Carl went tumbling forward as Dagger grunted. \"Sorry Boss...\" Carl rolled over, which was made all the harder due to the pounding and the large breasts, to see Dagger offering a hand to help Carl up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Boss, I know you wouldn't this guy to Cum inside you.\" Dagger said as he pulled Carl to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Carl was stable, which took a moment on wobbly legs. \"The hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDagger sighed in a very Carl way. \"You wanted to be fucking someone, so you broke off and took over this dick. Its all about your intention man. I'm surprised I haven't figured this out yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sighed the same way and decided to give it a try. \"Man, it would be amazing to be back to my normal self.\" He slowly felt his body become lighter and soft. He looked at his hands to see they had turned into some bizarre form of liquid metal. It still had the general shape of feminine hands, with her large curves sticking out in front and figure but had slowly shifted and changed becoming more and more like his original body. Soon it returned to his own body as bare as the day he was born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that works,\" Carl said with a smile. \"Can you do that? I want to see some real tits on you. None of that liquid metal stuff, I want to enjoy your change step by fucking step.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDagger smiled but as he did so his lips grew thick. Dagger gave a pout as the changes moved to his face, his cheeks moving higher as his eyes enlarged to counter his shrunken nose. Thick crimson curls poured out of what was a clearly Manish hair cut as he started dropping drastically in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl knew that he would like a damsel in distress as much as he would like a hot piece of ass so Dagger dropped until he stood just about at five foot tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do something about that dick, I can't enjoy looking at a guy.\" He took a fist full of Daggers thick hair and took a kiss by force. Dagger moaned in a girlish voice as she started sucking on Carls' tongue with all the fervor she could manage. Daggers prick quickly pulled inward until it passed the threshold of his hips and turned into the full female gender. Carl knew she would be feeling nice and juicy but Dagger looked so much tighter than Carl had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl did not waste any time as he pulled daggers thigh up to his own hip and started pressing into her. Dagger had to make room quick so her hips cracked outwards quickly, her ass filled out to something that one would have to find tailored clothing for, and her thighs swelled to give Carl more purchase on her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDagger was having trouble concentrating as Carl started pounding her hard enough to shake her entire body. Carl bent down and took one of Daggers old nipples in his mouth and bit down. Dagger squeeled and quickly changed her nipples. The grew hard and quickly swelled trapped in Carls' teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moorf\" Carl said as he pulled hard on Daggers nipple and locked on with his lips. Dagger was getting a massive wave of sensations from her now hyper-stimulated nipples. Breast flesh flooded her chest as she grew into an impressive Trip D cup that looked absolutely huge on her small frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoorf!\" He commanded as he reached back and pulled on her hair as he plowed into her. Dagger grew her breasts again, at this rate if she kept this form all of her clothing would have to be custom tailored. Carl must have been pleased with such large breasts as he let go of her hair and used his free hand to stimulate her other nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDagger felt Carl clench up as a warmth spread through her belly causing her to climax. Her entire body clamping down on Carls member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dagger finally came to Carl was slow fucking her for the pure enjoyment of it. \"I think I like you this way. But you didn't cum in me, why did you let me in you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDagger mewled in pleasure as her mind started taking in the slow idle pleasure Carl was giving her. \"You're the boss. I just sink a bit into Daggers personality and let it ride, what you say goes.\" Dagger reached up and rolled her own nipple as she smooshed her large breast into her own chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl gave an evil grin as he pressed her clit down on his prick earning a shiver out of Dagger, it felt good to get something out of his old drug dealer. \"Good, this is the new Dagger. You are going to stay in Dagger and you're gonna work for me. I don't care what you have to do, bring your contacts here so I can take them over as I did you. But there is a new Boss in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say BooAAHHH!\" Dagger squealed as Carl flipped her over and started plowing her hard for round two.</span></div></div>",

All in all, he looked like a perfectly female version of the young man he just was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked into the owner's office after kicking the door open. He sat down and pulled the first female assistant into his lap. \"So, free rent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man nodded, \"Yea boss, I'll draw up the papers. But you are going to have to really push for some coin. You can take over a lot of people and still not get to live the high life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sighed and squeezed the receptionists ass. \"Yea, one step at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sound behind them as the young lady who was once a young man stepped into the room. \"You're nine Am is here.\" She looked at Carl. \"We can't put clones in people, only you can. I just tried.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sighed as he stood up with the receptionist. \"Have the paperwork ready asap and leave it in my apartment. Also, get some cleaning done in there.\" He moved the woman at the door and ripped her shirt open. He gripped one breast and smiled, \"I will live the high life one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stormed out of the room and on to the rest of his day.</span></div></div>",

Officer Jennifer Parks, 38, a 10-year old veteran, was one of the beat cops in Carl's neighborhood. She was a brunette and her hair was always up in a ponytail when on duty. She had a slightly chubby figure but nothing that couldn't be burned off with a couple of day's exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we having trouble here gentlemen?\" the officer asked, eliciting a groan from Carl, who was well known to the force. \"Just can't stay outta trouble can you Carl?\" the officer then said, looking him in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This fucker was hassling me, but I don't expect you to believe that!\" Carl grumbled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Parks feigned a smile. \"You're right, I don't!\" she said. \"Now I suggest you take your beer and your cigarettes and go on home before you get in more trouble\" she advised him as politely as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl left the store, mumbling away to himself, and the officer followed him, to make sure he didn't just turn around and go back. \"You know you should be in there giving that fat, bearded fuck a hard time...not me!\" he suddenly said to Officer Parks, who didn't respond. The silence only served to infuriate Carl further. \"Look, can you blame me for being how I am? Yeah I've made mistakes, but you fucking cops won't leave me alone or give me a chance to make amends\" he ranted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home and get some sleep Carl\" Jennifer sighed, before turning and walking back towards her squad car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't done yet!\" Carl barked...as he outstretched his arm in the officer's direction. Suddenly he felt a little jolt through his body and what looked like a small blot of energy shoot out of his finger and hit the cop in her back. Jennifer stopped abruptly in her tracks and then began feeling her breasts as she looked down at herself. \"Woah...yeah dude, now this is what I'm fucking talking about!\" she suddenly said, turning to grin at a confused Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...the fuck you doing lady?\" Carl asked, as he then watched Jennifer feeling in between her legs, rubbing her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhmmm...fuck...that feels good\" she grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wrong with you?\" Carl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, relax, she ain't in here anymore, at least for now. I'm a copy of you, and you just put me in this bitch's body!\" Jennifer said, as she continued to masturbate in the street. \"Nice!\" she then said as she drew her pistol and aimed it in random directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you're me?\" Carl inquired in befuddlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what I said. That funny rock you touched, it gave you powers that most people can't even dream of\" Jennifer then explained to Carl, who slowly came to the realization that the possessed cop was telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you're me! That means you do what I tell you right?\" Carl mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as its fun!\" his clone replied, winking and lifting up his boobs again before letting them drop and jiggle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

''Write reports then go home.'', after a pause, she continued. ''Actually might not be so bad, there might be some people we can have fun with.'', the same glint that Carl's eyes showed earlier, appeared on her. Carl had familiarized himself with the police station, but mostly the cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoa... you can read her mind or something?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone answered with a simple nod.

His hand snaked down to find Jennifer's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer let a barely audible moan escape her mouth when Carl subtly groped her ass, but Melissa had been making her way back to her room, clearly being uncomfortable with Carl and probably disgusted to see someone like him. Although she knew that her mother's work involved a lot of dealing with those kind of people, she did not expect her mom to be bringing back one to the house. Not to mention it was very late at night and her father was away to work as a security guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''She doesn't know yet what her mommy here is doing. Sucking off strangers' cocks, whoring herself and all.'', Jennifer spoke in a low tone, breaking into a giggle as she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''With a quick nudge, she will do the same.'', Carl grinned. He willed himself out from his body. At first, it was an awkward situation, full in concentration as though someone enduring a prolonged bowel movement. However, focusing on projecting himself out from his body, Carl finally managed to put into action his other power. Possession. Jennifer caught the pilotless body swiftly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here I go</i>, Carl thought to himself. Extending a ghostly limb against the wall, he found out that he can easily phase through it. Just a few moment of practice, and he was able to navigate himself to any direction, before he sped past several walls to find Melissa already changing into her purplish sleepshirt.''Delicious.'', Carl grinned, hovering around her for a moment or two and phased into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, fuck.'', Melissa said in astonishment, only it was now Carl in control of her body. Carl examined his fingers and noted how remarkably feminine they looked, but his attention soon was diverted to his bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Great wasn't it?'', Jennifer greeted the sight of her daughter, while Carl noted that his former body was carelessly dumped on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nodded as she walked over to the couch, ''Nice to know I can sink into her persona.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl and his clone spent ten minutes to haul Carl's unconcious body into Melissa's bedroom and hid it from view. Satisfied with his work, Carl decided to extract his clone from Jennifer's body to see how well he could play the role of Melissa Parks. Jennifer's body was knocked out cold for a few minutes, just about enough time for Carl to drag her back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mom.'', Melissa looked concerned as Jennifer stirred.''You alright?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's face was one of confusion and disorientation, realizing her sticky crotch, an alarmed look swept over her face.''Yes, I think I am.'', Jennifer feigned a smile and got up. She could not remember how she got home so early on her night shift. ''I should be going now.'', Jennifer looked around and stood up, walking to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You don't seem okay mom.'', Melissa stood up as well and went after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer glanced at her daughter and smiled again, ''No, I'm fine, I just wanted to see you, that's all. Maybe I fell asleep.'', she still could not figure out how she ended up back in her house and with her crotch sticky, but one thing in her mind was just to get changed and get back on the road. Maybe a visit to La Gnocche as well in the morning after she finish her round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl chuckled inwardly, but maintained a strong Melissa composure. ''Take care mom. I'm going to bed.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes, see you later dear.'', Jennifer murmured as she made her way into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Melissa's bedroom, Carl laughed out loud, ''Fucker didn't even realize that I'm not her daughter.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a perverted idea, but then...Carl didn't have many ideas that weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...me!\" Carl grunted as he dragged his own, unconscious body from underneath Melissa's bed. He then knelt down in front of his prostrate body and unzipped its pants, reaching in with one of his manicured hands to grab his flaccid cock. <i>\"Hmm, can't do anything with that yet\"</i> he thought. So he projected a clone of himself back into his own body, but gave it limited motor functions, just enough to get his cock erect. \"There we go!\" he grinned, before leaning forward and slipping the cock into his mouth. With his tits swinging loosely from his chest beneath him...Carl bobbed Melissa's head up and down on his body's erect 'shaft' until it shot a load in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never knew cum would taste so...sweet\" Carl laughed, after swallowing the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Carl, giving head (even to his own body) was a weird experience. He knew he wasn't gay, but as long as he was possessing a female body...he had a craving for cock, and it didn't mind matter whether he was sucking it or having it buried inside his cunt. <i>\"Speaking of which!\"</i> Carl then thought, as hs ditched Meliss'a knickers. He then removed the pants from his own, semi-conscious body and lowered himself down onto his cock. \"Oooh...fuck...YES!\" he screeched out quite loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes he then 'rode' his body like a horse, the sweet cheeks of Melissa's pert ass slapping on his body's thighs as he bounced up and down. And then came another moment of ecstasy as his body emptied its ball sack into Carl's stolen pussy. Now wearing an expression of utter satisfaction...Carl kept fucking his own body until Melissa's body reached its own orgasm. And what an orgasm it was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...FUCK!\" Carl gasped, as sweat trickled down his feminine brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then dismounted his body, cleaned it up and put its pants back on, before rolling back underneath the bed. \"Fucking incredible!\" he chuckled in delight, even as his pussy continued 'leaking' bodily fluids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl next decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl continued to bask in the afterglow of his first female orgasm, feeling juices run from his pussy down his smooth leg, when he took a good look at his body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking freshly fucked as she was, Carl thought that Melissa looked much like a young porn star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if she's going to be a porn star, she needs some improvements,\" he muttered in his new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDitching his shirt, he idly played with his nipples as he focused on his face. What looked like heavy make-up appeared out of nowhere, while his lips plumped up and his tongue got longer as he stuck it out. His hair became a thick brunette wave going straight to his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I'd love to have that wrapped around my cock,\" he said as he licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tits blasted outward and only a bit of quick thinking to strengthen his back muscles kept him from falling onto them. He'd always liked seeing massive boobs on porn stars, but hated how all of them were so obviously fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrank his already-trim waist further, and widened his hips. Spreading his legs, he got a good look at his cunt as he both tightened it and made his labia more prominent, and his ass he made huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is a body I could keep!\" he exclaimed softly. \"But I probably won't, and after all, I can always turn myself into this whenever I want. I've even got all this slut's memories now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he played with his new knockers, he began to feel horny again, and decided to see if he could get some relief with the other body in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping into Jennifer's bedroom, in one swift motion he turned on the light and sent a clone into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clone sat bolt upright in bed and appraised his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, great job with that bitch, dude! If I had a cock I'd be throwing her on the floor and fucking her right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl bit his lip and stuck his tongue out slightly in a suggestive fashion. \"Well why don't you give yourself one, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clone threw his covers off and shucked his nightclothes to reveal Jennifer's decent body. A dick, larger than Carl's own by some margin, sprouted from its crotch. Huge balls dangled beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl scampered over, knelt down and, removing his gag reflex, took the whole thing into his mouth in one motion. He stuck out his tongue briefly to tickle his clone's new scrotum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clone grasped his head and began forcing it back and forth along the massive tool. \"Oh yeah, blow me, slut, blow me, you fucking whore, blow your mamma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Carl felt himself shoved backward off the cock, just in time for it to explode all over him. He slathered the cum all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me,\" was all he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clone obligingly pounced, and Carl screamed in pain and pleasure as the huge penis was forced into his tight pussy. It didn't take long for both to reach another massive orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying next to his clone, coming down from his second female orgasm, he asked, \"Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sweetie?\" his clone replied, playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I fuck you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why darling,\" his clone said, retracting his cock, \"all you had to do was ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl gave Melissa's body a cock even bigger than his clone had given Jennifer's, and as he indicated that he wanted to fuck her tits, Jennifer's body sprouted a pair even larger than his own. Carl returned his clone's favour by blasting his load all over Jennifer's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon found out that his clone had taken a page from his own book as Jennifer's pussy was by far the tightest of the many he'd fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he'd blown his load, he took a look at Jennifer's ass. \"Hey, can I do your ass, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, these bitches are ours to do with as we please--fuck away! At least as long as I can do yours after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem--it's begging for a big, thick dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey traded assfucks, having to shapeshift to repair the damage done by their too-large cocks, and then spent a while having rough lesbian sex--after Carl had blown up Melissa's tits to match Jennifer's--and finally Carl felt spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should get out of here,\" he said, \"don't want her husband walking in on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" were his clone's last words before he extracted it. Shifting Melissa back to normal and cleaning up the juices, he laid her in her bed as she would have been had he not intervened, then left her to possess Jennifer briefly. Doing the same with the policewoman, he floated back into his own body and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she heard the door close Jennifer Parks sprang awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bad enough having that fucker in her body, or having a copy of him in there. But that asshole had defiled her daughter, fucked her with his own cock, made her fuck her own daughter with a cock he gave her, and gave her daughter a cock to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been so easy to force him out of their bodies. But then he would have been mad, and there would have been an altercation, and she didn't want that around Melissa. At least the teen wouldn't remember how she was used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer scanned her own body and her daughter's--thankfully, the fucker hadn't gotten either of them pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally she enjoyed her powers. She was far more experienced with them than Carl was with his, of course--she knew his entire life's story, now, and where he'd had his for less than a day she'd had hers since before birth. She'd easily been able to hide them from him, and let him know only what she wanted him to know about her. Yes, her husband was fat, but he also had a huge dick, which helped with how horny her powers had made her ever since she hit puberty and they'd grown substantially. It still wasn't enough, of course, but her telepathy made it easy to allay her husband's suspicions about her affairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't shapeshift like Carl, though, so she was glad he'd put their bodies back to normal before leaving. The place still stunk of sex, but her husband knew that sometimes she just needed a marathon masturbation session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShucking her nightshirt, she materialized some simple clothes on herself, as well as a handgun to replace the one Carl had stolen. She couldn't do much more, but she could no longer count the number of times she'd been saved by her ability to call another weapon into existence in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl wasn't the first person with supernatural powers she'd encountered, of course, merely the second. The first had been a would-be rapist when she was eighteen herself, who jabbed a gun into her back that she could've sworn hadn't been on his person a second before. She was already well-practiced with her telepathy, though, and clamped down on his mind to prevent him from doing anything more while putting her martial arts classes to good use. She hadn't meant to kill him, but didn't much regret it--at least, not after she gained his powers, which allowed her not only to bring small objects into existence, but also to manipulate the environment in small ways, which had been useful in disposing the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash-heating some water, she made herself a cup of coffee and drank it. She'd have to manipulate the chief's mind, of course, to keep him from asking where she'd been tonight. She hated messing with people's minds like that, but her husband just didn't make enough for her to be able to quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being a police officer had other benefits. When she'd absorbed that rapist's powers, she'd also absorbed the urge they gave him--murder. He wanted sex all on his own, preferably sex with an unwilling partner, but he never left them alive, or even with anything to be found. She didn't have to kill often, thankfully, but she could feel the stirrings already, and already knew her next target: Carl Jason Edwards. She'd managed to stick what she thought of as a \"telepathic tracer\" in his mind, so she knew exactly where he was and what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, and with it her husband. Greeting him with a kiss on the cheek, she asked him to see that Melissa got to school on time before he crashed, then left for the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rage slowly grew, its flames fanned by her powers, rage she would target at one person: Carl. Fucking. Jason. Asshole. Edwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was back at his apartment, lying on his bed in the body he'd given that bitch officer's daughter, unable to decide whether he liked it better with or without a dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it,\" he said as he shifted back into his own body after enjoying another female orgasm, this time in Melissa's normal body. \"I'll just find another hot whore to take as my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrifting off to sleep, he got up a few hours later and sprang up easily, ready to bring the world to its knees with his powers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Smiling, he sent out his clones. Immediately the three walked over and surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, none of these bitches even have anything like the clap, or chlamydia, or AIDS--they're great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, want to be at the bottom of three hot women today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have come out here if I didn't,\" said Carl, giving his dick a bit of a boost as he walked back to his apartment, head held high as his clones fawned over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing exactly what turned Carl on allowed his clones to put on an arousing strip show in his small home, and for hours they fucked, one pleasing him and his massive dick, the others screwing each other in some way, trading off every so often to make sure Carl got a good piece of each. They even managed to persuade him to give one of them a blowjob. It felt weird, but, having been Melissa, Carl admitted that it wasn't quite as weird as it might have been before he'd experienced being a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the four of them were spent and went to sleep on Carl's bed, the smallest still on top of him, Carl's dick in her cunt, the other two pressing into his sides with their vastly enhanced tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later the one on his left began reached over and slapped Carl a few times. \"Huh? Wha? Who?\" he said groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's me, look, wake up!\" His clone shoved the woman on top of him off his cock and pulled Carl into his small kitchen with surprising ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I was having such a nice dream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you've got to kill me,\" his clone said, proffering Carl's only knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to kill you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there are people other than you with powers, and this bitch is one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Other people have powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, look, this whore's like some kind of superhero, or used to be. Here's the thing: anyone with powers has some sort of compulsion. You have to rape people, but luckily for you, when you send one of us into someone and then screw them, it's still rape because the original owner hasn't consented, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this bitch has powers, but she's compelled to steal things--big things. She tried to be a superhero but realized that she was also the world's greatest supervillain, so now she turns tricks and only steals when she absolutely has to--and at her prices, she's practically stealing anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does that have to do with killing you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you kill someone with powers, you get their powers. You also get their compulsion, but you've wanted to move up to bigger things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of powers does she have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way more than you've got. She's super-strong, she's super-fast, she can fly and teleport--she can even teleport other things, she's telekinetic, she can turn invisible and walk through walls, she can even open up pocket dimensions--that's where she stashes her loot. She's even completely invincible. Probably a few other things I haven't delved deep enough into her mind to know about. Like I said, this bitch is fucking powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl took the knife and looked at it skeptically. \"If she's completely invincible, how am I supposed to kill her with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's only invincible if she wants to be--or, rather, if she wants to be not invincible, she isn't. I've turned it off right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do, slash her throat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold her hands while you do it, but yeah, that'll work. Just kill her quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I'll have all her powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her compulsion to steal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that deal,\" and grasping her wrists firmly, he looked into her eyes gleefully, seeing his clone looking back eagerly, and killed the slut with one stroke, removing his clone at the last instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Carl felt an influx of raw power, bringing him to his knees as he felt it surge through him. Within seconds it was over, though, and looking at the body on the ground, he found it easy to use his new powers to open a hole in reality and dump it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see the cops try to find any evidence of that one!\" he laughed as he teleported the blood after the body and closed the tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling energized, he reached into one of the whore's own dimensions and pulled out a wad of cash. Shifting the other two sluts' clothes onto them, he removed his clothes, left the money in their pockets and dumped them back on the street where he'd found them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in his mirror, he laughed and laughed as he faded from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer sat in a coffee shop an hour or so later with Erin. The nineteen-year-old woman was clearly frightened out of her wits and it took considerable skill for Jennifer to calm her and get her to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just around the corner, could just see as Abby, Betty and Chrissie just suddenly got up and walked off with that man, fawning over him. They looked like they were familiar with him, but I'd never seen him before in my life and, well, we talk, you know? Anyway I was back there a few hours later when suddenly Abby and Betty just appeared out of nowhere. Just poof! No Chrissie, though, and I hope she's all right. She's like a mother to us. I don't know how she did it, but when one of us needed money, she somehow always had some for us. If a john treated us badly, we knew to go to her, and the bastard would never dare show his face around here again. Sometimes she'd vanish all of a sudden, but never even for an hour. You won't arrest me, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer knew that, properly, she should. But she'd looked into Erin's mind, and into Abby and Betty's, and she could see the trauma they'd suffered. \"No, I won't, as long as you're willing to enter this pilot program we're running. It helps women like you get back on their feet, find jobs and gives them a place to stay. You just have to promise not to turn tricks any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Chrissie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we find her, she can, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the rest of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're willing to guide me to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin broke down and sobbed. Jennifer cradled the younger woman, unable to help but see Melissa in the same situation, feeling rage at a society that would force women into this situation, rage she redirected toward Carl fucking Edwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer called the chief and explained the situation, and a bit of long-distance mental massaging--her powers were pretty attenuated, but the chief was a good man and didn't need much convincing--saw him agree to her offer. All in all, she managed to find seventeen street walkers, some--her rage burned hotter--as young as fourteen. They were all worried that there had been no sign of Chrissie and it was easy to convince them to enter the program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were gone, Jennifer stalked off toward Carl's apartment. She had sensed what he'd done to Abby, Betty and Chrissie, of course, and while she was a bit fuzzy on the details, she knew he was responsible for whatever had happened to Chrissie and, somehow, for Abby and Betty's sudden reappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her compulsion to kill burn in her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rope wrapped around her tits--which she noticed were much larger than she was used to--and there were painful clamps on her engorged nipples. Her knees and elbows were forced apart with spreaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA machine was pumping a huge dildo in and out of her pussy, while her only attachment to a solid surface was a hook, on a chain attached to the ceiling, planted in her ass. A ball gag in her mouth prevented her from speaking while her eyelids were forced open. She'd long since learned how to compartmentalize her mind, though, and found it easy to envision some lubrication for her eyeballs, only to find it whisked away a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you slut. Nothing like that,\" came Carl's unmistakable voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled mentally. His mistake. She clamped down on his mind, freezing him in place, blocking off his powers. Delving deep, she discovered what had happened to Chrissie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily she again created small metal plates to cut all her bonds and flash-melted, then swiftly froze, the pumping plastic prick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big mistake, Carl. You should have killed me while you had the chance. But here are the last lessons you'll ever learn: Don't mess with a telepath. Don't mess with a telepath's daughter. And never give a telepath a chance to get into your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nude, she walked up to Carl, forced his hands together and grasped them tightly in one of hers. In the other she created another gun, pointed straight at his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one last lesson: When I can control your powers, it doesn't matter that you're invincible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl slumped unceremoniously to the floor a few seconds after, his head mostly splattered on the wall behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer felt a huge rush, from avenging her daughter's rape, from satisfying her need to kill, and from absorbing not only Carl's but Chrissie's powers also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done she staggered over to Carl's mirror, and focused on fixing her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bruises that covered her body vanished, and her breasts shrank to their normal size. The damage to her sphincter was easily repaired, and she easily created a new police uniform for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling flush with raw power, she hovered an inch into the air and looked at Carl's couch. Immediately it too lifted off the ground as she mentally commanded gravity to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let it down slowly, revelling in her new abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Carl's door, she found it already repaired from when she had kicked it down. Not wishing to stay any longer, she opened the same pocket dimension in which Carl had left Chrissie, and threw him and all his scattered bits and pieces in to rot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking herself intangible and invisible, she hovered up through the ceiling, feeling the building's superstructure pass through her, and eventually out into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt energized, like she never had before, and realized that that was part of Chrissie's powers. She was amazed how the combinations of the powers she possessed allowed her to do so much more than she ever could have done with only one set. Spotting a woman far below, Jennifer sent a clone into her--but thanks to her telepathy, the clone wasn't really a clone, but rather a fragment of her mind still linked to it. From the street, Jennifer looked up right at the spot where she knew her flying body was. Pulling out, she left the short woman a few inches taller for her trouble, finding it simple to replace her wardrobe, even at a distance and despite the size of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enhanced vision allowing her to see for miles around, the powerful cop pondered what to do next as she felt another pressure building in her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The store hadn't had much, but it hadn't taken much to get the store's attendant to hand it over, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacing into a back alley to take a shortcut home, he saw a figure appear that he swore wasn't there before. As he attempted to slow down, the figure resolved itself into a stern-faced female cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze.\" It wasn't a request, or an order. It was a statement of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron couldn't take another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron Jessie. Twenty-nine years old, currently single. This is your third convenience store robbery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was shocked--it was like the woman was reading his mind. He was further shocked as his hands opened involuntarily, causing his bag and handgun to fall to the ground, while his arms moved backward and handcuffs somehow encircled his wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later he felt a tearing sensation and found himself in a police van, out of which he could see only a black void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis had the bitch screaming on the ground, sobbing, trying vainly to scrabble away. He grinned and dropped his pants, revealing his throbbing eight-inch erection. He leaned over to pull her skirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the slut vanished, replaced by a butch female cop with the muzzle of her gun resting in the centre of his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put those back on, Dennis Madson,\" she said, referring to his pants, in a tone that suggested that, whatever he did, they were going back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefiantly, he did nothing, and to his amazement, his dick went limp and his pants and underwear lifted themselves up. His arms moved backward of their own accord and out of nowhere he felt handcuffs on his wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt as if he were being torn from existence as his surroundings shifted and he realized he was in the back of a police van with nothing but a black void outside and a morose man in a ski mask inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer stopped another two robberies and a rape, as well as an attempted murder and two domestic violence incidents before taking the van she had created out of its pocket dimension and to the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief was, as Jennifer knew he would be, quite impressed, and she went home to an empty house and started on some books she'd been meaning to read at some point--only to find that she'd absorbed powers from Chrissie that allowed her to read books in instants, along with an eidetic memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling at all tired, and swiftly determining that there was nothing interesting on TV, she darkened the windows, created a full-length mirror, teleported her clothes into a neat pile on her couch and began playing with her new ability to morph her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made herself ten feet tall, then three feet tall. She shrank her breasts to nothing, then made them each as large as the rest of her body, then gave herself four of them. She tried having no arms and four arms, having no genitalia and having a raging two-foot erection above her prominent cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreating perfect insulation in her walls, in addition to altering her windows to prevent sound from passing through, she altered her vocal cords, caused some sheet music to appear in her hands and sang the entirely of Orff's <i>Carmina Burana</i> with all voices and all instruments in perfect pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've recorded that,\" she said quietly after she was done, and creating a professional-grade recorder she did it all over again, then sent the unmarked recording to a struggling music producer, along with a mental suggestion not to ask questions about where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately she felt a quickening of her urge to steal something, and realized that now, for her, acts of such generosity would have to be balanced by acts of theft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was no stranger to having to break the law, though, and with a savage smile turned herself into an exact copy of the late Carl Edwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreating some loose-fitting clothing for her new body, along with two huge machine guns and many bandoliers around her shoulders, she vanished and reappeared in the lobby of a bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSealing off the doors, she fired briefly into the ceiling, causing the bullets to vanish on impact, and sent compulsions into everyone's minds not to do anything to alert police to her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking forward, guns held threateningly, she simply stepped through the terrified patrons and the tellers' desks, all the way to the vaults in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her hand, everything tore open--the vault door, all the safety deposit boxes, patrons' wallets, and everything flew out and into one of the holes Chrissie had used during her own robberies. Jennifer found it equally easy to manipulate computer records to transfer all the money in the bank's system to a number of new offshore accounts in her name at discreet banks that wouldn't ask questions--especially not after she influenced their managers' minds to overlook the sudden influx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiring a few more rounds--and, feeling her urge to kill rising from her failure to murder any of the people she'd arrested earlier in addition to the raw terror she felt from everyone else present, shooting an elderly woman in the heart at point-blank range--she vanished, not bothering to wipe any security cameras, laughing at the thought of the manhunt for someone who could no longer be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in Carl's body, her feelings as a mother were nowhere in her mind as she decided to satisfy her urge to rape and to have sex before they rose higher and pulled one of the younger patrons, a terrified 18-year-old college freshman, back to her house with her and fucked the poor girl for half an hour before sending her to a random street corner in that city, with no underwear and cum uncontrollably leaking from her pussy and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returned to her own body and casual clothes, the euphoria she felt from satisfying her urges overwhelmed any guilt she might have felt had she not gotten used to engaging in such activity over the last two decades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she finished than Melissa arrived home, clearly having been sobbing on her way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's maternal instincts kicked into high gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, sweetie, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa broke down again and, as if she were ten years younger, brokenly told her mother everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's rage burned once more and, cradling her weeping daughter against her chest, whispered, \"Don't worry.

He felt a crushing pressure in his mind to stand, and did so to see the same woman he had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew there was something about you,\" she said. \"Let's see: only three powers, two of which you didn't even know you had until just now; compelled to pull pranks on people now and then; can turn into or merge with anything not human, can see true forms of anything changed from its original form and can tell by sight when someone else has powers, though you can't tell what their powers are. Quite a nice list, if short. I think they'll be better off with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Harold managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who I am is not important. What is important is that I'm the last living person you'll ever see.\" With that she grasped his scrawny wrists in her left hand, and with her right crushed his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe influx of power from Harold paled in comparison to that from Carl, or even from her rapist twenty years prior, but that didn't matter to Jennifer. Power was power, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumping Harold's body with Carl's and Chrissie's, Jennifer vanished from the bank after ensuring that Harold had been unable to alter any of the footage from earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she teleported, she split herself in two, one part going home, the other merging with Melissa's school, becoming part of it and getting ready for the next day. Melissa would never know just how close she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband had a long shift that day, and when she reappeared in her house Jennifer clearly heard Melissa crying into her pillows. Waving her hand, she created a platter with Melissa's favourite meal and brought it to the young woman, who accepted it gratefully but made it clear she wanted to be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRespecting her daughter's wishes, Jennifer retreated to her bedroom and, once again creating perfect insulation and darkening the windows with a thought, stripped naked, created a pile of sex toys, along with a few more bodies for herself, and had a one-woman orgy until her husband came back that evening. After dinner, Melissa retreated back to the sanctuary of her room while Jennifer fucked the brains out of her husband in theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Jennifer tendered her resignation from the police. Not five minutes later, the chief picked up a pen, which promptly exploded, leaving his right hand drenched in ink.

Still, Melissa couldn't shake the feeling that hers both meant it and could make sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first sign that something was different was her car. She'd had her driver's licence for a year, and had purchased an old beater with money from a summer job, but that morning her car was nowhere to be found, and her keys fit perfectly in the stylish, brand-new, expensive sports car sitting where her own used to be. She was so shocked that it wasn't until she got to school that she noticed her clothes and bag were clearly designer stuff. Her rear-view mirror revealed diamond-studded earrings where previously she hadn't even been pierced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven stranger was that nobody looked askance at the sudden display of wealth she knew her parents didn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first class was a world literature course, though they read everything in translation. She was half-distracted, as usual, and prepared to bullshit an answer when the teacher asked her something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she suddenly found herself immensely knowledgeable about every single work of literature ever produced, even ones she knew had long since been destroyed. She didn't know how she knew, nor how she also had intimate knowledge of authorial intent, or every piece of literary criticism ever written. She just knew, and almost automatically gave a concise but erudite answer. The teacher seemed to be expecting her contribution and seemed almost deferential, as if she were gracing his class with her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same pattern repeated itself through the rest of her morning classes. At lunch, she found a wad of cash in her wallet and realized she had a huge appetite, and nobody looked twice as she ordered three of everything on the menu in the cafeteria, nor as she still managed to finish it almost before anyone else sat down. She didn't feel bloated as she packed everything in, though, but rather energized, as if her body were rapidly and efficiently digesting everything she ate almost as soon as she swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't save her from having to go to the bathroom, where she took a good look at herself while washing her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd seen Katie in the halls that day, of course--Katie, the girl whose smile could light up a room, who could make boys hard with the hint of one. Melissa knew that Katie would look like an ugly crone next to her, and she was clearly not wearing any make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling ever stranger, she walked off to her least-favourite class, PE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa knew her body was reasonably attractive, but her PE class seemed to have every student who outshone her in each physical aspect--well, except for her face, now, but Katie wasn't in her class anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had the largest breasts in school, Harriet was the tallest girl, and June the most athletic. There were other things about the girls she envied, too, but they were doing swimming that day, which meant getting fully naked for the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they showered, Melissa started feeling extremely strange. Her breasts tingled, and to her shock she realized they were growing, becoming like those on the models she'd looked up on the net to see if she could see what the boys saw in big tits. Her muscles tingled as they grew, and somehow Melissa felt strong, very strong. Her whole body tingled, and she grew, until she was so tall Harriet would be standing under her now-gigantic boobs. Her hair flowed freely down her back, her skin was perfectly smooth, and all in all she realized that everything she had once envied about the other girls she now far surpassed them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't stop the taunts, though, just changed their subject from making fun of her comparative lack of growth to her absurd overgrowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the class, despite easily outperforming everyone, she showered as fast as she could and raced to her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, she saw Scott for the first time. He had to crane his neck to look up at her, of course, but almost tried to run into her, considering that his face was level with her nipples--but when he tried, she found herself sprouting another foot and he had to stop short to avoid running into her hard abdomen. As he walked around carefully, she felt his hard penis brush her leg. She'd heard whispers that the thing was a foot long, and idly wondered what it would be like to have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did the thought cross her mind than she felt two feet of flaccid dick and balls to match dangling from her crotch, her perfect pussy nonetheless unaffected. She was glad that whoever was making the changes had decided she should be wearing a long skirt and no panties that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up a little straighter, but soon realized that her new appendage was growing and tenting the front of her loose skirt. She realized that, to everyone else, it had to be a reasonably common occurrence as the taunts were certainly well-practiced. She fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, a short distance away the tall teenager saw massive flesh-coloured walls, and to her shock realized that they were toes. Craning her neck she made out what had to be ankles almost in the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her surroundings shifted, and she found herself with her head literally in the clouds. She was completely naked, but her body, which she had thought was around ten feet tall, had kept its proportions. A short distance away her sports car sat, a familiar figure leaning on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa!\" her mother exclaimed, reaching out to embrace her. She too was nude, and Melissa felt uncomfortable returning the hug, especially when she realized her mother also had a cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's going on? Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on is that everything's going to be all right now. We're in an unpopulated area of the world, we're each twelve miles tall and have the world's biggest car right here. Oh, and it can fly, now. Care to take it for a spin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, mom. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother sighed. \"I guess I should start from the beginning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf her mother hadn't punctuated her description with vivid examples--dredging up secrets she'd thought well-hidden, creating books out of thin air, showing her the three bodies--she'd never have believed a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. He's not your father. To be honest I don't know who is, but I only met him when I was six months pregnant with you. But that doesn't matter, does it? You're my daughter, and I'm your mother, and I'm offering you a place at my side as I take over the universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're just one of them.\" Her mother shrugged as if she wouldn't think anything of using her daughter to satisfy the urges she'd described.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Melissa's pent-up rage and hate suddenly burst from its mental dam and she took her mother's hand fiercely. \"I'm in.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harriet was proud of her 6'2\" stature. It was tall enough for her to dominate at sports that put a premium on height, but not so tall that she looked like an overgrown freak like Melissa. And she was especially glad she didn't have a cock like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she wasn't prepared for what she saw when she neared her school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was huge--if it hadn't been for the windows, she would have thought it had at least twenty stories, but it was clear that it had only four. She wondered how that could have happened--such extreme renovations didn't take place overnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors were equally huge, but whoever installed them had the courtesy to install smaller doors within them for people like her. She didn't want to think about who might need their full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so of course, she realized, she would be confronted with two such as soon as she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo huge, glittering thrones sat in the entrance foyer. On them sat two people--whether they were women or men Harriet could not tell because she could not see their faces. Besides, who had six breasts, each with multiple nipples with tubes dangling from each as if waiting to be sucked, and numerous long cocks between their legs dangling at around the right height for people of regular height to pleasure them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a strange compulsion, she walked around to the side of one of the chairs and found a door. Opening it, she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShort spiral staircases led up to platforms shrouded in darkness. Still feeling compelled, she walked up the central one and soon realized that she was right near a giant pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as the thought disgusted her--she'd experimented, then sworn off lesbian sex--she began pleasuring the massive cunt with skill she never knew she had. Not long after, more people began joining her. The thing was too big for her alone, after all, but she began to feel envious of the two guys who got the clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott walked into school that day, feeling his eight inches packed into his pants. It was a good length, not like the elephantine tool Melissa had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, when he saw the mess of huge dicks dropping from the people on the thrones, he realized that his cock was woefully inadequate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to fight the mental pressure forcing him toward one of them, causing him to reach out and grab a dick, take it into his mouth and suck, but failed. Around him he saw students and teachers grabbing cocks, or tubes, or going around the side or back of the thrones. He could have sworn there were maybe 50 tubes and 50 dicks for each throne when he began, but somehow it seemed the school's entire population was soon pleasuring--whoever these giants were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what it feels like to have four hundred people sucking on my teats, another four hundred blowing my dicks, and some more eating me out, giving me a rim job, or pleasuring my balls,\" thought Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is new to me, too,\" Jennifer replied mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom, can you let me know just who all's pleasuring us where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa scanned the participants briefly, then made a decision. \"You know what, I really don't like any of these people. They hated me for my height, they hated me for my boobs, they hated me for my cock, they hated me for my strength, my beauty, everything. So how about we blow our loads in a bit, force them to have sex with each other--especially if it goes against their orientation--then do a number on them afterward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fun. What did you have in mind for after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Harriet felt pussy juices squirting into her mouth. She tried to close her mouth but found it locked open; when she tried to move away, the stream followed her. Only when she began to feel bloated did it stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later she was eating out Amanda, the shyest girl in school, who had somehow obtained a latex catsuit, whip, and huge tits and was completely dominating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's cheeks bulged as the massive dick began to squirt cum. He frantically swallowed as fast as he could, not daring to let any of it seep out, having the vague notion that it would go ill with him if any did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more than a few minutes passed after he felt full than he was bent over, his ass being fucked by the sixteen-inch monster the school's quarterback, Robin, suddenly sported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giant women sat on their thrones and observed what they had wrought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we let them break for lunch?\" asked Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" replied her mother. \"When it's time for that they can suck each other off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling really horny again,\" said Melissa after a short silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let mommy take the edge off, then,\" and Jennifer began stimulating both her daughter's and her own erogenous zones with her mind alone. She even made herself into a few vibrators and pocket pussies to get closer to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa threw her head back and moaned at her mother's expert mental ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet panted after her third half-hour blowjob. At least it would be time to go, soon--she just wanted this day behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boy she'd pleasured walked off to find another partner, though, he and everyone else she could see suddenly stopped dead. Her eyes widened as his cock grew, becoming massive, stretching out on the floor, leaving him teetering, trying to stay upright. The attempt proved futile as massive breasts exploded from his chest, leaving him bent over as they hid most of his gigantic tool except for the huge, pulsating head. He was clearly trying to move, but couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to run but realized she was just as stuck with, she quickly realized, the same body. And she needed her nipples--pressed against the ground--sucked, her cock--jammed on the floor--in a pussy and her pussy--too high, she realized, for anybody normal to reach it, as she was just a human body attached to a huge pair of tits and a titanic dick--filled with a cock. She couldn't even reach around to masturbate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through her anguished wail she noticed that the two giants, and their thrones, had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over the former school, now remodeled once more as a storehouse for its former students, Jennifer and Melissa idly tweaked their nipples, stroked their dicks and fingered their pussies while conversing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So should we crush it?\" asked Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, not yet. Let them suffer a while,\" replied her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman shrugged. \"Okay, but I need to kill something now. A lot of somethings, in fact.\" She looked toward downtown. \"Care to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, mother,\" said Melissa coquettishly, \"I thought you'd never ask.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A simple thought placed Melissa and Jennifer in the middle of downtown, some buildings and streets crushed by their mere appearance. Jennifer let out a tiny moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember, leave most of them for me,\" she admonished her daughter mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've already got a plan,\" replied Melissa. \"Oh, and can you do a few things to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer picked up on her daughter's thoughts and moments later Melissa stomped off through a relatively open area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that simple stomping would be best, Jennifer walked around aimlessly, feeling small rushes as she snuffed out life after life. After a few minutes, she glanced at her daughter. \"Now!\" she said aloud, feeling the effect it had on all the helpless humans below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa stomped all around downtown, sinking the ground around it, cutting it off when it was at its maximum population for the day. Then her hands flew to her pussy, her dick and her tits, and cum, piss and milk flew, filling the trench, and squatting, she completed the indignity by putting as much shit as she could into it before it overflowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled and began her slaughter in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople died under her feet. They died when she made buildings go up in flames. They died when she created anvils to drop on them. They died when she made their cars explode. They died by the thousands, all because she wanted them to die, because her needs were more important than their existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone downtown at that time died, killed by a powerful giantess utterly lacking in mercy, their escape cut off by her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished her slaughter, she collapsed, madly stimulating her erogenous zones, trying vainly to achieve orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would not come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" called her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her maddened state, Jennifer did not hear her daughter. Her sex-starved brain, addled by its need to rape, with its need to kill still unsatisfied, heard only one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa felt a crushing pressure on her mind, immobilizing her. Her beautiful dick vanished and she felt herself forced onto all fours, her face only just above the river of bodily fluids she had created. Her mother was nowhere to be seen, but she felt the fucking when it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no other word for it. Jennifer ravaged Melissa, screwing her in every way her crazed mind could imagine. Melissa screamed, asked why, and got no answer. Jennifer could not provide any. Her urges had overcome her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the rush from the rape, from the sex, from the theft of her daughter's final shred of innocence, even from the prank she pulled making Melissa wonder where she was. But she still needed one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive, rotting carcass marked the spot where it happened. Nobody lived there. They could not, for She forbade it. Nor did they live a few miles away, where a huge head, perfectly preserved, face contorted in shock, pain and horror, stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the universe, and the universe was Her. On that day, Jennifer Parks became the universe. As She killed Her daughter, wrenching off her head and flinging it away, Her powers reached out, melding with each other, replacing every particle in the universe with a copy of Herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe universe became subject to Her capricious, perverted, deadly whims. Anarchy reigned, for there was no crime, as it was impossible to know if a person had done something of their own volition--and whether such still existed was a subject of debate--or if She had overtaken their will and demanded it. Nobody looked as people vanished without a trace, or appeared out of nowhere, or as women became men and men women, as children became adults, or adults children, or as a huge foot snuffed out their life. It was all part of Her rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was God, but nobody prayed to Her, for everyone knew that She did not listen, or care. She did as She would, and nobody dared--or even bothered--to question Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilson Smith walked along. As his foot came down, he realized he was wearing heels instead of the walking boots he'd had. He kept walking. Being in heels was nothing new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a blast of air across his body and shrugged his shoulders. Nobody cared that he was naked. Everyone knew that if you went out for more than a short walk and didn't see someone's clothes vanish, you weren't paying attention to anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision was suddenly blocked by massive tits--three this time, he quickly determined, even though he found himself unable to look anywhere other than directly into his middle boob. He felt his cock pressed up against one, too, and knew that he had six. He estimated each to be probably around twice the size of the rest of his body. With difficulty he turned around and began walking backward. He had somewhere to be, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed as his face contorted painfully. Nobody listened, if they could even hear him. He knew he had a female face, and that the pain could have been worse. He kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his dick vanish and a tight pussy replace it. He sighed. He knew what was coming and that there was no sense resisting it. He kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt himself at a complete standstill, and massive, thick cocks tore open his cunt and his ass. He could feel them pumping in and out pitilessly, and he could feel the blood streaming down his leg as they forcibly widened his holes. He screamed, but nobody cared. Nobody bothered to care any more. He felt hands twist his nipples--he realized he had six on each boob--painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt no pleasure, but then this was not about his pleasure. Soon enough he felt cum blasting through his innards, filling his pussy, blasting through his intestines, up his esophagus and out his mouth. He didn't bother to try to hold it back. Better to let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it had begun it finished, and Wilson turned around and walked on. He caught sight of himself in a window, seeing quite clearly his wild, frizzy blonde hair, his four gigantic tits, his two pussies and his titanic ass, all above a pair of foot-high heels and topped with a face covered by heavy make-up. He knew it wasn't the same body he'd had a few moments before and he knew he might have a different one a step later. He didn't, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely naked, he passed a clothing store. Shrugging his shoulders and feeling his boobs bounce painfully on his chest, he reached for a large blouse and saw his hand slip right through it. He sighed and walked on, still nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was supposed to help negotiate a corporate merger that day, but felt some of his memories being overwritten. Somehow he knew he had once known the details of the deal, but now he knew it was just the sex toy the company had bought to celebrate the event. He'd be used, passed around like the living, breathing object he was, fucked every which way and ultimately discarded. He had no dignity; he was just a thing to be thrown away after use.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He redressed her, fumbling about as he found taking off womens clothing a lot easier than putting it on. \"Pretty as a picture\" Carl laughed as he looked at himself once more in the mirror, blowing himself a kiss with Melissa's cute young face. He then proceeded to drag his body into the main room from it's hiding place beneath the bed. \"Here goes nothing\" Carl said as he began to will himself out of Melissa's body. His spirit form took hold again as his former host slumped on to the sofa. Carl shot back into his body, getting up quickly as he made a note to leave before she awoke. \"Damn, I did a number of myself\" Carl muttered to himself, noticing the afterglow of the sex he had given his body with Melissa's. She was still passed out as he exited. \"Thanks for the fun bitch\" he told her, laughing as he left the house. Carl made his way out of the house and began walking down the street, looking for some new subjects to mess with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling towards the outskirts of a nearby park, he began to notice some potential new victims to use his powers on. The first he noticed was a cute teenage couple, both around the age of 19. They were two inocent looking indie kids, cuddled up together on a park bench as they avoided the prospect of leaving each other for another day. Great test subjects to corrupt with Carl's colourful personal touches. Further down the street was a sexy young indian woman talking on her phone. She was busy squabling over something, clearly quite cold in her strippy dress, which showed off an impressive clevage. Carl pondered to himself on which option to take before a third arrived on the scene. A classy young man pulled up to the nearby traffic lights in his coveritable sports car. He looked way to loaded to be from through this part of town. He must have simply passing through. Thoughts of plenty of money began to circulate through Carls criminal mind. It would be the easiest robbery ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he decided on...</span></div></div>",

These however seemed pure and undoing of most wrong deeds. \"This will be a good bit of fun then!\" Carl noted as he approached the seclusion of the park. It was dark and out of the way, the mere streelight illuminating the couple being the only real source of light behind the bushes. Carl moved stealthily, hiding in the bushes as he got close to the couple and prepared himself for another possession. As the couple gazed up at the sky, Carl wondered which one to possess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot out of his body again and it slumped to a heap on the floor. Carl could curse his gut for being the way it was as it made a thump. Thankfully, the couple seemed to transfixed in each other to notice.

Then again, there was the chance to pull off the easiest heist of all time by taking over the rich young mans body. \"Choices choices!\" Carl said, deciding quickly before the oppoutunities were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which did he choose? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think this choice is fairly easy actually!\" Carl grinned as he continued looking at the young woman chatting away in her phone. He had enjoyed his time inside Jennifer and Mellisa so keeping with the trend would be a blast. This body before him was definatley the hotest of the three he had encountered today. She was an attractive young Indian woman, around the same height as Carl. She was wearing a stripey black and white dress which finished at around mid-calf and showed off a nice amount of clevage. She also wore a set of red high heels, a thin black cardigan and carried a red handbag. Carl estimated her tits to be arround DD. She looked to be in her early 20's, with flowing black hair that stretched down to just below her shoulders. \"This should be fun\" Carl laughed as he changed into his spirit form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, who was totally oblivious to what was to befall her, continued to chat away into her mobile. \"Listen Izzi, you need to stop with all this. I'm just not up for something like that\" she said, speaking over some kind of issue with a boy on the other end of the line. She kept looking to the road for something or someone to appear. Whatever it was was still clearly absent it seemed. A voice spoke back from the other end, bringing her to reply. \"Look, Izzi...\" she began. It was all she could muster before her head shot backwards however, Carl having leaped into her body and began his process of taking control. She dropped the phone as her eyes rolled backwards, the foreign presence taking control of every limb and nerve inside her. Eventually, she looked back down, her shocked expression contorting into an evil grin as she began to survey a sight she should have seen a million times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is something!\" Carl spoke, using his new voice whilst his new, manicured hands wandered to his chest began to squeeze away. Looking past his breasts for a moment however, he could see the phone she had dropped still in mid call. Picking it up and putting it his ear, he could hear a voice calling for his host on the other side. \"Ammi, you ok? You still there?\" the guys voice asked in concern. \"Sorry dude, got to go!\" Carl replied, hanging up and slotting the mobile into his bag. Leaning himself up against a wall briefly, he began to explore his lower reigions with delight as he read her mind. Her name was Amandeep, though most of her friends knew her as Ammi. She was a 21 year old financial consultant who lived not far from here. She was currently waiting for a friend of hers, Hana, to pick her up for a night on the town. She had a day off tomorrow and was prepared to enjoy herself the night. \"Oh I'll enjoy myself all right\" Carl muttered as he probed between her silky smooth legs. Reaching the space between, he let out a slight moan as he combed over her pussy. The street was pretty much destered though Carl didn't care much who saw him. He hadn't much shame, especially in a body not of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his hands ventured north again, a car pulled up infront of him. It took him by suprise, breaking his pleasurable trance as another young woman began to speak to him. \"Hey Ammi, you ready to go?\" she asked as she leaned out from the car window. Carl recognised her as Hana from the memories he read. \"Sure thing! Erm, two seconds\" Carl replied, sorting out his provisions whilst he fumbled with her handbag. He also walked awkwardly in the heels, the new experience being new to him. As he clambered into the passengers seat, Hana spoke again. \"You feeling alright hun? You were acting a bit strange out there when I pulled up?\" she asked, clearly having noted Carl's proding and poking of her friends lucious body. \"I'm fine babe\" Carl replied calmly as he looked her up and down briefly. He had seen her in Ammi's memories, though Hana was something else in the flesh. At 5\"6, she was young Egyptian girl of 19 years old. She, like her friend, had a lucious body, with a curvy figure and large, playful tits. She also had the same flowing black hairstyle though with purple highlights in her own. She was also paler in complexion to her friend. She wore a stylish white top with a denim mini skirt hidden from view beneath it. Her lovely legs were covered by tights and she also wore a pair of black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hana drove off, Carl spoke up once more. \"So where are we off too?\" he asked, playing dumb as he kept eyeing her up slyly. Even after his cock craving in a female body, his old tastes still hadn't worn off. \"We're going to Edge remember? Half price shots tonight!\" Hana replied, excited by the prospect of a fun night. \"Sounds great!\" Carl replied, thinking of the possibilitites. A packed club would certainly be a fun place for Carl's powers to manifest. Though he could have his own personal fun with Hana if he wanted. Carl always had his ways, thinking of how he put a copy of himself in Jennifer before. The fun was there to be had. Now he just had to make a choice... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

''Ammi?'', Hana briefly took a glance toward her friend, ''You alright there?''. She didn't keep her eyes too long off the road, even as the car entered a rather quiet part of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, sure.'', Carl broke into a grin. Wading through Ammi's memories, Carl found out that the two girls were going out to celebrate Hana's first job as an assistant manager in a local coffee shop, along with it, a complementary talk about men and especially Hana's arranged wedding, something that Ammi currently face with Izzi who was more reluctant with his and Ammi's parents' wish. Little did the girls knew that they would spend the night doing something entirely different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl looked at the girl behind the steering wheel, and shivers of excitement ran through the spine of his host as he considered how it would feel to possess her body and to see what's underneath the clothes. Half price shots can wait another time. Carl thought about sending his clone directly inside Hana's body, but decided against it. He didn't want to let a clone sample her body first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hana.'', Carl called out, imitating how Ammi would sound exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm sorry, I'm not up for the club tonight.'', Carl dropped a bit of sadness in the tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why?'', Hana pulled over, looked at her friend in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's... It's Izzy and my parents...'', from his years of conning people, Carl knew what he should say, and armed with Ammi's knowledge, it was easy to pull. ''I just need someone I could talk to.'', here comes the fake tears, even Carl was surprised at how easy for beads of tears to form in the corner of his hosts' eyes and he felt tissues on his face. He grabbed Hana's hand and noticed how slender and soft his prospective host would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carl could say another word, he was surprised that Hana had offered to go to her new flat, closer to her workplace. He had conned people before, selling fake vitamin pills and insurance, and it was hard as hell to persuade them to let him enter their house. His gaze fell on his chest and noticing the ample bosom, he was reminded that he was now Amandeep and the person who just offered him was the girl's best friend. Carl smirked inwardly, maybe she'll be up for some kinky stuff as well. Too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sniffed, ''I'm fine.'', he smiled just as Ammi would've. It wasn't that hard, knowing that in the past, a similar situation had happened.''Sorry.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry.'', Hana touched Carl again in the arm, before she turned around and began making her way back.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, they reached the door and Hana swiftly unlocked it. The apartment took Carl by suprise. Although Ammi had seen it before, the sight still took Carl by suprise in blunt spontaneous fashion. It was a rather roomy studio apartment, nicely decorated and comfy all at once. It must have taken a fair bit of money to put together, a mean feat for a 19 year old girl. \"Wow, nice place\" Carl mused unasumingly, taking in the sights through Ammi's eyes. \"You've seen it like three times now Ammi? Whats so suprising about it?\" Hana asked, giggling at her friends lapse of sense. \"It just feels like a good place to be now I guess\" Carl told her, spinning a lie to sound innocent. Hana just smiled back as she kicked off her shoes and sat herself down in the main room. Carl followed suit, kicking off the dreadful heels before joining her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whats up then hun? Whats been going on?\" Hana asked concerningly, trying to figure out her friends suposed plight. 'Shit, better think up something quick' Carl thought as he stalled to read Ammi's thoughts. He could see in her mind that she'd been having trouble accepting the arranged marriage she'd been forced into. Even though it wasn't for a few years yet, the guy was a complete stranger and wanted to start forcing his way into her life and shuffle things about. Of course, Carl didn't give a damn. But it was pure gold in fooling Hana. \"It's just...things have been so hard lately you know? All this preperation for something I don't even want. I don't know anything about Izzi and I doubt I'll like what I do find\" he rambled on with Ammi's innocent voice. Hana began to reply with words of comfort, going on about how the same was forced on to her. Carl drifted in and out of attention however, more focused on Hana's heaving chest whenever he got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up around mid-conversation. \"You should just enjoy yourself for now though, see whoever you want. Thats what I do\" Hana told him, almost seeming a little embarressed about admiting something of the sort. \"Wait, you sleep around?\" Carl asked, perked up by the prospect of Hana talking sexual. \"Well I wouldn't be so black and white about it. But yea, I enjoy sex I guess. I swear I've told you about this before?\" Hana asked, again noticing her friends lapse in concertration. Carl dived into the memory bank again. The two had indeed discussed this before. Hana was quite the cockteasing little slag too, sleeping about with men and women. 'Just how I like them!' Carl thought as he masked a grin. \"Oh yea, sorry. I forget these things sometimes\" he giggled, feigning innocence once more. \"It's ok, your stressed I guess\" Hana replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered Carl a drink as things loosened up a little. Carl accepted her offer of wine, loving a frequent alcohol intake. He didn't usually go for something so fancy but it was probably the only alcoholic thing he'd get in her house. \"Make yourself at room in the other room, I'll bring you in a glass\" Hana told him, nodding him in the direction of the living room. With a moment of free time, Carl collapsed on the sofa, spreading himself out in a very un-ladylike maner. He fondled with his large breasts as he waited, playfully grabbing his occupents tits as he showed no respect for her body. He straightened himself up quickly however as Hana came into the room with a bottle of wine and two glasses. As she handed him a glass, Carl began to drink it in large volumes. He was an alcoholic first and foremost so that wasn't going to change in whatever body he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while afterwards, he and Hana sat around drinking wine and discussing girly things. He managed to keep up a good impression, lying his way through the conversation with thoughts from Ammi's head. Though to Carl, it was incredibley tedious, dull and boring. He hated all that sissy stuff. All the while, he kept trying to sneak a view of Hana's body, eyeing her up intently like he did every atteactive woman. Eventually, the talk was becoming too much and he knew he had to try something. \"You know Hana, I really don't deserve a friend like you sometimes\" he began, feigning tears as if to act sad and needy once more. \"Aw, don't say that hun! Your like my best friend!\" Hana replied, taking him in her arms for a hug. Carl liked the feeling of being this close to such a sexy young lady. He wanted to reach out, pin her down and fuck her now. Though he tried playing character for a little longer. \"No I mean it Hana. Your so smart, so successful and just amazing. And to top it all off, you so beautiful\" he told her, concocting something sappy that he knew chicks loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, stop Ammi, I'm really not\" Hana giggled as she took in her friend complement. Her blushing hinted at Carl that this was a good oppoutunity to try something. Although he was getting pretty tired of play acting. He wasn't the sort of person to wait. He just wanted to put a submissive clone in her and get it over with. But what to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl, still locked in Hana's arms, was just about ready to make his move. He was getting tired of the constant play acting and just wanted action. He was never going to keep the sissy stuff going, it just wasn't the guy he was, however Ammi might have been before hand. He began to move in slowly, not taking any chances as he didn't want to falter after coming so far. However, just as Carl was about to turn Hana for a kiss, she loosened her grip and got up from the sofa. Carl was simply stunned for a moment as he wondered what the heck she was doing. Looking over to where she was, he now saw Hana opening a nearby cupboard and flicking through DVD's. \"I thought we could watch a film or something hun. How does The Notebook sound? Or Dear John?\" she asked, now listing the most sappy films she could find in her collection. For Carl however, it was the end of his tether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, enough. I'm not fucking around anymore\" Carl said sternly with Ammi's sweet voice, straightening himself up as to asert authority. \"Whats wrong Ammi?\" Hana asked, now concerned by her friends sudden outburst. \"It's you! Your a cockteasing bitch and...argh, I've had enough of this!\" Carl shouted, venting his frustrations at a girl he didn't even properly know. \"What did I do? Your scaring me now\" Hana said nervously, intimidated by her friends rage. Carl suddenly came to his senses, realising that he was shouting his own personal anger at a girl he didn't even know. Looking at her scared expression however, Carls criminal instincts kicked in. An evil smile came to Ammi's face as he looked his prey up and down. This was like many situations he had exploited before. Moving in, with a sutble sway in his now feminine hips, he approached Hana as she began to cower backwards. \"Ammi, please stop this\" she whimpered, only finding the wall as she backed off. \"I'm not Ammi. And babe, you don't have a choice in all this\" Carl mused as he came to within an inch of her. He could pretty much feel their two sets of breasts poking one another, a feeling that satisfied him as he leaned in to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana wasn't ready to give in however and brung her hand up for a hard slap, colliding with her friends face as Carl stumbled back somewhat. She felt shock in what she had just done, tears forming in her eyes as she felt guilt for assaulting her friend. Carl reveled in this sort of treatment however. He simply laughed it off, a sinister cackle coming from Ammi's body now as her evil grin resumed. \"Who are you? What are you?\" Hana asked, pleading for reason with whatever had became of her friend. \"I make this too hard for myself sometimes. Especially with these fucking powers\" Carl noted, moving in once more. Hana swung her arm around for another hit, thought Carl was quick to catch it this time, holding Hana's wrist with his own manicured hands. She struggled to break free, though Carl was already putting his plan into action. Looking into her eyes, he shot one of his clones into her body. Her eyes clouded over with white mist as she shook a little, Carl's clone taking control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, her natural eye colours returned. All it took was a grin from Carl to let the clone mirror it back, using Hana's cute face to contort the evil expression. The next thing Carl knew, he was being pulled in for a kiss. A full blown groping session ensued as the two 'girls' got to grips with each others bodies, madly snogging one another as they roughly went about their buisness. Calr eventually pulled away, watching his handy work as 'Hana' now began madly touching herself, her hands cupping those large tits as she moaned. \"Fucking hell boss, this is awesome!\" the clone shouted, a hand wandering south and between his legs, rubbing at Hana's pussy. \"That definatley an improvement\" Carl noted as he admired the changes he's made to the sweet girl. \"Damn right. She was a cockteasing whore anyways\" the clone replied, gasping as he got his current body wet between the legs. Carl was definatley taking full advantage of this. The only question was how to go about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could experience sex from the other side and put Ammi's body to the limit. Or he could leave the body, slap a clone in her and screw the two girls to his hearts content. He wasn't bothered about the moral objections, being a criminal and all. To him, the two girls were just objects. Carl had never bothered much with morals anyway. Eventually, he made his choice. </span></div></div>",

Fuck!'', a rather furious and agitated Ammi cursed while the clone inside Hana's body just mumbled quietly, still focused on its host body. Carl had remembered that he left his original body in the park where he found Ammi. ''Fucking heels.'', Carl cursed, he dressed the girls up the way he found them, but regretted the heels, no one should be allowed to drive with them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fucking shit...'', Carl returned to the car, back to where the clones in Ammi and Hana were waiting for him. He realized that there was no way in hell these two delicate females can carry him back to the car and depossessed Ammi, shot a clone in her and flew as quick as he could to return to his body. It was there that he saw someone had stripped his body bare. His wallet was stolen, not that there was much money in it, but he was still pissed nonetheless. The pair of Nikes, Melissa's last gift before their break-up, weren't on his feet. He was left literally with only his t-shirt and jeans, and had to straddle back scraping his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What happened to you boss?'', the clone in Hana couldn't hide the sense of bemusement. Carl shot her a glare as he made himself comfortable at the back seat. The clone in Ammi sniggered, she started the car and they cruised into the night once again as Carl decided to return to Hana's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's alright boss, we'll get you some new gear.'', Ammi snickered. ''Or some new host.'', Hana quipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, it gave Carl a little boost, maybe it was the prospect of a menage a trois<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm, this is a curious situation\" Carl noted, pondering exactly how he wanted to go about things. He made the act he was about to commit seem like rocket science from his speech. Though with these new powers, there was definatley something new added to the current equation. That didn't subtract any of the fun from what was about to conspire. Watching the clone of himself now fondling himself with Hana's body however gave Carl a craving for his old cock back. He had limitless time for the fun he could have anyway. This could just be the first of many options. The body he currently inhabited gave him similar feelings on the inside anyway, a mirrors image confirming his lust for her. \"Ah fuck it, I can always try things from the other side at another stage. Right now, I just want it the old fashioned way!\" Carl mused as he took one final look down at his bouncing bosom. \"Thats the spirit dude!...Ahhh\" 'Hana' replied, his continued probing of his hosts nether reigons causing him to gasp with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to push Carl into his choice. Focusing intently, he felt himself willed out of Ammi's body, letting her drop to the floor briefly as he went about becoming himself once more. \"No place like home!\" he joked as he got aquainted with his old body again. \"Now for phase two\". Carl looked down at the unconscious body of his former host and placed an eager clone inside of her body. The process was a lot quicker than normal, Ammi's body putting up little resistance in it's current state. The clone slowly sat up, groggy at first before he noticed the fine body he was now inhabitting. 'Hana' just looked on with amusement, as did Carl. \"Man, waking up from this is like having a hangover!\" 'Ammi' exclaimed as she got to her feet once again. \"I would say I feel bad for whoever we take over...but I really don't\"! With that, the clone began fondling Ammi's tits, displaying the same level of crudeness every version of Carl showed. Including the original. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn fucking right. Now why don't you get yourself more aquainted with that hot body of yours whilst I have some fun\" Carl ordered. He let the Ammi clone foddle his new body on the sofa as he turned to 'Hana'. The clone could tell from instinct what Carl wanted, being an extension of him. He instantly stopped what he was doing and proceeded to giving a seductive look to his master, as if to wind him up. \"So how are you going to violate me first?\" 'Hana' cooed, seducing Carl in a manner the clone knew he liked. \"Well you can get over here and deal with this hard on I'm getting\" Carl ordered, unzipping his jeans as a signal. \"With pleasure\" 'Hana' replied as the beautiful young girls body got down to it's knee's infront of the scruffy looking criminal. Her manicured hands pulled Carls now stiffening cock out of his pants and began jerking him off. \"Thats what I'm talking about\" Carl muttered. He felt not only pleasure and satisfaction in what occouring, but triumph. These powers were an easy way around everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl grabbed Hana by the hair and forced his cock towards her mouth, something which the clone gleefully accepted as it used it's new body to take it in. Carl gasped in satisfaction as the clone started deepthroating him, taking the whole lengh of his cock into the pretty girls mouth. It was a process 'Hana' continued, pausing only for air and to work Carl's dick in other ways he liked. \"This certainly feels weird. But she's used to it!\" the clone chuckled with Hana's voice. \"Well she's mine now\" Carl informed his clone, pulling back in order to continue on to something else. This was something the clone again picked up on, standing up with an evil grin on Hana's face as he pulled off her tights and lowered her panties. Carl then proceeded to take her over the armchair, positioning himself behind her as he entered from behind. He began rocking her body back and forth as he impaled his dick into her, the clone moaning loudly all the while as he took it greatfully for his master. Eventually, Carl came to climax, finishing up inside his captive with much satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the best lay he had ever gotten. And he wasn't even finished yet. He still felt like he had plenty of gusto. Plus there was another exceptionally hot girl currently getting herself off on the sofa just behind him. Carl was certainly not done here. </span></div></div>",

He was an ideal target for a money hungry Carl, oozing with wealth that he could so easily exploit. Who knew what possibilities having his life could hold. \"Better act quickly then!\" Carl said as he quickly shifted into spirit form once again. As his body slumped to the floor, he shot towards the car, which just seemed to be gaining ignition. Just before the driver could put his foot on the pedel, Carl leaped into his body. He jolted somewhat, his body being taken over by the hostile entity before he could react. As Carl awoke once more, he found himself in the driving seat, feeling the rumble of the sports car beneath him as he held a hand on the steering wheel. \"Fucking hell, this is new!\" Carl exclaimed with his new voice. The man had a higher tone to his voice than Carl's grumble. It the first of a few new things he noticed. The man was vastly more well groomed than Carl, with a clean, shaved face and a stylish hair cut which cropped his light brown locks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl looked down, he saw an expensive array of clothes adorning him. \"Sweet, I always wanted a blazer!\" he chuckled as he looked at the expensive grey blazer he now sported. \"Damn, big brands too!\" Carl added, noting the mans hollister shirt, with a pair of white shorts and neat shoes. \"Not really my style, but then again I'm not really me!\" Carl laughed to himself. He was brought back to Earth by a car honking behind him. Clearly his not moving in the car had held up someone. \"Alright arsehole!\" Carl shouted back as he put his foot down. The rumble of the cars engine satisfied him. \"That fucking awesome!\" he exclaimed as he reved it up and brung the car round. \"Just need to make a quick pitstop first\" he noted, as he pulled up alongside his lifeless form. \"In the back fucker!\" he groaned as he pulled his body into the back seat. It was amazing nobody had noticed or found it out of the ordinary. The joys of modern society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his normal hub gathered, Carl scanned the guys mind. His name was Travis. He was 25 years old, with a well paying job in his fathers buisness and plenty of money off mum and dad. He currently lived in the west end in a high class apartment with his current flame. \"Damn, I would mind giving that a go!\" Carl noted as he read thoughts of the guys girlfriend. She was a hot, latin babe of around 23 named Ariana. She had long, flowing brown hair which complemented her cute face. She also sported a lucious slim figure, with perky tits, great legs and curves where they need to be. \"This is going to be a fun evening!\" Carl exclaimed as he reved up the car and drove off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Carl pushed toward the door, he bumped into the burley, bearded man, the so-called \u201cass hole.\u201d \u201cOut of my way, fat-ass!\u201d Carl barked.  He really should have been careful with his words\u2026this guy was big.  Carl had to look up to bitch at the man, as he was about 6 foot 3 or so.  He wore a suit\u2026a bit out of place for this part of town.  Carl guessed he was some rich bastard passing through the ugly neighborhood on his way back to one of the mansion-like homes in the suburbs.  Said fat-ass stood over Carl, looking down at him and shaking his head.  This enraged Carl all the more; he hated being looked down on, literally or otherwise.  \u201cWhat are you shaking your head at prick!?\u201d Carl demanded of the man, inching still closer to the gentleman.  Carl got as close as he could though the man\u2019s bulging gut was in the way.  Carl stared up at the man and looked him over.  He seemed to be in his mid-forties or thereabouts.  He had a full head of hair that was mostly dark but had begun to grey in some areas.  A thick beard, also with bits of grey, covered the man\u2019s face.  He had a set of broad shoulders and wore a nice suit jacket.  He had a full belly that hung over the edge of his pants, which, incidentally, were held up by suspenders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought pussy!\u201d Carl said angrily to the man when he, despite his size, did nothing to Carl.  As Carl angrily headed for the door, he suddenly began to feel queasy.  His vision blurred a little bit, and his stomach felt amiss.  Stopping, Carl leaned for a moment against a small wooden rack, using it to steady himself.  He tried to shake off the nausea and blurred vision, bit it persisted.  \u201cAfter all that tough talk, now you won\u2019t just leave?\u201d called the big guy.  Carl quickly looked back and thundered, \u201cShut the fuck up, rich boy!\u201d at the man, who still stood shaking his head.  Something was wrong though, and all three of the men there had noticed it\u2014Carl\u2019s voice sounded exactly like that of the big guy he had yelled at.  Taken aback by this and still feeling a bit off, Carl quickly turned back around.  \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with me?\u201d he said quietly to himself, his voice still not sounding as he expected.  An ache filled Carl\u2019s belly, and he began to feel sharp pains in his chest and his legs.  His face felt strange too\u2026almost as though it were contorting and moving about of its own accord.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf-panicked, Carl dropped the beer and smokes to the floor and headed for the bathroom, pain shooting through more and more of his body.  He threw open the bathroom door and rushed in, breathing heavily and beginning to sweat.  Carl also locked the door behind him.  He rested his hands on the sink as he stared into the mirror at his bewildered, pain-stricken face.  \u201cWhat the fuck is going o\u2026.\u201d he began to ask his own reflection, but suddenly sharp pain shot through Carl\u2019s body, and he dropped to his knees, unable to stand.  Carl could feel his bones moving about\u2014crunching, shifting, squishing around under his skin.  \u201cAggghhhhghgh,\u201d he bellowed in pain.  As this subsided, Carl stood again, but something was different.  Carl stood up\u2026just more than usual, a lot more actually.  He had to bend down a bit to see his own face, and his pants and shirt were clearly too small for his lengthened body, as they were stretched to the limit\u2026he must have been about 6 foot 3 now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die in there are you dumbass?\u201d came a voice from outside the door. It was the man from before, the man whose voice Carl had somehow replicated!  \u201cGo the fuck away!\u201d Carl yelled back in a labored voice, holding himself up by the bathroom sink.  Suddenly pain enveloped Carl again, but this time he was able to stay standing.  Carl watched and suffered as his face moved and contorted into a new one.  It also got\u2026well\u2026bigger. It fattened up, and a significant double chin appeared, as well as a grey beard and hair of the same shade.  Staggering back in fear, Carl watched as the transformation of his body continued.  Carl\u2019s belly grew quite a lot; it expanded sloppily into a fat belly that hung over his jeans.  His legs fattened up too, tearing at the stitches of his pants.  \u201cArrrrghgghghgh my GOD!\u201d Carl yelled in pain as his newly plump, expanded form jiggled and shook, causing feeling and sensations Carl had not known before.  He fell to the ground again, and as he lie on his back, grey smoke enveloped his body and replaced his torn-up clothes with a nice suit and a white dress shirt, both of which strained a bit by Carl\u2019s fat frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl turned over, feeling the unfamiliar tug of suspenders and stretched fabric on his fat stomach.  He looked down as his newly pudgy form as he slowly stood, grunting.  \u201cThat\u2019s it!  I\u2019m comin\u2019 in!\u201d Carl heard from outside, and the door flew open.  In flew the man from before, the very ass-hole whose form Carl now wore.  Carl stood slowly, not yet used to his new form\u2014the new height, the new weight, etc.  The man stopped in his tracks upon seeing Carl, upon seeing himself really, standing there.  \u201cWha\u2026..what the hell is this?\u201d he said in disbelief.  Carl glanced down at his new body, running his hands over the bulging stomach and the tailored suit that covered him.  He felt so much taller than before too.  \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Carl said to his double, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be finding out by myself,\u201d he declared as he balled up his fist and punched the man in the stomach.  He literally flew backward!  Carl looked at his fist in amazement.  He\u2019d expected the man to put up a fight\u2026he was a big guy, after all, but instead he literally got tossed through the air, hit a wall, and crumpled to the ground unconscious.  Whatever was going on with Carl, it involved unnatural strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl slowly knelt down and searched the pockets of his unconscious doppelganger.  He took money, credit cards, car keys, and more.  He came to an ID, \u201cJacob Harlan, 335 Riverside Court,\u201d Carl read.  \u201c\u2026.a rich neighborhood\u2026this should be fun,\u201d Carl mused.  Carl continued his search, and he came to a business card, one that bore the words Harlan and Sons, LLC.  This immediately got Carl\u2019s attention.  \u201cSo it\u2019s that Harlan!\u201d Carl said, seething with rage.  Harlan and Sons was a family-run law firm that had grown exponentially in recent years and had gone national; it had lots of lawyers, but the same Harlans had stayed in charge of it.  Named for Duncan Harlan, who had started the firm in the very late 1960s, the firm specialized in criminal law.  Through an odd confluence of events that rendered the normal prosecutor unable to perform, it had been the Harlan law firm that had put Carl away for his longest stretch of time in the slammer.  These bastards were to blame for his woes, and now he was one of them!  What damage he could do as one of the Harlan family!  He could embarrass the whole firm, bring down the whole enterprise!  He\u2019d do just that, but now without playing with them a bit first\u2026he\u2019d make them suffer like a cat plays with a mouse.  Carl thought he should probably figure out these new-found powers of his a bit more too.  \u201cYou\u2019re whole family\u2019s gonna wish you never fucked with me, fucking prick!\u201d Carl said to the unconscious real Jacob Harlan.  He slowly stood, adjusting his suit and collar, looking at himself in the mirror, and trying to get used to his new body and new reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked slowly from the restroom.  As he approached the door to leave the establishment, the clerk from before stopped him.  \u201cSo\u2026.so is he all right in there?\u201d he asked.  Carl chuckled a bit, his belly shaking with laughter, \u201cI think he\u2019s gonna be just fine,\u201d he said, and stepped out into the evening\u2026..           <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d gone from a slobbering drunk with a rather extensive criminal record to a high-powered and high-priced lawyer within just a couple (excruciatingly painful) minutes.  \"This should be interesting,\u201d Carl declared as he briefly ran his hands over his plump form and marveled at the feel of a tailored suit.  He glanced around the parking lot and noticed a black BMW across the way.  Looking at the keys he\u2019d stolen from the real Jacob Harlan, he noticed the familiar BMW logo emblazoned across the keychain.  \"Bingo,\u201d Carl said, a smile spreading across his face.  He walked up to the luxury vehicle and opened the door, savoring every sweet motion that moved him closer to his revenge, the revenge he\u2019d taste from inside the body of the man who most deserved his wrath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl maneuvered his bloated body into the fancy leather seat of the car and looked about at all the bells and whistles it had, one of which was a GPS.  \"Come on dammit...ok...favorites...\u201d Carl said, talking to himself as he used his pudgy fingers to navigate through the device.  He found one marked \"Home,\u201d pushed it, and the pleasant voice came to life, telling Carl how to drive to the house.  He started the car and rode off, leaving the filling station and rolling through the streets of the town toward the home of his borrowed body.  \"This whole situation is gonna take some getting used to,\u201d Carl thought aloud, with only himself at the GPS as his companions.  He glanced down slowly at his enlarged body and the suit that covered it, the clothes that probably cost as much as a college education.  \"How the fuck did I end up turning into this bastard anyway?\u201d he asked no one in particular.  He had yet to figure out just how the hell this new-found power of his worked...he figured he should probably find that out at some point.  On Carl rolled, through the darkened streets and past businesses closed for the day, until he eventually entered the suburbs with the help of his electronic companion.  \"Son of a bitch,\u201d he said as he glanced up at the increasingly palatial houses with their big, manicured yards and their 3- and 4-car garages, many probably complete with butlers and maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In point two miles, turn left and arrive at home,\u201d said the pleasant female voice from the GPS.  Carl did so, and he started up in wonder at the vast home that was Jacob Harlan\u2019s...well...now his, really.  \"Oh my god,\u201d Carl said, \"at least there's one upside of being this fat fuck,\u201d he declared as he parked the car and got out, heading up to the house.  It was huge!!!  A big stone house right on the water, the place had a pool in the back yard and a nice clean-cut lawn.  Next to the pool was a fenced-in basketball court.  \u201cGuy\u2019s got more money than he knows what to do with,\u201d Carl mused as he unlocked the door and slowly entered the home...mansion, really.  \"Hello...anyone home?\u201d he asked, hearing the voice of his borrowed body echo through the large home.  He walked slowly, looking about and hearing the click of his expensive shoes on the tile floor.  The light of the moon shone beautifully through the windows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply came, so Carl continued walking through the home, glancing about the rooms in the night.  He took off his suit jacket and put in on the back of a chair in the kitchen.  Turning a light on, Carl took out the wallet he had stolen from the real Jacob Harlan, opened it up, and began to flip through it with his pudgy fingers.  He found a number of things--credit cards, business cards, and so forth.  He found something else too, though, something invaluable--family pictures.  \"Jackpot!\u201d Carl said as he looked through the pictures and saw the faces of Harlan's children.  The first was a girl who appeared to be about five years of age.  She wore a flowery pink dress and a cute pink hat, a hat below which tufts of brown hair hung.  She had a pleasant, toothy smile.  The name \"Maddy\u201d was written across the bottom of the picture.  The next picture was of an older girl...probably about 17.  She had on a beautiful red dress and a wonderful smile, and a tiara adorned the top of her head.  She was a prom queen!  This girl had obviously been in front of a camera before.  She was quite beautiful--her fit, toned, and young body adorned by two large breasts hanging from her chest and straining against the red dress.  \"This chick\u2019s cut...obviously she don't take after daddy,\u201d Carl mumbled as he patted jiggly belly his new form carried around.  A third photo was of a young man with slicked-back, dark hair and a handsome face.  He wore the white coat of a medical doctor, and the writing on the back of the picture read, \"Jackson Harlan, MD.\u201d  \"These ones'll be fun to...play with,\u201d Carl declared in his borrowed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked again through the expensive home of his host body, filled with antiques next to the latest in new technology, photographs of the Harlan family with diplomats, billionaires, and the like.  Living Harlan\u2019s life would be fun, Carl knew.  Suddenly, Carl heard the door open and close, and heels clicked across the tile floor.  \"Anybody home!\u201d a female voice yelled out, echoing through the home.  \"SHIT!\u201d Carl thought.  He didn't expect to actually have to pretend to be Harlan just now, and certainly not in front of a person who obviously knew him quite well, well enough to walk right into his house!!  Carl's body\u2019s pulse quickened, and he shuffled over quickly to a corner and tried to hide his sloppy, bloated form by putting his back tightly to the wall. Lights were being flipped on in the house.  Pensively, Carl peered around the corner and beheld a woman, the one whose voice he'd heard.  She smiled oddly at seeing the apparently startled Harlan trying to hide, and she walked toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tHis older daughter.<br>\r\n2)\tHis wife.<br>\r\n3)\tA woman from Harlan's work, who seems VERY friendly with him, despite his being married.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Outside, Carl stood a while in the night, still excited what very unbelievable had happened, but the feel of the fabrics of the suit reminds him that this is not a dream, as he never owns and feels such expensive and quality of silky shirt and tie, woolen coat and pant, and use suspenders instead of belts. He didn't even know how to tie a tie before, and only wear some cheap suit while in court facing charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what to go next, he took out the car key he stole from Harlan, and notice the BMW logo keychain. In such neighborhood, it is not hard to notice the only luxury car parking nearby. Carl quickly opened and sat inside the black BMW, though now his form is bigger, the seat still wide enough and comfortable. He started the engine, but decided to take some time to calm himself down and understand what exactly is his newfound power before driving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no doubt Carl got the ability from that strange artifact he touched early, but only by the actual experience he now total believed that is not some hallucination while drunk. But it doesn't matter to Carl how he got the ability, as long as he can use it for own good. So he doesn't plan to go back and take the artifact, not to mention by now that place should have crawled with people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the look of his body now, no doubt he can shapeshift to other person's appearance, even size is very different, though the process was very painful, but once complete he doesn't feel any uncomfortable, except a bit bloated and gassy. Maybe that's why that Harlan guy comes to the store, to find some medication for his stomach, because the real Carl's body didn't ate much today, or any other days for that matter. So, he can assumed he's not only duplicate the appearance, but also inside organs and health status. Maybe that also explained his strength, though he still has doubt that Harlan guy has such strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, during the shapeshift, the clothes will be duplicated too. But how is that only the clothes changed if the shapeshift also affect something else around body? Harlan's car key, wallet and other personal things were not duplicated, he has to search his body to take all that just now. Is it because these are metal or plastic material? Carl couldn't figured out, maybe shapeshift one or more times will know its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext question is, how does it triggered? He remembered he bumped into Harlan by the door, then his voice starts to change at that time. So it was triggered by physical touch, maybe their hands or any exposed skins touched accidentally. Wait, is that mean he will change into anyone he touches for now on? Carl not sure, of course, it's not like he has a guide for his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to turn 'the shapeshift thing' off if Carl wants to stay in this form, while touching other person is necessary like shaking hand or having sex? This Harlan guy may not has ideal body shape, but he's rich, at least should hold on until he makes Harlan's family suffered, or robbed Harlan's every penny. Carl reminds himself he has to find out how to control his ability as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of money, Carl noticed he doesn't know much of this guy, like his bank account or his signature. he try to concentrate and search his memory but no luck. Even though his ability was incredible enough, he still hope to come with more cool abilities such as memory steal or mind control. 'Looks like I have to work a bit to get money without getting suspicious.' Carl sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, there maybe ways to just took Harlan's money and ran off, if the spent money was traced, he can just keep shapeshifting to other person, let the former body owner took the blame. But if the crime life of Carl teach him anything, it is spend the money with worries and always running are not so fun. Since no one will ever thought of shapeshift is real, maybe he can take the time to figure things out and enjoy a while, and also, he doesn't know will his ability stays with him forever, for now let's put such careless plan as plan B.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about the real Harlan during his impersonation? Carl just realized. He has stayed in the car quite some times now, eventually the store clerk will go inside the bathroom to check if \u2018Carl\u2019 didn't came out after a while (since Carl was in Harlan's form when he comes out, the clerk will thought the one still inside was Carl). He can imagine that clerk's face when he saw that the same guy who just took off is also laying down in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Harlan will be discovered sooner or later, and the punch that knocked him out doesn't seems to cause severe injury, maybe he wakes up right at this moment. If he's not, the clerk will call ambulance, they will take him to hospital and informs his family and such. In anyways, Carl actually has little time to impersonate Harlan and proceed his revenge plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl panicked, he should've thought a way to hide Harlan or drag him out right then. Now he can't risk to go back to the store. To make situation worse, a silenced ambulance actually approaches the store, two paramedics got out and go inside the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould Carl wait and see what happen? Or choose to drive or ran away for now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl decided to stay and see what will happen. He turned the car and lights off to be less noticeable. He leaned on the steering wheel and had his eye focused on the store's front door, nervously. Luckily the car windows are black privacy glass kind, passers can't see a thing inside of the car. Plus, Carl has the key, which means even Harlan able to drive, he couldn't. Carl thinks if Harlan really had recovered in this short time, at least he can sell the car to chop shop later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on! Why took it so long?\" Carl mumbling impatiently, getting used to his new voice. Only ten minutes passed, but for Carl it seemed forever, he also started to sweat under his new shirt. So Harlan is a sweater when nervous, not a fun fact. Finally he saw the clerk opened the door and holds for the paramedics to push stretcher out. So he still alive... hold on, Carl squints and notice something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarlan's head was blocked by the paramedics from Carl's sight while they pushing him toward the ambulance, but he notice, even though Harlan's body was cover with sheet, his figure shouldn't be that small. Is it the illusion created by the distance between them or is Harlan's eyesight he now possessed poor? Then the paramedic walked away, and Carl has the chance to see Harlan's head, he's shocked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... ME?\" Carl couldn't believe it! That guy on the stretcher, definitely has the real Carl's face on his! \"Awesome!\" Carl cheered with a load off his mind. That guy must the real Harlan that shapeshifted to Carl's appearance, with body size, hair and such, whole package like his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how? their change are not simultaneous, what triggered him to change later too? Carl is not a very bright man, but maybe because the brain duplicated from Harlan, though knowledge and memories are not copied, it still seems to affect Carl somehow, make him thinking stuff more than before. Now the situation is looking good for him, Carl decided to take some risk to have some answer. So he gets out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi, sir, you still around?\" the clerk said when he heard shoe steps approached then turned and saw Carl, or 'Harlan', walking towards him. Carl thinks, \"The clerk doesn't seems surprised or weird when he saw me, that's a good sign. And the way he call me sir, not a bit despise.\" he can get used to being superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, try to calm myself down in the car before leave, and feel guilty of my reckless action. Anyway, it's good that you called the ambulance. Will he be fine?\" Carl imitate Harlan's upbringing voice unwittingly to the clerk, maybe that's also one of the perks he got from Harlan's brain, reflex or something, treat polite with polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Actually, I was hoping that guy will go out by himself, not worth to call ambulance and go through such trouble for a douche, you know.\" The clerk shrugged, \"but not long after you left, I heard that guy screaming and moaning in the restroom again.\" Again? Carl intrigued and paid full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think my boss will be happy if some guy died in the store, right? So I went inside to check on him as he stopped screaming. \" Maybe because of Carl's politeness, or it's quite an unusual night for the clerk too, he continues to share his story, \"that's when I saw him still lying on the floor, unconscious but still breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk paused, like he's aware of something till now, then said, \"but boy, his clothes are so torn, even the jeans! How strong are you, sir? Anyway, to be cautious, I finally called an ambulance, didn't think they came this fast, but the paramedics said he's fine, they even decided no need to rush.\" He then added, \"and don't worry, sir, I didn't tell them who punched him. I don't think they care that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paramedics put Harlan, or 'Carl', in the ambulance. Carl can sees him up close before the car door closed. It's weird enough with what happened to Carl's own body, it still feels odd to see his double. Harlan seems dizzy but notice Carl too, he pointed his finger to him, \"if you are me, who am I? what...\" then passed out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarlan's voice is weak, but still recognizable that he sounded like real Carl. And the sleeve on his hand also confirmed two things, torn and was what Carl wear today. Judging by what he mumbled and Carl is the only one who touched that strange artifact, he can assumed Harlan does not has the same power, so it must be Carl who changed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his torn-up clothes may also explained something. The last second Carl's clothes exist was during his change, after stretched out, and before replaced by suit. Since it stays torn on Harlan, which means he was duplicated after Carl transformation. And maybe during Carl search his body, their skins accidentally touch each other again at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it is safe to assume: first touch changed Carl to that person, Second touch changed that person to Carl, or, Carl's previous appearance? Alright, Carl happy to know more of his power, though still have lots of question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl's mind was running more than ever, the ambulance is about to drive away, the clerk was back to the store after he greeted Carl goodbye. Carl remembers something. He quickly stopped the driver of the ambulance, take out his, the real Carl's wallet with ID in it to the driver, \"I found this wallet on the ground, maybe it's belong to that guy.\" The driver says thank you then drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long, sucker!\" Carl grinned. The ID will told people who Harlan is now, and after they checked Carl's record with police department, Harlan will have problems if he insists he is Jacob Harlan, as people will not treat criminal, no matter current or former, with open mind. Maybe they will lock him in mental hospital, or his parole officer will decided to throw him back to prison. Anyway, he will not bothered Carl anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Carl thinks he should keep track Harlan's whereabouts. Sure he can order someone in Harlan's firm to check on a criminal tomorrow, saying it's for a lawsuit. Carl walked back to the car and sat on the driving seat, \"What a night!\" He started to feel a bit tire. The watch of Harlan's, one still working and looks expensive of course, tells him it's after 12 now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after 12 and tired already? Maybe because of all the excitement in one night, or Harlan has good habit of sleep. Huh, good. Carl can't help to find it how ironic now that he's about to become, or pretend to be, one of the good guy, only plan to destroy them. Anyway, Carl thinks it's time to visit Harlan's house, ah nope, \"back to my house now,\" Carl corrected himself and couldn't resist to put a smile on his face, or, \"Harlan's face\", he could go on and on, but he told himself to focus on the task now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car has GPS device attached, and it's not hard to find the word 'Home' among the list even for Carl, with 'Work' and other locations may come in handy later. The GPS is set, but before he started to drive, something caught his attention again, it was...</span></div></div>",

Carl believe he did took all Jacob Harlan's possessions while searching his body in restroom, he didn't came across anything close to a ring on his hands or pockets. But his ring finger suggested different, as there is a round lighter tan mark on it, means Jacob do wears a ring. Or was he? Divorced maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis assumption makes Carl a bit disappoint. If Jacob has a wife, Carl may finally can have some sex after a long time since his last, he doesn't even care if his wife beautiful or not. It's that long of the time. Now not only he still can't have sex anytime soon, he has to deal with someone else's ex-wife. And do they have kids? If so, were the kids lived with Jacob or his ex-wife or they took turns? Or were the kids old enough to have their own life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl flip his palms while thinking, something caught his eyes again. The top of his left index finger is glowing! Among the meters, GPS screen, and many other car device's lights, the glow is not very obvious, Carl may not even notice it if on the morning. At first he thought it just some reflection from the light, but when he checked his finger closer, he found that glow is actually came from his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that how the touch triggered the shapeshift power? Maybe he can turn it off? Not sure how to do, Carl just try to concentrate on his finger and think something like 'switch off' or 'close'. And how lucky he is, the glow disappeared almost immediately, indicate it was switched off. Carl concentrates again but this time think 'switch on', and the glow back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl is very pleased, now that he knows how to control his power, he can use it whenever he wants, no need to scare to touch other person. He can have sex whatever he wants! Oh, wait, he's divorced... Screw it, with Jacob's money, he can get as many hookers as he wants, and ruined his reputation at the same time! Or maybe Jacob already is a regular of some fancy agencies, those rich guys always have their privilege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose questions can't be answered if Carl just sitting here. Clear up his mind, he started the car, and drove off the parking lot to the main street, followed the instruction of the GPS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*  *  *  *  *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl may not drive a luxury car before, but as a criminal, he drove getaway car plenty times. The only challenge is his now new height, also affects his sight a bit different than before, wider or higher, let his usual calculation, or intuition, of the space among him is a bit off. But unlike getaway car, he can drive slowly to have time to get used to the new adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed the instruction of GPS voice, then he started to saw some big houses with big yards at the roadside. Though Carl shouldn't be surprised that Jacob's house will be located in some high-class suburbs, and he did passed by this area before for some 'surveillance jobs', it is still excited that this time Carl no longer will be suspected just being here and no need to be secretive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have arrived your destination.\" Finally, the GPS voice took him to stop in front of a three floors house with a big garage, lights and water sprinkle on the front neat lawn and a yard bigger than Carl's apartment. Truth to be told, the house is not as fancy as he imagined, people like Harlan can afford much nicer house, this house could be just one of their vacation houses. But 'upgraded' from an overdue small apartment to this house, it still amazed him very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's not much lights coming from the house, doesn't looks like anyone's in there. Or could be just because of all residents were sleeping, it almost 1am now. Carl not sure should he park the car in the garage, or how to open the garage door first. He searched through the compartments in the car, nothing useful. He then search the briefcase and overcoat that has been on the shotgun seat all this time, found a switch thingy in one of the overcoat's inside pocket. He pushed the button, and happy to see the garage door slides up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the garage was empty, so Carl decided to drive the car in. Once parked the car inside, he turned off the car and closed the garage door with the switch. He then takes Jacob's -- or his now -- briefcase, overcoat, phone and other possessions with both hands, stumbled out of the car with his bulgy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jacob Harlan, a lawyer in Harlan and Sons, also one of the partner, born on 12th August 1971, so is, uh... 45 years old this year.\" That's all the information he got, from name card and driver license. The hatred he invested on Harlan and Sons was more of a imputation through the lawyers he hate just so happened to work under that firm, he never took the time to know all his enemies before. Hell, he didn't even recognize Jacob until he found his ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing.\" Carl brace himself. There's a door on the side of the garage. In the other side of that door, he has to start acting more like Jacob in front of people. The staff (with house this big, of course Jacob has maids or more) should be easy to deal with, just boss them around or make small conversations only. The hardest part is facing anyone Jacob intimates with and not grow their suspicious when getting information he wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan he finally playing a long game? Even though his newfound power makes him more confidence, he never planned or involved in any big heist before, now not only he has to work alone, he didn't even know what his next step will be. Take a deep breath, Carl lift up his foot...</span></div></div>",

Some lights were already switched on, Carl put his stuff on the dining table, then took off his suit jacket and hang it on the back of a chair. He looked around, the kitchen is clean and neat, on the counter has some fruits in a basket, a 32\" TV on wall, a refrigerator, many cupboards, and any thing that can be found in a typical kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit thirsty, he took a glass, and get some OJ from the fridge. Beer would be better, but he left his six pack in the store, and he couldn't find any alcohol in the fridge. Is Jacob happened to drink all his beer just before, or he didn't drink at all? <i>Am I gonna pretend not to drink in front of people? What kind of a man who doesn't drink?</i> Carl can't related at all, hoped the latter assumption was way wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he poured and drank slowly, he saw there's a backyard with swimming pool and loungers outside, a gym room seems to have a lot of equipment on the other side of the pool, and the fences were farther and wider. <i>Jacob must be rarely using these facilities these days</i>, Carl thought while looking at his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not sure if any persons were in the house or not, he decided to walked around softly, especially now he's wearing leather shoes in a silent night, to find more clues. He took his coat and followed the corridor from the other side of kitchen, at the end of the corridor is the front door, Carl hang his coat on a coat rack nearby and checked the door. It's locked and didn't have any security system installed, Carl relieved, one less thing he has to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he backed in and went to the living room. Sofa around a small table, in front of a 60\" TV on the wall, and some decorations, but some frames caught his eyes. Carl looked through the pictures, some were old family photos, from Jacob's childhood to young adults. In likely the most recent photo, Jacob still looked a lot younger than now, less beard and thinner, maybe around 30. All were taken with Jacob and his parents and apparently his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also some photos with Jacob and other people, some are celebrities that Carl recognized, others maybe Jacob's business partners. Some were women too, but not one seemed very intimate with Jacob, more likely working relationship only. If Jacob's really divorced, it's not surprised that he didn't put any ex-wife's photo in living room. But if they have kids, there should be at least one photo with kids, but no photo in here was suggested that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, my luck just keep getting better and better.\" Less family member he has to deal with, especially no some pain in the ass kids around. And more signs showed Jacob was living alone, no wife and kids around here, and not even a butler or maid stayed with him. If there were some staff, they should be woken up by the noise he drove his car into the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news eased up his tense, he felt more relaxed and tired. Still can't 100% sure that no one's in the house, he walked softly back to the kitchen and put down the glass in the sink. There's a study room opposite of the living room he saw just now, but that's not the time for Carl to go through, so he just pick up the jacket and walked to the stairs and up to second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were rooms on second floors too, he didn't checked thoroughly, but opened each door slowly and carefully, to see if anybody's in there. All emptied. Then he went to the master bedroom. A king size bed, a laptop on a table, a door lead to bathroom, a walk-in closet... most importantly, no one else. Those things didn't concerned Carl now because he was distracted, as his stomach started to grunt. He almost forgot that Jacob's stomach hasn't felt well, now could became diarrhea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly went into the bathroom, took off his pants and sat on the stool. \"Great, the first thing coming out from this body is shit.\" Carl complained to himself. He thought of masturbate ever since he's in this body, the curiosity of using other person's penis is also kind of a turn on, or called it a test flight. It's much weirder to take a dump as somebody else, even though technically, this is still his own body. He saw his, or Jacob's penis, he's not disappointed in its normal size, but with the stomachache, he has lost his interest of masturbate for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of \"out of body\" experience, while playing some buttons on the stool (\"Whoever thought of warm seat is genius,\" Carl said), he's happy it's not diarrhea as his stomach felt much better. After cleaned himself up, he decided to take a shower before bed. He took off the rest of his clothes, put them in a basket, and looked at his new naked body for the first time through mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's body is out of shape, but not much, his height helped make him looked strong but not just fat if he sucked his belly in, and the beard hid his double chin. If Jacob worked out a bit, he could still be attractive enough even in his mid-forties. And with his wealth and status, he could get any women he want quite easy. Which make Carl wonder why Jacob still live alone, though it is a huge convenient for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a tub in the bathroom, but Carl didn't have time to enjoy now. It's after 1:30 am, and as Jacob he must go to work in the morning, and Carl still has a lot to figure out then. He just used the showerheads next to the tub and soap to take a quick shower, then wore a robe and went to the closet. There were lots of cabinet inside, Carl didn't look through each one but found boxers and pajamas folded in two different cabinets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe changed into one of the pajamas and crawled into the coziest bed he ever had in his life. Carl finally knew what a good night sleep was after all these years. Before the drowsiness got him, the final thought he had was thinking he's really getting into became the master of the house. Then the snore train started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he knew, he did act like Jacob unconsciously ever since he's in his shoes. He didn't have Jacob's memory, but when he didn't pay attention how he did what he wanted to do, his body tend to be 'autopilot' on some of his movement. He's not only walked different than his former body, he also actually walked like Jacob's, but the reason is not because of the body size changed he'd thought; Or he hang the suit jacket on a chair when he's in the kitchen, instead of tossing his clothes around like he usually did in his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl yet to notice and asked: How he knew how to take care of a jacket? Why he carry the coat to coat rack when he walked around the house? Was it just a coincidence that he found the boxers and pajamas so fast and put them on before sleep? He's not a tidy person, just take a look at his former clothes and apartment. And he never care what to wear to bed, just passed out after a few bottles of beer almost every night, in any places. It's like the years of habits or routines of Jacob has make some sort of muscle memory, which now Carl inhabited.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's 8:30 am on Thursday, the alarm sound woke Carl up. He reached out to the clock and push the button on it. <u>Fucking clock!</u> Carl mumbling, he slept soundly last night, but now has to wake up. <i>What a vivid dream last night. Better prepare for work now.</i> He barely opened his eyes, his mind still hazy and hadn't have the mood to concentrate, he trust his body move on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out the bed, walked to the bathroom. A morning wood greeted Carl when he took a leak. <i>Huh, looks bigger than before.</i> After that, as he stood in front of the mirror and saw Jacob's reflection stared back at him, he now noticed how odd of his behavior just now. <i>Prepare for work? Since when did I work?</i> He still knew himself as Carl Jason Edwards, but his appearance now was Jacob Harlan's, proved what happened yesterday was not a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How did I walk from bed to here with eyes almost shut but didn't hit or kicked anything just now? And come to think of it, why did I put on pajamas last night?</i> Not that the pajamas weren't comfortable, Carl just not a pajamas guy before. So many questions came to him when he traced back his action started from last night, but he can't quite figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to wave his arms and stretched his legs, relieved that he still able to control his own body. He also realized he still only have his own memory. If he had Jacob's memory, he would knew, as their life were so much different. But somehow the body has Jacob's subconscious and will guide him when his mind was in other place, like right now, he had picked up a toothbrush and toothpaste, tried to start brushing his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure it is a good thing or not, Carl decided to go with it, might turned out to be useful. Even though he now thought more than usual ever since he has Jacob's brain, it still doesn't meant he has more knowledge suddenly. \"If Jacob brushes teeth in the morning, then I brush my teeth in the morning. For I, am Jacob Harlan.\" Carl said to his reflection on the mirror, tried to have some fun from it. It may be years from his last time and different set of teeth, but the steps of brushing teeth came to him naturally, maybe that's one of the Jacob's muscle memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't usually took shower that often too, but there's some sort of urge that makes him wanted to shower now, as if that's the normal to him. \"If Jacob takes shower every morning, then I will take the shower.\" Carl striped his pajamas, continued 'his' morning routine by taking the shower, also took the chance to know his Jacob Jr.. It's not huge, but still larger than Carl Jr., and obviously no erectile dysfunction. Strange hand handled strange penis, but at the same time everything also felt so familiar and spiced things up a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning and pleasuring himself for 20 minutes, he then moved to the walk-in closet. He didn't have time to search through every cabinets last night, now he has. A person often judged by his appearance and what he wore, after went through every Jacob's clothes, Carl concluded that Jacob must be very old-fashioned, or dull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was 45, of course considered as old in young people's eye, but his clothes still seemed added him 10 more years older. Shirts, polo, ties, suit jackets, vests, sweater vests, khakis... it's like Jacob only wore formal clothes, and did not have wide choices of color. Carl did managed to find something looked casual, most likely are sportswear, but no jeans, not even one. <i>And is that fedoras like the ones Sinatra wore on the top shelf?</i> Considered what he saw, Jacob definitely not wore those fedoras for stylish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Carl was going to Jacob's work, he has to imitate what Jacob usually wore to work, so he thought he should wore something like what Jacob's wore last night. He picked out a long-sleeve light blue shirt, navy suit, and blue stripe tie. He saw some belts, but considered Jacob was wearing suspender last night, \"If Jacob wears suspender, then I... well, that's getting old.\" No pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJokes aside, though suspender seemed like piece of cake, it still took Carl some time to figure out how to wear it, and went through his yesterday clothes just to make sure no mistake. \"Ooh, there's X shape and Y shape suspenders; Ooh, there's buttons inside my pants.\" he said it with over enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he's not getting luck in tie section. He didn't know how to tie a tie before, and looked at yesterday's tie couldn't helped him knew the steps. And the harder he tried, the less that subconscious thing came to him. Getting nowhere, Carl tried not to lose his head. <i>Dodged bullets several times, but get beat down by a silly tie? No way.</i> Looked around, he saw the laptop outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hah!\" He walked to the laptop, open it. But it was password protected, 6 pin number. \"Password huh? Well, let's hope you're old fashion in this way too.\" Carl's no expert in computer, but some simple handling were easy enough to him, thanks to his dedicated porn browsing whenever he came across a computer. So he knew most people often used their birthday as password, and he knew Jacob's birthday. After trying several different orders of date combination, \"711208... Bingo!\" He's in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, searched \"how to tie a tie\" through internet was no-brainer, and now he has thousands of step-by-step pictures or instruction videos. Carl randomly picked one of the style, Windsor, and started followed the instruction. Maybe Jacob's body subconscious (or whatever it called) did helped, he learned very fast and has tied the tie nicely in his first try. He even added a tie pin that he found among other clothes accessories in a drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, he put on the suit jacket, pulled out the shirt cuff (one of the action he didn't realized he's doing it now but never before and why) and straighten the suit in front of a full-length mirror in the closet. Carl may not agreed Jacob's taste of style before, but now he knew it's actually looked good on Jacob, make him seemed reliable on serious business, and less belly. If a suit make the man, a tailored, expensive suit make a 5 man became almost an 8. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he admiring himself in front of the mirror, he heard a knock on the door just outside the bedroom, it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mister Harlan? Are you in there?\" A woman voice followed the knock. Carl half-panicked, not sure what to response. <i>Who's this woman? She called me mister, is she a staff of Jacob? Why is she here? Was she and Jacob would do something every morning?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" the woman knocked the door and asked again. \"Uh- uh, yes?\" It's not like Carl can hide and avoid all day. \"Oh, excuse me, mister. Your breakfast ready.\" She said. \"O- Okay, in a minute.\" Carl relieved that's all she had said. He feels hungry as soon as he heard breakfast, but there's something in mind to hold him rush out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back to the laptop, and start searching information about Jacob Harlan's firm. Can't know nothing if he tried to go to work there, like which building, what floor, what exactly Jacob does there. He found their website, with photos helped him identified the building, with address at least knew which floor, and under Jacob's introduction, seemed like he's in charge of... \"Real Estate Law Department?\" How come Jacob was only in charge of minor department?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father was the founder, currently in charged of Harlan and Sons' headquarter, located in other state. His brother was with their father, in charged of Criminal Law Department, which the firm best known for. And yet Jacob has so different treatment, in charge of Real Estate Law in their division. Was Jacob an outcast? The rotten apple in his family? Whatever, Carl thought it's a good thing, because he won't have to face Jacob's family on work, less people he have to act around. But was that also mean Carl's miserable life has nothing to do with Jacob?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much else to know, Carl closed the laptop and decided it's time to go downstairs. He picked up wallet, phone, and other personal things, opened the door, and saw a woman in maid uniform standing at the side. \"Morning, Mister Harlan. Sorry to disturb you like that, it just usually you were eating breakfast downstairs by now.\" Said the maid, while she took a look at what's Jacob wore then choose a pair of leather shoe from shoe rack at the side to match his outfit, and helped Carl wore it. Carl then remembered he left his shoe outside the room last night, which must be cleaned and put back in the rack by the maid, but more importantly, he didn't even aware he did that last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy what the maid said, looked like Carl has spent more time than Jacob usually did. \"It's okay, thanks for remind. Wouldn't want to be late to work, would we?\" Carl responded with a smile while walking towards the stairs, not sure if he overdone this small talk than Jacob before. \"Of course, sir. Have a good day.\" the maid didn't sound surprised, then she walked into Jacob's bedroom. She must be in charge of room cleaning too, Carl thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl already smelled the food half way through the stairs. It's not the first time Carl stepped in Jacob's kitchen, but under the bright sunlight, everything looked clearer than last night, and he's impressed by how good the quality. The wooden chair, the marble table, some high-tech stove that cook things without fire, and some decorations either antique or artsy.  He glanced outside the french window, there's also some people working on the pool and yard, waved at him when they saw him stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a man in chef uniform standing next to the stove, watching the TV news. \"Morning, sir.\" he greeted at Carl as he saw him walked to the dining table. Carl nodded then sat in front of the meal. Seemed like Jacob is not a harsh boss, the staffs seemed relaxed around him but also respected him. But also not a very friendly boss, the staff may make small talk, but leave him alone most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl surprised that the breakfast was less and ordinary, like some typical diner's meal, came with salad, scrambled eggs, sausages, beans, and a disgusting green-color juice. The fact that rich people like Jacob preferred ordinary food too, make Carl felt connection to Jacob over this little thing. Sure, he still rich enough to hire a chef to make all these instead of eating at diner. He thought since Jacob has chef, he would ate something fancy, something Carl never ate or even knew how to spell. And the other thing is, it's clearly not enough to fill Jacob's stomach. With that green juice as a clue, was Jacob on diet? Well, Carl can't suddenly changed Jacob's menu if he want to stay low by act like Jacob, so whatever it is he better finished it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... the specialist said, the meteor's radiation was very low, the neighborhood should not be worried... \" Apparently the reporter in the TV was talking about last night. Carl began to absorb his food while distracted by the news, didn't even realized his mix and confused eating manners in other people's eye. Like, he did put napkin on his laps gently, something he never did before; then he cut his food sometime small to chew lightly, sometime big and try to fill up his mouth like savages, at the same time he's somehow managed to avoid getting grease on his clothes. He never bothered dirt on clothes that much before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...a man who claimed he saw the meteor before they retrieved, said the shape was nothing like rock, but a square beaming object.\" The news continued, Carl's appetite still strong. \"... but the spokesman of the institution has denied they obtained any sort of alien object.\" Of course the government will try to cover it up, Carl not surprised but this time he quite supported them. The less people knew about that strange object, the less worried that people will found out his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of news were nothing notable, the meteor didn't even make the headline, just a local news among many others, and the chef sometime added some personal opinion to make some conversation. Suddenly, Carl was interrupted by the phone ringtone. He picked up the phone, it's not someone call him, but just an alarm that Jacob set to ring on 9:30am, with a word 'Work'. Jacob must be very care for punctuality, now his habit helped Carl followed his schedule easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl haven't finished all his breakfast, but he had to stop and prepared to work. He went cleaned himself a bit by the sink, the chef took this moment to confirm if he should prepared dinner for his employer tonight. Carl not sure but he said yes anyway. Then the chef said goodbye to him as Carl walked out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl saw there's another maid standing at the front door, holding Jacob's briefcase and newspaper. Carl walked near her, adjusted his tie through a mirror by the wall. By now it's already the longest time record of him wearing a tie in his whole life and still counting, he didn't felt uncomfortable but a bit irony. He always mocked those guys that wore suit and tie to work, now he's getting used to be one of them. He took the coat from the rack and the briefcase and newspaper from the maid. The maid opened the front door for him and wish him a safe trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl remembered where the garage remote control was, he took it out and opened the garage door then jumped back in the car he already familiar with. Up until now, his mind still split. He can either went to Jacob's work and see will he come up with a bigger plan, and he has Jacob's phone and notebook (he found in the briefcase) helped him knew his schedule for the day; Or he can have fun in someplace else since he has Jacob's credit card, and no one in the firm dared to question Jacob's, a partner of the firm, absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time to make up his mind.</span></div></div>",

What kind of criminal are you if you let go the big fish?</i> Carl convinced himself once again. <i>Even getting suspicious, nobody would ever thought such strange power involved! They ain't gonna catch me no more!</i> He took a deep breath, set up the GPS, then drive off to the road. Accepting whatever the next challenge will be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road became more busy as he drove into city, to keep the frustration from traffic jam away, he tried to read some pages of Jacob's notebook in between time. He found it from briefcase, along with a pair of reading glass that Carl naturally put it on when he tried to read. This body subconscious thing still spooked him a bit. Anyway, Carl's happy to see how methodically Jacob was, he keep track his schedule in it, and other important notice too. On today he has a meeting with someone, maybe clients. Carl haven't thought of how to face them or avoid them for now. Tomorrow he has an appointment with barber. Seemed easy, but no address or the barbershop name in the note. Then Saturday has golf, Sunday nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's after 10, His car finally get near the building where the GPS took him, he circle around and found the car park. The guard saw the car and opened the gate without question, let him went straight in. By now the car park was almost full, but just as Carl expected, Jacob has his own parking spot with his name plate. He got out of the car once parked, put on the coat and take the briefcase and newspaper. It's still chill in April's morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked into the building, standing in security line like others, take the pass in briefcase and scan like others, follow the crowd to elevators, like others. If people who knew Carl can recognized him here and now, how very blend in he can be among ordinary people may shocked them more than his shapeshifting power. There's a floor guide near elevator, Carl found out the firm at which floor. There were some people greeted him on his way, and make way for him to go in the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you, sir.\" a young fella holds the elevator door once they arrived the floor. Carl felt excited and nervous. The first challenge will be finding Jacob's office. There's many people walking around and busy working, he can't looked around like he's first time around here, but then the firm is big and he's not sure which way leads to Jacob's office. He took out the phone and pretend to look at it and walked slowly, that way if he walked into wrong direction, people would think it's because he's too concentrate on the phone. In the mean time he can also tried to unlock the phone, not surprised, Jacob's birthday came in handy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few wrong turn, he found Jacob's name on a corner office. A young secretary has her table just outside the office greeted him when she saw him came, he immediately thought something dirty on her. <i>Rich guy with pretty secretary, maybe she and Jacob already in 'office romance', let see if I can get lucky today.</i> But for now he just walked into the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office is big enough, and the view outside the windows was spectacular. There's bookcase with a lot of thick book in it, a wooden table with computer and stationery on it, some chair in the center of the room, a sofa, a coat rack he had put the coat on, some plants and decorations, very antique style. Another prove showed how Jacob is so old-fashioned. There's a closet with some spare clothes, and a door leads to personal restroom, no, bathroom, it has shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door startled him, he quickly sat on the back of the table and answered, \"Come in.\" It's the secretary with a cup of coffee, she put down the coffee on his table, \"As usual, sir.\" \"Thank you.\" Carl pretend to be busy reading the newspaper. The secretary doesn't seemed to send sexual signals. He peeped at her tight covered butt through newspaper as she walked out, felt disappointed. <i>What's wrong is this Jacob guy? Never hit on that thing before? What, was he... gay?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis assumption never occur to Carl until now. This morning he only had time to browse the firm website, doesn't said much about Jacob's personal life. It's time for another internet search. He opened the computer, also password protected, but this time birthday combination doesn't worked its charm. The security was tighter since it's company's computer. Carl thought for a while, took out the notebook again, he remembered he saw something like password in it. And he's right. No matter how tight the security, it's always easier to hack through people's laziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob even has some social accounts kept logged in too, save Carl a lot of effort. He looked through all of them quite fast, because Jacob didn't actually put much time on it. His status was single, didn't followed much people, replied a few comments, liked some common articles, no selfie. It's not surprised people like Jacob didn't rely much on internet social. Carl still can't be sure his sexuality, he couldn't describe what his feeling now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary came in again later, with lots of paper and files, \"Mister Harlan, here is the contracts that need your signature. Please have a look. If anything else please let me know.\" She put them on the table, then smiled away. <i>Whoa, is that what Jacob do all day? Meeting clients and sign contracts? He didn't even have to write or say any lawyer term?</i> Of course the real Jacob would have to read those paper thoroughly to check, but no way Carl's gonna read them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSexuality aside, now Carl focused on figuring out how to fake Jacob's signature. He checked every drawer, and found some document clearly with Jacob's signature. Now only need some practice, but Jacob's signature even better than Carl's handwriting, not an easy job for Carl. Before he started, a knock on the door distracted him again. But this time that person on the other side of the door didn't wait Carl's respond, he straightly opened the door and let himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked younger than Jacob, thinner, shorter and wear smarter, look much sunny, sharped and energized than Jacob. Carl happened to see his face this morning, but couldn't remembered his name. \"Hey, Jake. Heard you came in late today, well, late for your standard.\" He lie down on the sofa, \"Having fun on the blind date last night?\" Carl was accessing the firm's website, and find the page where he saw this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, Mike, she left early because of family emergency.\" Carl said. Michael Stewart, a partner of this division too, in charge of Criminal Law department, and quite surprisingly, same age with Jacob. Since he addressed Jacob in nickname basis, Carl think they must be more than just partners of a firm, may be friends. He didn't know what the blind date he was talking about, but since Jacob was alone last night in the store, the date must not went well, also explained his temper then. And he tried to slip 'she' in the conversation to see Mike's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? Keep that up, I started to wonder whether are you purposely sabotaged these dates. I mean, with your wealth, at least you can get some one night stand, how many YEARS since you got laid last time? Before Obama? Or...\" Mike kept talking. Carl kinda relieved that now he knew him and Jacob shared same sexuality. He didn't interrupted Mike, the less he engaged the less he said something wrong. He used the time to learn Jacob's signature, he's not a quick learner, but thanks to the subconscious thing again, he mimic it successfully only after a few practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I mean, you had let go of your ex-fiance thing already, right? Sure she's almost conned her way up just for your money, estranged you and your family, which by the way, you wouldn't have met your savior, me, if you didn't came here.\" He smirked. \"But shouldn't years of therapy sessions healed your fear-of-women phobia already?\" Suddenly Mike answered so many questions in just a few sentences. So that's why Jacob has ring mark but no ring, why the guy has everything but girls, why he worked here but not with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still too soon? Jake?\" Mike noticed Carl, the man he think is Jacob, didn't respond the whole time, thought Carl mad at him joked around his life. \"Yeah, it's only noon, my 'savior'.\" Carl still shocked of what he learned, but tried not to show on his face and pretended to read a contract. \"Oh you poor thing, how about some drinks, my treat. Any plan later?\" Mike stand up. \"Well, a 2 o'clock meeting.\" Carl remembered from Jacob's notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave it to your underlings, that's why we hired them. You know you don't have to supervise everything, right? Have some faith in your employee.\" He continued his persuasion, \"And you are a partner in here nonetheless, who else you still have to prove? If you don't exercise your rights once in a while, you gonna make other partners look bad.\" Mike was such a bad influence for Jacob, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer was very tempting. Mike's not only provided free drinks, but also an excellent idea to avoid the meeting he don't know how to handle, and  perhaps he can get more information about Jacob from Mike. But on the other hand, the meeting aside, Carl assumed Jacob was not a person who will ditch the work, accept this offer may make him look less in Jacob character, something that he somehow started to care.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay.\" Carl accepted. \"Really? Finally!\" Mike invited Jacob several times, but Jacob always chose work. They only knew for few years, they have very different personality, but somehow they became friends. It's harder to make friend when you're in higher place, people always seemed to have some agenda when they get close to you. So Mike very valued Jacob as his truthful friend, seeing his friend working so hard, he always tried to help him lighten up as much as he could, not because of he's boss' son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mike would never thought that the Jacob sat in front of him now was not the friend he knew, even Jacob/Carl unearthly agreed to ditch work now, he thought it just his effort finally moved him. \"It's a date then, don't tell my wife. Pick you up at one. No back out, or I will be seeing you in court.\" Mike added, feared that his friend might changed his mind later. \"On second thought, tell Amy. She wouldn't believe me if I told her you finally ditched work and drank at working hour with me.\" Then he walked out of Carl's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the schedule has changed, Carl thought he should gave instruction to his employee. He doesn't know which button on the phone can called the secretary, so he walked out and asked her to come inside. \"I have to leave early today, something important came up with Mi.. uh, Mr. Stewart.\" Carl said to her. \"So about the 2 o'clock meeting, could you tell others to handle by their own?\" He took some risk and assumed Jacob is not the only lawyer who will attend the meeting. \"Alright, sir. Have fun.\" either the secretary was eavesdropping, or Mike's a big mouth. Carl chuckled as she walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill has some time to kill. Carl signed all the paper, not gonna read them. Beside sweet sleep last night, he finally has some time to really relaxed his mind since all these bizarre things happened. He stood in front of the windows, hands on his hips, looking at the skyline outside, his heart still pounding from all the new things. He couldn't help but to admit, he's kinda enjoyed being Jacob Harlan. The revenge plan became less and less in mind by now. He stretched his suit, adjusted his tie and collar, feel the fabrics again and again. He's not become obsessed about suits, just that this is a simple way he can feel everything still very real, not a dream. <i>Was it worth to destroy all this good things for some revenge if instead I can enjoy them in a long time? I could do much worse than Jacob Harlan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to think maybe he shouldn't waste this opportunity, a complete makeover of his life. Jacob's body was not in best shape, but Carl's old body wasn't good either, he could start working out if he want; Shoving Jacob's work to his staff and signed, doesn't seemed hard too; He could spend Jacob's wealth not necessary as Carl, and less risky if as Jacob himself. Of course he no longer seen his own face in reflection, lost about 12 years of his age, but what goods had came out from his old life? What else would he missed? No family, no friends, many enemies, poor and miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of old life, the real Jacob would  eventually showed up. Maybe no one would ever believe him, but he could still caused some troubles. Even he can find someone to stalk him, then what? Kidnap and send him far far away? Threaten him not to come near him? Or... make him 'disappeared'? Although Carl has been a criminal in most of his life, he never killed a man before, that's his bottom line. So, until things got completely out of control, Carl won't considered that, even if he can hire people to do the dirty work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock knock, you ready?\" Mike showed up right about time, seemed unusually excited just for a drink. Carl also happy to finally get a drink too, it's almost a day since his last beer, if he's still in his old body he will start to withdraw. But he already assumed Jacob is not an enthusiast, so he has to dial down the excitement, \"Let's get it over with.\" Carl said plainly while put on his coat and pick up the briefcase. \"Admit it, you're excited too. I can see it in your face!\" Mike patted Carl on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out of the building, Mike led him to a car with chauffeur opened the backseat door for them. \"Wait, what about my car?\" Carl asked. \"You didn't have driver, we're going to drink, and you want to drive yourself home after? I'll take you home, and tomorrow give you a ride, how about that?\" Mike suggested, Carl nodded. \"Since we're on the subject, what's the deal with you didn't want a chauffeur, and only has one car? Saving money for your future kids college fund?\" Mike continued, Carl wondered too and gave the best excuse he can thought of, \"I like to drive. And I haven't expand my garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was not far, the car stopped in front of a restaurant only a few blocks distance from the firm. It's lunch time, tables almost full but Mike has booked a booth. The waiter gave them menu as they sat down, Carl couldn't believed the price, even he can afford now. He ordered a steak, and Mike ordered something in french and a bottle of wine. \"Didn't you said your doctor wants you to take care of your cholesterol or something?\" Mike always found something to start conversation, \"Well, I... uh... the doctor said I can reward myself once in a while.\" Carl\u2018s wittiness helped him a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next two hour, they ate many courses of meal, drank many wines. Although Carl preferred beer, the wines are not bad too, maybe because Jacob's tongue more familiar with wine. Mike carried most of the conversation, and the wines, during the time. He complained but not really complained of his family, accidentally revealed things about Jacob, talked about games last night, something and someone at work. Carl mostly pretend to concentrate on his meal, part of him didn't have to pretend too because of light breakfast this morning, but he also chipped in the conversation sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bottle turned to a few bottles of wine, Mike's drunk. Carl didn't drank as much as Mike, feared he might said or do something stupid if drunk, but he's kinda impressive that Jacob's body can handle liquor better than his old body. \"Never seen you drank that much, t- thought you can't hold up like me.\" Mike surprised too but not suspected, he stopped drinking once he noticed he's drunk, it took a lot of self-control to stop at his drunken stage. He paid the check with huge tips and then they walked out the restaurant. Carl has to support Mike to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, Amy will k-kill me if... if she sees me like this.\" Mike suddenly mumbling something after the car started to drive. \"Robert, t- take us to Jake's house first.\" \"Yes sir.\" Robert the chauffeur replied. \"Jake,\" Mike then turned and looked at Carl with goofy eyes, \"this- is important, let me stay a few hours in your house to- be sober enough.\" Nope, not self-controlled, turned out he's just whipped. \"Fine by me.\" Carl's tried to be a good friend like Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's after five when the car arrived at Jacob's house, Carl and the chauffeur, Robert, carried Mike to the front door. A maid opened the door, \"Good to see you, sir, you're home early. Oh, what happened to Mister Stewart?\" \"Drunk. Anything in the house can help him sober up?\" Carl told the maid while he and Robert took Mike to the living room. \"Yes, we have, sir. Let me get it for you.\" the maid quickly ran to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert put down his master gently on a sofa, then he said he will be waited at the car. Carl followed him to the front door, as he opened the door, a woman was standing right in front. The woman make way for Robert to get out. She's a very fine looking woman, young, long blonde hair, wore sexy but not hooker like. She waited the chauffeur walked far, then turned to Carl and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hello, Mr. Carl Edwards.\" She said with a smile. \"Wha- What did you call me?\" Carl panicked. He never met this woman before, even if he did, how did she knew he's Carl when he looked like Jacob? Who is she? What did she knew? How did she knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, we both know who you really are, Mr. Edwards. \" She's still smiling, like no big of the deal, \"I will explain everything, if you give us some privacy, like, send your staff home.\" She's alone, her body much smaller than Carl's, and her clothes didn't seemed to able to hide any weapon. Carl thought a while, then he told the maid who just gave Mike some medicine and towel, \"Something came up, I need you and others leave early today, clear the house now, come back tomorrow.\" The maid worried, but Carl reassured her it is not something bad, she hesitated but off to tell others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff said goodbye to Carl hurriedly, the chef even left a half-cook fish on a pan. As soon as the last one leave and closed the door, he went into the living room where the woman was waiting. He saw her hold something like lipstick and sprayed some purple mist on Mike's nose, he inhaled. \"What are you doing?\" Carl's too late to stop her. \"Some precaution, making sure he's asleep and won't wake up anytime soon.\" The lipstick thing disappeared from her hand when Carl\u2018s not looking. \"Done? Talk.\" Cal's mind was in a whirl, he needed answers very much, very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut to the chase, huh? I like it. First, let me introduce myself. My name is Alice, I'm what you human called an alien.\" Carl didn't expect he really got a straightforward answer, also a very out of space answer. \"Alice is the name of this body I copied.\" She pointed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl didn't know how to react, his face very blank. \"You shouldn't be so shocked, after all, you think the device you touched that granted you these abilities can be earth made?\" Her voice sounded sweet the whole time, but her words make Carl uneasy, \"Let me start from the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been hundred of years since life form from outer space come visit earth. Aliens from different planet, with different technology. Of course we don't call ourselves aliens, just wants you to understand easier.\" She added. \"We have rules not to disturb the under developing planet when visiting. Aliens come here because of different reason, from research to vacation. We have authorities in charge, giving something like visa, not like anyone can come and go anytime and do whatever they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we are not saint, having advanced technology doesn't mean we won't make mistakes, things happened, good or bad. Whether is trying to take over your world by using secret weapon, or accidentally leave marks on desert. We are much advanced than human, but we can't undo time. Yet. If happened, happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still do damage control. Some may never even heard as rumors, some make a huge part of history of your world, depend on how far we handled.\" Carl interrupt her, \"You mean... kill everyone who's involved?\" She laughed a bit, \"Depends, some aliens are aggressive, mines are not. The rules are flexible once thing already happened, any trick will do as long as not making another chaos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While we here, we have several options to blend in or hide among human, transformation device is one of them. It's a hot selling item in our planet, very suitable for people who want to come here for vacation.\" <i>Buy now for only $29.95, tax not included.</i> Carl added in mind. Though everything he heard was way over his head, but getting answers helped him calmed down, even can jokes around a bit, \"Long story short, one of our people accidentally dropped his device to the earth, we traced it back to you, and here we are. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you mean the device transformed my body? But I didn't took it with me, and the transformation didn't took place around that device.\" Carl responded honestly, no point to lie. If she's the enemy, she didn't have to explain all this to him. \"Ah, that's one of the reason why we approach to you rather than just kill you in the sleep.\" She said what he thought out loud, a scary coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said just now, different planet has different technology.\" She started another explanation. \"Our technology, is a combination of science and what human called, magic. Those elements of magic exist in earth too, but only a few human know how to use them, and mostly used it on spiritual thing, what a waste if you asked me. For us, we found a way to combine both. We extracted them, learned them, controlled them, used them, but we didn't fully understand them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the part we find it fascinating. The device was malfunctioned after it fall from such altitude. But when you touched it, somehow the magic elements transferred into your body. The device was designed for us, nothing like that ever happened to our people. We think it's because human and us have different body structure, so it affects differently. We analyzed your body last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! what the fuck did you do to my body?\" Carl complained. \"Yeah, we actually found you last night, after we retrieved the device and replace it with a rock before more human saw it. Following the trail of the magic element to this house was quite easy, even if you can't see it. We waited you to sleep and scanned your body, nothing harmful. We also extracted your memory and pieced everything together. That's why we know who you really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, nothing unusual other than the magic element in your body, we didn't find the answers we're looking for, like how did you control and use it without the device. It took some time for us to decide whether or not to ask your cooperation for further study, then we waited until the timing is right to contact you with less witness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal. We have bureaucracy too. The permits to do experiment on human is hard to get in a short time, but if we can make it as a cooperation, sign a deal for win-win situation, it could makes the paperwork move faster and easier. The deal will be like allowed us to monitor your power in action, take anything necessary for research but won't harm you in any way. At the same time, we provide anything we can for you if you need anything, keep you safe and not disturb your any action, unless it could kill other people. If the research caused human dead, the authority has the power to shut it down. We could be banned from earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's hand suddenly appeared a device that looked like tablet, \"Here's the details, put your palm here if you agreed the terms after you read it.\" Carl took over the tablet, saw the deal was written in English, but he's lazy to read it. \"What if I said no?\" Carl only curious about this. \"Well, either wait for permits to abduct you, or we will try to extract all the magic element in your body, and wiped your memory about all of this. To be honest, the element has become very attached to your organs, we can't 100% sure if we get them out by force, you will still be alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't sound like he had a choice at all. Carl's mind filled with confusion and chaos, but he's not stupid. Without much thought, he put his hand on the tablet. Alice took the tablet back, checked it, look satisfied. \"Sorry we don't have time to prepare a celebration ceremony. Now, since we have a deal, can you demonstrate your power for us the first time?\" Alice suggested. \"Us? But I only see you.\" \"Oh, we had put surveillance around you and your places, other than the bedroom, my colleagues are watching us this whole time.\" <i>So they knew I will say yes eventually. Asking me was just some formality.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can try it on this man.\" She pointed at Mike, who still sleeping on the sofa. \"He won't remember a thing in this condition. Or, do you have someone else in mind? We can try to get him, or her, to you.\" Carl didn't expected she will offer him something like that, \"Didn't you mentioned before something like aliens are prohibited to involve in human world?\" \"Yes. Here's a little tricky, we can't, but you can. Those rules don't applied on you, since you are human. We simply provide 'material' you requested like in the contract, what you did to the material is out of our hand, as long as you didn't kill them.\" Her smile turned sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued, \"Before you said you want president of your nation or someone like that, we are not able to just kidnap anyone too. We can't let human sees us, every kidnap must be discreet. Those alien abduction story you heard are bad examples, if we want to abduct human, no one would ever suspected. Your world nowadays surrounded many surveillance system, especially the man in higher power has more security. We can zapped the person in a second, but if the person disappeared an hour or so, may become national security issue. So let's be real on your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl remembered the first time he shapeshifted, it was painful. If he wants to use it now, he needs some time to rest before another transformation. So the choice of the next person is important too, he wants to stay as that person for a couple of days. Mike's not a bad choice, he saw his beautiful wife's photo, he had know little things about him through the lunch, sure he has a teenage son who hits adolescence maybe a downside, but overall his life can considered better than Jacob, and he's here already. But on the other hand, it is the opportunity he can choose someone else who he can't reach easily, maybe from other state or even other country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your decision is?\" Alice asked again, Carl's answer was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's getting dark outside, Carl didn't noticed until Alice mentioned it, \"Look at the time, I hoped we can finish our first test before bedtime. We have to sleep and rest too.\" He couldn't think of any other names in the short time, and Mike's not a bad choice and available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I start, I have a question.\" He stand next to Mike, \"Is my power has a limit amount to use?\" She thought a while, then said, \"The device can recharge itself by collecting the same magic element from air, apparently so do you. This planet has the magic element, and from what we checked last night, the element in your body has lots more than one device, your body must be absorb them from air too. I think it's safe to say you can do many times, as long as the magic element still exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" He touched Mike's face with his glowing finger, \"That's it? For device, we need to scan the man first, choose options from screen and so on. Maybe you scanned him through your eyes, then triggered it through that glowing part. It's like your whole body is the device.\" She observed him excitedly. \"Next will be painful.\" Carl took a deep breathe, his voice started to change. \"The first sign is voice changed. Ah, I can see the element become active.\" The tablet appeared again, looked like she used it to record and scanning Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the pain start, Carl can feel his bones moving, muscle squishing, similar yet different than last time, he's shrinking rather than expanding. Even though Carl was not surprised this time, that doesn't mean he can bear it, he couldn't help to drop down on the floor groan and scream. \"Interesting, the device will gave us something like sedative so we won't feel a thing during transformation, too bad your body didn't absorb them from the device.\" She didn't freaked out by Carl's reaction. \"And please lower your voice a bit, the driver outside could hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain came and gone all so sudden, \"About 2 minutes.\" Alice counted. \"Enjoyed the show?\" Carl pants a while, then stand up. His new height was actually about the same as Carl's own height, but switching from Jacob to Mike, he felt weird instead about became shorter. The Jacob's suit he wore was now oversize for his new body, shoes too. He didn't feel any beard on his face, and his body more flexible and firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a mirror and look at it, no doubt he's now Michael Stewart, dark hair, blue eyes, aquiline nose, square chin, an exact replica of the man who lay down on the sofa, except clothes. He even felt more dizzy than when he's Jacob, because Mike was drunk at the time he transformed to him. But he's sober enough to notice something's not right, something didn't happened like last time. \"Uh, Alice? Something's wrong, my clothes didn't changed like last time by some grey smoke, you said I have enough power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice put down the tablet, said \"About that, we kinda expected. You see, the grey smoke you saw is other material, not magic element. It works like 3D printer in your planet, you know, the printer that can print out any shape of object? The material is similar but more advanced, not only we can use it to form clothes and some other things, it also can change to be same material as the object, like wool, hair gel or makeup. but it has its limitation, it can't duplicate if several different objects was packed together very close, like wallet. The device can't scanned through too much layers very well. Also it can't duplicate some metal materials, because they required more components.\" On her hand a small grey slime appeared, \"And one device only fill with this much of that material, for about two pairs of clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer why your clothes didn't change this time, it's simply because your body has used all the amount of the material you had in your first time transformation, with you and with Mister Harlan.\" They picked Carl's memory last night, of course they knew what happened to the real Harlan too. \"It's one of mystery we're looking to find answer too. Here, I want to try something.\" She give the slime to Carl, Carl hold it on his left hand, not sure what to do. They silenced a while, nothing happened. \"Huh, I thought your body will absorb it automatically for refill.\" She took the slime back, \"Maybe try some other ways later, definitely not by eating it. Our research said the material is like poison to human.\" Carl afraid to ask what research is that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, less convenient from now on, I can live with that, just strip and switch clothes.\" As long as the transformation power still work, Carl won't mind a little complication, \"What next? Want to see me change that man to Jacob Harlan?\" \"Sure. We can't do experiment on human, but you can, that's why we have the deal.\" Alice said. Before Carl want to touch Mike again, he almost forgot, \"Wait, I can't change him like this, Harlan's body size will rip his clothes. Help me strip him first.\" Alice agreed, Carl turned off the glow on his finger, they took off Mike's suit, shirt, pant and everything, Carl hesitated if he has to touch Mike's underwear, but Alice strip it without any blush, sometime she act like human, sometime reminded him she's totally alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's watch.\" Carl touched Mike's with the glowing finger. It's the first time Carl can see how transformation process. \"Do you notice the colors of your finger's glow are different? For you to change, it's yellow, but the second time that you change other person, it's light orange.\" \"Really? they looked the same to me.\" Mike's snoring turned to moan then scream, his face fill with pain. Carl covered his mouth by hand, at the same time he can see Mike's naked body start bloating, his legs stretching, beard appearing on his face... About 2 minutes later, the transformation finished, a naked Jacob Harlan was lying on the sofa, and he's awake from all the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice quickly spray the purple mist on Mike again, before he saw too much he's back to sleep again. Carl relieved. \"Fascinating! The device can stored up to two body's record data, for you is one you touched, one is your previous form. I wonder if your two continuous touch were not on the same guy, what will happen?\" Alice's back to research mode again, she scanned Mike with the tablet, \"Huh, same as Mister Harlan. Strange.\" Carl don't know what she mean, \"You mean Harlan that look like the real me now? You guys have checked him already? What strange common do they shared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice explained again, \"The device is not just cloned exactly of that person, but is the better version of that person. Like if that person has high cholesterol, the device will reduced it. But it didn't make you immortal, maybe you will be stronger, healthier, but you still can catch a cold, you still bleed if someone stabs you and you could die. Your body has that same effect, if not, the steak you ate at lunch would gave your stomach a hard time, Mister Harlan's digest system is not good lately.\" So they'd been followed Carl all day, not surprised. \"And didn't you curious that you're not as drunk as Mister Stewart? It's because you can handle more liquor in the better version body of him. But those effect didn't seemed to appear on Mister Stewart and Mister Harlan, they stayed the same as the person they become. Like this guy who become Mister Harlan now, his must not feel so well of his stomach, luckily he's asleep right now. Or Mister Harlan who become the real you, he has inherited every disease you had before.\" Carl listened, but he has other things in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl think it's time to proceed his next step he had planned before he changed to Mike. \"Well then, that's all for today, am I need to change everything back?\" He asked. Alice figured out his has an agenda, \"What do you have in mind?\" Carl insinuated, \"What if I say I want to stay as Mike? One painful process is enough for a day, I'm not a big fan to feel it again in a short time. What would you gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't make the decision by myself, please hold on.\" Alice lowered her head and talked in a low voice, must be discuss with her colleagues through mini walkie-talkie. It ended pretty fast, she raised her head and said...</span></div></div>",

I heard you said you can extract memories, right? Does the machine can do more than that?\" That's what Carl after. \"Yes, we have a machine that able to control memories of human, we rarely use other function unless necessary... I see where you're going with this, but we can't do this for no reason.\" Alice sound rejected, but she winked at him, Carl knew what she wanted to hint. \"But I can.

I think this can count as research too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strong argument, sir.\" Alice acted so surprise, \"Since we had promised we provide everything you need, if you insist, we will help you. \" Another tablet-like device appeared on her other hand, the screen has some sort of alien language, \"Let's called it memory device. It can do several things to human brain, the screen can play what memory you like to see, you can copy, alter, even wipe people's memory, no physical harm. Let me show you how to use it, you don't even have to know how to read our language.\" She put the device near the head of Mike, \"First choose this and get close to the brain and wait for it to scan, then you can choose this to view, this to store, this...\" Carl very concentrated on her teaching, he never learned something so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's see, first I copy and stored Mike's memory, then I choose this to wipe his memory...\" Alice stopped him, \"Actually, you can just choose wipe, the system will stored a copy before wiping, as a precaution.\" They treated Mike's brain like a teaching material. \"That's it, see, now Michael Stewart's whole memory was now only available in this device, the brain in this body is completely blank, even babies knew more than him now. You can stored up to two person's memory in this device.\" \"Why only two? You mentioned the transformation device can store two body too.\" \"You think the data of a person's body and memory are little? It should be very impressive that the devices this small can store not one, but two person's data. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you can see Mike's memory whenever you need, helped you live his life.\" Alice thought that was Carl's plan, but Carl wanted to go further. \"Not exactly, I don't want to take out the device every time I need to know something about him. I want to put his memory into my brain so I can use it easily.\" Alice's face was less cheerful as she heard him. \"Isn't that how you can act like human too?\" Carl curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence, then Alice finally said, \"I can act like human is because I have been stay here for years, learned the language by myself too. And the transformation device helped too.\" \"Wait? The transformation device?\" \"Yes. you know what is subconscious? The human body has something like that too, like you don't need to think how to breathe, how to walk. It's not just stored in your brain, but every cell of your body. Our body structure is very different from human body, but with the help of the subconscious, we know how to walk with two legs almost instantly after transformed into human form. And that's all we needed.\" It also explained some of Carl's act before, like how he tidy up the suit, learned how to tie a tie very quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for knowledge and cultural behavior of human, it's either take a long time to observe and learn, or use this memory device as shortcut. But there's a catch. When the memory inside your brain, it became you mind.\" Carl didn't understand, \"So? You gained that person's knowledge and memory easily, how's that not a good thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how can I explain it... Have you ever thought how to define you are Mister Carl Edwards? Your appearance? Your mind? Your life? Now that your appearance has become Michael Stewart, how do you so sure you're still Carl Edwards?\" She looked serious in this subject. \"Because my mind still is Carl Edward's mind.\" He answered. \"Correct, and also the soul if you believe in spiritual thing. But even with your own memory, you can't recall every memory too, right? Some fuzzy, some only remembered in certain situation, some you even had remembered it wrong. By using the memory device, other person's memory will be mixed with yours in your mind. The line that separate which memory is yours, which is not, will become harder as time goes by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm pretty sure my life is very different than Mike's, I think I would know which miserable life is mine.\" Carl still don't understand why she so serious about this. \"You would think so. But here's another thing: what shaped a person's mind?\" Another philosophy question. \"Erm... Experience?\" \"You are smarter than you look. Every knowledge you learned, every event you experience, every decision you make in your life, shaped up your current mind. Like you learned criminal is bad, but you chose to be one anyway, then your mind always in criminal mode. When you saw an old lady with bag, you would think how to snatch her bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, let say Mister Stewart was a gentleman, and his knowledge, past decision and experiences had now been mixed with yours. When you saw that old lady, you may think something like helping her instead of robbing her. In the times you won't aware, his memory will affects your mind, especially you are using his brain. Mind can be affected by brain too, let me simplified, some physical part of brain can makes a man more cheerful, some makes a man less caring about others, even a person's IQ has related with brain structure. You think the real me is also cheerful? It's only because the brain I duplicated affects my thinking a little. You're under influenced too, you just didn't realize it.\" Carl actually did noticed, like he thinks more than ever before, way more, when he's Jacob Harlan. But he didn't want to admit she's right, so he said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice continued, \"You live his life day after day, every reflection you see is Michael Stewart, you use his memory more often, you think like him most of the time, the Carl's part was less used so it starts fading. People forgot things they didn't use often so easily. Then one day when you walking down a street, suddenly you remembered you have been here before, but you can't be so sure the memory was came from yours, or Mister Stewart's anymore. Eventually, you'll start to think: 'Am I really Carl live in Mike's life, or Mike that has some imaginary memory of some guy named Carl?' See the different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're exaggerated.\" Carl still doubted her. \"Suit yourself.\" Alice knew she still can't talked him out, but she has to add one more thing before she gave up, \"But we lost some men over this before. We have so different life than human, like the planet we live is complete different view than any earth place, so it should be easier for us to separate memory. And yet after some of us received the human memory, they abandoned their true self after stayed too long. Which is why we are not using this device as shortcut anymore, even though it can separate your mind with others, but you would need time to back to yourself. And you and that person are both human, I think you may be easier and quicker to get influenced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we won't know unless we try.\" Carl won't changed his mind. Alice sighed, \"If you really gonna do this to yourself, can you do it later before you may forgot who you are? Since you have the memory device, we have something to ask for your help.\" \"Sure, what is it?\" \"We want you to take care of...</span></div></div>",

Although no one will listened to him thanks to your reputation, he's still an unpredictable timed bomb.\" Alice said, \"You can replaced his memory by a copy of yours, he will live as Carl Edwards from now on.\" \"Didn't that will make him knew about all of this?\" Carl asked. \"Silly you, you can wipe some of your memory after you gave it to him, like cut out these two days memory. People like you won't even find it strange to lost two day's memory, right?\" Carl can't argued with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan. So, where is he?\" It does sound good that he can get rid of Jacob, Carl didn't like that he have to be always beware that Jacob will suddenly come find him. \"I will go and bring him here, we can transport any distance in a second, but we have to wait no witness. My colleague who stalked him now says he's in the subway, full of people, it may take some time to find the timing. See you later, partner.\" Next thing he knew, her body glowed and disappeared in a second. Carl still a little surprised after he saw that many alien devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike still sleeping in Jacob's body, doesn't know his life gonna changed completely. Carl went to kitchen, got a glass of water from the sink and drank it, washed his face, now Mike's, tried to sober up more. He still wore Jacob's clothes, the oversize suit looked silly on his new body, his hands kept slipped into sleeves, luckily his pants didn't dropped because of suspender. He thought about used the free time and changed into Mike's clothes, but then something else in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike will receive Jacob memory in order to have him live as Jacob, but shouldn't it will be hard to explain why he lost two days memory? Unlike Carl's life, Jacob's was important enough not to find out his lost time. Alice did taught him some advanced function to edit memory instead delete, he can make Jacob's these two days memory looks normal, but... maybe there's another way, a very different way. He's not sure if he's think straightly or the alcohol, the plan he conceived was crazy and unnecessary, the aliens might not agreed. But if succeed, he may needed Jacob's clothes again later, so he decided not to change for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA phone rings interrupted Carl's thought, he followed the sound, turned out it's Mike's smartphone in his pants. Carl took it out and saw it was Amy who called, Mike's wife. \"Hello?\" Carl thought answering it would be less suspicious, beside, he is Mike now, sort of. \"Mike, Where have you been? I didn't remember you said you have dinner or working late today.\" Amy sounded worried more than angry. \"Oh, uh, me and Carl had a few drinks this afternoon, Carl's drunk so I had to help carrying him home... Honey.\" Carl don't know how Mike called his wife, a common 'Honey' can't be too wrong. \"Really? Harlan's drank at noon? I want to know everything when you're back.\" Amy has her doubt, added, \"I hope it's soon.\" \"Of course, dear.\" Carl started to understand what whipped felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited a while, walking around the house, when he's about to go into the reading room, he saw a light flashed in the kitchen. He went back to kitchen, saw Alice and 'Carl Edwards' was here. He looked panic, of course, \"Whe- where am I? Wait, I know this place... It's my house! But h- how? Who are you?\" Alice didn't say a word, just smile. Jacob, in Carl's body, no longer wearing last night torn-up clothes, he's wearing Carl's other jeans and only shirt, he seemed to try to put some effort on his appearance, but still far from Jacob's usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked around, and when he saw Carl walked in, he thought he found his savior, face filled with hope, \"Mike! It's Me, Jake, Jacob Harlan!\" Then he remembered he didn't looked like himself now,  \"Plea- Please believe me, hear me out first! I'm really your friend Jake! \" He sounded almost crying, Carl couldn't believe he can saw himself as a wimp, but at the same time enjoyed to see Harlan's helpless reaction. Carl act serious and said: \"Calm down, Mr. Carl Edwards, calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm not Carl Edwards, I- I'm not this guy!\" Then Jacob noticed something's wrong, \"Wait, how- did you know this name?\" And then he also noticed that 'Mike' wore a set of oversized clothes, his face darken, a disturbing thought he try not to think right now, \"You- you're not Mike, are you?\" \"Of course I am Michael Stewart, a lawyer of Harlan and Sons, have a wife Amy and a son Adam. And you are Carl Edwards, Jake told me the incident he had last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop call me by this name!\" Jacob almost broke down. Carl couldn't help but to continue teased him, maybe it's how Mike's brain always worked, always wanted to joke around. \"Jake won't lost temper like that, and if you said you are Jake, then who's the guy sleeping in the living room?\" Jacob went into the living room as soon as he heard what Carl said, then back to kitchen with frowned face shortly after. \"I- I- I-... it must be some sort of magic! Or curse, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carl tend to play some more, Alice interrupted them, \"We don't have whole day, Mr. Edwards. Can we start now? Want me to put him to sleep?\" Carl stopped her from spraying the purple mist, \"Before that, I had to confirm one thing again: you guys really give me anything I need?\" Carl asked. \"Yes, under our restrictions and laws.\" \"Then, let me handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl turned to Jacob, \"All right, no more jokes. Yes, I'm the real Carl Edwards, the 'Jacob' you saw in the living room is the real 'Mike', and I know who you are, or were. And I did all this.\" Jacob's pupils dilated, \"So it was you!\" \"Before you want to punch me or something, hear me out first.\" Then Carl briefly explained what he knew in these two days, what Alice had told him just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can reverse what you have done? I can have my life back? I give you anything you want, just tell me!\" Jacob's hysterical. \"Didn't you hear what I just said? I can get everything by myself now, thanks to my friendly ally and their alien technologies, why do I want to change back. By the way, Alice, meet Jacob. Jacob, meet the alien.\" Alice held up her hand waiting to shake hands, but Jacob has other thing to concern, \"It's your device that cause this, can't you make everything back to normal?\" He started to beg, this time is to Alice. \"We can, but we won't. For now. We just closed a deal with Mr. Edwards, he's kinda in charge of everything related to this incident. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was one step to breakdown, he felt on the floor and mumbling, \"Why... why me...\" \"It just bad luck to you. But I'm not stupid, I won't miss the chance to change my life. You've been live as me for one day, surely you know what I mean.\" Carl didn't even have to lie. \"But... but you can find someone much better than me and Mike! There's people who wealthier than us and doesn't need to work, or someone younger than us, or more power among society...\" Jacob began hysterical. \"You're right, I not planned to stay as Mike forever, once I got bored I will seek next target. But not now.\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... what are you gonna do to me?\" Jacob finally gave up. \"We're planned to make you become Carl Edwards completely, which mean you won't remembered yourself as Jacob Harlan. Then Mike will be you completely, and I will be Mike.\" Jacob's face distorted as he heard what Carl said. \"But, I can make you an offer.\" Finally Carl began to share his plan. \"What offer?\" Jacob clinging to his last hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my sidekick.\" Carl didn't let him hang. \"What's that mean?\", \"I'm confused, Mr. Edwards.\" Jacob and Alice almost spoke out simultaneously. \"Well, you're the only one other than me that knew this whole thing. And I want an audience, or someone who know the situation like I do to talk to. Another human, I mean. Alice, considered this as a therapy for my mental health, a way to release stress. Also a human accomplice can help me a lot too.\" Alice wanted to said something, but eventually she just shrugged and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, can I call you Jake? If you accept my offer, then I'll let Mike become me, and you can be Mike with your memory still attached, I will be you, we stay close from now on.\" Jacob didn't understand this arrangement, \"Why can't I just back to myself?\" \"Consider it a gift from me to you, let you know the good of my power too. I'll let you test drive a week, if you still didn't satisfied, we can discuss other arrangement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... that mean Mike will be the victim without any reason, and I will take away his life.\" Jacob didn't feel like betraying his best friend. \"Let me ask you, he'll not remember he used to be Mike, he will think he is Carl in his entire life, is that still Mike? If Mike's not the one who suffer, will he still considered a victim? And don't tell me you never jealous of Mike's life, his family, his wife... People always wanted things they don't have, and now you have the chance to get all you ever dreamed of. Tell me, are you that loyal to your friend, or will you seize the best chance you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob really torn. On one hand, he experienced only a day as Carl, and it already is his worst nightmare, let alone he has to live like that forever, and not remembered his real self, frighten him more than anything. On the other hand, he has the chance to back to a comfort life, even it's not his, but he has to betray his friend, and he still has to live as him, seeing him everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, your final answer is?\" Carl asked...</span></div></div>",

Or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl actually desperately in need of a partner, but the real reason was he can't completely relied on alien partner if anything happened, so he wanted a human partner. And even though he's a criminal, he knew a good person is best candidate as accomplice, more loyal and obedient once they are on your side. As for his intention at the beginning, he saw that seeking revenge was so wasted of what he can achieve now, he's ready to put all hates behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed. You have nothing to bargain for, yet you still want to help out your friend.\" Carl said, now he wanted Jacob more than ever, seeing his loyalty to his friend. But Carl believed people can't resist their primitive desire. \"Alice, how many times I can transform in a short time, right now?\" he asked. \"With my calculation, about five times.\" Alice answered honestly. \"That would be enough. Wanna see another experiment?\" Carl headed to living room as he talked, and waved them to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stood next to Mike, \"Well, Jacob, let's shake hands.\" Jacob pulled up his hand hesitantly, \"Why?\" Carl's finger glowing, but Jacob didn't noticed. \"For our new partnership.\" Carl said as he quickly touched Jacob two times while shaking hand, then he touched Mike two times too. \"What do you mean? And what are you doing?\" Jacob back away a bit, Carl didn't answer him but turned to Alice, \"Let see if can I changed three persons at the same time. Put Mike to sleep again after.\" Carl's voice change as he talked. \"We never did something like that with the device, but I'm curious how your body handle it too.\" Alice took out a tablet and scanning again, \"Wow, it does seem the magic element has divided into three of you, and... start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jacob wanted to ask some more, pain filled every inches of his body, the familiar pain that changed his life forever last night. His muscle moving, bones restructuring, hairs growing, teeth shifting, and more other irregular movements. It was so painful he fainted out last time, but this time he refrained himself not to lose conscious under this situation. He glanced, saw Carl and Mike also under transformation, Carl didn't looked as painful as he is, and Mike's reaction most surprised him, screaming and crying like... like a baby. Alice covered Mike's mouth, as she making notes by narration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pain gone shortly after, unlike last time, Jacob still felt dizzy. Though he hasn't felt like that in a long time, but he knew what it is, he's drunk. He tried to stand up, he noticed he didn't gain height, but the clothes was tighter, because he's more muscular and fitter now. His figure was not Carl anymore, but he's not back to himself. He looked at himself in a mirror and confirmed his worry, the face he wore now is Mike's. He looked around to find the man that did this to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl took more time to finish the transformation than before. By Alice's observation, it is because Carl first transforming back to himself, but on the halfway through, he's changing again, and this time transforming into Jacob completely. \"I'm kinda hoping you would became a mixture of both man, like has four hands, four legs and such.\" Alice said something horrified with calmed voice. She had put Mike back to sleep, who now became Carl. Carl didn't 100% sure he can pulled this off too, but he can't risked to expose himself to Jacob if he turned the second time with Mike and Jacob's watching aside, so he had to try if he can do all this at the same time. He's very lucky that everything went as he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you do this to me?! I already said no!\" Jacob shouted at Carl, he shocked himself a bit when he heard Mike's voice came out from his mouth. \"Because 'no' is the answer I'm looking for, I won't want a partner who will betray friend if things gets hard.\" He actually lied a bit, he already decided no matter what answer Jacob gave, he will forced this plan to him. He didn't have friends to help, Jacob is the best candidate from the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What done is done now, what are you gonna do?\" Carl, now back to Jacob's body, stood up and stretching his suit that fit his body again, tidying up the mess he make in the process of transformation while talking, \"Kill me? Or commit suicide? If you kill me as Mike, you'll make him a murderer, you will be in jail, his reputation ruined, his family will fall apart; if you kill yourself, your friend will have to stay as me forever, his family will be devastated. Needless to say, if you try to tell someone else about whole thing, they will thought you, or Mike in their eyes, has gone crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!...\" Jacob can't refute. \"Look, like I said before, just give it a week,\" Carl sweeten up the situation, \"And you can make sure your friend's life doesn't ruined while enjoy a bit, technically your DNA, your gene, the whole you other than mind are Mike's.\" Jacob silenced. With no other way he can thought of, Jacob has to follow Carl's plan, and whether it is reluctantly or not, deep down, he was tempted. \"I'll take your silence as agree, congratulation on joining this galaxy family.\" Carl pointed at the pile of Mike's clothes, \"Now, if you don't mind, take off your clothes and change into Mike's, we don't have much time, 'your' wife called. And I need to scan your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob didn't move, struggled a while, \"What? Still feel weird to see yourself?\" Carl holding the memory device near Jacob's head. Jacob mumbling something like \"You're not me\", then started to strip off his clothes. \"Not yet, but I'm about to be. And you will be Michael Stewart soon. Let's see, scan completed, first copy your memory... Hey, I mean fully changed, underwear included.\" Carl saw Jacob started to dress shirt before changed to Mike's boxer, \"Do you think his wife won't recognize her husband's underwear?\" Jacob hesitated, \"But...\" \"But what? Shy because I'm here? Or shy to see Mike's penis? You have to eventually, I've seen yours, even masturbated.\" \"What? I don't want to know that! It's... because of her, Alice, she's looking at me.\" Jacob said. \"Oh? Don't mind me, sir, I'm alien, remember? I'm not really woman. And I've seen many naked human bodies.\" No blush on Alice's face, and apparently didn't plan to look away either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob can't avoid the embarrassment, so he speed up his moves, changed underwear as fast as he can, even though it felt so weird wearing someone else underwear which was wore by that person a few minutes ago. \"All right, memory copy completed.\" Carl didn't stop operating the tablet. \"What are you doing?\" Jacob asked while continue dressing. \"This is a device that can get and give people's memory. I've just copied your memory into it. Now I will try to give you Mike's memory.\" \"Wait, I really can still remember who I am?\" \"Yes, don't worry, although this is the first time I use this thing.\" Carl didn't want to mention what Alice said before about memory confusion, and Alice didn't said anything now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" Carl pressed on the confirm button, the tablet shot a beam to Jacob's head, Jacob stood still, nervous of what will happened to him. But he felt nothing even after the beam was gone. \"How do you feel? Anything different? Mike?\" Carl asked. \"No, nothing really.\" Jacob answered. \"Let's try something. Remembered our lunch?\" \"Ya, I had foie gras and you ordered steak.\" \"How many bottles of wine we've drank?\" \"Five I guess, I'm still a bit dizzy, you should've stopped me.\" \"Have you noticed you referred yourself in Mike's place this whole time?\" \"What's wrong with that, I am Mi...\" Jacob froze and swallowed the rest of the word, he almost lost himself, that scared him the most in these two nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm Jacob... of course I'm Jacob.\" He said it mostly to himself. \"Welcome back. What happened in your mind?\" Carl has to know what consequence he will faced. \"I don't know. I didn't feel strange to recall this afternoon as Mike, I know who I am exactly once you pointed out. But just now, I really thought that I am Mike and I'm talking to my friend Jake. It switched so smooth and natural, as if I'm both Jake and Mike at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl kept quiet, let Jacob sort his mind. It's Carl's turn to receive Jacob's memory that he copied just now, but seeing Jacob's reaction, he may have to consider what Alice said was true: received others memory will affect him. But he needed Jacob's memory to live a week, and Jacob still able to remember back who he is after all, maybe he won't be lost like Jacob, maybe his mind was stronger than Jacob's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl must decided quickly, it's almost 8pm, they have to wrap things up as soon as possible. Should he use the memory device on himself or not? </span></div></div>",

Using other person's hands had make him a bit clumsy, but his moves were a lot smoother after receiving Mike's memory, like he always knew how to use proper strengths, but Jacob didn't notice this small change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl decided to complete Mike's transformation first. He scanned his own brain into the tablet himself, then copied all his memory. He cut out these two days memory from the copy, make sure the copy doesn't have anything start from seeing the meteor. By now Jacob has finished up his look, with wedding ring, wallet, and other Mike's possessions. He looked at himself in the mirror again, this time with Mike's clothes. Carl knew his feeling, confused and excited, but Jacob maybe also has a bit guilty about his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you finished, dress Mike with your previous clothes.\" Carl said. Jacob followed order without hesitation this time, he knew there's no point to show disregard by the time he dressed himself as Mike, whether he wanted or not, he is an accomplice now. Carl finished memory edit, then shot the beam to Mike's head. \"How do you make sure he won't remember he's Mike?\" Jacob asked while busy and a bit embarrassed of dressing up other guy. \"Easy, I had cut out his Mike's memory instead copy, his brain was blank. And since the memory has transferred to you, you are the only one that has Mike's memory. Now he had received my memory, without these two days memory, he will think he's Carl without knowledge of all this. In conclusion, he is Carl, you are Mike.\" Jacob didn't feel much conflict as he heard Carl called him Mike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, how did you get these clothes from my place? I don't think I have my current address in my wallet.\" Carl asked after the beam was stopped, and he then helped Jacob dressing Mike. \"I... er... I'm not sure. I woke up in the hospital this morning, freaked out, but I pretended I'm all fine, checked myself out. I had no idea where should I go, just wondering the street while dealing a lot of questions in mind. Before I realized, I was standing in front of an old apartment building, and when I walked up the stairs and corridor, somehow I knew which door I could open. This is where I found some least dirty clothes that I can changed into.\" Carl knew what he experienced, but he can't explained the subconscious thing like Alice, so he just listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can't find any food, I have no money, yet I found a subway pass.\" Jacob continued. \"Yeah, I stole it some time ago.\" Carl added. \"Anyway, I used it to came this neighborhood, but I don't know how to approach, and I knew that my look will get attention if I stayed too long around here. So I decided to back to your apartment, at least less cold than outside before figured things out. You know the rest, I got kidnapped by alien.\" They finished dressed up Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl asked Alice to transferred Mike to his apartment, and put on a surveillance for caution. \"I can't put surveillance, but-\" before Alice finished her sentence, Carl continued for her, \"Yeah yeah, but I can, because of galaxy law's loophole. Jake, watch the house, we will be back soon.\" Before Jake wanted to protest that this is his house, Alice started the transportation, a bright light make Carl shut his eye, and when the light gone within seconds, he's back in his hellhole. The mess, the smell, the dirt, all same as before but he felt more disgusted now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice handed him a small device, it's like a camera and instructed Carl to put on the ceiling. Carl did as she said, the device stick and became invisible. They put Mike on the floor, Carl looked at his body one last time this close. Some might thought something like 'life sucks, but better sucks in own life', those people must be never tasted how low can life be. Carl couldn't wait to ditch his old life, not a single thing he will missed. \"Push this button, this will cancel out the sleeping mist.\" Alice took out the spray and aimed at Mike's nose while teaching Carl, this time it sprayed yellow mist, \"We better leave now, he could be wakes up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another light, Carl and Alice were back to Jacob's living room. Jacob put on a smile when he saw them, but froze as he found that odd too. Carl figured out what could it be, \"Thought happy to see your friend Jake again for a second, weren't you? MIKE.\" Jacob didn't opposed, Carl smirked. \"How's Mike? Is he really fine?\" Jacob tried to change subject. \"Let's see, here's the monitor.\" Alice took out another tablet thinner and flexible than previous device. The screen showed Carl's apartment, Mike has woken up, mumbling \"Fucking headache.\" \"I thought it's still fucking noon.\" \"How the hell did I came home?\" and something like that while walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob didn't feel any relieved when he saw Mike's reaction, Carl noticed his sadness, \"I bet Mike never cursing like that, right? He's Carl Edwards now, and he won't recognizes you or himself, he won't upset about what he missed, because he didn't remember a bit. Let him be, that's Carl who live in Carl's life, not Mike.\" And it's time for Carl to become Jacob Harlan too. He turned off the screen for not to let Jacob lost into his guilt, and took the memory device to start operate. Then a beam shot into his head, there's no turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seemed like everything's in place, Mr. Edwards, I'll leave the rest in your hands.\" Alice said, but it took Carl a moment to realize she's talking to him, he's Mr. Edwards, \"These devices are solar-charge, don't let them fall into other people's hand.\" \"Sure, I won't.\" Carl answered politely. <i>Maybe I can use these devices to help Mike escape... No, that's Jacob's thinking!</i> Carl almost drawn into how Jacob thinking as Alice continued, \"I won't meet you often, but you can call us anytime, just shout out. You're under surveillance, but we leave some privacy in this house, like bathroom and bedroom. I think that's about it, goodbye, Mr. Edwards.\" \"Goodbye, Alice.\" Carl being very polite again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice disappeared in a bright light, Carl turned to Jacob and said, \"Well then, you should head home too, Mike.\" This time, he called Jacob as Mike was not joking around but a sincere mistake, that's how confusing. \"Amy called, remembered? Better get our story straight. I told her that you and I were drinking and I'm drunk, so you carry me home.\" Now's a mixture of Carl's memory with Jacob's concern for his friend. Jacob looked at his watch, he frowned, \"Oh my god, that late already? Amy's gonna kill me.\" Whether is the fear had put him into character or not, he had to face it as Mike anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob didn't want to waste time on clear up whose mind it is, he wouldn't want to worry his --Mike's-- wife. \"Don't messed up my life, Carl.\" \"Start get use to call me Jake, Mike.\" They walked out the front door, the chauffeur open the back door when he saw them. \"Well, goodbye, Jake.\" Jacob had to call Carl by Jake as a third person was around, but he didn't rejected as much as he thought might be, even a bit cheerful like Mike would do. \"See you tomorrow, Mike.\" And Carl responded like Jacob too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl closed the door as Jacob walked towards the car. <i>What a day!</i> Carl started to feel the exhaustion. <i>But haven't done much work today, I can squeeze some time to do before bed... Wait, what was I thinking?!</i> Jacob's workaholic personality slipped in. He also knew what works Jacob do now, and almost about to start making a schedule to catch up the work he left, no, the work Jacob's left today, but stopped as he realized that's not how Carl's think, no, how he think. <i>Referred myself as third person, first step to lose my mind.</i> It's only been less than an hour since he received Jacob's memory, and he already felt much more exhausted to keep separate his and Jacob's mind. Maybe that's a good thing, he's living in Jacob's life now after all, <i>maybe I should go with the flow. It's getting late, let's keep the strength for tomorrow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put all the alien devices into his briefcase, luckily they all small enough. Then he ate some cookies, he knew exactly where they were, as simple dinner. He took the briefcase and went to bedroom, and started to put things to where Jacob always put, like jacket to hanger, watch and wallet on cabinet, phone on the counter at the side of the bed and charging it. And then he took a bath, unlike last time, he didn't find it strange to see his naked body, and his cleaning process was different too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's 9:30pm only, he didn't changed to pajamas after bath, instead of polo and khakis, added the suit jacket if still felt a bit chilled with the heater. Even nobody's watching and only some times left before bed, Jacob still wore decently at home. Carl couldn't bothered much anymore, just went with it. But when his mind tried to tell him to work, he fought back and went to living room to watch some TV, he can finally relaxed after the tense of these two days, he deserved to enjoy an hour or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being couch potato for only an hour and half, Carl went to bed at 11pm as always, well, as Jacob always. He couldn't even resist to read the novel Jacob's been reading before sleep, wanted to know what happened next to that John Dempsey guy. Jacob always favored military thriller novel. This might be the first time Carl ever read a book very concentrated. Then sleep before midnight on time. Jacob might already felt bored to his life, but Carl tasted for the first time how organized life can be, <i>I have to admit, not so bad. Not bad at all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the ups and downs of Carl's life, turned out all he ever wanted was a normal life, like most people do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Carl followed Jacob's behavior, more sufficient, more spick and span than yesterday. Like he knew what sock garters are and put it on, he found the look without pants was kinda funny for a second, but then thought it is necessary for hold up socks and he stick to it; or knew to use beard care product, wore cuff links for some shirt, a handkerchief in pocket. Those little things he missed yesterday, but now he knew exactly what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff of his house might thought their boss a bit weird yesterday, like late to work and let them home early, but today they got the usual Jacob Harlan back, like did everything on time and ate elegantly, that's how great job Carl had done. And he's at work early like Jacob usual did, greeted his colleagues by their names on the way to his office. He started to work after reading newspaper, another thing Carl never read before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drafted some paperwork, read through documents, ask his lawyers about progress of yesterday's meeting, calling clients, confirmed next week schedule with Jen - his secretary. He knew and spoke the legal terms like he's been learned for years. He didn't even felt like pretending the whole time, surrounded with the atmosphere that's more familiar to Jacob, had amplified his Jacob part. Of course he also felt fresh or weird or surprised of what he's doing occasionally, but the Carl part was definitely appeared less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't saw Jacob, as Mike, the whole day. Mike usually would visited Jacob's office to chat with his friend two or more times a day. Now that Jacob was Mike, Carl understood why he didn't followed this Mike's behavior. He even went to barber alone followed Jacob's schedule, usually Mike would happy to tag along just to sneak out from work. Mike's very good at his work, just sometime behaved like child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl came home after work, did everything like Jacob would in front of his staff. But as soon as they gone, Carl tried to find himself back after being Jacob the whole day. He used the free time when Jacob would did some more work to do things he like, called it Carl Time. He won't admit what Alice said about memory-affects-mind thing, but after whole day being Jacob, he's not that stubborn anymore. He must at least take some time to do something he liked, to remind himself who he really is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it's Friday, Carl decided to go to a bar. He drove to a bar at downtown he heard but never went before, a bar that sold $4 beer at $15, but that's not a matter to him anymore. Jacob not a fan of beer, which is why his house didn't have any. And that's why Carl eager to find some beer, because that's also mean this is definitely his own decision, not Jacob's. But he still gave in on responsibility, only drank enough to still able to drove back later. And Jacob's low confident stopped him hitting on girls too. Well, two days without beer, he might as well enjoyed his beer alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golf event was in a country club. It's about business, making relations with clients and lawyers, exchanging information, discussing about finance and other topics that can bored Carl to death, while playing a little golf. Jacob's memory also told him he's bored too, but he had to do it for work... <i>Wait, I could just choose not to come in the first place?</i> All too late now, at least Jacob's memory helped a lot the whole time, like who he knew, what to say, where to go, how to golf. Carl did enjoyed sometime too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob came too, he greeted to Carl like Mike usually did to Jacob when in public, but he still tried to avoid Carl as much as he can. Carl didn't forced him, but now he can observed him in short distance, seeing him interact with other people, Jacob definitely done a great Mike too. Jacob's not bad in socializing, but he's not as good as Mike. Make people laughed, knew the timing and mood, Mike can easily be the center of the crowd, which is what Jacob achieved now. But Jacob's not the only person he observed, Carl picked out candidates of his next life too, making a list in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to bar at night again. This time he hit on some women, awkwardly. He's not good at it while he's still Carl, he's terrible now added Jacob's fear of women. Apparently Jacob's ex-fiancee/con artist left a big scar in his heart. Carl did tried to thought about it, but all he got was sadness and almost cried out loud. Jacob still has some feeling for her, but Carl swore he's not gonna let this ruined his sex life, he would get what he wanted eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday came, Carl went to the mall shopping. He bought some clothes he like to wear when he's himself, like jeans, but also suited for Jacob's look. He didn't plan to stay as Jacob for long, but he thought these little change would helped him stayed Carl. He also bought a small bag for the devices, easy to carry around. He also tried to find next body in the mall, teenagers, happy family, or picked by appearance, doing that let him figured what he really wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday, Carl went to work as usual. <i>Huh, 'as usual'. Only five days and I already adapted this lifestyle as my own.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost surprised was, Jacob came to him. \"Hey, Jake, got a minute?\" Jacob entered his office and said in Mike's lively tone, while the door still opened, can't be too cautious. \"Morning, Mike.\" Carl said in Jacob's tone. As soon as Jacob closed the door, he tuned down his Mike's characteristic, \"Carl, right?\" Not sure why he asked that, \"Yeees?\" Carl responded with curious. Jacob seemed relief from what he was worried, then lay on the couch like Mike usually did, but quickly stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything wrong?\" Carl stopped his work and asked. Jacob's face, or Mike's face, showed some fear. \"I, er... I don't know where to start,\" Jacob sat on the chair in front of Carl, \"You know the memory thing? It's convenient, too convenient. These few days I acted like Mike, live exactly as Mike. And sometime... most of the time, I forgot who I really am. I thought I can differentiate whose mind it is, but Mike's life took over me. I become more chatty, I like to watch sport games, I write left-handed, I...\" Jacob hesitated, then continued, \"I had sex with Amy.\" Amy was Mike's wife. \"Whoa, tell me everything.\" Carl teased him. \"It's not funny, I had sex with my friend's wife! I know it's wrong, but it's our- no, their routine, and I- she- I- \" \"You gave in Mike's mind at that moment, doing his duty as husband.\" Jacob can't argued with that. \"Look at this way, technically your body are Mike's, so the sperms you produced should still be Mike's if she conceived.\" \"You sure?\" \"Try not to overthink it, just enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I know what you've been through. I constantly lost in your mind when around people too.\" Carl tried to change subject so Jacob won't stayed guilt, \"So I've created a Carl's Time, doing my own thing during that. You can try for yourself.\" \"But I always surrounded by people, colleagues at work, family at home. It's 24/7!\" Jacob still a little frustrated. \"How about this? Mike always come by to this office. You can use the time as Jacob's Time.\" Carl said. Jacob considered Carl's suggestion a while, \"I supposed I can. Seeing myself might be a good reminder too. Sorry I avoided you before.\" \"Oh really? I didn't noticed.\" Carl said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuesday to Thursday, Carl's life didn't have much to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl done the work well like Jacob, and Jacob started to come by often. Sometime they talked, making actual conversation, not just about their extraordinary experiences, but also something work related, and, since they shared the same Jacob's mind but different on the extra, they shared opinions on small topics too. They interacted like friends, there were times they were accidentally called each other 'Jake' and 'Mike', and most of times Jacob carry the conversation, like Mike always did. Sometime Jacob just read the novel he hadn't finished when he's himself. Jacob didn't brought up his and Amy again, seemed like sex had overpowered guilt, he's still a man after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Carl's Time, Carl either went to bar, or watched TV, he still has to fight his mind over bringing work to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday, the one week deal was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sat down with Jacob in his office in the morning, they didn't called Alice to this meeting, she didn't showed up in the whole week either. \"So, how's the weekly experience, satisfied?\" Carl asked, Jacob didn't answered, but he didn't denied too. \"Still wants your life back? Or taking our partnership to next level?\" Carl asked again. \"What exactly is the next level?\" \"To be honest, I haven't decide yet. We can be anybody, but I haven't figure out what I really want.\" Carl didn't lie, \"But I knew you want to be in military. We can do that first if you want.\" He has Jacob's memory, and his nightstand novel was an obvious clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's face blushed as someone else has said out loud the wish he had in deep mind. When he's young, he even planned to join the military, but of course his parent wouldn't allowed and sent him to law school, and he caved in. Now his dream can finally came true, though a bit cheated with Carl's power. At the same time, he also knew how dangerous will be, he's not acted by impulse like teenager anymore. And speaking of teenager, he has someone else in mind too. And, he also kinda missed his old dull life too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's answer was...</span></div></div>",

I'm just one of the lowlife in hundreds of cases.\" Carl didn't surprised, \"The firm takes pro bono case, right? Few years ago I was represented by Rick, you know, Rick Anderson under your- Mike's department.\" Jacob nodded. \"I was facing burglary charge, the evidence was not solid, but he advised me to take the DA's deal, said the DA might have found hard evidence. So I took the not-so-good deal. Much later, I found out the DA didn't have new evidence like he said, he just helped the DA in exchange of favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you were guilty, right?\" Jacob interrupted. \"Maybe, that's not the point.\" Carl continued, \"I have every reason to hate Rick and this firm for sold me out. I thought of using your identity to ruin this firm as soon as I found out who you are. But the thought faded in these couple days. Yesterday I met Rick on the way, we even make some happy small talk. With my power, I can ruined his life easily, but I'm not gonna waste time on getting even.\" There's a thing that Carl left out, he also thought it's Jacob's mind affected him to be less vengeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to enjoy life from now on, but less work. Your life's fine, but you're too dedicated to work, I'm still amused now, but I'm not sure I will after long time. Maybe find a life that's no need to work at all, and can travel around the world without any worry. I have many ideas but couldn't decide which to focus. Since I'm not in a rush, if you have something, or someone in mind, I can follow your plan first. Maybe after experienced some more different life, I can know what I really want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether feeling guilty or not, Jacob did enjoyed these last few days. His friend, Mike, has what he always dreamed of, a family. But that should be over now. And since Carl offered, why not took this opportunity to live another dream? \"Well, I... uh... I did thought of try military.\" Jacob said in almost whispers, but Carl happy to hear. \"Then settled, let's go play soldiers.\" By now, Carl knew his has succeeded in luring Jacob to his side, even Jacob didn't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... in my Jacob's mind, I knew you always like Navy, right? What rank do you want? Commander? Captain? Maybe even different country's Navy?\" Carl started to plan. \"I'm more interested in lower rank, do the works first hand.\" Jacob joined in. \"Still workaholic huh? I thought Mike's laziness might rubbed off on you.\" \"What's the point if not enjoy the procedure? By the way, how do we do it? It's not like we can kidnap them from the base.\" \"About that, we have friends, alien friends, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jacob raised his head and called out Alice name. After few minutes, Alice did appeared. \"Hello, Mr. Harlan, Mr. Stewart. Nice to meet you again.\" She might thought that's hilarious by calling them the body's name. \"Yeah, yeah. Look, can you snatch some people for me?\" Carl didn't want to waste time to that joke. Alice kinda disappointed that they didn't fall for that, \"Other than the real Mr. Stewart, no can do.\" The answer shocked Carl, \"What?! Why? You did took Jake to me before, why not now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't just kidnap human, we're not that kind of alien who ignore the law. That time with Mr. Harlan was just because he is already involved. Mr. Stewart is same too. As for someone else, we can't.\" Alice said calmly. \"So... even for research purpose, you still can't help us get any people?\" Carl asked again. \"That's right. Apply for human snatching will be a lot of paperwork and take months.\" Alice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, now you telling us.\" Carl sighed. He and Jacob silenced, thinking what's the next move. \"How about change to someone else.\" Jacob opened his mouth first, \"I always want to be young again.\" \"Young, like teenager? Or child?\" Carl intrigued. \"Teenager, of course. Don't you ever wish to go back to the time when what you worried most was asked the girl out and homework?\" Jacob said, \"Well, you know my past. My boarding school life wasn't that interesting, maybe this can be my second chance.\" Jacob started to excite, \"We can sneak into some college party, after they were drunk then we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" Carl interrupted, \"You can just switch with Mike's son, Adam.\" Jacob gazed, then suddenly jump up and higher his voice, \"You can't do that to my son!\" Then he realized what's wrong in his saying, and slowly sat back down. \"Calm down, don't let Mike's instinct control you.\" Carl and Alice were a little shocked by his reaction. Mike must be a good father. \"Sorry. Even so, Adam is my friend's son.\" Jacob tried to sound calm. \"Unless you planned to sabotage his life, what's the harm for a few days? He's the easiest target we can find for now, you can switch with his friend later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's strong fatherly protective aside, Jacob knew Carl has the point. As Mike, he can make some excuse to take 'his' son to work, then they meet up with Carl and let Carl do the rest. Quick and easy. Adam's not a bad choice too, maybe a bit younger than planned. He attended a private school, he's not geeky like Jacob was, but he's not some famous jock either. He didn't have a girlfriend, not that Mike knew of. He's a good kid, though lately he didn't talked much about his life to his parent, but that just maybe adolescence. Mike and his wife respected their son's privacy, but sad about growing distance as he growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacob's mind being taken far from the point by Mike's affection, Carl didn't have the patient to wait for his answer any longer, \"So? Are you in?\" \"Huh? Yeah, I guess.\" Jacob back to earth, \"How about you? It will be weird if 'Jake' meet with his friend's son so often.\" Carl thought of that too. There are a few people around Adam that he can choose, the easiest one will be Mike. Or Robert, the driver, but definitely not other house staff, too much work. Or... Mike's wife? Carl not sure if he wanted that much life experience... or is he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's answer will be...</span></div></div>",

But promise me, after switch with Adam's friend, please let Mike back to himself.\" \"No problem, at least we can get him whenever we want,\" Carl turned to Alice, \"right?\" Alice smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to make a plan, and set the date on tomorrow, which was Saturday. Then continued the day as Jacob and Mike, and Alice back to wherever she lived. To commemorate the last day as Jacob Harlan, Carl was in full Jacob mode the whole day. He didn't questioned himself whether the thought that came up was his or Jacob's mind, he didn't bothered to correct himself when he really referred himself as Jacob Harlan. And after work back to home, Carl didn't went to bar or watched TV, he done some more work in study room and finished the novel. He even wore a shirt and a sweater vest instead of the clothes that he bought last Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day morning, Carl came to the firm. He went to Jacob's office as planned, and called out Alice to help. \"Good morning, Mr. Edwards.\" Alice showed up quickly, \"Are you sad to say goodbye to Mr. Harlan's life soon?\" \"Well,\" Carl stretched his arms, \"Not much going on in his life, but after living years of frustration, I do enjoy the normal and boredom. And... I hate to admit, but wearing suit and go to work everyday, weren't so bad.\" Carl don't know why, but he's more opened to Alice than he thought, maybe because Alice has feminine look. \"You know,\" Alice replied, \"we checked your past. Do you think the old you would said the same thing?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, is it your mind that came to this conclusion, or you're under influence of Mr. Harlan's mind?\" \"Slap 'I told you so' to my face, eh? Yes, maybe Jake's kind-heart makes me soft, but maybe that's not a bad thing. Why do I have to feel negative all the time?\" Carl admitted human minds are more complicated than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice just stood there and smiled, \"If it helped, not only human, all creature's mind are very easy to manipulate once you know how, there's no stronger mind so to speak.\" She changed the subject, \"Anyway, here's the things you asked for.\" She took out some capsules, \"These are our special painkillers, modified for human, won't cause delusion or sleepy or dizziness, but only affects 5 minutes.\" Then she took out a couple of ball-shape devices, \"This is the device that can cancelling noises. Put them on the walls, we'll create a sound proof room.\" The reason Carl asked for the device, was in case the painkillers won't work. Carl followed her instruction and put those devices on every corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Carl took out the memory device from the bag. This was the tricky part. First he cut out Jacob's mind from his brain, feared that the device couldn't differentiate his and Jacob's mind and took all his mind instead, even Alice has reassured him that won't happen. And he glad it didn't happened. Carl still has his mind after the process. He then tried to think something from Jacob, he still remembered some of what he learned from last few days, but other than that, completely clueless about how to do Jacob's work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the work's not finished, now he has to add and modify some memories of what he did as Jacob over the last few days, make sure nothing about transformation, make his and Jacob, or 'Jacob and Mike's conversation' looked normal. The device can do that, but that's not an easy job, even Alice was here to assist. Before he finished, he saw the doorknob suddenly turning. Jacob must be arrived with Adam. The plan was Jacob would signaled him as he arrived, but Carl didn't heard a thing this whole time. Luckily he noticed the doorknob, he quickly took out the sleeping spray and ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...come on in, son. This won't take a minute.\" Jacob said as he walked in. \"Hi, Mr. Harlan. How... wha... \" As soon as Adam walked in and the door closed, Carl sprayed the mist to his face before he can finished his sentence, then put Adam's body on the couch. \"Didn't you said you will signalling me?\" Carl asked Jacob. \"I did, didn't you heard?\" Jacob asked back. \"No!... Ah, must be the sound proof device, didn't considered that.\" Carl thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, \" Carl continued his work on memory device, \"I just finished the memory modification, let's strip all the clothes.\" \"Uh... before that, can you take out my Mike's memory first? It's so weird to strip own son, and his mind still shout out to save his son from this.\" Jacob suggested, \"And one thing I thought of last night, can you erased some of my memory too?\" \"I get the first point, but what's the second one for?\" Carl finished on memory modification. \"Well...\" Jacob felt too embarrassed, \"I er- I'm about to be Amy's son. I'm not comfortable to still have some memories that...around the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl knew what he implied, he laughed, \"Afraid of too much mommy issues for therapy? Fine, I will have it anyway.\" One thing he noticed when he's working on his Jacob's memory that cut out from his brain, that Jacob's memory also included the last few days that Carl became Jacob, but Carl still remembered what he did in these days. That means when he lived as Jacob, the memory was considered as belonged to both of them, which is convenient for him to know what Jacob did as Mike in these last few days too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCut out Mike's memory from Jacob was simple, and the work of erase certain memory was easy too, with Jacob pointed out the exact time, while he stripping down Adam's clothes. They didn't have much time, according to their plan, Jacob 'accidentally' forgot his phone in his office yesterday, so he came by to his office on Saturday when they were on the way to Adam's soccer practice, which mostly Mike drove and dropped him off. Then Jacob will take Adam along to the firm and met Carl, the rest were obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl put Jacob's memory into Adam's brain, then cut out Adam's own mind. But before he and Jacob each received Mike's and Adam's memory, he decided to make the transformation first. He and Jacob took off their clothes quickly, now we have three naked man in the office, luckily the office didn't come with transparent glass wall and the windows have curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take one, the effect will start quickly, \" Alice handed them the painkiller, and put one in Adam's mouth and make him swallowed. Carl and Jacob took it, then Carl work his magic finger, he touched Adam first, then Jacob. Like Alice said, this time they didn't feel any pains at all, but they still feel their whole body shifting, and they can watch the process. For Carl, like last time, he first shrink to be like Adam, but in the half-way he grow a bit and make his way to become Michael Stewart. For Jacob, he just shrink from Mike's form to Adam's, even though Mike was not very tall, Adam was still shorter than Mike. But without pains had its downside, they just stood there awkwardly, as the transformation continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, transformation completed. Carl familiar with Mike's body last time, but this is the first time he saw his naked body. He's not muscular, but still in good shape, especially in his age. And not to make competition on purpose, but with same height, Carl couldn't helped to notice Mike's penis seemed bigger than his old penis too. \"Can't believe you would gave up this body,\" Carl said to Jacob as he stretched his muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was checking his new body too. Adam has short hair like his father, blue eyes, and his father handsomeness but still boyish, he's not thin and on his way to be muscular, full of energy, in fact, he has an erection right now. \"Erm... are you sure you're into women?\" Carl noticed too. Jacob quickly cover it with hands, \"No, it's not that! Just- just- I was just a bit excited about this, but somehow...\" \"I think it's teenage hormones.\" Alice chipped in. \"Can you gave us some privacy or-or at least look away?\" Jacob wished she wouldn't be looked so interested on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get dressed,\" Carl said as he start put on Mike's clothes that Jacob wore just now, \"But remember, son, me and your mom will love you no matter what.\" He couldn't resisted to joke around. \"Well, jokes on you, you saw your son's erectile penis.\" Jacob fought back as he put on Adam's soccer uniform. \"And you saw your father naked!... You know, this is a battle with no winner.\" Carl ended the joke before it got bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished dressing up during the conversation, then Carl took the memory device, and shot the Adam's memory into Jacob's brain. Jacob's face expression from nothing to disgust, \"Ewww, I saw my Dad naked. No, Adam's Dad. Not quite right either...\" as Jacob confused about what to call Carl now, Carl shot Mike's memory to himself. \"Oh get over it, you're gonna be late to practice. Let's go, mister.\" Carl inadvertently slipped in fatherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him?\" Jacob pointed to Adam, who now has Jacob Harlan's appearance and memory, lying naked on the couch. \"Oh, I had put some memory about this. Make him thought he was about to take a shower but suddenly felt ill and has to lay down a while, explained why he's sleeping naked on the couch. Save our time to dress him too, just put his clothes in the bathroom.\" Carl answered while collecting the sound proof device and put in the bag, Alice agreed to lend this to him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything set, Carl and Jacob looked at each other, \"I know everything in this are weird, but become your son, become my friend's son, it's the weirdest.\" Jacob said. \"Let's hope you won't do something that make me ground you, son.\" Carl laughed. \"Whatever.\" Jacob shrugged, a typical teenager 'don't care the whole world' reaction. They said goodbye to Alice, stepped out Jacob's office, and began a new chapter of their life, or, as other person's life, again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the way to the field, Carl and Jacob were tried to adjust with their new roles. They discussed what the next step is, like picked out their next candidates from Adam's memory in Jacob's brain. But at the same time, as Mike, the father of Adam, Carl tried to know how Adam's life was too; And Jacob, as Adam, a 15 years old teenager, answered questions reluctantly sometime, and seemed more concentrated at his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Dad.\" Jacob jumped out of the car as soon as they arrived, \"Good luck, Sport.\" Carl replied, everything seemed so natural. Mike usually only dropped Adam off, and picked him up after practice. In between time, Carl decided back to his house, he knew Amy was at home. It's time he could finally has what he wanted after a long time, and he's not gonna felt any guilt like Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl drove the car, a Toyota sedan, as fast as he can without breaking law. Speaking of the car, he thought Mike lived luxury too, but now he knew he actually lived much more simple, even compared to Jacob. They have a suburb house in a good neighborhood, like old-time America dream, and also have a minivan for family trip. The chauffeur and the big black car were a show for work, held reputation of the firm. Mike and Amy did have lots of saving, but they choose to live like that, and thought that would helped their kid grew up more down to earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he parked the car, Carl hurried into the house. He went to the reading room, and there she was, his beautiful wife. Amy was grading papers, she's a lecturer in a university. \"Hi, honey.\" Amy said as she saw Carl at the door. Carl walked straight to the back of her chair, bent down and start kissing her neck. \"Not now, Mike. I'm busy. Can't you go do work out or something?\" Amy knew what her 'husband' wanted, though she said no, she didn't put a lot of effort on rejecting him. Carl didn't stop, and became handsy, \"I'm going to, and I inviting you to join me in some cardio exercise.\" Then he grab her hand and took her to upstairs bedroom, Amy let him and followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*          *          *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife couldn't be better for Carl after that, he loved how Mike lived. Mike's not uptight like Jacob, other than jog every morning and went to gym once a week, and went to Church every Sunday as Amy wanted, Mike didn't have much routines he stick with. He worked hard in the past, but now he's in charge, he wouldn't have to be workaholic anymore. Sure sometime the family argued over some little things, sometime work has crisis, but nothing can't be solved. Carl didn't really understood why Jacob would gave up Mike's life just because of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jacob, he's enjoyed being the son too. Adam was a good kid, grades not bad, about same height with his father but strong enough that wouldn't get bullied, has some friends to hang out. His school life was way better than Jacob had. And at home, at first it's strange that the woman who was his wife few days ago was now his mother, and he had to call a man \u2018Dad\u2019 when he knew his not his father, but he get used to it pretty quick. Jacob's family was rich, he have brothers to grow up with, but he never knew what family felt like. His parent always absent, he was sent to boarding school in young age, and now they estranged, only met on special day, not even birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso Adam was a single child, he got full love and attention from both parent, which sometime make him a bit spoiled and do stupid things, but Mike and Amy still raised him a lot better than most brats, so nothing terrible like drugs or alcohol, yet. Well, he started get invited to party ever since he joined the soccer team, the parent just have to keep an eye out. But now Jacob was Adam, Carl trusted Jacob should have better judgment for those things. \"It's hard to say, to be honest.\" But Jacob told Carl the other way during one of their father and son's gaming time when Carl brought up the 'don't do drugs' subject, while Amy's at reading room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I should be more responsible, but maybe affected by the under developing brain of a teenager,\" Jacob said while crushing his old man in a fighting game, \"Sometime I do things by impulse lately. Remember what happened to Sam and I few days ago? I knew I shouldn't do that, but I let Sam talked me into it.\" Sam is one of Adam's friends, a bit of troublemaker. \"Yes I'm aware of drugs are bad, you- Mike had shown many cases he had that drugs related to Adam before as example. But, if my- Adam's friends encourage me, I can't promised I won't just go with it under pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you better think of those cases when facing drugs. By the way,\" Carl asked, \"What's in you mind lately?\" It's not Carl asking Jacob, But more sounded like Mike trying to find out if there anything troubled his son. \"Nothing.\" Jacob didn't noticed he's back to teenager's behavior. \"Really? Nothing like girl problem?\" \"Mom put you into this, right?\" Jacob rolled his eyes, somehow the conversation back to be a real father and son conversation. After almost a month, they were more and more like Mike and Adam, even when no one's around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*          *          *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason they stayed that long, was because of what Sam and Jacob did few days after the transformation, which make Jacob grounded for a week. They made a plan, they have chose two senior students that Adam didn't acquainted but heard of, so Jacob can't just invited them over. And it's hard to make the transformation in school that has people everywhere, so they figured a party would be easier. But since Jacob got himself grounded, they have to wait another week. And there wasn't always has party around the corner, so weeks turned to almost a month now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat it's like to live as someone else every minutes for a month? Carl knew the consequences by now. He's tired of reminded himself who he really is, and the frequency is less and less now. Even though he saw Jacob everyday, but sometime he didn't recognized him as Jacob, and they were more and more like how Mike and his son interacted. Now he understood what Jacob said after a week being Mike before, he's either with his family or with his workers, there's only one place that make his Carl's part active, was his work. As a former criminal, now identity snatcher, Carl's past life can be helpful to Mike's work, whether to figure out the client guilty or not, or were they lying to him, Carl can saw through their tricks better than Mike, but the legal stuff still needed Mike's wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, maybe Carl won't mind to become Mike at all. One can argued that he has family burden, didn't have freedom like Jacob's single life, can't just go wherever he wanted, but the life is more settled. He won't have to meet girl and see if they matched, then get married and have kid. Now he has skipped all the trouble, with a wife that already love him, a kid that no need to change diaper anymore, will sent away to college after few years but now still has some time to spend together. Then left him and Amy grew old together, have grandchildren visited them later. Carl didn't expected that's what he wanted after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for real Adam, Carl saw him on the work almost everyday too, since Mike and Jacob were good friends. He acted exactly like old Jacob, maybe mentioned something like he didn't know why he would bought some very different style clothes before, and thought that was his middle age crisis. Sometime Mike's part kinda annoyed too, it kept make Carl wanted to save his child from all this, it's very confusing. As Mike, he shouldn't knew this Jacob was the real Adam, but with the combination of Carl's memory, he knew. And since he knew the truth from Carl's memory, then he shouldn't be so protective to his son, no, other guy's son. But after almost a month, he's less aware of this fact too. Maybe that's a sign too, telling him that he should make the next transformation sooner or he might forgot more things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something happened might messed up their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*          *          *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the last Wednesday in March, there's a party in this Friday, and Adam was invited, their targets too. Carl and Jacob have discussed the details, now they just have to wait until Friday came. Carl came to firm as usual in the morning, chit-chatting around, then went into Mike's office to start his work. But there's a guest already in there, it's Alice, the alien partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Edwards.\" Alice didn't put on a smile like usual. \"Strange, it feels longer since I heard this name. Like years.\" Carl's in good mood, he didn't noticed how serious Alice's face was. \"Do you have a minute? I'm sorry I came with bad news.\" She said, now Carl noticed something must be wrong. \"Yeah, sure.\" he then locked the door and put on the soundproof device to make sure no one heard them. Luckily he carried all those devices around everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to inform you,\" Alice said as Carl sat on his chair, \"that Mr. Stewart was dead. To be exact, he died as you, Carl Edwards was dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's brain went blank for a while, then confused, then finally realized how shocked the news was. Part of him felt weird to hear his own dead, whether is Carl's or Mike's. He never planned to go back to his old life, but to shut off the option completely still surprised him. He have so many questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had to think of how to break the news to Jacob, how Jacob would react can be a crucial point too, with the guilt he already had, now added this, he might chose to back away from all this no matter what, then Carl will lose his ally. It's not like Carl can hide the news from Jacob, the longer he hide, the more chance Jacob would walked away when he found out eventually. But maybe, there's a chance how Jacob dealt with this situation would surprised him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, \"How is this happened?\" was the first question Carl asked. Alice took out the surveillance tablet, \"I'll show you, it happened in your apartment.\" She operated the tablet and played the archived video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 2 am last night, Mike, who lived as Carl, came in drunk. He passed out in the living room, didn't locked the door. Several minutes later, a guy came in, he took out a syringe and injected something in Mike's arm, then more syringes, then make the scene looked like Mike took them by himself. It was dark, only some lights shed from corridor and moon, Carl still able to see that guy's face from certain angles, but he didn't recognized that guy. Who was he? Why he wanted to kill 'Carl'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The neighbor saw the door opened and looked inside curiously and found him like that just this morning,\" Alice said, \"The police and ambulance came, it was already too late.\" She changed the video to live streaming, the body was gone, there's yellow tape around the door, two cops going through the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Carl realized something, \"Did you and your guys just watch the whole things and do nothing at that time?\" \"We can't intervened among humans no matter what they did, and Mr. Stewart wasn't under our protection even though he's involved in this 'research'. Besides, we couldn't have known that guy's intention, it happened so fast, it's not like we can stopped the time and get there in a blink of eyes to stop that. We are not that resourceful. And even Mike didn't died in a short time after that, we can't go heal him, it's considered as intervention too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl lied down on the couch, everything changed so suddenly and he couldn't do anything about it. He took out the phone, decided to text this news to Jacob, let him took some time to absorb, then he can calmed down a bit when they talked about it tonight. For Carl, the news was just shocking, but for Jacob, it's devastating. Carl put some thought on writing that text, then hit 'send'. He surprised that he received a response very quickly. At first Jacob thought he was joking around and not funny, but after Carl sent some screenshots from the surveillance video, when the coroners bagging Mike's body and polices walking around the apartment, Jacob didn't responded back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*                    *                    *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Carl straightly back to home from work, Jacob pulled him to Adam's room, and told mom 'he got homework that needs dad's help, hope she won't interrupt until dinner'. He locked the door as they were in, Carl opened the soundproof device, and called Alice to show up. \"Tell me everything.\" Jacob said. Carl started from the beginning, and Alice helped add some details he missed. It's not much to say actually, and the video showed it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sat silently on his bedside listening their words. Maybe because of Adam's personality, he even have tears in his eyes. \"So,\" as soon as Carl finished, Jacob asked him, \"You really don't recognized the killer?\" \"Yes, never met or even saw that guy before.\" Carl said. \"How about you, Alice? Can you use your any alien device that has face recognition or something to identify that guy?\" He then asked Alice. \"Sorry, some other aliens might have, but we are not focus on collecting human's ID.\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And the police didn't even suspect there's foul play?\" Jacob asked. \"According to the detectives conversation earlier, they set their mind on closing the case as overdose accident. To be honest, I doubt they can find anything suspicious, the killer looked like a pro, and they don't have the surveillance video like we do.\" Alice answered, then Carl added, \"Even there's some questions like 'how Carl Edwards can afford to get so much drugs', or 'why this guy using needle for drug when he's so drunk', but if the cops didn't put interest in the first place, those questions won't even be asked.\" Mike's lawyer experience kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can...\" Before Jacob finished his sentence, Carl knew what he's thinking and stopped him, \"No, we can't show them this video, how are we gonna explained where it came from?\" Jacob silenced and lowered his head, he had unintentionally avoided to make eye contact with Carl the whole time, who looked exactly like Mike. <i>It's all my fault!</i> was filled in Jacob's mind, <i>If Carl and I make the next transformation earlier, Mike will be very alive in his own life... but then somebody else would still died in his place... I shouldn't agreed to involve to begin with. I should've insisted on against Carl's manipulation. I saw right through his plan at the beginning, but I let my desire beats me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacob dwelling in sorrow, Carl also thinking of what his next move should be. How should he persuaded his partner if he really wanting to back out. Offer him something to take off his mind? Blackmailed him again? What can he used to threaten him? Before he preparing more comebacks, Jacob broke the silence first, \"I want to find that killer. I owed Mike this at the least.\" \"Find the killer? Then what? Make him confessed to the cop? Or kill him?\" Carl surprised of what Jacob suggested. \"I don't know yet. I will know when I facing him.\" Jacob said. \"Then how do you investigate? As Adam, you can't go anywhere anytime by yourself, and who will gave a teenager any leads seriously?\" Carl asked, but he has a bad feeling about the answer he would heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as Adam, I can't do much. But as a detective, I can.\" Jacob pointed to the screen of the surveillance tablet, that showing the live feed. Carl saw that there were two guys just walked into the apartment, a uniform police, and an old guy in suits. \"Hey, it's one of the detectives this morning.\" Alice said. \"So... you want me to help you to switch with a detective, and investigating yourself?\" Carl saw that his bad feeling became real. \"Yes. And after everything sorted out, I promise I will help you do whatever you want. Forever. Until you got sick of me.\" Jacob put out a big promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Such a sweet deal, too sweet actually... I'll bite.\" Carl saw there's no downside for him, \"How about I put in a bonus, I'll help you around.\" he thought he can took the chance to live other life for refreshing, it might helped his mind to stay himself, away from Mike's memory for a few days. Jacob surprised, he thought criminal like Carl won't actually help anyone, \"...Thank you, I guess. So how are we gonna do?\" \"That's your plan, and you're asking me? Luckily, we already have two candidates there.\" Carl referred to the guys currently at the crime scene. \"How? Alice already said she can't helped us kidnap others before. And even if we drove there by car right now, they would've gone before we arrive.\" Jacob confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I think I found a solution. It's quite simple actually, \" Carl grinned, \"She can't kidnap those guys to us, but, since she can transfer us to anywhere, I bet she can send us to them. What say you, Alice?\" he looked at Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Alice helped them to get there quickly? Or something else happened?</span></div></div>",

He's pretty sure he still have it when he's at the scene this morning, but lost it afterward. There's two uniforms patrolling nearby when he arrived, he asked them to help him, one of them followed him into the apartment, one stayed outside to keep an eye out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe searched about three times, it's a small apartment, hard to miss even his eyes weren't as good. It's just a pen anyway, he's about to give up, but suddenly a bright light shined behind them, they turned around, purple mist sprayed towards their faces. Before they passed out, they glimpsed there seemed to have three people in the room out of nowhere. And their life would not be the same anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*                                        *                                       *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Carl and Jacob slowly held the detective and the cop onto the floor, Carl quickly turned on the soundproof device, and Alice disappeared again. They have to act very quickly, Amy might came by Adam's room any minutes and saw no ones there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they transported here, Carl already cut out their Mike's and Adam's memory and edited. One month long for each memory would took some time to edit if wanted to be flawless, but since they didn't have much time, Carl just selected all memories that have certain keywords and erased them. They managed to finish it before the detective and the cop leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jacob didn't make the work easier for Carl, he insisted to take Adam, who currently lived as Jacob Harlan, here to transform him back to himself. That's where Alice gone as soon as she took them to here. Thanks to Jacob's boring private life, --Carl pointed out, Jacob didn't denied-- Adam should be alone at home now, which makes Alice easier to transport him without any witness. So she's back with sleeping Adam, who looked like Jacob, in a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-consuming part was clothing. Adding Adam, there were three unconscious people's clothes that needed to take off by them. Even with two people, and Alice joined in later, working together, it is not easy to take someone else clothes off without ruined it and quickly. Carl did asked Alice if he can borrowed some transformation device so that he wouldn't have to do all the transformation and easy to exchange clothes, but Alice declined, said \"What's the point to do this research if using the device instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Alice calculation, five people transformation at the same time was Carl's power limit, so that should be enough. As soon as they stripped all the clothes and swallowed the painkillers, Carl worked his magic in the least steps they thought of. First he touched the detective twice, exchange his Mike's body with him; then he touched Jacob, so Jacob will have the detective's body; then he touched Adam, which gave Adam back to his body; then he touched the cop, so that he will have the cop's body, and the cop has Jacob's body. It's impressive to transform five people, but only Alice have time to observe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl didn't waited to see through the transformation, he took the memory device out, and put Mike's memory in the detective while cut out his; then gave Adam back his memory and took out his Jacob's memory; Carl didn't have to modify this Jacob's memory, he just put it in the cop's brain, and cut out his; Last he put the detective's memory to Jacob, and he himself received the cop's memory. Jacob also used the transformation time to start dressing up the detective's clothes, the clothes seemed loose at first, but as Jacob's body grow, the clothes became fitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob wanted to be the detective so he can have more resource to do his investigation, Carl became the cop to stay nearby, or at least they can meet up in the station conveniently. The detective was about the same height as Jacob used to, in his fifties, bald, beer belly, many joint pains, heavy smoker, obviously not a healthy person, and judging by his stubble and odd smelled suits, not a hygiene person too, this part should make Jacob very nausea, but he didn't hesitated to put on those clothes, it's just a small sacrifice for him to investigate his friend's death. And after received his memory, Jacob knew his name was Jim Rogers, a deadbeat detective waiting for retirement, so he lately liked small cases or no case at all. Jacob and Carl's assumption was right, Jim did wanted to close the case as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was busied on the memory device while transforming, the hands kept changing form didn't helped much, he started dressing up only after the transformation completed. The uniform of policeman with gadgets might be hard for Carl to wear them right, but not a problem if he already has the cop's memory. The cop name's Frank Esposito, 23, two years of rookie cop experience, a bit shorter than Jim, but a lot fitter, he's the kind of the man that has tough look, dependable, also can be intimidated, with crew cut hair, sharp eyes, and robust body. But what excited Carl most, was his identity. From criminal to law enforcer, from being chased to chasing bad people, it a huge different side and moral, he waited to see which mind in his head will win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, we don't know each other.\" Carl said as he put on the jacket. Jacob already ready, Jim dressed like a detective in noir film, except he didn't had ruggedly handsome look, \"No wonder I can't recall your first name, only last name from your name tag.\" he responded. They thought the detective and the cop were knew each other since they showed up together, thought that would make them less suspicious if they met up often. \"Still, I think it's okay for us to meet at station, it's not rare to see a detective talking to a cop. I'm Detective Jim Rogers, by the way.\" Jacob introduced himself. \"Officer Frank Esposito. Maybe we should exchange phone numbers too.\" They continued making small talk while took out their phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Carl planted memories, Alice didn't just stand there and do nothing. Since they don't have time, they decided to sent the three naked guys to where their new lives now with clothes at side. Alice transferred them one by one. They might felt weird and can't think of any reason why they woke up in their places naked, like Frank who lived as Jacob Harlan from now on, he wouldn't figured out how he's in his reading room naked, but he would get past that eventually. Adam back to his life, and Jim became Mike Stewart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stopped for a while and stared as Alice getting ready to take Jim, transported. One last look of Mike, though not exactly the real Mike, and naked, but that determined his mind what he's about to do wasn't crazy or worthless. Carl also looked at Mike for a while, though he's not sure what was he feeling. Mike's life was good, maybe he will 'revisit' him after things settled. They packed up all the devices, took turn to check on their looks in front of the only mirror in the room one last time. They made the whole transformation in about 20 minutes, still considered a long time just to look for a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*                                        *                                       *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out of the apartment quickly, Frank's partner was seemed impatient already, but she tried to sound calmed, \"Found your pen, sir?\" \"No,\" Jacob said, \"thanks for helping anyway, young man. Frank, right?\" his acting was very convincing. \"Yes, detective.\" Carl said, while laughing in his head. It's kinda funny now that their ranks were switched, before that, Carl was the one in charge. \"I guess I'll see you around, Frank. Officer Banks. Goodbye.\" Jacob walked to Jim's car, a department issued Civic, get in and drove off, started his life as Detective Jim Rogers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Valerie Banks waited Jacob drove off, then she started to complain to her partner, \"'Frank'? What, you guys buddy now?\" \"Well, he's a detective, it's no harm to show him some respect.\" Carl responded, while continuing their route. \"Oh, come on, you just want someone to help with your detective test. Don't you ever heard his reputation in station? I wouldn't count on him.\" Apparently Jim's incompetence spread far and wide. \"Maybe he's not that bad once you know him. I'm sure he once was a good detective too.\" \"Wasted that much time just to look for a pen, you called that a good detective?\" \"Easy, Val.\" From what Frank thought of Valerie's personality, Jacob knew she didn't mean to, just blew some steam off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Valerie changed the subject, \"what's with the bag? You didn't have it before. What's in it?\" She referred to the bag that has all the alien devices. Carl tried to hide it under jacket the whole time but apparently failed. \"Oh? Uh... it belongs to Detective Rogers. I helped him carrying just now, forgot to return to him.\" \"Huh, really?\" She tried to think if she noticed the detective has carried a bag before. \"Speaking of the test, do you think I'm too soon to take it?\" Carl quickly diverted the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted while continuing their patrol until their shift's over, it's a quiet evening. They went back to the station, --it's the first time Carl walked in without handcuffed, by the way-- reported to their chief, then Carl went to Frank's locker, changed out his uniform and took a shower, exchanged conversation with his fellows, of course Carl knew what Frank knew, acted how Frank acted. After that, it's time to go home, Frank sometime bicycling, sometime took the rail, today he came to station by bicycle. He dreamed of getting a motorcycle, but a rookie police salary wasn't much, he still saving money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sighed. From luxury cars to a bicycle, he began to regret the trade. Put on the hoodie, he bicycling through the wind, felt the chill at night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The apartment that Frank rented wasn't fancy, but decent enough to bring dates home. Although Carl only lived like a ten-percenter in a month or so, he already got used to it. That's why when he saw Frank's apartment, though still a lot better than his old apartment, but no where near Jacob's or Mike's house, he felt a little down. Not long ago, he lived in a big house, with wife and kid, now he's back to a single apartment, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl dropped his belongings to where Frank usually put them, and grab the leftover pizza that Frank had this morning with beer as dinner. If it was yesterday, Carl can went to any restaurant he like, but now he has to think about every penny he spent. Carl can adapted Frank's life easily with his memory, but he still started to miss everything he had in life before, he even missed the suits. At least Frank wasn't poor, he has a roof on top, food to eat, though the job wasn't that great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what he can recalled, Frank Esposito grew up in a bad neighborhood like him too, gangsters everywhere, waiting for him to be old enough to join and die for them. But he chose other path. He finished his high school then recruited into police academy. The path he thought he can help make the world better, start from neighborhood. Carl wondered why his first three transformation were all good guys, making it hard for him to stick to his thieves honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl finishing the pizza while watching TV, his phone rang. It's Jacob. \"Yeah?\" \"It's me. How's the night?\" It's an old man hoarse voice, since Jacob was in Jim Rogers' body. \"Being cop was weird, but uniform's not bad. You?\" Carl said. \"Pains everywhere, can't stop smoking, and never love beer this much.\" Jacob coughed a bit, \"Let's cut to the chase. I need to ask you one last time: You really didn't know the killer before?\" \"Wow, sounded like a real detective. Start working on the case already?\" Carl teased. \"Yeah, and you have different accent. I want an honest answer now.\" Jacob didn't want to waste time. \"Alright, alright. No, I never met that guy before, I swear.\" Carl didn't have to lie about it, he really didn't know who that guy is, \"Maybe he's hired by someone I know, but I don't think I'm important enough or I have enemies that hate me enough to put money on my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob silenced a while, \"Well then, I believe you, for now.\" maybe it usual for Jim as a detective to be skeptical, but it's strange to hear Jacob being straightforward blunt, \"Now, I want you to take your surveillance device and trace back Mike's every steps last couple days, even weeks. Call me ASAP if you found anything.\" \"Sir! Yes, sir!\" Carl said it sarcastically. \"...Sorry if I sounded bossy, bad habit of Jim.\" Jacob knew he's becoming more irritating. \"You're lucky Frank is not short-tempered.\" Carl also sympathized that Jacob just lost his friend, \"Anyway, I'll need some time to look through. Though I doubt that will be useful, the surveillance only on my apartment. And what are you going to do?\" \"I will open the case, have coroner to do the autopsy, gather any information I can. I want solid evidence to charge the killer, so everything by the book. And not gonna let Jim's laziness bested me in anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds a lot of work.\" Carl sighed, but part of him was excited actually, Frank's part mostly, he's excited that he can teamed up with a detective, working on a real case, could learned a lot from that. After month of experience, Carl knew by now that strong emotion is something he can't resisted and very vulnerable to get influenced, part of the reason why he can't stayed as himself in most of the time, because he's not felt as strong about lawyer or investigate stuff as the persons he transformed to, which would took over his emotion and even personality. In other word, he's kinda a pushover actually, even though he claimed to be in charge of all this. That's also why he's always been a small thug before, never been able to do bigger crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chat for a while, getting to know each other new identity, \"Did you- Detective Rogers really like what they said in rumors?\" Carl asked. \"I know what they said behind my back. A divorcee with dead-end job, who wouldn't be grumpy?\" Jacob exclaimed, \"Also maybe he had seen too much tragic, he's tired to be frustrated all the time, then starting to put less and less effort. But everything will be a little different tomorrow. What about Frank?\" \"Not much, two-years rookie, young and still has hope for the world.\" Carl felt he left something out, but another call came in, \"Sorry, Jacob. I have to take another call, see you tomorrow?\" \"Okay.\" Jacob hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl knew who's on the other line, \"Hey, Ma.\" It's Frank's mother, she called him every night except when he's on night shift. \"Mio figlio! How's the work today? Everything's fine?\" \"Yes, Ma. Everything's fine.\" Then she went on asking the usual concerned question, and told him the little thing she faced today. It's been like that ever since Frank moved out, maybe that's why Carl and Frank grew up differently, Frank has a family who love him, while Carl... well, he won't even want to start thinking about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl won't mind talking with Frank's mother, in fact, he enjoyed to have a concerned mother he never had before. When their conversation ended, it's almost midnight. He fell onto the bed, and quickly asleep. It's been a long day, for Carl and for Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*    *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday morning, Carl woke up before alarm, like Frank always did. First thing he noticed was the 'tent' he built under the sheet, what an energized young body. He grabbed a sock from the floor, with a little fantasy, he released his 'tension'. After that, he started Frank's workout routine, weighing dumbbells, push-up, and sort. During workout, he thought of another thing he just noticed: Frank was gay. He fantasized some male body in his masturbation just now, some were Frank's ex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to think about it, there were signs, like when looking at new Mike he was also admiring the naked body; partnering up with Valerie the whole night, he didn't even thought of one obscene fantasy about her sexiness that she tried to hide while on the job; last, talked with his mother for a long time. Frank didn't intended to hide his sexuality, but it's not like he should told everyone he met the first time either. His boss and some of his partners knew, Frank only told them because he knew they were no blabber mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl didn't seemed to be surprised by this, which surprised him the most. He wasn't homophobia, but he shouldn't be that acceptable too. Maybe the Frank's memory helped, he's been gay for few years. He's more surprised that Frank's look didn't strike him as gay, or whatever stereotype he think how gay people looked like. But more importantly, was Carl also gay now? The part he loved women and the part Frank loved men, both considered strong emotion, he didn't think he's more sided with either one. So was he bi now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl took a shower after workout while his mind still confused with those questions, he gave up since he won't knew the answer unless he's put into action. And now wasn't the time, he has to go to work. After shower and put on uniform, he cooked some simple breakfast to eat, while watching the surveillance video of Mike. Make use of his time before today's shift. He started from the day before the incident, watched it in reverse order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*    *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Frankie, I need to talk to you for a minute.\" Carl was pulled aside by Jacob after his morning briefing. Valerie was still his partner today, she heard Jacob, nodded to Frank and walked away, \"Meet you at the car park later, partner.\" \"You look different... cleaner?\" Carl said to Jacob, saw him still wore the same brown coat, different suit, shaved, tie still a little loose. \"A little tidiness on appearance wouldn't hurt. This guy is a mess, last night I spent lots of time trying to clean the house, gave up eventually.\" Jacob then asked, \"Anyway, what is your assignment today?\" \"I get car patrol.\" Carl answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Make a stop at your apartment, get statement from neighbors. And I'm going to look through some files.\" Jacob said. \"Fine, but it seems like I'm doing all the legwork.\" Carl complained. \"Well, you are the rookie, Frankie. And I'm an old man.\" Jacob self-deprecating. \"By the way, what's with the 'Frankie'?\" Frank didn't like to be called like that, thought that sounded boyish. \"I don't know, it just came out. Sound friendlier, and you are young enough to be my son.\" Jacob said. \"Well just stop.\" \"Okay, okay. Geez, young man nowadays, not respect to elder...\" Jacob stopped as he realized what's he mumbling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*    *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to work, Frankie?\" Valerie said and laughed when Carl joined her. \"I knew you won't let that go.\" Carl sighed. \"What's the matter, little Frankie? Am I upsetting you? Are you want your mommy?\" Valerie continued. \"No.\" Carl said, \"And I don't mind being called Frankie.\" \"Really? Then I decided to call you Frankie from now on.\" Valerie teased. \"Fine by me. At least one of us has to be grown up.\" \"If you say so, Frankie. And I might slip out to other partner.\" \"...Alright, what's it gonna take for you to stop?\" Carl surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie seemed to enjoy too much over this little joke, \"I'll stop if you tell me what Detective Rogers want from you. Or are you into that type?\" Valerie was one of the few people who knew Frank's gay. \"No, he just want some legwork from me. Searching his pen last night seems to let him rethink about the overdose case, he wants to investigate a bit.\" They thought of a reason just now when he and Jacob talked. \"Whoa, are you saying we can help out a possible homicide case?\" Valerie sounded excited. \"We?\" \"Of course, that's what a partner for.\" Valerie said, \"Beside, you're not the only one to think about become detective someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl knew he can't argued with her, and also, she's the one driving.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl visited his old neighborhood one more time, with mix feelings. Last night they came and went in a hurry, now he has time to think how funny and weird and confusing of this were, a low life criminal came back as one of the good cop. He no longer have to dodge or hide from his landlord and people he owed money to, now he can swaggered around as man in blue. If he wanted, he can went and arrested people he hated because he knew what crimes they had committed, read them the Miranda rights, not the one receiving it. Maybe after things settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut being a cop wasn't popular. \"Excuse me, ma'am. Can I ask you some questions regarding the guy in 3C?\" Carl has spoke similar sentence to several residents already, they have to knock on every door, endured every rudeness, and received very least or no help. Most people won't want to snitch, that just asking for trouble. Carl used to love being one of them, now he didn't like it so much. <i>Karma</i>. And also, the killer came and fled the scene late at night, most of them really slept in and didn't saw anything. Carl and Valerie split up to speed up the progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is it the dead man yesterday?\" An old woman answered the door this time. \"I thought they said he killed himself?\" \"Maybe, ma'am, but we want to eliminate any other possibility.\" Carl answered, \"Do you see or hear anything unusual or suspicious?\" \"I don't think so, we are at different floor. Although...\" she paused and tried to recall, \"I did saw a stranger last night.\" \"Can you tell me more, please?\" <i>Finally, a witness, and she willing to talk.</i> Carl surprised himself that he's happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on in, I'll get you some tea while we continue, young man. You can call me Mrs. Hernandez, Officer...\" She invited Carl. \"Esposito.\" Carl accepted her offer, stepped in her apartment. It's as small as his apartment, but she kept it tidied. Carl sat on a sofa comfortably, she handed him a cup of tea and some cookies. Carl passed her by a couple of time in the hall before, but she wouldn't be that nice to real Carl, though the real Carl was to blame because of his attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Hernandez continued her statement, \"I saw him at late night, which is unusual even for this neighborhood. I woke up in the middle of the night, couldn't sleep well, so I stand near the window and look at the sky. Then I heard the slam of the door of the hall down here, and a stranger walked out.\" \"Can you described him?\" \"I can't. It's dark outside, he's wearing a dark coat, and my eyesight isn't good anymore. Sorry I can't be more helpful.\" She said. \"That's okay, ma'am. You helped a lot.\" Carl came up a plan after he heard her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Mrs. Hernandez didn't saw the killer's face, but Carl can changed her statement a little and put in the description of the killer that he saw in the surveillance. That way he can search the killer from police system and put out a BOLO properly. Luckily Valerie wasn't with him. \"Anyway, I should get going. Thanks for the tea and cookies, ma'am. Good day.\" Carl said and walked out quickly before Mrs. Hernandez wanted to talk some more. He went and found Valerie, told her the altered statement, but she jealous on something else, \"Cookies? I got door slamming and dirty flirting. You got cookies?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey still have their assignment to do, so that's it for the case today. No big case along the car patrol, some domestic disputes, neighborhood complains, and public disturbances. By the time they reported back to the station, Jacob has left. Carl suggested he went to his house and reported to him, Valerie agreed. Carl didn't know where Jacob lives now, but he can called and asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter work, Carl bought dinner on the way back to Frank's place. He finished the dinner quickly, then took out the phone and called Jacob, \"Hey, Detect- uh, Jake. Are you at home?\" \"Yes. Call me Detective or Jim, I don't mind. In fact, how about we just called each other who we are now? Save the time to make correction.\" Jacob answered, \"Anyway, why'd you asked?\" \"I want to meet you and discuss the case, Detective. Hard to do it through phone.\" Carl emphasized the name part to tease Jacob, thought he must be began to feel self-satisfied hearing people called him detective. \"Okay, but do you know where I live?\" But Jacob didn't seemed to notice he's been teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Carl wanted to ask Jacob his address, a bright light appeared in front of him. Alice the alien showed up. Carl quickly thought of what she can do, \"Don't worry, my ride's here. See you in a second.\" \"Wha-?\" Carl hanged up the phone before Jacob figured out what he meant. \"Hello, Mr. Edwards.\" Alice greeted as usual, \"We heard you guys want to discuss about Mr. Stewart's case, so I'm here to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Carl knew the aliens were watch over them all the time, no surprised in there, but this is the first time the aliens offered their help before asked. <i>Maybe it's just because a death man involved,</i> Carl tried not to overthink it, \"Okay. First, let us meet Jake at his current location, his new home. I guess you can transport us?\" \"Sure, piece of cake.\" Alice then put her hand on Carl's shoulder, and bright light glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetective Jim Rogers live in a normal house in town, at least it looked normal on the outside. Inside, like Jake said before, was a big mess. After his divorce, he didn't bothered to clean up anymore. Carl and Alice arrived in the living room, there's magazines, newspapers, clothes, beer bottles and trashes everywhere. No to mention the smell. The only clean place was the kitchen table, apparently Jacob prepared it for case files. No sight of Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl and Alice looking around the house, they heard the water flushed from toilet, then saw Jacob coming out. \"Whew... Hi, Frank, Alice.\" Jacob was only wearing wife-beater and boxer, he didn't seemed to bother to put on some clothes, \"Want a beer?\" He took out two bottles of beer from fridge, handed one to Carl and one for himself, then picked up the cigarettes from table and lighted one. Smoking, drinking beer, and wearing only underclothes in front of people, the old Jacob would never done any of these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really let yourself go, huh?\" Carl said. \"What? You mean the beer and cigarette? It's not as bad as I thought, but I did try to cut down the smoke.\" Jacob said while leaning on a chair. \"What about clothes? Alice's here too, you know.\" Carl said. \"We've known each other, besides, she's not really a woman.\" Jacob paused and burped, \"Don't be so uptight.\" <i>Me?! Now I'm the uptight one?</i> Carl couldn't believed what he heard. Was it because Jim's older than him, have more memories, so Jacob became easier to be influenced? If so, was it happened to Carl too when he's Jacob or Mike? Is that why he's becoming uptight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sighed, \"Let's talk about the case.\" \"Case, yes. I open the case as investigation on progress, possible homicide. Other detectives think it's odd for me to take the initiative, but the case seems minor so they leave me alone. I asked for autopsy too, but the result comes tomorrow, though I doubt that would be helpful, it's not CSI.\" Jacob continued, \"I pulled out Carl Edward's police record, nothing seemed important recently. And I also talked to Trask. You know him, right?\" \"Yeah, the detective that keep bugging me in old time, arrested me a couple times. He still alive?\" Carl did saw some familiar faces in station these last two days, but no Detective Nick Trask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healthier than me, I would say.\" Jacob has started his second cigarette by now, \"Anyway, I asked him if he knows anything happened to Carl Edwards in last few weeks. He knew nothing. But,\" he paused for drama, \"he told me, there's a robbery in a jewelry store at 16th Street two weeks ago. They didn't have enough of evidence to work the case, not even a suspect. These 3 robbers are pro. The only mistake they made was one of them dropped his mask when they ran out from the store, he put it back on quickly, there's only one witness. And sadly, the witness didn't saw his whole face, only partial. From the incomplete sketch done by his description, Trask said it does have resemblance of Carl Edwards.\" Jacob stopped and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike, as Carl Edwards, must be accepted a robbery job. He exposed his face during the robbery, his partners don't want to take any chance, so they eliminated him. The killer was either one of the accomplice or hired by them. It's not odd that Mike worked with new people, Carl did that too before. Just unfortunately Mike's new friends were homicidal. The cause and effect became clearer to them, but not very helpful to catch the perpetrators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn,\" Carl said, \"I found a witness saw the killer leave. But she didn't saw his face.\" \"So you got nothing too.\" Jacob looked disappointed. \"Not exactly. If you agreed, we change her statement to 'saw and gave us a clear description', then we can put the killer face in it.\" Carl shared his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we saw his face through the surveillance already... We don't have much right now, let's give it a try.\" Jacob said, \"Anything else?\" \"No.\" Carl sighed, \"Why can't be more like TV show? Solved a case in an hour.\" \"Yeah, right.\" Then they noticed something. Alice was here the whole time and didn't make a sound, but right now she's raising her hand, like a student waiting to be called by teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Alice?\" Jacob asked. Alice put down her hand, cleared her throat, and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Actually,\" Alice said, \"We've found where the killer is.\" Just a few seconds ago they thought the finding process will took days, never expected this quick. \"What the fuck?\" Carl yelled, \"And you let us wasted all the time to talk about it? How? Where? Tell us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, we used our techs to trace his steps, and keeping track on him since then.\" Alice showed surveillance photos while explaining, and a brief personal info of the killer, \"He's now at a motel room, too bad we can't just get him over here.\" \"Then teleport us to him now!\" Carl suggested the obvious answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Jake suddenly shouted. Carl surprised, \"Wait for what? Aren't you the one that eager to find the killer?\" \"I am, of course I am. \" Jake tried so hard to sound calm, \"But what are we gonna do to him once we confronted him? Kill him? Remember what Alice said, it's against your contract.\" \"Yes, I won't teleport you to him if you're planning to kill other human.\" Alice confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I'm not a killer.\" Carl shrugged, \"Then what's your plan? Arrest and interrogate him?\" \"Right now we don't have any evidence to arrest him.\" Jake said, \"Even we make him talk by tortured him or something, the case won't stand in court. He will be free in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl shot another idea, \"How about I use my power? You or me become him for a while and confess everything, after jail time guaranteed, we switch back.\" \"That's not a bad plan, but he still could live good in his jail time.\" Jake said, with Jim's face added more stern, \"I want him to suffer the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave me an idea,\" Jake continued, \"Give me a day or two to prepare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you guys don't have a day or two,\" Alice said, \"The killer is about to leave the country, he got his fake passport today and has booked a flight early morning with it.\" She added, \"Do you guys ever read the contract we signed? I can't help you once he's outside US.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Carl asked, he thought they could just teleport to anywhere. \"We have restrictions law, can't go anywhere we want too.\" Alice answered, \"Basically its similar to how human divided the land by nation, we need something like passport to go over the area we assigned too, but it's a lot harder to get those permission. By the way, I have to remind you that you can't leave the country too under the contract.\" She said the last part to Carl only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter heard Alice explained her difficulty, Jake then said, \"Well then, it maybe rush and risky, but I think my plan still can be done by tonight. Here's my plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonald Murphy, the killer, was sleeping when Carl, Jake and Alice teleported to his room. Alice spread the soundproof devices around the room, while Jake cuffed Donald's hand on his back before he noticed and woke up, \"What the... who are you guys!\" He sit up, quickly aware it's a waste of time to try to escape, a buffed guy and a beautiful girl blocking the way to the door, an old man stood between his bed and the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Donald Murphy?\" The old man (Jake) asked. Donald was shocked to hear his real name that he hasn't use in a long time. From his view, that guy was just like any other old man, even smell like one, but has the look of... of course, cop. \"Who wants to know? Detective...\" \"...Rogers.\" \"Detective Rogers, may I know what's this all about? And do you have any warrant?\" Donald answered his question with questions, while thinking of how to escape. Once he knew they're cops, he thought the situation would be easier to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake didn't answered him either, he moved to next question, \"Where were you two nights ago, around 2am?\" <i>Ah, so it's about that guy, whatever his name was,</i> Donald thought. He's quite surprised that the cops can track him down that quick, is he leave some evidence in there? Or someone snitched? \"Sleeping of course, it's quite tired after a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are here for business or vacation?\" Jake asked, he still sounded calm, but there's rage in his eyes. \"Road trip, you know, seeking warmer place. Just passing here by. May I know why I'm being cuffed now?\" Donald played innocence. \"Oh? Then why did you booked a flight in the morning?\" the buffed guy (Carl) asked this time. Donald saw him working on some sort of tablet since he's here, now he had put down that device. The girl still quiet the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that? I received a phone call telling me that my uncle is dead, the trip has to cut short because I have to go to the funeral.\" A couple of lies in an instant is easy for guys like Donald. \"Boy, aren't you have every answers to every questions,\" Jake said, \"How about this?\" He took out a passport for Donald's backpack. \"Hey, you don't have the rights to search my backpack.\" They won't found swag with him, but Donald needed the fake passport for tomorrow's flight, \"That just my passport, what about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your photo with different name, 'Donald... MacLeary'?\" Jake was hard to see the words without glasses. \"So? I hate my abusive father, so I changed my name once I grew up,\" Donald started to feel less fun, \"Look, if you won't say what's all this about, I'm gonna shut up until I get my lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's cut to the chase. I'll give you one last chance to confess,\" Jake said with more deeper voice, \"Did you killed a guy named Carl Edwards two nights ago? An 'associate' you hired to rob a jewelry store?\" But Donald kept quiet this time. Jake waited his response, and took the tablet from Carl. He showed Donald the surveillance. Donald never expected that guy's house has such good surveillance camera, there's plenty of clear vision of his face. But he still won't considered to admit anything, \"Like I said before, I want my lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told you, he won't confess,\" Carl said to Jake, \"It's just a waste of time.\" Jake stared at Donald for a while, eventually he said, \"You know, if you confessed, I might change my mind of what we're about to do to you.\" <i>Is this guy crazy?</i> Donald started to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, the man you killed, was my friend. My best friend, my only friend. He's a good guy, he didn't deserved any of this,\" Jake said, \"I'm sure you are very confused: 'A lowlife like him is a good guy?' Well, you'll know the answer soon. Allow us to demostrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl took out two pills, he handed one near Donald's mouth. \"It's a painkiller, for what's gonna happen next. You can either take this or feel the pain, your choice.\" Donald hesitated, but seeing Carl also took one, he decided to take the risk. \"Now, pay attention.\" Carl said as he touched Donald twice with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonald didn't know what to see at first, then he felt it. He felt his bones moving, the handcuffs and his t-shirt tighten. He looked down and he saw his body grew bigger and muscular. He looked at the guy in front of him, and there's more surprises. Though he can't see everything under Carl's jacket, but he's sure Carl's figure became smaller as his jacket became unfitted. And then he saw Carl's face began to grow beard, his hair grew in incredible speed and color changed. His head shrunk and face shifted. Finally, he saw 'Donald Murphy' standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonald would jumped up from bed if he wasn't cuffed. \"Shocking, isn't it?\" Carl smirked. \"Wha... WHAT THE HELL!\" Donald realised his voice sounded different, while Carl's voice sounded more like his old voice. The girl hold a mirror in front of him, and Donald saw his reflection was different too, he became the buffed guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, my friend here has special power.\" Jake started to explain, while Carl... 'feeling' himself, \"So weak, yet so hairy.\" \"As you can guessed, he can swap body with anyone.\" Jake stay focused, and Carl added, \"but I can't swap clothes, tattoos and something else, not now anyway.\" \"That's not important. So, can you imagine what's going on now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonald's mind still blanked, even though he had saw plenty of unusual things in his criminal life, he never expected this became such fiction, he can't stayed as calm as usual. Jake continued, \"The Carl Edwards you met, was not the real Carl. He's actually my friend Mike swapped with the real Carl,\" he pointed to Carl, who now has Donald's body. \"I'm the real Carl Edwards, please to meet you. Or should I say I'm Donald MacLeary now? Just so you know, your current body is not Mike's. That's another story.\" \"Don't make him confused more, we don't have much time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, you guys not really look like that? Not really cops?\" Donald digested what he can one by one. \"Yep, you start catching up real good, under the circumstances.\" Carl answered. \"Are you try to tell me you can killed me and get away easily?\" Donald knew his time was up, but still try to buy some time. \"No, killing you would be too good for you, not suffer enough.\" Jake said, \"We are going to let you live a long life, but, as different person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Donald expressed his confusion, Jake continued, \"I have another friend. He was caught in a gunfight years ago, a splinter shot into his head, caused him brain damage, since then he was incapable to take care himself, he can't think straight, he can't express himself well. With no hope and no other option, his family sent him away to mental hospital till now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, can you figure out who you gonna live for the rest of your life?\" Jake asked rhetorically. \"You're crazy!\" Donald shouted, and he started to think a way out. Although all this still seemed surreal to him, he knew he had to escape. And 'luckily', he now possessed a buffed body, and apparently was a cop. If he managed to get out now, he can even ran to police station for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The handcuff seems easy to broke the chain with this body, stand up and kick the freak through sheet to avoid any physical contact, then push off the girl and run to the door, the old man might have gun but if I fast enough... yeah, this might work. I have to try, anyway.</i> Donald thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Donald succeed to escape? Or Jake able to execute his plan? Or something else happened?</span></div></div>",

And I'm gonna find you!\" Donald said, while seeking a good timing to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, we didn't explain clearly,\" Carl said, \"You see, you get all the physical status the person you swapped with, not just the appearance, it's everything except minds. But to be honest, we only know tattoos don't applied too by now.\" Carl rolled up Donald's left sleeve and saw a name tattoo, but Frank's body didn't have those tattoo before. \"That's because tattoo didn't produced from human body, like hair coloring or make up also can't be swapped. I know, bummer.\" This is the first time Donald heard the girl spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, once we swapped you with my friend, you'll inherit all his traits, including brain damage.\" Jake continued, \"Not brain dead, he has some consciousness from time to time, you can try to explain your situation to anyone as mental patient, see who would believe. Apart from brain damage, he's younger than me, healthier than me, still have a long life waiting for him. A long time to drive you crazy slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say it's a lifetime sentence. Mind you, when comes the time you finally give up and try to commit suicide, make sure you'll succeed, or else, who knows how the hospital will deal with their suicidal patient.\" Jake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any more question?\" Carl stood up, with both hands clutching his jeans, Donald's figure was way thinner than Frank's. \"If not, let's sta--\" \"What about your friend? Is he gonna took over my life? You want him to become a wanted person for the rest of his life?\" Donald not really wanted to know, just tried to let their guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not that it matters to you, but we have some other plan for him. Anything better than his current situation, right?\" Carl answered, \"It'll took a long time to explain, as you can see-\" Carl was interrupted by Donald. Donald suddenly jumped up, and kicked the sheet over Carl. \"What the fuck!\" as Carl shouted and fell down, Jake, with Jim's years of police experience he got, reach to the gun in holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jake wasn't quick enough. Though Donald not able to broke the chain of handcuff, he still strong and fast enough with Frank's body, and the door only guarded by Alice the alien. Donald thought he could took down the girl easily, but he didn't expected she has a small device in her hand, she hold it up and spray some purple mist to his face, Donald avoided at the last second but still inhaled some, enough to put him to sleep in no time. Donald's escape plan failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this happened in seconds, when Carl got out of the sheet and stood up with pants down, Donald was passed out on the floor already. Jake put down the gun, \"Told you no need to demonstrate your ability on him, of course he would try to escape.\" \"You're the one that wants him to understand the whole things so that he knew what he confronted, \" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just start, shall we?\" Jake back to calm. \"Alright, alright.\" Carl said, while pulling up his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n3:20 a.m., St. Heart Hospital. The night shift staff just finished routine room check. In room 201, Tom Hill was slept soundly after his night pills, not even four people suddenly appeared in his room with a blink of light could woke him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sprayed the yellow mist to Tom's face to wake him up, while Carl and Alice putting down the naked Donald on the floor. Tom opened his eye and saw them, before he screamed, Jake covered his mouth, \"Calm down, Tom. It's me, Jim Rogers, you remember me?\" The room was dark, Jake used his phone's flashlight to show his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked, then nodded. \"Now, you know you can trust me, right? Be quiet and take this pill, it will help you. Do you understand?\" Jake uncovered his mouth, and handed him the painkiller. \"J- Jim, yell -yell a lot, my- my friend.\" Tom said. \"That's because you always hotheaded, you think I liked to yell? Just take the pill,\" Jake put the pill in his hand, Tom paused, then put it in his mouth and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sit still. And this is my friend, will you shake his hand?\" Jake signaled Carl to get closer. Carl reach out his hand, Tom hesitated but also put out his hand. Carl was still in Donald's form when he touched Tom, then he went and touched Donald who in Frank's form. Tom's figure wasn't much different than Donald's, skinny, similar height, messy hair. Tom felt something shifted, he couldn't figured out at first, but as time went by, he discovered he can think straightly, no more noises in his head that scrambled his mind, it's been a long time since his mind was that clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Tom saw something that he thought he just went crazy to a whole new level. The man that shook his hand, was became bulkier, more muscle, with whole different face. \"What the hell?\" he heard his voice sounded different, then he thought maybe his voice changed after all these years, \"Jim! Who is he? Wait, I can speak normally, and think normally! Is that because of the pill?\" He finally can worked his brain like normal, filled with more and more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it all works out too. But let's get out of here first, then I will explain everything. Now, leave all your clothes here, and put this on. Be quiet, be quick.\" Jake handed him a bathrobe. Jim was not only Tom's partner but also his mentor, so even the order is strange, Tom still obliged to listen to Jake, who he thought was Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring stripping, with only light came from one phone, he has noticed his hands looked unfamiliar. No, not just hands, it's like his entire body was... a stranger to him. <i>Gosh, am I change that much after the injury? How long was I out?</i> He thought. In the mean time, Jake was using the memory device, copied Tom's memory and put it into Donald's head. He didn't gave him all the memory, only the years that Tom became mental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl, with Frank's body, can now pick up Donald by his own and put him on the bed. Donald still asleep, in Tom's body, when he wakes up, he no longer has his sanity. Jake tossed Tom's clothes on Donald, and whispered to him knowing he can't heard him, \"I'll visit you from time to time, make sure you live long and suffer. Also, enjoy my friend's memory lane of all these crazy years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's set, let's go.\" Carl ordered as he saw Tom has ready. Alice put a hand on Tom's shoulder, with Carl and Jake formed a circle. Tom glimpsed at the naked guy on the bed and shocked, as he saw 'himself' lying there. Before Tom can expressed how shock he was, with a gleam of light, they were not in the hospital anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked around, all seemed familiar, he visited here before. They were transported back to Jim's house. Shock after shock, Tom wasn't sure what shocked him more now, or what he should ask first. \"That's it, I must be still in hospital bed. This is a whole new level of my crazyiness, weird realistic dream.\" Tom spoke to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice pinched him on his arm, \"I heard that's how to prove dreaming or not.\" Tom felt the pain. \"You're not crazy, not anymore. We'll explain everything to you one by one. First, let me introduce this two to you. She is Alice, He is Frank.\" Jake said, as he grabbed a few bottles of beer from fridge and gave one to each, \"Alice has advanced tech stuff, like transport four persons from place to place in seconds. And Frank is a police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Carl decided to change some facts, like let Tom thought who they seemed to be would be easier. \"He is also a shapeshifter.\" Tom choked  when he heard what Jake said, such science fiction word coming from his mentor's mouth. \"Don't believe? When you done coughing, go to the mirror and see for yourself,\" Carl pointed the mirror at the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom walked up to the mirror, he saw his face clearly, only that wasn't his face at all. No way the brain damage of all these years could make him that different, unless some doctor gave him plastic surgery. Different hair color, different chin, different nose... he opened his robe, everything looked different too because they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Tom remembered the guy he saw in his bed, \"This is the face of that guy, right? The guy that replaced me at the hospital?\" \"Woah, you took the news very well, way better than your partner when he saw my ability for the first time,\" Carl said, \"Yes, I have switched you and him, which also answered your question before: No, it's not because the pill, it's because you are using his healthy brain, so you can think straight now. And he has your body, which means he's the mental now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, he's a scum, a murderer, he deserves this treat more than anyone else,\" Jake continued. Tom stopped 'admire' his new look and back to the living room and asked, \"A killer? Why not just put him on sentence?\" \"Because we're short on evidence, if he goes to court, chances are he might got away,\" Jake answered, \"So when I know what Frank can do, and he introduced Alice to me, I came up with this plan, that I can save you while bring that guy to justice by our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take a break, how about you go clean yourself up while absorb what you knew so far? There's some clothes in the bathroom for you too.\" Carl suggested. \"Oh? Okay, I guess.\" Late night in spring, Tom felt the chill with only robe on, he went up to the bathroom on second floor, where Jake told him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry he might ran off?\" Carl make small talks with Jake while waiting for Tom to continue. \"Why would he run? It's not like he has place to go, not with that face,\" Jake said. \"I don't know, panic? Scare? Still think all of this was just his mind trying to screw him? Want to find his family no matter what? Think he's abducted by aliens, and this whole thing is an experiment? Not so farfetched for an assumption,\" Carl joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Carl's bad joke became true, or they continued their plan when Tom came down?</span></div></div>",

They stayed in their characters while talking, in case Tom can heard them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was back after 15 minutes, \"To be honest, I'm more of a briefs guy.\" He said, while adjusting his crotch. \"That's what bothering you more? Not wearing someone else's underwear, or, I dont' know, someone else's body?\" Jake picked on Tom, as what Detective Rogers always do. \"Well, if you put it that way... Anyway, I don't think the clothes belong to this body, a bit loose,\" he's wearing a checkered shirt, a cargo pants and boots, all seemed oversize but a bit shorter to Donald's skinny tall body. \"You're right, they're mine. I have a hunch you're gonna need them later. Now, anything you want to ask first?\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about tell me how you guys meet. How Frank got the power? How Alice invented such tech stuff? I don't think in my absent years the science would improved that much, unless we encountered... aliens? Did we make contact with aliens? Do we have time machine now?...\" Tom kept going on and on, until Jake yelled, \"For fuck sake, shut up a minute would'ya? Gosh, I'm starting to regret on saving your ass, forgot how annoying you can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said I can ask...\" Tom complained, with weak voice like kid tried protest the parent. \"Anyway,\" Jake said while rubbing his head, \"I see you have taken all this very well, back to yourself in such short time, maybe we should proceed to next phase right now.\" Jake also wanted to avoid answering those questions, so he took the opportunity to change subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What next phase?\" Asked Tom, Jake distracted Tom. \"It's about your life,\" Carl answered, \"Your current body is a criminal, which means even we gave you a new identity, you still could be danger if recognized by someone know him. So, we thought you would like a new face to live the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As we said before, you can't get your old body back,\" Jake said, \"if you have to stay as other person for the rest of your life, might as well not look exactly like a criminal.\" \"You mean I can choose whoever I want?\" Tom intrigued. \"Not really, it's not like we can go out and 'browsing' people on the street and kidnap whoever you want. My power worked almost instantly, it's risky to be witnessed or caught on camera. I'm still try to keep my power a secret.\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, we don't know what's the deal with that stranger, what if you happen to choose another criminal? Or the one that has cancer or any weird disease?\" Alice pointed out. Actually they can use some alien device to do a quick scan to know for sure, but of course they can't revealed that to Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From three of us, you can rest assured we are healthy. Well, Rogers here might not counted as healthy because... you know, but at least no any serious disease, yet.\" Carl said, \"and you can get senior discount after few years.\" Jake grunted, but tired to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After another transformation, we will provide you a new identity. Lady here can make a transporter, she also can make a perfect fake ID.\" Alice nodded and added, \"Not just ID, I can fake a whole new life, give you a new birth certificate, education background, et cetera, and I can guarantee they will be flawless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, here's one rule you have to follow: you will not be anywhere near here once all done, ever.\" Carl delivered bad news before Tom got too excited, \"and you can't meet your family and friends, and of course said anything here to anyone.\" Tom frowned, Carl continued, \"You have to start your new life in else where, you will be leaving this state at the morning. Think of it like Witness Protection Program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family... how are they?\" Everything seemed surreal tonight until this moment, Tom was pulled back to reality, \"Last I can remember they visited me in hospital, I don't think I saw my dad.\" Obviously, Carl and Jake didn't have the answer but Alice did, \"From what I found on internet, your parent separated a year after your incident, your sister engaged to her boyfriend half years ago.\" \"Huh, not so surprise, still...\" Tom said with a sad frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it helps, we just don't want you to make contact with them. Nowadays you can follow anyone on the internet, your sister have facebook and twitter, through her you can know your family situation over the time.\" Alice added, \"But keep in mind, never attempt to inform her who you are, I'll know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who do you choose? Your old partner, me, or a whole different gender? Mind you, it's one time deal, no return policy, because we won't meet again.\" Carl tried to enlighten the moods, \"I think it's an obvious choice, isn't it?\" He showed his biceps as he said. And without much hesitation, Tom said, \"I guess... Sorry, Jim, and uh, Alice.\" \"No surprise, but luckily you won't be duplicating his cockiness.\" Jake said with poker face. \"Eh? Did someone curious about my cock?\" Carl childishly response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing lacks of reaction from others, \"Jokes aside,\" Carl cleared throat and said, \"before we do that, there's some risk we need to address. You see, I always use my power to 'swap', haven't use it for 'change'.\" \"What's the difference?\" Tom asked. \"I'm still study my power, so far, I know I have to make 2-ways change in 1 transformation: One change let myself becoming the target, followed by another one for other to become me.\" Carl explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we about to do is 1 and a half time, first two changes for us to exchange body, then a third change for me to change back and stop there.\" Carl explained, \"But we never try to stop in the middle of the process, will I able to touch someone else after that and not change that someone? Will I able to stop it but my power will gone forever? Or maybe everything will be alright? Anything possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you willing to test it out?\" Tom asked, considered they just met in less than 2 hours, \"I mean, you might lose your power because of someone you barely know.\" \"Well, eventually I have to find out the answer, why not now? And Rogers vouch for you, that's enough for me.\" Carl answered, part of him did wanted to know will it work or not, part of him scared of losing his power. But he's feeling helpful, part influenced by Frank's personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence, until Tom broke it, \"Okay, let's do this.\" \"Alright, I'll start making fake ID. Want to go oversea or road trip across states?\" Alice hold up a tablet, at least it looked like a tablet for Tom. \"I don't have money to travel. Heck, I don't have any money for anything.\" Tom said. \"I'll book a plane ticket anywhere you want to go with a passport, and open a bank account on your new identity, there will be about 5,000 in it for you.\" Alice said. \"Whoa, you can do that?\" \"It's easier than teleport. I can gave you more, but I think it's better not to alert the bank. It's enough for you to start fresh anywhere as long you didn't gamble it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their conversation, Carl instructed Tom to stand in front of him, he handed him the painkiller, while Jake taking another cigarette. \"Here we go.\" Carl touched Tom twice, then let the change begin. It's the first time for Tom to see and feel the change with clear mind. Carl, or \"Frank\" in front of him, becoming taller and thinner, make Carl has to grab his pants before it fell, the face of him became the guy Tom saw in the mirror moments ago. And Tom himself felt every inch of his skin moved too, but no pain. He became shorter but muscular, fitting to the clothes and shoes he's wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation finished, while Tom still stunned and amazed by it -- you could say that's the normal reaction of everyone's first transformation experience -- Carl touched Tom again. His body changing back to Frank's form, but Carl was more concerned on the glow on his finger. Didn't know what else can do, he concentrated on thinking \"cancel second change\", \"reset\", something like that, hoping it worked like the first time he somehow managed to switch off the glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince there's nothing for Jake to do, he just sat on the couch enjoying his cigarette, watching them busy doing their thing. Tom, being the chatty one, now expressing his thoughts, \"I'm never a muscle man, I mean, I'm not easy to get fat thanks to family gene or something, but I never able to grow big muscle, not that I tried before. When I graduated from academy, my physical score was barely passable, but this- this body- wait, is it still narcissism if I admire my body but not really my body? And, do you, I mean, do we have any allergies? Will it be too much work to stay in shape?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom kept going on and on, didn't paused for people to answer. His voice sounded exactly like Jake's, but a little different accent because unlike Jake, he didn't have Frank's memory. \"...short hair, stubble, an intimidating look, with deeper voice. You know, even I made it to detective, they still look down on me because I look green. By 'they' I mean Jim and other detectives...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jake about to yell 'shut up!' to Tom, Carl shout out \"YES! It worked!\" first. Jake looked at him, noticed that his finger no longer glow. Carl tried to trigger it again, and this time the glow was different color than last one, which should means it's a new cycle of transformation, \"Fuck yeah, that means my power has reset or whatsoever, right? Alice?\" Alice still busy on the tablet, replied \"How should I know?\" without looking at him. \"It definitely is, I'm sure of it!\" Carl and Tom keep talking excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off, you two! This is why I feel lucky to not have any kid,\" Jake said. \"Sorry,\" Carl and Tom said simultaneously. \"Hey, look at the time, how about we go out for breakfast? I'm starving.\" Tom suggested, it's just passed 5 o'clock in the morning. \"All of us? I don't know, \" Carl opposed, \"what if someone I know sees us? What should I say? I have a secret evil twin brother?\" \"I agreed, too risky.\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill they went to diner, or something else happened?</span></div></div>",

Both of them were wearing caps, Tom added glasses. \"Finally,\" Jake said while grabbing a cigarette, \"'No smoking inside' my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's time to say goodbye. I can't thank you enough for all this.\" Tom looked at Carl, \"I promise, I will make your face proud... It sounded less weird in my head.\" \"Just as long as you didn't do something that will put you up for DNA test. Remember, Alice has altered your fingerprints so we won't have the same, but she can't change your DNA, or technically, my DNA.\" They shook hands, Carl asked, \"So you have decided what to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I am more of a going with the flow guy, which is why I became a cop in the first place. Quite an interesting story, actually.\" Tom said, \" Anyway, I don't know if I ever want to be cop again, but for now I want something simple, a stock boy in grocery store, or an accountant in some big corporate. I do have accounting degree now.\" Tom referred to the fake education background of his new identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't actually know a thing about accounting, you know.\" Jake pointed out. \"I had some courses in night school before, didn't I told you before?\" Tom said. \"You talk all the time, sometime it just a buzzing sound in my ears,\" Jake teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore this turned to another argument, Carl announced, \"Hey, look at the time, you guys should go now.\" \"You sure you and Alice can't come with us to the airport?\" Tom asked. \"It's okay, give you guys to catch up.\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, and hey,\" Tom said to Carl and Alice, \"I know it's precaution, but I do hope we can meet again.\" \"Let's just see what future take us, now you go live your new life, and don't turn out to be a psychopath, that will be enough.\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl and Alice watching Jake and Tom drove away. Everything's according to plan, a risky plan, which make Carl wondered the whole time: why Alice, the aliens will allowed it. Now that they alone, it's time to find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them go by themselves, won't you worried?\" Carl asked. \"Worry about what?\" Alice said. \"They might team up, run away, try to expose us and such.\" Carl said. \"I'm not worry, I believe in Jake. Aren't you?\" Alice said. \"You know what? How about we go back to my place and continue?\" Carl said with a little shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blink of eye, they're transported back to Frank's apartment, warm with heater. Today was Frank's day off, but he has a part time job at night, still plenty of time to kill. \"Let's start from beginning.\" Carl sat on the couch and said, \"You always said no to interfere human society, keep it secret from others, and borrow me more Alien techs. Why this time so different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let Tom knew some of our secrets, make him a fake identity, hacked into bank, send him away without brainwashing or something. It's like you intent to break every rule you make. \" Carl said. \"You sure have detective instinct.\" Alice teased. \"It doesn't need Frank's instinct to see something's wrong. Now, tell me the truth.\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that complicated. Remember the ultimate rule?  'No human killed during this cooperation.' Though that has nothing to do with us, but 'your' death still causes us a lot of trouble.\" Alice explained, \"At that time, we don't know whether the killer knows anything about us, so we have to find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we knew he knows nothing, our work has done. The rest of the plan is all your decision. We provide help as usual, and this time partly also because Jake promised he will take full responsibility.\" Alice said. \"Wait what? Jake the one that in charge?\" Carl surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should let Jake answers that.\" Alice said, \"About the rest, faking a new identity isn't much affect to human society, under this circumstance. We lie about hacking into bank, we actually just opened an account and transferred in some of our fund money. And finally, we didn't always use brainwash or wipe memory to hide our existence, we are more civilized than you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But let me do all the dirty works,\" Carl said. \"By your choice. And speaking of that, your support on Jake's plan is more surprising to us.\" Alice tackled back. \"You wanna said I'm under influence of Frank's personality again? we've been over this before.\" \"Yeah, but I think we should make some routine mental check, especially now you can't go back to your life.\" Alice sound sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never want to go back to my life in the first place.\" Carl pointed out, \"And even changing life messed up my mind, so what? Can't I be good?\" \"If you say so.\" Seemed like Alice still won't let this subject go, but she didn't push Carl either. \"Anyway, if nothing else, how about you beam us to Jim's apartment, we wait Jake over there.\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's home when Carl was touring the house, and even helped tiding up a little bit. It's a two-floor house with an attic, no yards, old but not too shabby, and convenience. Jim bought it years ago, when he and his ex-wife just married. After their divorce Jim got the house, but lose everything else. With nothing else to look for, he planned to just die in this house someday, alone or not, if not because Carl and Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, make yourself home,\" Jake said with a bit sarcasm. \"Tom's on the plane to Toronto safely?\" Carl ignored his sarcasm. \"I guess.\" Jake put down his jacket, then sat on Jim's usual couch. After up all night, and still going to work later, Jake too tired to make small talk, so he straightly asked, \"You guys must be here for a reason, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice told me that you two have some sort of deal.\" Carl said, he's more curious than angry about being kept in the dark. \"Oh... thought I can have some time to ease you in,\" Jake sat up, in all seriousness, \"Carl, this is the end to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lied, I won't accompany you on your journey, or experiment, anymore. I want to stay here forever, I will be Jim Rogers until I die. This way Tom can contact me whenever without suspicious. This is my choice.\" Caught him off guard, Carl don't know what to react. He finally asked, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Jake looked sad, but his voice was calm, \"Growing up, I, Jacob Harlan was a social awkward boy. I don't have friends, my family always absence. But I told myself that's okay, at least I have a decent life. I have a boring but well-paid job, My saving was enough for the rest of my life and more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I still looking for connection, whether with wife, family, or friend, any kind of relationship. Knowing that I have a place before going places, knowing I'm not alone. Mike gave me one. Yep, that sounds gay. But Mike was the best thing that happened in my life. He's a good man, a good husband, and most important to me, a good friend. A bad influence, yes, but a sincere friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I betrayed him. I dragged him into this, and he ended up dead. Yes, you're the one that forced me at first, but I would be lying if I said I don't enjoyed a bit. Yes, we can't predicted he would be killed, but if I really don't want to involve him at all, I will find a way no matter what. I let jealousy get the best of me, deep down I envy his life, I want his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you still can, I can transform you back.\" Carl realized that's a dumb idea before he finished the sentence. \"And remind myself that I caused his death every time I look into the mirror? No thanks.\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? This is some kind of punishment for yourself? Stuck in this miserable old man's life? Just for a friend?\" Carl tried different strategy, \"What about the real Frank and Jim? Aren't their lives matter too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jim now lives Mike's life, I don't think he would complain that, we both know Mike was like a model of American Dream. As for Frank, that's up to you, if you don't change him back, sure he's older and alone, but he won't have to worry the danger in the line of duty, and money.\" Jake continued, \"And yes, it's a punishment for myself that I can think of, that's the least I can do. Maybe someday I will regret, maybe not, but for now that's what I choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! If you're not coming with me, I'll go after Mike's family.\" Carl try different move--threaten, \"I don't mind getting my hands dirty if that's what the cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you will not.\" Jake didn't even flinch, \"You're not a good guy, I'll give you that, but you're not killer or torturer type of criminal either. We spend months together, I think I know you enough. There's line you wouldn't cross, and it's not because you were affected by other's mind, it's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The proof is whoever you become, you didn't even try to ruin their life. You didn't make my old life worse, you didn't mess up Mike's family, you didn't fool around Frank's job. You are just a selfish man enjoying someone else's life, and you can do that without me.\" Jake paused, \"Beside, Alice won't agree to harm any human, so that's not going to work anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Carl turned to Alice, \"Alice, are you gonna let him go just like that?\" \"Jake wasn't the one signed contract with us, and our evaluation said we can trust him to keep secret.\" Alice answered, \"To be honest, we are more agreed on his deal. He promised to be like middle man for us, help tracking Jim's status, visit Donald, and maybe useful later for other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing only ally, before Carl can think of his next move, Jake provided him some ideas, \"Now, you can brainwash me with the device, make me your puppet or whatever, I won't stop you. Maybe that's good for me too, forget all this. But if you consider me as your friend, I hope you can respect my decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl speechless. He knew he had lost him, and there's nothing he can do about it. Brainwash was never occured to him, Jake was right, they became friend along the way, friend he ever had in a long time. Is it finally came to this?</span></div></div>",

Now, I'll have to go and prepare for work.\" Jake said, as he stood up and went upstairs, leaving Carl and Alice in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl couldn't think of anything to help control the situation. He didn't have any card left.  \"It's all your fault, you know?\" He starts blaming Alice. \"How so?\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you guys can found the killer sooner, Jake and I won't ended up here, and he would still be Adam, but since he can't facing Mike anymore, he would follow me to anywhere else I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's your decision to follow his plan. Beside, that leads us to Tom, a perfect candidate for punish Donald without killing him. If you think about it, maybe that's what you called fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl knew that, but that doesn't mean he can't felt mad. With nothing else can be blamed, Carl took out the memory device, considered what Jake had suggested. It tooks Jake only 5 minutes to come back down, with clean worn-out shirt, 'clean' as in 'not smell yet'. Carl watched Jake walking around to get prepared for work, he adapted Detective Jim Rogers's life so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake pulled out a gun from his shoulder holster, checked it then put it back. \"Alright, I'm heading to station now. Want a lift?\" Jake said while adjusting his coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake didn't seemed to think about using the gun to defend himself, Carl can wipe his memory in a second if he want to. Maybe it's time to be aggressive, he's a selfish man like Jake said after all, what so surprise if he did brainwashed him to get what he want?</span></div></div>",

Detective Jim Rogers sat on a bench, watching people came and went, analyze what might they do for living, one of his occupational habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he noticed a man approaching. Caucasian, trimmed goatee, grey but thick combed hair suggested he might as old as Jim, a wedding ring on his finger. He has one of those look that can easily scored a good first impression. Average height and body size, wearing a suit like most people here. There's some business buildings near this park, office workers must've been often came here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim never saw this man before, and nothing about him stood out among the crowds, still something catches his eye. The man saw Jim looked at him, gave a smile and walked toward him, then sat right next to him, while there's still has some empty bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting hot for spring, isn't it?\" The man opened up a conversation with Jim.<br>\r\n\"Said the man with sweater vest,\" Jim teased, he knew who he was as soon as he talked: the guy who set up this meeting, the guy with thousand faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my workplace always felt colder than outside no matter what season,\" Carl Edwards, the man, laughed, \"Men at our age are getting weaker, don't you say, Jake?\"<br>\r\n\"Weak? Didn't you have better physical than original?\" Jim, used to be Jake Harlan, said.<br>\r\n\"Why yes, you remember. I am but I have to play the part, don't I?\"<br>\r\n\"Who are you this time? Some big shot in big company? Or do you just have some sort of old people fetish?\" Jim teased again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault that most of the powerful men are men.\" Carl said, \"This guy is a bank manager. I thought bank manager can do shady things under radar, turns out not that easy, if I want to make sure very discreet.\" Carl laying back and crossed his legs, \"Long story short, I'm about to ditch this and travel away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They allowed you to travel far now?\" Jake curious. Carl knew that 'they' referred to the aliens.<br>\r\n\"They didn't approve at first, but I convinced them if they want to continue to make progress on the project, eventually I can't stay in one place forever.\" Carl smiled, \"So, this could be your last chance to come with me. Are you bored of Jim's life yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you want to meet?\" Jake sighed, \"The answer is 'no'.\"<br>\r\n\"You sure? I'm will be gone for a long time, don't say I didn't asked you.\"<br>\r\n\"No.\" Jake still gave a simple answer, with no explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Find. Anyway, how's life treating you lately?\" Carl changed the subject, \"I heard Detective Rogers is very hardworking recently, and cleaned himself up pretty nicely, cutting alcohol and cigarette, it's like he's a new person. And is that new suit? Isn't it a little over detective's paycheck?\" Carl pointed Jim's clothes. Jim was wearing a suit too, but unlike old worn-out cheap one that last time Carl saw, this is new and neat, less 'detective vibe'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to know, it's two-for-one sale. Still, it's a huge improvement compared to Old Jim. I chose to live this life, doesn't mean I had to stay sloppy. And my new side job needs a better wardrobe.\" Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Side job?\" Carl asked.<br>\r\n\"Seemed like Alice didn't told you all about me.\" Jake mocked, \"Then maybe I shouldn't either. All I can say is I'm kinda working for Alice sometime now, and it paid pretty well too.\"<br>\r\n\"They PAID you? Look at me, I didn't get a penny since beginning, I have to find money on my own! And failed!\" Jake grumbled, \"Don't tell me they gave you some alien devices too?\" Jake silent, but the question has answered, Carl frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, \"...Let's just move on.\" Carl said, \"How's the other two?\" \"Who?\" \"You know, Tom and... Dan?\" \"It's Donald.\" Jake corrected him, \"Tom adapted his new body very well, had many sex along the road, if you believe him.\" \"Yeah, you had no idea how good Frank's body is.\" Carl confirmed it. \"Anyway, he currently settled in a small town, don't know will it be permanent, got a new job as security guard.\" \"Wait, I thought he said he never want risky work anymore. What about accountant?\" \"Guess he can't deny his nature. I won't surprised if eventually he will become the town sheriff or something like that.\" \"Fool always be fool.\" Carl teased, but deep down he envied the man with dedication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for Donald,\" Jake continued, \"I visit him every weekend. He acted like how Tom used to be, but more confuse, saying more things that don't make sense, other than that nothing suspicious. Kinda feel pity for him, well, when I forgot who he really was.\" Jake paused, talked about Donald reminded him someone. \"He got what he deserved, after all.\" Carl said, it's something he knew he shouldn't make fun of, at least not in front of Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn. How's Jake and... Mike?\" Jake finally asked what's on his mind the whole day. Ever since he became Jim Rogers, he didn't check on his old life once. He could've poke around by himself, but he didn't. \"Huh? I thought you would asked Alice to keep you update.\" \"I didn't.\" \"Well, I changed Frank back to himself, but right now the one who live as Jacob Harlan isn't this guy.\" Carl pointed to himself, \"That's another story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Jim Rogers is still Mike, nothing happened. Not surprise, I did put a lot of work on their altered memory.\" Carl said. No news is good news. Jake felt relax a little bit, and subconsciously took out a cigarette. He did tried to cut down smoking, it's his first cigarette today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked some more before Jake finished the cigarette. Carl had to back to work, knowing he failed on persuaded Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's time I'm more Jim than Jake, and other way around. As Jim, I'm very regret not to take your offer, but as Jake, I never doubt my decision. I don't know what I do can make any different, I don't know what I'm searching, I don't have every answer, I just... go on, one step at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl didn't know what Jake want to say, he may never understand why Jake did what he did. But they still crossed paths from time to time, sometime Jake help Carl, sometime Jake asked for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jake never went with Carl. Whether he still remembered who he was or not, he died as Jim Rogers years later, a retired detective who never make promotion, but sure helped a lot of people.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he was driving, a loud jingle began playing in his pants pocket. He pulled the phone out and saw a name, \"Alexa\". Well who would this be? Harlan's wife? A secretary? His mistress? With anticipation, Carl answered the phone. \"Yeah? Whaddaya want,\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright,\" came the voice on the other end, young and high-pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Who wants to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a giggle on the other end. \"It's me, daddy! Your daughter,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaughter? Yes, that jogs something in his memory. A 14-year-old daughter, Alexis; a first year student at the prestigious Barnwell Academy, an elite private school where most of the children of prominent people in the city attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, of course,\" Carl said with a laugh. \"I'm sorry baby, I've just had a long night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, really, because you'd never call me baby,\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry. So what do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, remember what I was supposed to do tonight? Becky, Shauna and I were going bowling and then you'd pick us up and drop us off at Shauna's for a sleepover, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course! How could I forget,\" Carl says warmly. \"So you need me to pick you up then? Alright, I'll be there in a few. Just wait out front for me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he hung the phone up. He was not in a particular mood to play chaperone for Harlan's brat and her friends but he figured there could be no harm in it. If this Shauna was the friend of his current form's daughter then that meant she lived in a fancy neighborhood. Maybe Carl could pay a \"visit\" to some of the homes there and rob them blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part is, that asshole Harlan would get in trouble and not him! So he drove to the bowling alley, the only one in town, and stopped as he saw three teenage girls waiting in front. This too seemed to jog some memories of Harlan's. Alexis was the dark-haired girl with looks she must've gotten from her mother. The girl with light-brown hair was Shauna Greenberg, the daughter of Roy Greenberg who was the most prominent accountant in town and whose client included mainly the other well-off. The girl with the sandy hair was Becky Kauffman, the daughter of John Kauffman who ran Kauffman Law, one of the biggest law firms in town. Both girls were her daughter's long time best friends and regarded Harlan as something of an uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, Carl was right on the money. All of these girls came from rich families which meant rich neighborhoods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Shauna dislodged memories of her family's address so he drove straight there. As was usual when Carl dropped off his daughter and her friends at one of their homes, he decided to play the role of chauffeur and hold the door open for his passengers. First Alexis, who exited and gave him a quick hug. Then Shauna who did the same. Finally Becky who, having recently hit a growth spurt, was awkward coming out which caused her to trip and fall into Carl's arms. They both tumbled to the ground and stayed like that, Becky laying on top of him, as they processed what had just happened. Finally, grabbing Becky, Carl was able to pull himself and her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I'm sorry Mr. Harlan,\" Becky stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's not a problem,\" Carl reassured the now upset girl. He grabbed her purse from the backseat and thought he noticed a phone drop out but paid it no mind; it might come in handy later. When he handed it back to her he noticed tears starting to well up and come from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it is a problem. I'm all tall and awkward now and I keep tripping over myself. I'm such a klutz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't cry, it happens to everybody. You'll get used to the new height,\" Carl says as he wipes some tears from Becky's eyes. Becky nods and with that heads into the house with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice girl, sweet girl,\" Carl said as he took the finger that still had her tears and licked it, \"Salty too.\" He laughed at his own little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he wanted some smokes, but something a little fancier, before heading back to Harlan's, Carl stopped at a nearby convenience store and grabbed some cigars. However after paying he began feeling funny again, the same sort of feeling he had earlier. Crap, was he gonna have to use the bathroom? Was it diarrhea? Carl grabbed his cigars and dashed to the bathroom, locking the door. Inside he could feel something shifting and changing and to his shock, he looked in the mirror and watched it take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got younger, smaller, thinner, his hair became longer, he became prettier. He became Alexis, Harlan's daughter. It was her, right down to the clothes she had been wearing. \"What the fuck,\" he said in his new higher-pitched voice. He then felt the same feeling coming on again and watched as he changed once more, his face becoming a slight bit puffier, his nose becoming larger, glasses appearing on his face and braces on his teeth. His hair become shorter but brown and wavier. He become slightly shorter and heaier, his hips became a little wider, his breasts a little bigger. His clothes became a tight, low-cut shirt and dark jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe became Shauna. He ran his tongue over his braces, his hands over his chest and hips. \"This is so fucking weird,\" he said in Shauna's voice. And then the change happened again. He got taller, much taller, approaching well into the upper five foot range. He became skinnier as well. The glasses and braces disappeared, the hair became a short, sandy bob tied at the top back by a short ponytail. Short jean shorts sat atop long legs and a large greay t-shirt hung just above the end of the shorts as his chest became smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no longer Shauna, but Becky! And more than physically as instantly a lot of memories and her personality started coming to him to the point where he had to remind himself he was Carl turned into this Becky girl, not the girl herself. How had this happened? He was just Shauna a second ago, could he go back? He thought about Shauna and becoming her, he felt the transformation but stopped partway through. The girl in the mirror looked like a mash up of Shauna and Becky. He tried again and was able to complete the transformation though he felt tired and straight. He tried turning back into Becky and found that easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering, he tried turning into Harlan but no dice. He tried his own shape as well but again, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened? Was he stuck as these girls? Unsure what to do, he dashed out of the restroom and into his car. He took out and lit one of the cigars and began smoking. He caught sight of himself in the rearview mirror and thought it was a sight, the cute, thin Becky puffing away on a cigar. \"Goddamn, but it's kinda turnin' me on,\" he said, his speaking style sounding weird in the girl's voice. \"Knowin' that it's me controllin' her and makin' her do and say these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to know what he could do with the seeming ability to shapeshift. He wanted to know more about it. But maybe he should just get home although that would be a dangerous prospect as he was now. There was another method: Becky's phone in the backseat. He could call up her father and go home... to Becky's home! He could feel her mind and her memories right there. He could make up a story about a fight with her friends or somethng and then impersonate her. Until he could figure out his powers and how to get back to normal, he could be Becky Kauffman.</span></div></div>",

Carl sat silently on the bench as he downed a nice cold can of beer, enjoying his freedom, such as it was, alone in the night.  He let out a loud, deep belch, and he started to get a familiar hankering, one he\u2019d felt so many times before. It was really beyond explaining very well...like the need to scratch an irritating itch, but so much more intense.  Accordingly, Carl reached into his pocket and got out the cigarettes he\u2019d just purchased.  He pulled one of the long white sticks from it home snuggly within the pack, fingering it with great anticipation.  Carl reached down to his pocket and felt about for his lighter, finding...nothing at all.  \"Where the hell is my li...\u201d he began as he searched his pants pockets more furiously.  He pulled out the lining of his pockets, finding nothing but the change from his recent purchase and some lint.  \"God fucking dammit,\u201d he said exasperated, \"figures I wouldn\u2019t have a damn lighter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl shook his head in irritation.  He glanced up and saw something across the street, a woman.  The night was dark, but Carl noticed as she passed under a streetlight and close to a restaurant sign that she had tanned skin, probably of Mexican descent.  She seemed to be in her late 30s or so, with a relatively trim figure, but she had plenty of bounce in her boobs, hips, and ass, as (rightly or wrongly) is stereotypical of Latinas.  The woman carried a purse over one shoulder and a rather full shopping bag over the other, and she stared straight ahead as long dark hair cascaded down from her head and flowed behind her.  She wore a tight-fitting maid\u2019s uniform that hugged her wide, motherly hips and showed a hefty amount of her cleavage.  Carl got up, leaving his beer, and jogged across the street after her.  \"Lady, do you have a li...\u201dCarl began.  \"Save it senor; I\u2019m tired,\u201d she said in an exhausted tone, a pronounced accent running through her speech.  Carl persisted, \"Mam I got cigarettes but no light...\u201d She cut in again, \u201cBuddy, the last guy to use that line ended up trying to fondle my boobs; I got ninos at home ok, so save it for somebody who cares!\u201d she said, irritated.  Carl sped up so that he was next to the woman.  \"Lady,\u201d he said, \"I\u2019m sure your ninos are great, and I\u2019d be a lot better if I just had a fucking light...\u201d Suddenly the woman turned on Carl.  She dropped her shopping bag and raised her arm to strike at Carl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, Carl put his arm up in self-defense, grabbing the woman\u2019s arm before she could hit him.  As Carl's hand closed around her wrist, felt strange...dizzy...different somehow.  Carl suddenly got shorter, losing a good eight inches in height.  His skinned darkened to a beautiful tan; all his body hair simply receded into his form.  His skin became smooth, and arms and legs took on a more feminine character, coarse muscles being replaced by a soft, womanly exterior.  His hips flared out into a wide, child-bearing pair, and his ass fluffed up significantly.  His abs softened up into a toned but feminine belly, and two giant globes sprouted from his chest.  Lastly, long dark hair sprouted from his head, and his face contorted, changed, and otherwise squished itself into a feminine one, complete with big ruby lips and pearly white teeth.  It all happened to fast Carl had no clue what was going on.  Smoked enveloped Carl\u2019s new body as his clothes were replaced with the woman's tight-fitting maid's uniform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman dropped her purse and backed away in horror at seeing her exact double.  She raised a finger accusingly at Carl.  \"Dios mio!  Es el Diablo!\u201d she shouted, a look of pure terror on her face as she turned and ran away as quickly as she could.  \"Lady, I just wan...\u201dCarl began, then he stopped himself, hearing a strange voice with a strange accent coming from his mouth.  He put his hand up to his mouth in surprise, and he was all the more amazed to feel a mouth that was smaller than his own and a face that was smooth and without the stubble of whiskers.  Carl looked down at a pair of dainty, delicate hands.  \"Oh my god,\u201d Carl said, with a clear Mexican accent escaping his lips.  Carl moved his hands down to the maid\u2019s uniform he now wore and to the pair of large globes pushing out from his chest.  He cupped them, hefting them upward and moaning as a result.  \"Holy shit,\u201d he said, amazed as he moved his hands farther down and felt out his hips and gave his bubble butt a good slap.  Carl ran over to a side mirror on a car and looked at himself.  Sure enough, the Mexican woman looked back at him, and he smiled broadly with the face that was now his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust by touching the woman, Carl\u2019s entire body had shifted into hers.  Carl stood silently, strutting around, hips swaying and boobs jiggling, as he tested his body on a short walk around the silent evening.  What to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tShe dropped her purse.  Carl takes it and tries to learn about her.<br>\r\n2)\tHe should test out his power more.  He looks for another person to touch and transform into.<br>\r\n3)\tExamine his body more.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carl walked through the darkened streets for a few blocks, enjoying the sway and jiggle of his new body.  His boobs jostled about with each step, and he grabbed his own fluffy ass every couple minutes.  After a bit of a walk, Carl had made his way into a nice area of town, a fairly upscale locale with nice homes, manicured lawns, first-class entertainment, and so on.  Glancing up, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl noticed a place he\u2019d heard about before:  'Rocco\u2019s Bar', as indicated by a big neon red sign out front.  \"I\u2019ve heard people blab about this place...a lot of rich suits in there,\u201d Carl said, his body\u2019s accent still clear.  Calling the place a bar was a little misleading, actually.  There were indeed drinks...lots of them...but the place was more than that.  Rocco\u2019s was the sort of place rich people went to blow off some steam...in the carnal sense.  There was a public area where you could mingle, yes, but there were also a great many private rooms full of people ready to cater to any sexual desire or unusual fetish you might have.  Men went there to have sex with beautiful women without consequence; women went there to share a bed with men not their husbands...women even went there to...shall we say...become familiar...with other women.  Membership was quite exclusive, and it cost a great deal of money; the guys at the door knew most customers by name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl gazed up at the bright neon sign.  \"Lot of power brokers in there,\u201d he mused, \"lots of hot, powerful bodies I could sort of magically accidently bump into, then I could walk around in their shoes.\u201d  Carl looked down at the busty maid's body he now wore.  \"This one\u2019ll never get me in...hot as it is,\u201d Carl said as he poked his tits yet again.  Carl sighed, looking up from his chest to find a customer, somebody he could shift into.  He needed the body of a rich person to get him into the place; only then could he rub elbows (or perhaps other body parts) with those other powerful people so he could later shapeshift into them...he just needed to touch them.  Carl glanced across the parking lot, where he noticed a couple options...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tA young man of about 17.  Of course he was quite young, but the rich and famous (and their children) can do as they wish, regardless of age.  He was about 5 foot 10, probably about 160 lbs.  His body was toned and muscular.  He had on a dark suit...a bit ruffled up from a night of fun, and curly blonde hair bounced about his head.  Drunk as hell, he staggered in the general direction of a limo that awaited him.<br>\r\n2)\tA woman in her mid-40s.  Red hair cascaded down from her head, and a tight black dress with a very low neckline showed off her creamy white skin and a wonderful bit of bouncy cleavage.  She was decked out in make-up and lipstick, as well as a good deal of jewelry.  She had a nice fluffy ass and big breasts, but a quite toned set of arms and a taut belly.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"He\u2019ll work for now,\" Carl said as he moved toward the staggering young boy.  Carl strutted, hips swaying and tits bouncing, toward the drunken boy who was staggering toward the car.  On the way by, he sort of nonchalantly bumped into the intoxicated young man.  \"He...he...HEY!  Wa..Watch where yur goin la...lady!\" the boy eventually yelled out.  He stood up to the extent he could and watched as Carl walked away.  \"Hey baby,\" he said in a softer voice, \"bring that meaty ass back here and lemme squeeze it...tits too!\" he yelled out as Carl just kept walking.  \"At least the boy's got good taste,\" Carl mused quietly to himself as a limo driver shoved the boy into the car.  Carl walked for a moment until he got behind a large bunch of bushes.  He looked around for a moment, making sure nobody was around.  \"Here goes nothin',\" Carl said as he closed his eyes and concentrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl gained a few inches in height suddenly.  His legs tightened up, picking up some muscle and losing their feminine shape.  Those wide, swaying hips and that wonderful bouncy ass rocketed inward and tightened up, respectively.  His belly tightened up into a respectable set of abs, and the giant globes jiggling about on his chest quickly and sadly receded.  His long black hair was replaced by tufts of blonde curls, and his face morphed into that of a 17-year-old boy.  Lastly, and perhaps most pleasantly, he felt a certain member down below pop up.  The erect dick appeared quite odd and made a bit of a tent in the maid's uniform\u2026.until that uniform was quickly and magically replaced with the dark suit the boy had been wearing.  Carl felt about himself a bit, prodding his newly flattened chest and belly with masculine hands.  \"Well this is a welcome change,\" he said as he felt his mid-section and jumped up and down a bit to make his dong bounce a bit.  It felt...normal...to have something dangling down there again.  Overall, the body Carl now used was refreshingly normal, if a fair bit less fun and exciting than the last one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl emerged from behind the bushes and walked toward Rocco's, his polished shoes clicking on the blacktop.  He stepped under the awning past the parking valet, and a large gentleman in a nice suit opened the door for him.  \"Thanks dude,\" Carl said, nodding to the man on the way in.  Inside, a plethora of dancers and colored lights greeted Carl.  \"So this is how the other half parties eh?\" Carl said to himself as he looked around at the women pole dancing for gawking customers, as well as a few muscle-bound men bringing drinks to doting women dripping in pearls.  \"Ah, Mr. Bancort, back again so soon?  Well it\u2019s great to have you!  I must say you look to be in better condition than when I last saw you,\" a woman said to Carl.  Carl smiled and nodded, looking the woman up and down.  She seemed to be in her mid-30s and of average height.  A long set of smooth, muscular legs gave way to a wide set of hips and a toned mid-section.  Her breasts were quite large and hanging out of the top of a dress that stuck quite tightly to the woman's very curvy form.  Carl made sure to reach out and shake the beautiful woman's hand, noting a name tag next to her wonderful boobs that read \"Katrina.\" \"Well, Katrina, with beautiful women like you here, how could I stay away,\" Carl answered.  Katrina smiled, \"Oh, sir, you\u2019re too much haha.  The recent ugliness in the market hasn't battered your father's holdings too much I hope?\"  Carl paused, hoping he could play the part convincingly.  \"Oh no,\" he chuckled, \"Dad's holding his own.\"  \"Well that\u2019s reassuring,\" Katrina said, \"we\u2019d hate to lose such good customers!\"  She took you by the arm and escorted you through the room, past the neon lights and busty waitresses.  The place seemed to find a happy middle between a party setting and a quiet, enjoyable evening.  She led you to a hallway with a number of doors, behind which were luxury rooms with women (and in some cases men) willing to do things most people only dream of.  \"We have you room ready for you sir, as always, you\u2019re cup of tea is still...oh dear...let me remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\t\"...busty, middle-aged teacher-types, right?  ...Cougars?\"<br>\r\n2)\t\"...horny black women...in professional attire right?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Speeding up, Carl caught her well before she reached the door.  \"Excuse me mam,\" Carl began, \"we have a matter that requires your urgent attention, so if you\u2019ll just come this way...\" Carl lied, taking the woman softly by the arm and guiding her toward a large collection of bushes that offered some privacy.  \"Why...well all right miss, but I can't imagine what the matter could be...\" the woman began in a quite confused tone as they neared the secluded area.  The two women stepped behind some bushes, and Carl looked about to make sure no one shared the area with them.  \"Well miss, what was it you needed from me?\" the woman said with a pensive tone and smile, \"I must say I don\u2019t see anybody else back here so I don\u2019t know whom 'we' refers to...\"  \"It's just me,\" Carl stated flatly, \"and what I need is you mam...well...your body anyway.\"  The woman smiled broadly, looking Carl up and down, \"Oh my,\" she said as she moved closer and pulled Carl close, grabbing a firm hold of his luscious ass, \"I didn't think this sort of thing started until we got inside,\" she said in an excited voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was blown away...and a fair bit excited, but he had a job to do.  \"Woah woah there lady,\" Carl said as he backed away from the grabby woman, who promptly got a very hurt look on her face.  \"Why...I don\u2019t understand; you said you wanted my body.  I want yours too,\" she said, a mischievous smile creeping across her face.  Carl paused, \"Sadly, only one of us can get what we want,\" Carl declared with a laugh, as he began to concentrate.  He felt his body gain a few inches in height.  His hips and ass retained their curvy shape, and his skin went from the tan color characteristic of the Latina woman to a creamy white color like that of the woman who stood before him.  His long hair went from wavy and dark to curly and red.  Carl\u2019s face slimmed out a little as his skin changed to a creamy white, and a wrinkled appeared here and there, since the body he would now have was in its mid-40s.  Carl\u2019s belly and arms remained taut and toned, and breasts stayed big, but sagged just a tiny bit.  Lastly, his maid's uniform, stretched by his body's new proportion, transformed into a tight-fitting black dress with a neckline that plunged so low as to reveal wonderful mounds protruding from his new chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl looked down at his new body, poking and prodding at his jello-like boobs with a manicured hand.  He glanced back up at his companion, his double, as he brushed some red hair out of his eyes.  \"Oh my goodness, how did you...what the he...\" the woman said as she backed away in amazement and horror.  Suddenly, her eyes seemed to go weird and roll back a little, and the woman fell to the ground unconscious, having fainted from the shock.  Carl stepped up to her, heels clicking on the blacktop.  He looked down at the woman's unconscious body.  \"Thank you for your cooperation,\" Carl said mockingly in his best stern, cop-like voice, holding back a laugh.  He then turned and walked, hips swaying and boobs jiggling in the stunning evening dress, toward Rocco's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached the door of the place, and a large man in a suit opened the door for him.  Carl chuckled a bit as the man struggled to remove his eyes from Carl\u2019s bouncing chest on the way in.  Once inside, Carl looked around briefly at a place that was half-way between a party and an elegant evening out.  Rich folks\u2014beautiful women and mostly older men walked around wearing suits that probably cost as much as a degree from Harvard.  \"Hello, Mrs. Bellacroft, how are you?\" a woman walked up to Carl and said.  He glanced up at the lady and smiled, looking her up and down.  She was a petite blonde with wide hips, a narrow waist, and boobs so big they had to be fake.  The name-tag on her thin white blouse red \"Candy.\" \"I'm fine,\" Carl said, smiling as he made sure to shake Candy\u2019s hand, \"just here for a good time.\"  \"Very well mam,\" Candy said, \"will Mr. Bellacroft be joining you this evening?  Or will you be enjoying the company of our female employees this evening?\"  Carl paused, \"Well, I actually think I'm just going to mingle this evening.\"  Candy smiled, \"Wonderful mam!\" she said, leading you to a quiet table and showering you with drinks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sat for a few minutes, enjoying the view from Mrs. Bellacourt\u2019s luscious body.  He watched as the rich and powerful walked (or, in some cases, staggered) past, doing things their spouses would surely not approve of.  Suddenly, something caught Carl's eye\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tAn old acquaintance of Carl's\u2026<br>\r\n2)\tThe REAL Mrs. Bellacourt is in the room and is making her way toward Carl and not looking happy.       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then as his eyes glanced the room he saw a familiar looking figure walking in the door. It took a moment for it to click, but Carl quickly recognized his dark-haired, ex-girlfriend Melissa, who had dumped him several years back. \"Huh, conservative as ever!\" Carl grumbled in his new voice, as he looked Melissa up and down. Standing 5' 6\" tall, she was wearing a red halter top that didn't show too much of her modest breasts, and a pair of low-rise jeans along with a pair of strapy, high heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's this dick?\" Carl grunted further, noticing the man Melissa was with. \"She must be going for the muscle bound dumb guys now!\" Carl laughed to himself, as he watched Melissa's new boyfriend, a 6' 2\" individual wearing a tight, black t-shirt that emphasized his muscular physique and a pair of black corderoys to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Mrs Bellacroft, enjoy!\" Candy suddenly said, as she brought another tray of drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er...thanks babes!\" Carl winked at the young woman, taking a moment to caress one of her manicured hands with his own. Candy just smiled and walked off, her shapely rear giving Carl quite the view. \"Damn! I'd be hard by now if I still had my dick!\" he chuckled. \"Hmm, ...talking of hard!\" he then muttered, as he reached up to grope his large tits, noticing how erect his nipples were. \"This body is hyper!\" he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Carl turned his attention back to Melissa and her hew chunkhead of a beau, as they were taken to an empty table across the other side of the room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Son of a bitch!\" Carl said in amazement as he looked in Melissa\u2019s direction some more.  A couple of tables behind Melissa and whatever dick she was with stood a man Carl hadn\u2019t seen in over a decade.  His name was Jackson Pearlman...Carl hadn\u2019t seen him since he was 18, but, after doing a double-take out of pure surprise, he was sure it was Pearlman.  \"Worthless pond-scum motherfucker!\" Carl lamented, causing a few strange looks from people at surrounding tables who'd never heard the beautiful Mrs. Bellacourt use such language.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen years before, Pearlman had been a man of about 40, with smooth talk, a trim figure, and dark hair.  Items two and three on that list were things of the past, it seemed.  Pearlman was a tall man, but he'd packed on quite a few pounds since Carl saw him last, his plump belly spilling over his waist-line and straining against the nice white dress shirt he wore.  A double chin had begun to develop, and his hair, though itself very much intact, had grayed a lot.  Fifteen years earlier, Carl and Pearlman had planned a job together.  They wanted to rob a big company called Endocom, which sold medical supplies around the world.  Pearlman, a man of greater age and experience than Carl, then 18, and asked if Carl would handle the leg work.  Carl was supposed to do the messy stuff\u2014pick locks, break windows, keep a look-out, beat up security guards, etc.\u2014while Pearlman did the tougher work of breaking into Endocom\u2019s database and bilking millions from its investors.  All was going well until somebody called the cops\u2026Pearlman, in fact.  He'd tipped off the cops, then hidden himself away to get Carl caught so that he wouldn\u2019t have to pay Carl the $50,000 he was owed for the job.  Having Carl in jail also meant nobody would be around to blackmail Pearlman while he enjoyed his misbegotten millions.  Having stolen the money anonymously, Pearlman bought a stake in the company and got himself on to Endocom's board of directors, where he sat still.  That was the first time Carl had done serious time.  Pearlman had gotten millions of stolen dollars and a good life\u2014a beautiful wife and kids, a grand house, as well as a great deal of other companionship the wife and kids didn\u2019t know about.  Carl, in contrast, had gotten years in jail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeething with rage, Carl glanced down at Mrs. Bellacourt\u2019s wonderful body\u2014her heaving breasts especially\u2014and realized that he didn\u2019t have to put up with the status quo anymore.  With his new powers, he could make Pearlman's life miserable.  He could shift into Pearlman's wife, his mother, his kids, his business partners, maybe even Pearlman himself, and ruin his story-book life.  Jackson Pearlman had made his fortune overnight, but he would watch his life fall apart slowly, and on Carl\u2019s schedule.  \"By the time I'm done with you you bastard, you\u2019ll fucking wish YOU had been the one in jail,\" Carl promised as he shook with rage.  How to begin his revenge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tOne of the busty beauties around Pearlman gets up to go to the bathroom (probably to adjust her boobs or something).  Carl could follow her into the restroom, touch her, take her body, and walk back out as her.  He could then get close to Pearlman, just to mess with him a little bit at first.<br>\r\n2)\tCarl decides to plan a bit first.  He goes to do some research on Pearlman, his family, Endocom, and so on, so that he knows the names and faces of people to shift into to fuck with Jackson Pearlman.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The woman was about 5' 6\" without heels and had a fairy short hairstyle for a woman, yet it was styled in a feminine way. Her tits, Carl estimated, had to be at least an E-Cup, and from the way they bounced as she walked...all natural. The low-cut, skimpy blue dress she wore clung to her cruvacious frame. \"How helpful!\" Carl mumbled in Mrs Bellacourt's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then maneuvered his current, buxom, red-headed body from behind his table and strutted across the room, his own, slightly flabby breasts jiggling with each step he took. And Carl followed the young blonde, who looked to be about 25, into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the bathroom, Carl looked around, and the only other person in there finished washing her hands and left, smiling as she passed Carl. With no other person making a noise, Carl could now hear the young woman he had followed, in one of the cubicles, relieving herself and humming a tune. He ascertained which cubicle she was in and then just stood outside of it...grinning. \"Knock knock!\" he whispered...before lifting one of his shapely legs and giving the door a swift kick...sending it flying open and scaring the girl half to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bitch...I need you for something...sort of!\" Carl said to her, before walking into the cubicle, where the blonde was standing up and hurriedly trying to pull up her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith hardly any effort, Carl grabbed hold of her neck and rammed her head into the cubicle wall...twice...knocking the girl out cold. As she slumped unconscious on the same toilet she had just got off, Carl smiled. \"Now...lets see!\" he said, rubbing his smooth chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the morphing process began to take an effect on Carl's body. The years of age that had taken their toll on Mrs Bellacourt's body rapidly dropped away, Carl looked down as his breasts lifted...and even expanded in size...stretching his already <i>restricting</i> black dress to the point of tearing. He felt a pleasant..tingling sensation between his changing legs as his middle-aged vagina was replaced by the blonde's young, moist twat, and lastly...as his face shifted into a new configuration and his hair shortened (also changing color)...his clothes and heels turned into those the blonde was wearing,  \"Nice!\" Carl grinned, as he reached up to his chest and groped his massive new tits, and he also ran his new hands over his delectable hips and his wonderful new ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll have a headache in the morning!\" Carl chuckled again, as he looked at the unconscious woman who sat slumped before him. He then exited the cubicle and jerry-rigged the door so nobody could open it for a while. \"Man...no wonder these chicks like this complain of back ache\" Carl briefly mumbled to himself as he adjusted his huge tits a little, amazed at how much they weighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...fuckface!\" Carl said, referring to Pearlman as he stood checking his new reflection in the mirror, \"Time to fuck up your life the way you fucked up mine\" he sneered. Turning on his heels...Carl then left the bathroom and headed towards where Pearlman was sat.</span></div></div>",

I trust you were keepin' these things good and bouncy for me,\" Pearlman said loudly, reaching out and drumming on the massive mounds that adorned Carl's chest, causing them to jiggle and shake mightily. \"You know it honey,\" Carl answered, smiling on the outside but cringing in every other way possible.  Carl moved his curvaceous form up to the table right across from Pearlman, making sure to lean forward so as to give Pearlman a good, clear view of his heaving chest.  \"So what does a big sexy man like you do for a living honey?\" Carl asked, batting his eyelashes and flashing a wide smile.  Pearlman leaned in toward Carl, close enough that the strong odor of vodka was clear in his breath.  \"I help run a great big company honey.  We're a medical company...anything you want I can get for you.  Botox...boob maintenance...you just gimme a call,\" he says drunkenly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohh...you must make lotsa money...that\u2019s so sexy,\" Carl cooed in Pearlman's ear, \"So you must have a great big house and a whole garage full of cars and everything right?\"  \u201cYeah yeah I gotta big house and lots of real nice cars...just bought a brand new Porsche last week...maybe you'd like to see it some time?\" he said.  \"Sure honey,\" Carl said, wanting to get some more information that might be of use to him.  \"So I don't suppose you\u2019ve got a family right?  I mean, if you did, you wouldn't be here,\" Carl said to Pearlman.  Pearlman signed and smiled a little bit, \"Yeah yeah I got a family...got three kids,\u201d he said.  \"Ohhhh that\u2019s so cute,\" Carl said in his sexiest voice, \"what are their names?\"  Pearlman took another shot of vodka and composed himself a little bit.  \"Well the first one is Connor...he\u2019s 13.  The kid's got this head full of really tangled, messed-up black hair.  He's not so little around the middle...gonna be like his daddy,\" Pearlman said, gesturing to his own full belly.  \"Every time I come home, he's bought himself a new album from some classic band...this week he's kinda stuck on Rush, so I hear 2112 about a dozen times a day,\" Pearlman said, \"and he's got all the t-shirts from all the bands too.\"  \"That's great,\" Carl said, \"I'll bet he grows up to be a great big rock star!\"  Pearlman continued, \"Then there's Kendall.  She's eight...she's got this long black hair, and she's always decked out in all these bracelets and necklaces...she\u2019s a little princess...fuckin' expensive.  She spends way too much time watching that...ahhh.....what\u2019s her damn name.....Miley Cyrus on Disney.  She bugged me into buying her all the DVDs and the posters and shit.\"  Carl laughed sexily, \"Well kids always have their fads honey,\" he said, \"and what about your other kid?\"  \"Well she's Lexi...she's just about to turn six.  She's such a tom-boy....wants to start kick-boxing and karate and shit like that.  She's so damn small she'd get her ass kicked.....and I don\u2019t think she's sure if she likes me yet, but she loves her mother.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOW Carl was certainly getting somewhere.  He needed details about Pearlman's life; he had to know the pressure points.  \"Oh my god, you must have a hell of a lot of work on your hands raising all those kids on your own baby,\" Carl said, shaking his head in amazement.  \"Well...it ain't on my own....I got a wife too...she takes care of the kids, so that's great,\" Pearlman said, shaking his head as if to indicate there was a drawback, \"but she ain\u2019t nearly as exciting as she used to be, if you know what I mean,\" he said.  Carl leaned in and smiled deviously, \"Ever bring the wife with you to places like this?\"  Pearlman got a WTF look on his face, \"Oh hell no....no Angie would hate this place......but what she don't know won\u2019t hurt her,\" Pearlman declared as he took another shot of vodka and chuckled a bit, sitting back comfortably in his chair and glancing around happily at his harem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl figured he'd made real headway.  He pushed back from the table and stood up.  \"Well honey, I have to go...gotta get plenty of sleep, otherwise I can\u2019t guarantee the structural integrity of my boobs haha,\" Carl declared.  \"Wait!\" Pearlman said as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a little rectangle and hurriedly wrote something down on it.  He reached across the table and handed Carl said rectangle.  Carl took it and looked down at it, noting that it was a business card.  It bore Endocom\u2019s name and logo, as well as Pearlman's name, office address, and office number.  Carl smiled, and he did so all the more as he did turned it over to see a home address and number as well, along with instructions telling him when it was and was not okay to call.  Carl looked across at Pearlman, who smiled widely and said, \"If you ever want to ride that Porsche baby, and maybe more...\"  Carl smiled and turned around to head for the door.  He walked, his body swaying and jiggling beautifully with every step, toward the door and out into the night.<br>\r\n1)\tCarl goes home for now...and resolves to bug Pearlman at work tomorrow.<br>\r\n2)\tCarl rests awhile but is determined to get to know Pearlman's family in the near future.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other mugger still tried to stab Carl, but quickly found himself disarmed and thrown a distance of 10 feet into some garbage cans. After knocking out his 'colleague', Carl then clicked up to the first, dazed mugger in his heels...and grabbed him by the neck...lifting him clean off the ground with just one of his feminine hands. \"Guess you'll think twice before you try mugging a Latina again huh?\" he said...before slamming the guy against the wall, knocking him out and then throwing him on top of his buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that felt fucking good!\" Carl snickered in his feminine tone, as he sashayed his sexy form out of the alleyway and headed home.</span></div></div>",

He walked over to the mirror and concentrated on his own form, watching with anticipation.  His long black hair receded; his arms became rough and hairy, and the wonderful globes deflated, leaving only Carl\u2019s flattened chest.  His hips narrowed a bit and his luscious ass lost some of its bounce.  Finally, the sexy maid\u2019s uniform was replaced with Carl\u2019s ratty clothes.  \"It\u2019s good to see me again,\u201d Carl said, a bit surprised at his rough voice as he gazed into the mirror at his own form.  Carl crawled into bed, tired and content in a form that, while less fun than the maid\u2019s, was refreshingly familiar.  He drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Carl awoke early.  He hopped a bus to Pearlman\u2019s offices at a big building downtown.  Stepping off the bus, Carl made his way over to a secluded area shielded from view by bushes on one side and the building on the other.  Carl concentrated on the familiar form of the Latina maid from the night before, figuring people would assume she was just there to clean the office, as many likely did.  The curvy hips and ass reappeared; the luscious breasts sprouted, and the uniform came to cover Carl\u2019s new form yet again.  \"Damn baby; you\u2019re\u2026.useful,\u201d Carl mused as he looked down at his form, noting the accent and strange voice that escaped his lips.  He walked through the building toward Pearlman\u2019s office.  Some walking and an elevator ride later, Carl, wearing the maid\u2019s body, stepped into the hallway, at the end of which was Pearlman\u2019s office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see a little girl playing down at the end of the hallway next to the door.  Carl headed down to meet the little girl.  She was quite small\u2026probably about 5 or 6 years old.  She wore tennis shoes and overalls, under which was a red shirt, and the words \"Power Rangers\u201d were visible, peaking out above the overalls.  Her dark hair was long in the back but short in the front.  Carl walked up to the little girl\u2026who was boxing with an imaginary opponent.  Seeing Carl, she stopped.  \"Hi, I\u2019m Lexi,\u201d she said, extending her hand to the person she presumed to be the maid.  \"Hi there, Lexi,\u201d Carl said, shaking the little girl\u2019s hand politely.  \"That\u2019s my daddy\u2019s office,\u201d she declared, motioning to the closed door.  \"Really?\u201d Carl said, smiling and nodding to little Lexi.  \"Yeah,\u201d Lexi said, nodding her head emphatically, \"mommy and daddy are in there....they\u2019re....they\u2019re fighting.\u201d  Carl frowned at Lexi, \"Does that make you sad, Lexi?\u201d  \"Yeah...yes it does,\u201d Lexi said in a depressed voice, \"my daddy gets mad a lot...at mommy...and at me too.\u201d  Carl could hear raised voices....Pearlman was insisting that he had been at an important business meeting the night before.  Lexi seemed to perk up.  \u201cWell hey I gotsta go fight some monsters okay?\u201d she said to Carl.  Carl smiled, \"All right,\u201d he said as he shook her little hand again, bidding her well.  Lexi then charged off, arms flailing about, and turned into a waiting room down the hallway a good distance.  \"Cute kid,\u201d Carl thought to himself as he watched Lexi run off to play.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then concentrated on her form.  The body of the busty maid shifted, her breasts flattening out and her hips narrowing.  Suddenly, Carl got shorter and his features softened into those of the cute  little girl, of little Lexi.  The maid\u2019s uniform was replaced with boyish overalls and tennis shoes.  Carl stood and looked up at the world around him, which seemed huge from his tiny body.  \"She's useful too,\u201d he mused to himself in his meek little voice.  He ran his tiny hands over his body, devoid of curves and sexiness his last body had.  It took a little getting used to...being six again.  Suddenly, the door opened behind Carl.  He looked up to see a woman of about 40 with blonde hair.  She wore a tight-fitting black dress that showed off a massive set of tits.  Her face was beautiful, but she looked sad.  She was dripping in gold and jewels, but tears had smeared her make-up; she\u2019d been crying\u2026a lot.  She glanced down and saw Carl, and she put on a brave face.  Smiling she reached down and scooped up her daughter\u2019s tiny form and gripped her tight.  \"Hey Lexi baby!\u201d she said with a grin, \"I thought you\u2019d be off fighting monsters!\u201d  Carl hugged the woman tightly, looking back into the office and seeing Pearlman standing there, and he looked pissed.  The woman quickly walked away from the scene so the person she thought was Lexi wouldn\u2019t know about the fight.  \"The monsters ran away!\u201d Carl said triumphantly, flexing Lexi\u2019s tiny arm muscles for her mother.  \"Oh they did huh...I knew you'd beat 'em,\u201d the woman humored her daughter.  \"Charlene?\u201d Carl heard Pearlman calling the woman from inside his office.  Charlene\u2019s smile disappeared.  She put Carl down and patted him on the bottom.  \"Hey go find some more monsters to fight, all right?\u201d she said, \"I have to go talk to daddy again.\u201d  \"Okay mommy,\u201d Carl said.  The woman turned and walked back into the office and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl waited there for a few moments listening to the couple argue.  Charlene insisted she knew Pearlman was a womanizer, and Pearlman denied it of course.  Suddenly someone taps Carl on the shoulder\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The real Lexi.<br>\r\n2) Someone Carl does not know.            <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carl stood there for a second, not sure how to react to this.  After a couple seconds, Lexi spoke.  \"Are you my imaginary friend?\u201d she asked in a very quiet, meek voice...the sort one would use to divulge a secret.  Carl thought fast...this might be useful, and he needed to come up with something.  Luckily for him he was talking to so young a kid that she would believe anything.  \"Yeah,\u201d he replied in the same secretive voice and a little girly smile.  Lexi smiled broadly, \"Everybody at school says they got imaginary friends too, and I always felt bad \u2018cause I never had one before, but here you are!\u201d she said, leaping forward and wrapping her arms around her double in a great big hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stood there awkwardly while the little girl embraced his tiny body, then she broke the hug and looked seriously at Carl.  \"Are you here to stop my mommy and daddy from fighting?

Lexi reached out and probed Carl\u2019s face, feeling it out with her little tiny fingers while Carl stood awkwardly and had his face contorted into a number of strange expressions.  \"How do you look like me?\u201d Lexi ask curiously.  Carl leaned in to Lexi, \"I gotta tell you a little secret,\u201d he said as he concentrated.  Suddenly, he gained several feet in height.  Her short black hair was suddenly replaced by long blonde strands cascading from her head.  His body aged into its forties, and his tiny hips suddenly flared out into a broad, womanly shape.  Lastly, a set of massive, bouncy breasts sprouted from his chest, straining mightily against the tiny Power Rangers shirt and the overalls.  Suddenly, those clothes just sort of...smoked away and were replaced by revealing black dress that left little, particularly in the boob region, to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation complete, Carl smiled down at Lexi, now much taller than she was.  \"Woooooooowwwwww,\u201d she said as she stared up in amazement.  \"I can look like lots of people,\u201d Carl said with a smile.  \"You look like my mommy!\u201d Lexi said, wide-eyed.  \"That\u2019s right,\u201d Carl said approvingly, \"imaginary friends have magical powers.\u201d  Lexi stood and smiled up at her mother's body.  \"But you can't tell anybody about me, or else I gotta go away,\u201d Carl said in a cautionary tone.  \"Oh okay,\u201d Lexi said, making a motion as if she were zipping her mouth shut.  This was great!!!  Carl couldn\u2019t watch Pearlman all the time, but Lexi trusted him completely.  He could use her to get information, and she didn\u2019t seem to like her dad much anyway...she'd be all the more willing to work with Carl, spilling the beans whenever he asked, especially if she could be convinced that what she did was necessary to make mommy and daddy get along.  What better way to chip away at Pearlman\u2019s empire than to turn his own family against him.  \"Well I gotta go for now,\u201d Carl said, standing up and marveling at the bounce of Charlene\u2019s breasts on his chest.  \"Wait wait wait,\u201d Lexi said, reaching up and grabbing him by the arm, \"you should come by my house tomorrow!  We can play and talk!\u201d  \"All right, I will,\u201d Carl said with a smile.  \"Who are you gonna look like then?  How will I know it\u2019s you?\u201d Lexi asked.  \"Well I don\u2019t know, Lexi, who do you want me to look like?\u201d  Lexi rubbed her chin for a moment, thinking the question out.  \"Oh oh I know I know!  You can look like my neighbor lady Laura!  She's old like mommy...I think she's like 40...very pretty.  She's always out in front of her house gardening.  Daddy always says she's got big boobs...then mommy gets mad at him, and they both tell me I'm too young to know what that means.\u201d  Carl chuckled a bit, \"All right, I'll come as Laura!\u201d he said.  \"Yay,\u201d Lexi said, \"come in the side door...no one ever comes that way, but I'll let you in if your come at about 2:00 okay?\u201d  \"Okay?\u201d Carl said, nodding.  He turned to walk away and as he neared a turn in the hall, Lexi whispered (loudly) down the hall, \"See you tomorrow...remember to look like Laura!\u201d  Carl turned and smiled, then turned the corner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl walked down the hallway, his breasts bouncing around in the tight dress, he thought\u2026<br>\r\n1)\t He could stay in the office for now but shift into another body.  He might need someone with more access to the place and to more people than he would have as Charlene...he'd need to find the body of a more powerful person.<br>\r\n2)\tHe heads home.  The next chapter begins as he nears the Pearlman house the next day...and he has to find Laura.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't know where he was going to get more money from, his life had hit rock bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked back at the store, and through the window he could see the clerk, who was serving another customer. He contemplated going back in and robbing the place, it wouldn't have been the first time. But he decided against it, instead he just stared at the clerk and for a second he seemed to be in a trance. \"Give me all the money in the till...asshole!\" Carl grumbled, before chuckling to himself and taking another swig from his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw the clerk exiting the store, right behind the customer. He was carrying a wad of cash in his hand, and he had a smirk on his face. \"Hey, I thought we might be needing this\" the clerk said, handing Carl the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" a confused Carl replied, as he took the money hestitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you...?\" Carl began to ask, before being cut off by the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, relax, I'm you!\" the kid said. \"Well, I'm a copy of you to be exact, but only in mind...obviously\" the clerk said to a disbelieving Carl, as he gestured down to his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just remained silent for a moment, somewhat skeptical, but then he realized that a store clerk wouldn't just had all the store's money to a stranger for no reason. And his mind went back to earlier in the evening, and his encounter with the strange artifact. \"Shit!\" he gasped, staring at the $5, $10 and $20 bills that were in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that right?\" Carl then mumbled, a grin appearing on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking know it\" Carl's 'clone' grinned from inside the clerk's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so if you're possessing that body, how do I get you out of it?\" Carl asked the clerk, still not 100% sure he was telling him the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suggest that I go back inside first, then I don't know...concentrate on 'extracting' me or something\" the clerk said, shrugging his shoulders. \"Looks like you've got some fucking kick-ass powers now dude, no more hard living for you\" the clerk said, slapping Carl on the shoulder. \"Don't spend it all at once\" the clone then winked, pointing to the money in Carl's hand. The clerk then walked back into the store and went back behind the counter, before signaling to Carl.</span></div></div>",

He then looked at the money he was holding again, and it suddenly didn't look so important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs money if I can possess other people!\" he said, shaking his head. He nonetheless slipped the money into one of his pockets and grabbed his cigarettes and beer, deciding to head back to his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, he tested out his new found power again, sending a clone of himself into a police officer who was giving a woman a ticket. \"Ahh, who gives a shit about a little speeding\" the officer suddenly said, tearing up the ticket that he was going to give to the woman. \"Drive as fast as you fucking want lady\" Carl's duplicate laughed, before slamming the woman's car door shut. The clone then took the officer's gun out of its holster and threw it to Carl, who tucked it into the back of his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you!\" Carl said, saluting the possessed police officer.

He heard the familiar noise of his annoying college neighbors who lived across the hall from his apartment and blasted their music 24/7. \"Perfect,\" the drunken man muttered. He knocked on the door loudly, almost in a angry sounding manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe annoyed college punk opened his door and began to speak. \"The fuck dude....\" but before he could finish, Carl focused on the punk and his friends, sitting on the couch inside the apartment, transforming them into that same silver liquidy form and causing them to transform. The three men all began to take familiar shapes. They all now stood the same height, with black hair, unkept and grubby-looking. They were now him. The former punk looked Carl in the face and rubbed his forehead. \"Hey, there you are Carl! Carl, Carl and I were wondering when you were gonna get here.\" He said, referring to himself and the other clones. \"Come on in *hic* and grab a beer *hic hic*!\" It was clear to Carl that his clones were as drunk as him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UH, sure....\" the real Carl said. He walked into the living room and began to sat down on the couch, almost not believing what he was seeing. After all, he was drunk. He could just be seeing things. But, just as he was about to sit down, he remembered his purpose for doing all of this. \"Uh, just a second....where's the bathroom again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClone Carl looked at real Carl with a confused look but then laughed innocently. \"Damn, Carl. You are real forgetful. It's down the hall and to the right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....right...I'll be back in a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the bathroom, Carl wasted no time in carrying out his plan. He looked at himself in the mirror, his eyes rolling back in his head as his body turned to a pliable putty once more. His petite feet began to form first, followed by his long smooth legs, his tight ass carressed by his blue miniskirt, his slender stomach, his perky tits concealed in a red tube top, and finally the gorgeous face and head of his ex, highlighted by her plump lips, glistening eyes and blonde hair sheen. \"Damn, I'm fucking gorgeous,\" he said with a bit of a slur in her sexy voice. Once thing about Melissa that turned him on was this cute little lisp she had when she spoke. Now, everytime he heard that escape his lips, his mind flooded with memories of their time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at himself in the mirror for a few second, a smirked and adjusted the tits, feeling the erect nipples rub against his top. \"Wow....that's some sensation!\" He even tweaked a nipple and felt a rush of excitement. A large part of him still believed this was a dream, but he figured if that was the case then there was nothing to lose. He exited the bathroom and clicked down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClone Carl, making a sandwich, began to speak, \"You better not have left a bomb in there...\" and stopped talking as he caught sight of real Carl in Melissa's sexy form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two Carls were also staring and were salivating over their ex. The three drunken men were already turned on as their own penises started to become erect. \"Me- Melissa? Wha- What are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came back to see my favorite lover!\" Carl said, sauntering over towards the three, who now were all sitting on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look...amazing!\" said clone #1. \"That top is fucking sexy, your tits look great!\" said Clone #2. \"And that skirt makes you ass look great!\" added clone #3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you boys!\" said Carl, internally cackling and getting a rush of arousal from teasing what was esentially himself. The only problem was Carl was starting to feel what was Melissa's attraction for his own body. Normally, this would be no problem. But, being in his drunken stupor and mainly thinking this was a dream anyway, Carl was very open to just going with the flow. Seeing the erect dicks that each of his clones were sporting were getting him hot. But, before he could do anything to avert things going further, two of the three clones had already stripped out of their clothes and were completely naked. The main clone, the punk who had originally answered, the door began to undress the real Carl in Melissa's form. Carl was going to protest, but the touch of his masculine clone's hand on his perky breasts sent a rush of excitement to his nether region. He let his clone undress him, his thoughts still fighting this. Was he really about to have an orgy with three copies of himself in his ex's body?</span></div></div>",

He opened his eyes and saw that the three clones had been transform into the same grey goo as he had been before. Their bodies began to morph and distort as he saw the piles of grey goo rise from the ground and start to take shape simultaneously. First, the smooth legs formed followed by their wide hips and naked nether regions, then their toned stomachs, their large breasts and finally their gorgeous heads, each having a pair of pigtails topping them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Carl-Melissas looked like they had amnesia, rubbing their eyes and asking what happened. \"Holy shit!\" yelled punk Carl. He was looking down at his new perky tits. One of the other two clones was grabbing at his pigtails followed by picking up his ass and dropping it, letting it jiggle to-and fro. And the last Carl clone wasted no time checking out the good, rubbing his tits and rubbing in between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to us, Carl?\" punk Carl asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I'm liking it.\" second Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll second that! I'm enjoying this too much to freak out!\" said the third Carl, essentially masturbating in his Melissa form. The real Carl watched his creations as he decided to add one last touch. He focused on himself and his clones, adding a lacy corset and pair of crotchless panties to each of their bodies, to make the mood much sexier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy hell!\" said clone 1. \"This is amazing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, I'm surprised you're not freaked out by all of this!\" said the second clone, finally acknowledging the real Carl after all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I'm fairly attracted to my body I guess.\" said the real Carl, sensually walking up to the masturbating Carl clone and stopping him in his tracks. Real Carl placed his supple plump lips on those of his Clone's Melissa form and began to makeout. The first and second clones followed suit, shrugging and also beginning to makeout with one another and rubbing each other's breasts and grabbing each other's asses.

Ripping off his shirt and bra and kicking off the heels, he collapsed onto his bed and began fondling the naked tits intently. His lust increased as he slipped a hand below the skirts waistline. \"OH FUCK! Thats the stuff!\" he screamed as he brushed the folds of 'Melissa's' pussy. Waves of pleasure flowed through his body until finally, he sucumb to his first female orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, that was insane!\" he panted, crudly laughing at how he had jacked off in his ex's body. As much as he wanted to sit around and enjoy such a feeling all night however, a long and unprovoked yawn told him that exhaustion was catching up on him. \"Damn, I was enjoying that\" he muttered through another yawn. Getting up from the bed, he stared at his reflection again for a moment. The now topless form of Melissa stared back at him. Carl gave himself a cheeky grin as he admired the sight. Even through the now carbon copies of Melissa's eyes, Carl could see the bloodshot, tired signs weighing him down. \"Time to change back I guess\" Carl told himself, now pondering if the change was as simple in reverse. Surely enough, it was. As he kicked back on the bed, he melted into a silver puddle once more as his body reformed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at himself, Carl saw his own, hairy torso, with the beer ravaged belly below it. \"Definatley more familiar\" he laughed, the melancholy of it all very aparent. His own shirt now lay on floor where he had tossed Melissas, as were his own sneakers as oposed to the stilettos. The bra was now non-exsistant. Rumaging through a bedside drawer, he pulled out a case of special ciggerettes he'd been saving up for a momentus ocassion, such as pulling off a big heist or finally making it somehow. Carl figured gaining this power ranked among them. He rose from the bed and walked over to the open window, looking out on the gritty neighbourhood below, puffing his ciggerette as he looked amongst the areas iluminated by streetlights. \"The world is finally my oyster.

It was a vastly populated area, so there was sure to be someone. The sun was out above him, the birds singing in the trees and a cool summer breeze allowing for balence. 'The perfect day to have fun with these fucking powers!' Carl thought to himself as he trudged along, smoking a ciggerette as he walked. As he rounded another corner on to a main road street, he noticed an interesting sight ahead. He sighted a perfect place that he could unleash his powers. The scenario was just choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from a residential house was a young, asian, teenage girl. She looked around college age, with light brown skin, shoulder length black hair and a slim figure. She had moderatley sized tits, which bounced slightly as she ran. She also had a pretty cute face, though it sported a mischevious look about it. She was wearing black leggings with a white crop top, which gave a nice view of her clevage. Currently, she was running from her own house for some reason, screaming about something as she neared the front gate. She was laughing too it seemed, so it was clearly all in good taste. The door closed on the house, locking her out. Clearly she had been messing about with friends or siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl saw a prime oppoutunity to shoot one of his clones into the pretty teenage girl and have some fun. Though this was only the first oppoutunity he had. He could always keep walking.<br>\r\nEventually, he decided on...</span></div></div>",

The girl by this point was walking back up to the door, though it definatley wasn't budging, leaving her trapped between the entrance to her own home and Carl. Of coruse, she wasn't aware of that just yet. \"Come on guys, this isn't funny!\" she yelled at the door, trying to get the attention of those inside. Clearly, it was a little funny however as she still sported a large grin when talking. The innocence of teenage girls. It was was something Carl would most certainley remove once one of his clones inhabited her body. Now standing at the front gate, the girl was still oblivious to his presence. \"Perfect\" Carl muttered as he shot a clone forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the entity break off from him as it had done with the cashier the night before, Carl waited a moment before it made impact with the girl. She jolted somewhat, ceasing her screaming in place a of a gasp as the clone took her over. Her eyes clouded over with a white mist before they returned to their normal brown. Turning around, the girl now had a sinister grin upon her face that quite easily mirrored Carl's. \"Nice fucking find dude!\" she exclaimed, now squeezing her tits intently like she'd never seen them before. Carl was definatley in here. \"You know it man!\" he replied, admiring his handiwork. \"So do you know who is this chick then\"? \"Her names Amrit, though her friends call her Ammi. Theres a bunch of them inside if you want to truly have some fun!\" the clone noted, now admiring Ammi's curves. \"Woah, you can read her memories like that?\" Carl asked, amazed again by what his powers could do. \"Sure can! So can you once you get inside someone!\" 'Ammi' replied as she looked back at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was just becoming more enthralled by the prospect of the powers as time went on. He began to formulate an idea on what the clone had said. A house full of teenage girls was an iresistable prospect. Though the sight of the clone touching up the teenage girls body gave him other, more personal ideas. Which would be best to choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fuck it, lets do this then!\" Carl told his clone with excitement as he relished in the prospect of controling a house full of teenage girls. The clone mirrored his excitment, 'Ammi's' face contorting a wicked smile as her body was willed on by it's new inhabitant. \"Thats the spirit dude! I need some playmates\" the clone chirped. The pair moved towards the door of the house, still shut from the inside as Ammi's friend kept up their joke. \"Ok, you keep up her racket and I'll do the rest\" Carl whispered as he hid behind the wall. 'Ammi' simply winked before she carried on banging on the door. \"Come on, let me in now, seriously\" came her voice as the clone hammered home on the door. Eventually, the locks gave way and the door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, your face was priceless\" came a voice from inside. The clone simply smiled before signalling to Carl that it was time to strike. \"Ok, now dude\" he said, giving the order. Carl emerged from his hiding place as slying crept infront of the door frame. There he saw a very attractive mixed race girl standing in his presence, her smile fading as she became confused. She had long, flowing, curly hair with a very attractive face. She had an amazing figure, with large tits and curves in all the right places. She was wearing a purple tank top which showed off an impressive clevage, as well as tight jeans. Carl was very impressed as he preped another clone. The girl barely had a chance to react before her eyes began to cloud over as another version of Carl crept in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats another one down!\" she replied, grabbing her tits in the now customary female possession fashion. \"What are you guys doing out there?\" came a voice from the other room. \"That'll be number two then\" Carl noted as a head bobbed around the corner from the living room. It was one of a cute, young blonde girl, with straight, shoulder length hair. Carl jetesened clone number three and watched as her eyes clouded over. \"Last ones in here man!\" the clone replied with the girl's voice as he directed his master in the right direction. Carl trudged into the living room as the clones followed him up. The blonde was now kicking back on to the sofa and preparing to have a fondle fest as he entered and saw the final target. A cute young red head sat upon the sofa, looking the most confused of all as her friend fondled herself on the sofa whilst a scruffy looking man entered the room. She had a nice, slim body. It was wearing a blue jumper with mauve jeans. She didn't even have time to react before the clone was inside, a content grin now upon his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fucking easy!\" Carl laughed as he admired his own powers. Looking around, he now saw the girls all intently feeling themselves up, the clones clearly loving their new residence. \"Ok, roll call bitches\" Carl ordered as he watched them with delight. \"Georgina\" the mixed race girl said, now cupping her large tits with glee. \"Nikki\" the blonde muttered between groans as she rubbed her pussy through her shorts. \"Laura\" the redhead noted as she too followed the trend. \"So what now man?\" 'Ammi' asked as she wandered her feminine hands south. That was the million dollar question. Carl was curious to try things. Though he was also curious about wanting to fuck each of them. What was he to do?</span></div></div>",

Carl was getting a very prominent erection watching the show of 4 teenage girls beginning to masturbate before him. He needed satisfaction and in his current position, it was easy to get it. \"Right, you! Into the next room with me. The rest of you fuckers can get into the main room. Do what you want, just don't disturb us!\" Carl ordered, sending the Georgina clone to join his two compadriates. \"Understood dude!\" 'Georgina' replied, a sinister look on her face as she lusted over an idea Carl could only imagine. Carl was only focused on getting what he wanted from the clone currently inhabiting Ammi. Near enough pushing him in, Carl shut the door behind them as he looked her up and down. Her young yet tantalizing body was everything Carl lusted for at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, whats the hurry dude?\" the Ammi clone chuckled in his teenage voice, noting his former self's impatience. A quick glance to see Carl eyeing him up was enough to confirm what was about to happen. \"Oh, I see. Well let me get into charecter for you...\". With that, the clone began to run his hand through his long, black hair, pulling seductive faces as the other hand cupped a breast. \"Come at me Carl. I want you to fucking rape me. Take away my innocence\" 'Ammi' cooed, the words dripping with honey as she played on what she knew Carl liked. It was enough to make him lose his patience as he leaped towards her. The clone barely had time to react before Carl was upon him and his lips upon his own. 'Ammi' was taken back a little, though quickly eased into things. The clone didn't seem too fussed about being fucked by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl moved things onward quickly, moving his tongue into Ammi's mouth before pulling away to lick up the side of her face. \"Mmm, you taste good\" Carl noted, a sinister girn upon his face. Ironically, it was mirrored by the clone, looking out of place on Ammi's cute face. Before he could react again however, Carl went back to work, fumbling about with 'Ammi's' top and bra. It was something the clone helped him out with, exposing her now naked top half and her breasts in full glory. Carl knocked her back onto a nearby sofa before commencing with foddling with them. The clone was clearly enjoying it, his, or more Ammi's moans with the voice, now filling the air in the room around them. Carl began to whip his cock out, indicating to the clone to lose the last of the clothing he now had. He shed Ammi's tights and panties pretty quickly, leaving her snatch exposed for Carl. He wasted no time in opening her legs, preping her for what was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl slipped his cock inside his now willing victim, bringing a loud gasp of pleasure from his clone in the process. With that initial feeling of entry complete, he began pounding away on the young girls body, fucking her hard as he showed no remorse in this most definate criminal activity. 'Ammi' simply kept moaning loudly, running her hands through her hair and over her exposed breasts as Carl went to town on her. This was most definatley what Carl wanted, enjoying the sensation and the feeling of power that came with all this. He held her close as he approached climax, holding the top of her hair as he finished in as rough a manor as he started. The clone simply screamed in pleasure as he felt Carl shoot his load deep inside Ammi's body. Both of them simply lay back after the finish, the feeling of ecstacy still present in both of them. \"These powers...are fucking amazing!\" Carl managed as he breathed heavily. \"Damn right dude\" 'Ammi' panted, her body worn out from the crazy sex she had just recieved from Carl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even want to wait around, I want to try more!\" Carl exclaimed, getting up a lot faster than his clone in the young teenage girl. He was truly excited, feeling like a kid in a candy store with such anticipation to test his new powers some more. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl got up and bounded towards the next room, the more tired and naked 'Ammi' following suit. What greeted them however was like a scene from a porn flick. 'Georgina' had shed her top and was now busily eating out 'Nikki', her large tits bounding up and down in the process. 'Nikki' in the meantime just moaned in pleasure, one hand in her own hair and the other in 'Georgina's'. 'Laura' in the meantime just watched on with her hand down her jeans. She was the first to notice the duo enter however, and that 'Ammi' was stark naked. She wolf whistled, bringing a fake mocking blush from the clone in Ammi. \"Well hello there sexy\" Nikki said, panting as she came down from her climax. The clone in Georgina was quick to approve too, turing to face them after stuffing his face with pussy. \"Hey, she's mine you lot!\" Carl noted, reminding the others of their place as he pulled 'Ammi' in for a quick fondle. \"We're all yours boss, don't worry about that\" 'Laura' said, laughing at it all with her sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I have a question. Who knows anything more about these powers?\" Carl asked, now curious as to try them out. \"Well apart from what you already know\" 'Nikki' began, sitting up to attention. \"You can also possess people yourself. You morph others too\". \"So I can get inside babes like you guys can? What a result!\" Carl exclaimed. \"Damn right boss\" 'Ammi' noted, having a jiggle of her tits as she amused herself. \"So morphing eh? Lets see...\". Carl began to remember how he had morphed himself earlier, transforming into his ex Mellisa. Morphing someone else however it seemed was a different task altogether. Concerntrating, he watched as Nikki's hair morphed from it's straighted blonde into a shorter brunetter, with more volume and curls. \"Hey, don't use me as a guinea pig!\" the clone in Nikki protested. He didn't seem to mind the modification however, finding amusement with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, your not the only guinea pig\" Carl smirked as he turned his attention to Georgina. She began to gag a little as she felt a modification to her throat. Carl grew an adams apple into her system, deepening her voice. She also felt a sensation tingle in her groin. Carl had morphed a copy of his cock on to her. \"What the hell man?!\" the clone exclaimed in his significantly deeper voice, staring down past Georgina's delicious mounds to his new stiffening erection. The others began to laugh, particularly Laura. \"I don't know what your laughing at\" Carl told her, now aiming in her direction. All of a sudden, Laura's whole body began to change as she morphed into an exact duplicate of Carl. He definatley looked strange in Laura's girly clothing. The other clones burst out into laughter at their partners prediciment. \"Thats no fair boss! I was enjoying that\" the new Carl protested, missing fondling Laura already. \"Your right. Morphs for all of you!\" Carl exclaimed. With that, Nikki and Georgina's bodies began to change once more, morphing them into other copies of Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy. Four me's!\" Carl laughed as he admired his handiwork. \"In body and spirit!\" one of the clones exclaimed. \"Why does she get to stay normal though?\" the Carl ont he sofa asked. \"I'm keeping this one pure. She's mine\" Carl told them, keeping 'Ammi' close. \"Whatever, can we morph back now?\" the clone asked. \"You lot bellyache so much! Fine!\" Carl told them, changing them back to their original stolen captives bodies, much to their delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These powers are just endles entertainment! What to do now?\" Carl thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They're upstairs while Ammi here has her friends over.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, get them initiated!\" Laura said, brushing her red hair out of the way to look down her shirt again. \"The more fucking, the merrier!\"<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" Nikki piped up, moving in to cup Laura's tits, who began to smile and moan exaggeratedly.<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Ammi agreed, sporting a devilish smirk that looked completely out of place on her young face. \"We're playing a fun game down here!\" she yelled upstairs. \"Why don't you two come down?\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds more fun than the boring stuff we're doing!\" a younger girl was heard upstairs. \"Can we go play with Ammi, Courtney?\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine, Taylor.\" the older girl gave up, and footsteps were heard coming down the stairs.<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Carl pondered, thinking of a plan.<br>\r\n\"You could try possessing one of them.\" Georgina suggested, absentmindedly stroking her pussy through her tight jeans.<br>\r\n\"Excellent idea!\" Carl grinned as his body collapsed and his spirit flew out. He floated away from the four horny possessed teens and moved to the staircase, where he saw an older white blonde wearing a tight t-shirt and yoga pants leading another young blonde wearing a spotted pink shirt and a pink skirt down the stairs. They both looked different than Ammi, leading Carl to believe the teen had been adopted in.<br>\r\n\"Decisions, decisions...\" Carl snickered as he pondered his target. \"I'll take the young girl; get to surprise the older one, too.\" When the two reached the bottom of the stairs, Carl flew into the young girl, causing a short gasp before he was in full control. He eyed up his new body; unsurprisingly, it didn't really have any assets. The older sister turned around and looked down, confused. \"You okay, Taylor?\" she asked, tilting her head. Carl was instantly turned on by everything about her, and tried to hide it in his current body.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, Courtney.\" Carl smiled in Taylor's body, putting on his best innocent girl act. Quickly, he maneuvered around his elder sister and began to grope her ass, causing her to gasp in shock. \"When will I be as fuckable as you, big sis?\"<br>\r\n\"T-Taylor!\" Courtney stammered, taken aback by her sweet little sister's sudden perversion.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's this fantastic rack of yours.\" Carl giggled again as he jumped up to squeeze Courtney's tits.<br>\r\n\"Taylor, what's gotten into you!\" she shouted, moving backwards. \"This is appalling!\"<br>\r\n\"You sure about at that?\" he smirked. Before Courtney could respond, a clone shot out of Taylor's little body and zoomed into her sister. Her eyes clouded over for a few seconds, before returning to their natural color.<br>\r\n\"Actually, I wouldn't mind experimenting with our sister and her friends.\" Courtney shot a dirty smile as she looked down her shirt, and proceeded to cup her tits. \"Ooh, this one's a D-cup! She's tight, too!\" Her hands began to move south towards her pussy and ass.<br>\r\n\"Hold up, slut.\" Carl ordered. \"We're gonna want to get with the others first before you demolish yourself.\" Courtney nodded in agreement, and followed \"Taylor\" back into the living room. The clones had already got back to action, as Ammi and Nikki shed their bottoms and were scissoring while groping themselves, and Laura was sucking on Georgina's tits, currently topless, as she rubbed her own pussy. \"Jesus Christ!\" Carl shouted, surprising the clones with the girl's voice. \"I leave you for a minute and you horny assholes get right back to it!\"<br>\r\n\"To be fair boss, we are you.\" Georgina commented as she got up with the other girls to examine the new finds.<br>\r\n\"Nice meeting you, sis.\" Ammi grinned, still masturbating. \"So Courtney here is 17, and Taylor the tyke is only 7.\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing under the skirt, either.\" Nikki giggled as she crouched in front of Taylor's body.<br>\r\n\"Let's leave the kid out of this.\" Carl said, bigger plans in his mind. His spirit shot out of her body, and into Courtney's, with the clone switching as well.<br>\r\n\"Aw, man!\" Taylor pouted. \"Why do you have to take the hot chicks?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I'm the boss!\" Carl rebutted, grabbing his new body's tits as Laura groped her ass from behind with the dirtiest smile on her face. \"Now stay by the front door and let us know if anyone problematic shows up.\" he continued.<br>\r\n\"Ah, fine.\" Taylor stormed off to the front, obviously upset.<br>\r\n\"Now what, boss?\" Ammi tried not to squeal as her masturbating was getting more intense, grabbing her breasts with her free hand.<br>\r\n\"Fantastic question.\" Carl mused, as he had his hands stuck up his shirt playing with his grown D-cups, as the three other girls began to feel up Courtney's body as well.</span></div></div>",

Especially while I have my own private harem handy\" Carl told his subservient clones whilst continuing to fondle his new tits. It had been fun to grope himself in such a manor as a morphed version of Melisa, though having a pair of young and sensitive teenage girls tits sent his hormones skyrocketing. He began to feel other hands touching him however, not of his own. Opening his eyes from his blissful trance, he saw both Nikki and Georgina winging him, preparing to fondle him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as the thought of a Lesbian three way turned Carl on, he wanted to take things at his own pace. He was used to getting his own way and he wanted to take full advantage of this situation, whether or not it was truly copies of him stopping it. \"Whoa, slow down ladies... I mean guys. Whatever\" Carl mused from Courtney's body, maintaining his dominance over the others. It was evident in disappointed looks on the faces of the other 'girls'. \"Come on boss, we're raring to get going here!\" The clone in Nikki complained, trying desperately hard to not rub her snatch into oblivion. \"I think you forget that I'm in charge here! I'll make the first pick. And I pick her\". Carl pointed to the body of Georgina, who pumped her fist in celebration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's choice was made half out of spiting the other clones, the other being that he'd wanted to get his hands on the young black girl the moment he'd seen those lucious melons open the door. \"Well what are we meant to do?\" 'Ammi' asked. The other 'girls' just looked at him in unison, before he came to the rather obvious conclusion. 'Nikki' and 'Laura' pushed her body back against the other sofa before proceeding to go to town on her. Carl didn't wait up, moving up behind the onlooking 'Georgina' and cupping her already exposed tits. As Carl played with the young girls body, he began to feel the strange sensations of feminine hormones coursing through his new body. He began to feel the moistiness between his legs as the other of his young victims added to the intensity. \"Fuck, how are these chicks not constantly horny!? I'd be fucking all the time if I were one!\" Carl laughed wickedly with Courtney's sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe settled on the sofa with 'Georgina', shedding his clothing as the two engaged in a fucking frenzy. Over the next two hours, Carl made sure to get his worth out of the teenage captives, switching between possessing them separately and fucking them in his regular male form. It was like being lost in some crazy fantasy for him, his lust for desire and contempt for female treatment evident as he roughly fucked the girls. \"Fucking take it bitch!\" He moaned as he pounded Laura at one stage. The clones did their upmost to add to the sensation for their master, the looks of cock hungry pornstars about their innocent faces as Carl went to town on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he began to finish up, currently occupying Ammi's body and fucking Courtney with a morphed cock from behind. \"I bet they'll never be closer as sisters than that\" Carl chuckled with his hosts otherwise pure voice as he shot a load into his victim. Courtney was too out of breath to reply as she lay with her face in the cushion. Carl looked about, noticing his clones pretty exhausted from the massive orgy. He felt satisfaction as he cupped Ammi's delightful tits once more. \"Are you lot done already? The noise of all this is driving me crazy!\" 'Taylor' suddenly said, peeaking around from behind the door. \"Jealous pipsqueak?\" 'Nikki' laughed as she came down from the latest orgasm. \"Fuck off! I meant that these bitches parents will be back soon\" 'Tayor' replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, why didn't you tell us sooner?!\" Carl cursed. \"I did boss but clearly you didn't hear as you had a face full of pussy\" the little tyke told him, such a vulgar description sounding funny coming from the child. \"Point well made. Right bitches, playtimes over. Make them look presentable again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clones heeded Carl's orders and began to redress the teenage hareem. Carl simply exited Ammi's body for his own, letting a clone do all the work as he lit up a cigarette. After about 5 minutes, the troops were lined up, ready for inspection. \"It'll be a shame to let them go but whatever, I can control any bitch I want now!\" Carl laughed. \"Sure you don't want to take one along as a keepsake?\" 'Courtney' suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tempting thought for Carl, though he knew he wouldn't be any worse off otherwise. Eventually he decided on...</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll be back.\" Carl then began to recall his clones from the girls. Their faces suddenly went blank as they collapsed to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Ammi asked, surprised, as the girls all around her lay collapsed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl suddenly grabbed Ammi in for a rough kiss, which Ammi was eager to return, if not surprised. After the brief makeout session, Carl let Ammi go. \"Just wanted one last taste You were my favorite in the group after all. He took once last grab of Ammi's breasts, even as they were now clothed, as she suddenly lost her balance and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly surveying the unconscious girls all around him, Carl made his way out of the house and made sure to see if his latest acquisition was still in sight. He was happy to see that she didn't get too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few steps from the house, Carl saw an east Asian girl walking on the sidewalk. She was wearing a simple red one piece, but with knee high boots which really accentuated her long legs. She had a cute face framed nicely with long straight black hair that came down to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting little time, Carl flew in to possess the girl, briefly jolting her from her walk. The takeover was quick and Carl adjusting to his new perspective. He gave a quick feel all over his new body. The breasts were smaller than he had enjoyed with the girls before, but he was surprised to see how much he enjoyed the feel of the boots on the legs. Carl also sent over a clone to his old body, just to make sure it didn't get left behind. Carl watched it as it got up but then realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't have this lovely body be hanging out in public with someone looking like, well, me.\" Carl thought. Knowing that he had the power to change how bodies looked, he decided on a new form for his old body while they were out and about in the town.</span></div></div>",

Carl scoured his memory's from when he used to being his old body, after all whatever he liked then he must still enjoy now right? he found his answer and decided upon what form he wanted for his pleasure, deciding that it would be good if they too was in some form off swim wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"okay, blondey remember that girl from the con about a year back?\" Carl asks the blonde women. she lowers her head in compliance \"as you wish master\" she says softly before she begins to reform slowly.

After retreating her tongue from Carl's mouth the clone turned her attention towards Carl's form body, who was now lost in a flooding sea of hormones from the events unfolding in front of him. The clone starred confidently back at Carl before she too sat on the bed beside Carl's former body. With one hand she pulled Carl in for a kiss and the other she wrapped around Carl's old body's cock, helping the clone that controlled it enjoy his new sensations. \"how pathetic!\" the morphed clone said, aiming the insult towards Carl's former body. \"Even with a cock like that you still couldn't satisfy the master!\" she said in a smug tone once more, now finding herself toying with his dick, running her fingers up and down his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insults spurred your old body further, the clone realised the control she had over her old master and even the other clones. maybe one day this clone would be the master with others to service her, maybe she would be a just princss with her own servants. \"yeah, come on get that dick hard, for master\" Carl let out in the Asian women's body now too enjoying the sensation of teasing over his former body, knowing those words alone would make him weak.</span></div></div>",

Before she could respond, he shot out a clone at the younger girl, who twitched a little too before the clone was in control.<br>\r\n\"Why the fuck not?\" the younger girl grinned, now groping herself as well. \"Damn, this one's got a flat chest...\" she whined as she pulled down her shirt. \"But she's insanely tight!\" She began to mimic her older sister in masturbating, before Carl interrupted.<br>\r\n\"What the hell are we going to do about my body?\" he motioned to the man unconscious on the pavement. An idea suddenly came to him. He turned around for half a second to look through the school's windows and saw an Asian girl about the younger girl's age walking to class. Carl fired a clone into his original body and immediately morphed it into the Asian's form.<br>\r\n\"Good idea, boss.\" she smiled as she looked down her shirt. \"Perky for sure.\" she popped her tits out of her bra and began to play with them.<br>\r\n\"I say it's about time we head to class.\" Carl said. Yet he still had to choose whether to take Anna or her younger sister into their class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My fucking nai-\u201d Carl paused looking at his french manicured nail on his womanly hand. \u201cOh that\u2019s right.\u201d Carl remarked with a girlish laugh she stood up looking at her stained bathrobe pool at her feminine feet  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm... that\u2019s a problem.\u201d Carl thought for a moment then grabbed his bathrobe by the collar, then transformed into a puddle along with the bathrobe, he reformed as his normal self  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNow if I do this right...\u201d Carl thought aloud before transforming again he became Melissa, to his dismay he was still wearing his bathrobe \u201cPoo...\u201d Carl remarked in Melissa\u2019s voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went through the change a number of times, from himself to Melissa and back again. Till eventually giving an unlady like huff blowing her hair out of her sightline Carl tapped her foot in frustration \u201cSuch a tacky bathrobe. Not even an accent sash.\u201d Carl was shocked by his own remark <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he had taken a moment to look at his outfit in Melissa\u2019s eyes he never would have even thought of how drab his bathrobe was. With his mind focused on his clothes it started to race with all the possibilities of new clothes, not just bathrobes or even his day to day attire, he could think of summerwear, ball gowns and even just something to throw on to hit the mall <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particularly perverted smile ran across Melissa\u2019s face, which Carl had on. With a relaxed breath Carl once more melted onto his stained hard wood floor. Reshaping, still shaped after Melissa\u2019s body, but now wearing an adorable frilled skirt and bikini top, both pink with a jet black trim. With black bows on the front of her bikini top and skirt with a golden trim with an elegant necklace and arm band bangle. Carl adjusted the sunglasses peaking from the brow of her hairline. She smiled gingerly at the beautiful attire she materialized from her mind <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeen so long since I saw Melissa wear\u2019n anything like this.\u201d Carl started to marvel at his own work. He had to admit, Melissa could look pretty sexy, but she looked even sexier in an outfit he picked out for, even if it wasn\u2019t one that showed off her nipples, this was rather amazing considering how Carl never really cared what Melissa wore, just as long as he was able to get it off her, but now he could really appercaite how the colors complimented one another, the subtle jewelry was marvelous to. A nice size pearl with two purposefully smaller pearls flanking it on either side hanging on a small gold chain made up the necklace. The bangle made up of ruby in lines of four encircling the whole of her modest lady\u2019s bicep. Running a finger over the rubies they indeed rotated against her silk skin with every pass, it gave Carl goosebumps just feeling them run along such delicate skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn\u2019t planned on this getting him so terribly aroused. He couldn\u2019t believe being Melissa could feel this amazing. He was shocked by what he was capable of last night, but being in control of it just made it feel so much better. He knew he head to capitalize on this pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl posed for himself in the mirror seeing Melissa\u2019s breasts squeezed together in a nice cleavage by her arms made him incredibly happy, a sight he had a hard time getting from her with the trouble the two of them had in their relationship. Carl couldn\u2019t be very romantic from the inside of a prison cell with a busted nose <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with these new powers, Carl didn\u2019t need Melissa to see her body... or see her body naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl deliberately undid the outfit slowly, almost teasing himself with the promise of seeing Melissa\u2019s curvature for his eyes only. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully tugging on the bows of his bikini top and skirt, looping them in one hand respectively. With a wry smile, before chirping in Melissa\u2019s voice \u201cOops!\u201d the outfit fell off and Carl could marvel all on his own at Melissa, ogling to his heart\u2019s content at the woman he still yearned for so badly. Soon enough it was too much for Carl to handle, he went back to bed and went at it passionately. Like a horse mad with thirst Carl couldn\u2019t stop himself from rubbing the lips he remembered so fondly when Melissa let him explore time and again <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl couldn\u2019t believe how amazing it felt to be on the receiving end, it left him wondering how she could leave all this. But quickly tried to put such thoughts away as now was a time of pleasure and indulging this beastly desire for the woman he loved seemingly so long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGnnnn!\u201d Carl moaned in Melissa\u2019s voice when it became too much. Carl let his body give into the pleasure and release all he was building up to in a climax that shook his dainty woman\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying back and contemplating what he\u2019d just done. Carl had yet another mischievous look across Melissa\u2019s face \u201cAgain.\u201d Carl told himself as he returned with renewed vigor, the previous fatigue of his last session was put aside to allow even more pleasure, as he rubbed the lips between those curvaceous legs like a man obsessed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Melissa\u2019s voice whined, as Carl tried desperately to prolong the ecstatic feeling just a little longer, never wanted this amazing feeling to end Carl tried to hold it back, but he could feel his tongue lull out his mouth as he gave into the pleasure before finally his futile resistance gave way to a mind-numbing pleasure <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft in a notable puddle of juices Carl knew he had to get cleaned up. But how he dad that was up to him. With a wry smirk, he turned into a puddle mixing with his juices before reforming completely clean. \u201cIsn\u2019t that helpful?\u201d Carl laughed to himself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes... actually I could use this.\u201d Carl thought to himself, transforming again, this time Melissa stared back at him, this time covered in semen \u201cI-I swear it was just this one time! No please! Don\u2019t leave me for being such a stuck-up bitch! I-I can change please believe me!\u201d Perfectly mimicking Melissa\u2019s voice, Carl enacted a scene in his mind <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a laugh Carl turned back into himself \u201cYeah. I could find whatever new chump she\u2019s dragging along and cause her some real trouble. Hell, I could just go to her place for lunch and get naked and give everybody a good show. I\u2019d like to see her face tryin to explain that!\u201d Carl gave a laugh to himself <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind began to race with the possibilities of ways to get at Melissa, bust a window at her parent\u2019s house, going to her therapist and telling her all sorts of things. Carl couldn\u2019t settle on just one as he was so engrossed in the options to give her what for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess if I have to pick just one.\u201d Carl laughed in Melissa\u2019s voice \u201cOf course just one for now I guess it would have to be...\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was hard to tell in the dark with just a couple street lamps to light the scene, but Carl made out the figure of one Detective Nick Trask\u2026a constant pain in Carl\u2019s side for some while.  Trask was an unassuming man\u2026.only 25 years old, but quite sure to have a shining career in front of him.  He was an educated man, and his Master\u2019s degree in criminology helped him move up through the ranks of the police department a hell of a lot faster than he otherwise would have.  He was only about 5 foot 10; he weighed about 220 lbs.\u2014bit of a pudgy cop, yet with one of the best arrest records in the county. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMost importantly, though, he was Carl\u2019s nemesis.  It was pretty personal between the two men; each hated the other, and 5 of Carl\u2019s last 7 arrests had been made by this little shit Trask.  One of the arrests had been the one that made Melissa leave him for good\u2026 \u201cI WANT HIM!\u201d Carl declared, boiling with rage in the dark of night.  But Carl didn\u2019t want to just see Trask messed with; he wanted to ruin his career, and he wanted to do it himself\u2026not just with one of his clones.  He wanted to see Trask\u2019s shining star of a career snuffed out in full view of the department, his family, everybody, and he wanted it to be damn long and slow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl concentrated hard, and in a moment he felt weird.  He felt\u2026.a bit lighter somehow.  He felt his flesh and blood body fall back on to his floor with a thud, yet he was somehow still standing.  He looked down at himself and didn\u2019t see quite what he thought.  Instead of the norm, Carl looked down and saw a sort of misty, smokey aura in the general shape of a body.  He turned around and looked in the mirror\u2026.same thing\u2026.just a vanishingly thin outline of his body, visible only because of a bit of smokey mist coming from the outline of his figure.  \u201cThis is fucking weird,\u201d Carl mused, but he thought he had little time.  Turning, he ran his ethereal self clean through his apartment door, down the stairs, and into the street below.  A bit careful out of habit, Carl crouched down behind a car to watch the three men in the dimly lit street.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the formerly unconscious cop tried to explain the absence of his gun to his fellow officer, Trask had separated from the other two men, probably to look around one last time for the missing gun.  \u201cNow\u2019s my chance!\u201d Carl thought, \u201cI\u2019m gonna get you ya little bastard!\u201d he declared as he made his way hastily up closer and closer to the back of the unsuspecting investigator, then, when the time was just right, leaped at him.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Carl leapt at Trask, the latter turned around.  Carl flew through the air at him, and, as he did, his ethereal form started to almost dissolve, or at least to sort flatten out into a thin stream of black smoke.  This ethereal stream forced its way into the mouth and nose of the unsuspecting officer, who began to gag and jerk uncontrollably, almost as if having a seizure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all that stopped.  Carl looked through new eyes for the first time.  He was amazed by the set of new sensations\u2026.it wasn\u2019t like he was a woman or anything, but his own for did not have much resemblance to the one he now had.  He looked down at a gut bulging over the top of his pants and barely contained by a blue, button-down shirt.  He now wore a thin, black tie and a grayish rain coat.  Carl brought his new pudgy fingers up into clearer view, \u201cOh my God,\u201d he said as he patted his new belly just to make sure the whole thing was real.  \u201cIt worked,\u201d the amazed criminal said, just to be surprised yet again by the strange sound of his new voice.  He quickly brought his hand up to his throat in surprise, only to be rather unpleasantly confronted with Trask\u2019s double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick!!\u201d he heard from your temporary daze.  Immediately he looked up to see one of the other cops talking at him.  Seeing his name on his shirt, Carl was able to figure out who he was.  \u201cOh\u2026oh Jenson, sorry\u2026..I was just deep in thought for a second,\u201d Carl apologized.  \u201cWell get your ass in gear,\u201d Jenson said, \u201cshift\u2019s about over buddy.  Let\u2019s go home.\u201d  Carl, in his new, somewhat clumsy body, followed the other two officers in the dark of night into the Chevy Suburban with the sign of the local police force boldly emblazoned across the side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officers rolled through the streets of the city while Carl prayed silently that nothing would happen to blow his cover.  \u201cHow\u2019s Jennifer doing?,\u201d Jenson asked Carl as they pulled into a residential neighborhood.  \u201cOh\u2026.oh she\u2019s fine, a little stressed out lately, but all right,\u201d Carl replied, figuring that a claim of stress was sure to fly because pretty much everybody was stressed to one degree or another.  \u201cWell having a baby on the way will sure as hell do that haha,\u201d Jenson answered.  This was new news; Carl had never known Trask was having himself a kid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, the SUV pulled on to a street Carl could identify as King Lane, soon after which it pulled into the driveway of a mid-sized home.  The house wasn\u2019t huge, but it was nice enough and well-kept, at least insofar as Carl could see the place clearly in the dark.  \u201cWell, here ya go,\u201d Jenson said, \u201cget a good sleep and see you tomorrow.\u201d  \u201cYou guys too,\u201d Carl responded as he got out of the car and begin the walk up the sidewalk to the porch illuminated by only a single light.  This was a new experience in every possible way.  Carl was in a strange body in a strange house.  He\u2019d robbed houses before, but this time he might actually have to pretend that he lived peacefully in this one\u2026a tough sell maybe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked up to the door and saw that a couple lights were on in the house.  \u201cHere goes nothin\u2019,\u201d he said as he gingerly turned the doorknob, opened the door and went in.  Tucked away in Trask\u2019s body, Carl made his was slowly and calmly through the foyer of the home and into the kitchen that was fairly lit up with a couple of lights.  He took off Trask\u2019s rain coat and hung it on the back of a chair and looked around the kitchen.  Suddenly, he heard steps behind him.  Startled, Trask tensed up as someone grabbed him from behind and spun him around.  Before he could do anything, Carl beheld a beautiful sight.  A short woman with dark hair grabbed him around the shoulders and gave him a great big hug and a kiss on the lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of a very passionate kiss, Carl was let go and able to look at the woman again.  She was small of stature, but with a full, voluptuous, and curvy body.  She had dark hair and a beautiful smile\u2026.probably somewhere in her early 30s at her oldest.  Looking down at her, Carl noted a large and noticeable bulge in her belly, which strained a bit against a thin bath robe that covered this woman\u2019s beautiful curves.  \u201cHey, daddy,\u201d the woman said as she smiled and took the surprised man\u2019s hand and placed it firmly on her belly, \u201csee\u2026he\u2019s kicking hard.\u201d  And kicking the little guy was indeed.  \u201cHow was your night?\u201d she asked.  \u201cOh\u2026.oh it was fine\u2026normal enough,\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful woman, who had to be Jennifer, turned around and walked over to a hot cup of tea sitting on the table on the other end of the kitchen.  \u201cI\u2019m really tired hon\u2026so off to bed, but I just wanted to stay up to see you come home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n1)\tYou could play the part for now.  You could even secretly slip out of his body entirely once the wife wasn\u2019t looking, since you now knew where he lived and could come back any time to mess with him or his family to make him look bad.<br>\r\n2)\tYou could do or say something small now.  Not anything too overt or huge, but something out of his character to get his wife wondering.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to spend just a bit more time learning about, and frankly playing with, his prey before arousing suspicions.  Carl, still in the body of the plump officer, watches as his curvy wife drank her tea and walked, motherly hips swinging about, from the kitchen and slowly up the stairs, presumably to the couple\u2019s room.  \u201cGood night hon,\u201d Carl said just to keep up appearances.  Once Jennifer was out of earshot, Carl marveled, \u201cDamn, if I had a woman with a body like that, I\u2019d be fuckin\u2019 her so often we\u2019d never leave the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl wanted to head home for now, and he wanted to leave Trask\u2019s body in the house.  Now knowing where his nemesis lived, Carl could come back any time he wanted.  Carl walked into what seemed to be the couple\u2019s living room, where he saw a full-length mirror in the corner.  This was the first time Carl had actually looked in the mirror since taking over the schmuck\u2019s body.  It was odd to look in the mirror and see someone strange looking back\u2026especially someone Carl despised so much.  Examining his new form in the mirror was a strange experience; Carl turned from side to side a couple times, seeing his bloated belly sticking over his belt and straining against a thin blue dress shirt.  Carl deviously took Trask\u2019s gun out of its holster and posed with it before the mirror, \u201cStop!  In the name of the law!\u201d he said into the empty room, chuckling at the irony of the situation.  \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you fat bastard; I could just take you out with this gun right now, but that wouldn\u2019t be fun enough\u2026..you should really be thanking me,\u201d Carl said to his vessel\u2019s reflection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough fun for now,\u201d Carl said.  He stopped playing around, put the gun back away, put his hands down to his sides, and concentrated.  Suddenly, he started to feel strains all over his body, like every muscle was tensing up and cramping at once.  The pain was immense, and Carl started to sort of jerk and spasm, holding his hands to his belly and chest, which were in especially intense pain.  Suddenly, from Trask\u2019s mouth there came a flow of wispy black smoke.  The smoke continued to force its way from Trask\u2019s body through his opened mouth; after a few seconds, Carl\u2019s ethereal form emerged from the body of the inhabited cop, and Carl watched as a disoriented Trask slumped against the living room wall before slowly collapsing lazily in a heap to the floor, unconscious.  \u201cWell that was an interesting experience,\u201d Carl said, knowing no one could hear him.  Trask\u2019s unfit body remained passed out on the floor of his own living room.  Carl looked down at his adversary with pride, \u201cDon\u2019t worry you shit; I bet I\u2019ll use your fat ass again\u2026..and the wife\u2026.she\u2019ll be useful.\u201d  Carl walked his misty form through the door of the home and out into the cool night air to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked a few blocks to a major intersection, jumped into the body of an unsuspecting juvenile delinquent, and used his body to hail a bus, which Carl then rode home.  He exited the body of the vandal, leaving him walking about very confused in front of Carl\u2019s apartment complex.  Carl then re-entered his true body and climbed into bed.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a day\u2026the plan forges on,\u201d Carl said to himself as he drifted off to bed.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl wanted to mess around with Trask the very next day, so he set his alarm for good and early so that he could be at the police station when Trask showed up for his shift.  The fat-ass would be tired, having been up late the night before.  Trask groggily took the bus back to the police stations and walked from the bus stop to a hotel a couple blocks away.  Using a wee bit of credit card fraud (one of his specialties), Carl checked into one of the rooms in the hotel.  It didn\u2019t need to be a really nice place\u2026.just nice enough for Carl to stash his meat suit while he had his fun.  Carl lay down on the bed and concentrated, feeling his ethereal form rise from his body.  He walked unseen through the streets of the city which had begun to move with people on their way to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl reached the police station in a couple minutes.  He needed a body that would get him in without arousing suspicion.  He had to be able to walk around and ask questions about Trask without causing suspicion.  \u201cAh HA!\u201d Carl screamed to himself in his mind as he saw a vast array of potential targets.  Before him was a class full of school children; they were probably on a field trip\u2026trying to teach them that cops were their friends and all that good stuff.  If he jumped into one of them, he could walk around all he wanted and nobody would think anything of it; if he went somewhere he wasn\u2019t supposed to, the worst they could do to him would be walk him calmly back to the rest of the tour and perhaps give him a slight slap on the wrist.  He could always plead stupidity if he had to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now to find our winning contestant,\u201d Carl mused to himself as he looked across the line of curious faces looking on at their teacher as she babbled on about being polite and good citizens and all that shit.  At the end of the line, Carl saw one he thought would do.  Walking a bit closer to the kid, Carl bent down to get a better look while the boy twiddled his thumbs and pretended to care what the teacher was saying.  He appeared to be about 8 or 9 years old\u2026he had a chubby build (like so many kids these days), and his name tag read \u201cTommy.\u201d  A mass of hair cascaded about his head, coming down so far that it nearly got in the way of his vision.  Tommy\u2019s mother had evidently forced a Justin Beiber-ish haircut on the poor little bastard\u2026so sad.  \u201cHoly hell!\u201d Carl marveled as he saw one last detail of the kid, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a fucking Deep Purple t-shirt!!!  At least somebody in your family\u2019s got good taste!  You, my young sir, are the winner.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Carl heard the teacher announce, \u201cAll right class, remember to behave yourself, and let\u2019s line up and head in.\u201d  The students began to gather their belongings.  \u201cOh,\u201d Carl said in mock frenzy, \u201clooks like it\u2019s show time.  Here I come little buddy!\u201d With that, Carl turned around and positioned himself directly in front of the unsuspecting child, then simply sat himself down into the boy\u2019s body.  The world seemed to shimmer for a moment, and Carl\u2019s vision blurred.  He looked down at himself as he regained his senses, \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he said as he looked down at himself and saw his plump little body with his head situated much closer to the ground than usual.  He stood up and looked around for a moment, trying to get used to the feeling of the mass of hair flowing about on his head.  He glanced at the little girl next to him to find that her jaw had dropped open and she was pointing at him, \u201cOh my gosh, you said a bad word, Tommy.\u201d  \u201cShut up!\u201d Carl said, still getting used to the fairly high-pitched voice coming from his mouth.  The class walked silently into the police station, with Carl tucked away the whole time in the body of innocent little Tommy.  He walked through the bustling police enclave while paying little attention to what the teacher was saying or what the class was being told to do.  Truth be told, Carl found it very odd to be walking around so inconspicuously in the proverbial belly of the beast, as visits to the police station were often quite different, usually involving handcuffs, the occasional attempt at shanking somebody, and all-too-personal cavity searches the ugly lady cops always did\u2026.never the pretty ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked through the station, looking from his low physical position up into the faces of the officers, hoping to see or overhear Trask\u2019s location to maybe mess with him a little.  Suddenly, there he was!  Carl stood on his borrowed tip-toes to spy Trask talking to a couple other officers\u2026.the two from the other night in fact\u2026through the bulletproof glass behind which presumably important things happened.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to get in there!\u201d Carl thought to himself.  Carl slowed the movement of Tommy\u2019s body, letting the other children walk past him in line as they marveled at the shiny badges and official-looking uniforms of the cops.  Now at the back of the line, Carl simply turned and quietly walked down the hallway to the door behind which Trask was talking.  Reaching the door, Carl reached up and turned the doorknob just about level with the head of his borrowed body.  Carl opened the heavy metal door just enough to fit his girth through the doorway, letting the door close quietly behind him.  Carl sort of hunched over and made his way over near a desk near Trask; he scrunched down behind the desk to hear the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenson, was there anything really\u2026off\u2026about me last night?\u201d Trask inquired asked. \u201cAhhh\u2026.no, no not really; I mean it was a long day and everything, but you were all right,\u201d Jenson said.  \u201cReally?,\u201d Trask said, surprised, \u201ccause my head\u2019s fuzzy\u2014I remember being on that job with you guys and looking around for some evidence, but then I don\u2019t remember\u2026..I don\u2019t remember a thing until I woke up this morning\u2026.nothin\u2019.\u201d  Carl smiled deviously from ear to ear inside Tommy, \u201cThis is fucking awesome!\u201d he said quietly, \u201cTrask can\u2019t remember a damn thing from when I was inside him\u2026I can posses the fat fuck and mess up his life, and he\u2019ll have no clue what he\u2019s even accused of doing until people get suspicious and it all comes crashing down on him!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl snickered to himself, he just about leapt out of his borrowed skin as someone put a hand on his shoulder.  \u201cHey there cutie,\u201d said a feminine voice from Carl\u2019s right side.  Carl looked up to see a woman\u2019s mid-section, her face much higher up, bending down to bring her face level with his.  Looking at her, Carl noted that she was quite pretty.  She had long, curly blonde hair and a pleasant face, with a smile to die for.  A couple wrinkles appeared here and there; the woman probably in her early-to-mid forties.  She had a full figure\u2026.certainly not fat, but quite curvy, with wide, womanly hips and, from what Carl could see a wonderful set of boobs barely contained in a tight-fitting police uniform, a uniform bearing a tag that read \u201cOfficer Brenda Nelson\u201d  \u201cDid you get lost\u2026..Tommy?\u201d she asked Carl after reading his name tag.  \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d she whispered sweetly to him, \u201cI won\u2019t tell anybody, but let\u2019s get you back to your class, okay sweetie?\u201d she said, holding her hand out to Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl had been pondering something.  He figured there had to be a way to move in and out of bodies without making a huge, obvious scene\u2026real spy kinda shit.  He had an idea, and he thought this was as good a time as any to give it a try.  Carl looked Brenda up and down as she sat with her hand still held out to him.  \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll do all right.\u201d  Brenda\u2019s smile slackened into a look of confusion; she tilted her head inquisitively.  Suddenly, Carl laid his tiny hands on the unsuspecting officer\u2019s heaving chest, just atop her cleavage, and he concentrated.  Brenda struggled slightly and grunted a little, but only for a moment.  Suddenly, Carl\u2019s vision blurred; the world seemed to shimmer.  Regaining his senses, Carl found himself bent down and looking over at a very confused Tommy.  Carl glanced down to see two massive, fleshy mounds sticking out of his chest.  He reached a manicured hand up to fondle one just to make sure it was his.  He looked again at the confused boy.  Standing up slowly so as not to be thrown too much by the weight of his bosom, Carl looked down at the confused Tommy.  Patting him lightly on the head, Carl said, \u201cThanks for the lift, little fella,\u201d from inside the possessed officer.  Then he opened the door again and practically shoved the little boy from the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl turned and quickly marched toward a restroom door to examine his new form.  He savored the swaying of his hips and bouncing of his chest.  Stepping in front f the mirror, Carl was amazed at the feeling that bombarded him.  He again reached his hands up to mush his massive breasts together, also feeling the bra straps digging into his shoulders to keep the jello-like mounds in place.  Moving farther down, Carl caressed his new belly, a full belly with a tiny pouch in front, likely from age.  He reached his hands around and gave himself a good slap in his bubbly, cushy ass, watching it jiggle.  \u201cDamn\u2026I never been inside a bitch before,\u201d Carl said, marveling at the first female body he had yet inhabited, \u201cbut lady I\u2019d totally fuck you\u2026if I weren\u2019t inside you already,\u201d Carl said to his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tCarl takes Brenda\u2019s wonderful body to go out and chat with Trask.<br>\r\n2)\tWithout thinking, Carl has walked into the men\u2019s room.  A portly, older janitor man walks in and demands to know what the very female officer is doing in the men\u2019s room. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time to get down to business.  Carl tore himself from the mirror and walked, hips swaying, out of the bathroom.  He spotted Trask at his desk nearby and walked up to him, resting his new hands on the bastard\u2019s desk.  \u201cHey, Brenda,\u201d Trask said as he filled out some forms.  \u201cHey, Nick,\u201d Carl replied, \u201cheard you had a rough night.\u201d  \u201cYeah, maybe I\u2019m coming down with something,\u201d Trask admitted.  \u201c\u2026well I dunno,\u201d Carl began, \u201cI don\u2019t know of a bug that leaves you passed out in a heap in your own living room without so much as a stuffy nose or a slight headache first\u2026..you better get that looked at.\u201d  Trask looked up from his desk in surprise, \u201cthe living room\u2026.I never told anybody where I woke\u2026.\u201d Trask trails off, checking his memory to make sure he had not told Brenda that little detail.  \u201cHmmmm,\u201d Carl said playfully, \u201cthen you better get your ass to the shrink on the double,\u201d Carl advised as he turned around and walked toward the door.  <br>\r\nCarl saw a man walking in front of him.  An older man, probably in his late 50s with an unkempt appearance, and balding head, and a quite pudgy figure, this man wore a custodian\u2019s uniform and had keys jingling from his strained belt.  He was hauling around a mop in one of those yellow water containers.  \u201cHey you,\u201d Carl called out to the man, who turned quickly to see what the pretty officer wanted.  Carl put his manicured hand on the plump man\u2019s protruding belly and concentrated again, until his vision blurred and he found himself feeling odd.  He looked across at a very confused Officer Brenda Nelson and looked down at his new self, seeing a large, protruding belly and waist shoved tightly into a pair of strained trousers.  \u201cYeah, Nick,\u201d he called out loudly in a gravelly voice, \u201cI\u2019d get that looked at quick!\u201d  He let the wet mop drop to the floor, turned clumsily and slowly toward the door, and waddled his pudgy body though it, hearing it close behind him as his keys jingled with each step.  <br>\r\nCarl walked as quickly as his short pudgy legs could carry him, until he was a bit away from the commotion he had just caused.  He couldn\u2019t hear the conversation between Trask and Brenda, but, through the bulletproof window, it seemed like Trask was interrogating her\u2026.asking her why she had just talked to him and how she knew what she seemed to know.  Brenda had a very confused look on her face, shaking her head adamantly and seeming to have no idea what the hell Trask was talking about.  The janitor\u2019s belly shook as Carl laughed to himself, \u201cSquirm you little fuck!\u201d Carl said devilishly, \u201cand Brenda you\u2019ve been wonderful,\u201d Carl said from far away as he blew her a kiss.  \u201cI\u2019ll have to borrow you again later.\u201d  Still in the janitor, Carl slowly turned around from the scene, figuring he had gotten himself off to a fine start.<br>\r\nCarl then\u2026.<br>\r\n1)\tLeft that old janitor\u2019s body, re-entered his own, and went to Trask\u2019s neighborhood to have more fun when he got home.<br>\r\n2)\tLeft the man\u2019s body, re-entered his own, and went back to his own apartment to rest and plan more.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl figured he\u2019d gotten Trask good and frazzled, and Brenda\u2019s body had been a real treat\u2026he\u2019d have to try to posses women more often.  He walked clumsily, still in the body of the fat janitor, toward a restroom, where he hoped to dump his borrowed body.  Just as he was about to enter it, he glanced up and saw a sort of departmental bulletin board, one that had posted on it certain events that were important to people who worked for the police force.  \u201cLet\u2019s seeeee\u2026\u2026\u201d Carl said, \u201cApril 24th\u2026.Nick Trask givin presentation at William H. Harrison Elementary School,\u201d he read aloud.  \u201cHoly hell!  That\u2019s tomorrow!  \u2026It\u2019s a date, fat-ass!\u201d Carl quietly exclaimed in his host\u2019s rough voice.  Carl went ahead and entered the restroom, awkwardly bending down to ensure nobody was in any of the stalls.  He looked at his body in one of the big mirrors on the wall, and he began to concentrate.  This time too, the pain was significant.  The body of the possessed janitor began to convulse and spasm, his big gut shaking like jelly with every jerky movement.  \u201cAhhhh fuck I hate this part,\u201d Carl lamented as the first wisp of smoke forced itself from the janitor\u2019s throat.  The body tensed up as more and more of Carl\u2019s essence was ejected from it, until eventually Carl\u2019s ethereal form re-emerged, and Carl watched his former host just sort of fall limply straight backward as dead weight.  The backward inertia forced his feet up when he hit the ground, then brought them back down with a hard thud, causing a jingle of the man\u2019s keys.  The man sprawled out unconscious on the floor, with nothing but the slow rhythm of his breathing to indicate he was alive.  Carl walked out of the police station, returned to his body at the hotel, and went home.  He spent the rest of the day hanging out at his apartment, thinking of ways to mess with Trask tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke early the next morning intending to head to William H. Harrison Elementary School, which was but a couple minutes from his apartment.  Again he left his pilotless body in his apartment for safe keeping and went on his way.  Arriving at the school, Carl noted that a number of parents had apparently come to see the presentation as well, as their children led doting mothers and fathers by the hand into the building.  He saw one woman he thought could be of use to him.  She was probably in her mid-40s with a somewhat plain face, but a quite full body, wide hips, and big boobs encased in an ordinary t-shirt\u2026basically a well-endowed soccer mom.  She was rather tall\u2026probably about 5 foot 10 and a little girl who came up about to her waist was excitedly leading her into the school building.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Carl ran up behind the woman and simply walked into her body in mid-transit.  His vision blurred as usual.  He felt odd again\u2026his new host was probably quite beautiful at one time, but she\u2019d let herself go while shouldering the burdens of motherhood.  Carl looked down and saw an ample chest and just a wee bit of cleavage peaking out from the collar of his shirt.  He reached up and felt the ample mounds and noticed the bra straps digging into his shoulders.  The cups of the lacy bra were right above a belly that had a slight bulge to it, which Carl could feel sticking out above the rather tight set of jeans.  These were not low-rider jeans\u2026.they were the kind women seem to wear as they age a little bit, the ones that come farther and farther up to control increasing amounts of waist and belly fat as they age.  This woman was certainly no pin-up girl, but she had a certain matronly beauty about her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, mommy!\u201d Carl heard and jarred himself from examining his form.  Looking down, he saw a cute little blonde girl who\u2019d wrapped her little arms around the woman\u2019s hefty thighs, trying to urge her on.  \u201cAll right sweetie,\u201d Carl said in a voice quite foreign to him, and the little girl grabbed his arm and led him into the school building, with Carl savoring the jiggle that accompanied his new body\u2019s every step.  The little girl led him into a room filled with jabbering parents and kids, with the parents sitting in student-sized chairs entirely too small for them.  Carl forced his full body into such a chair.  A woman who was presumably the teacher was making the rounds and welcoming the parents to the presentation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher was probably in her early 60s, her hair done up like an old lady\u2019s.  Her body was rather plump, with a large chest and flabby belly encased in a dress made of a thick flannel-like material with buttons in the front.  It was the sort of dress you wore when you\u2019d gotten old enough that all your curves were too flabby and you wanted to cover them up.  She wore a thin white turtleneck under the dress to cover her chubby arms, and she had on thick round glasses.  Her face, with its double chin, seemed hardened into a perpetual smile she used to greet every parent and make polite conversation.  \u201cIt\u2019d make more sense to use her,\u201d Carl thought, \u201cas a class mom, I can\u2019t get too close to Trask, but as the teacher\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Trask walked into the room, clad in a blue suit and white shirt to contain his bulging belly.  He walked in and stood, arms folded, in the front of the class.  The teacher now came to the woman Carl was possessing, standing just before Carl.  \u201cMrs. Henderson!\u201d she said as if they were old friends.  Carl smiled back.  \u201cOhhh we just love having little Clare in the class\u2026.she\u2019s a doll!\u201d the teacher declared.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite a turn-out today; enjoy the presentation!\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m sure I will,\u201d Carl said.  Then he silently reached up and grabbed the teacher\u2019s shoulder, concentrating.  The blurriness returned, and Carl found himself in the body of the chubby woman looking down at a very confused Mrs. Henderson.  Carl simply turned around, \u201cI\u2019m sure I will lady\u201d he said in the teacher\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe introduced Trask to the class, and they all said hello to him in unison.  He went through his prepared talk about how cops were people\u2019s friends and how it was good to never fight and always get a adult if you ever found a gun\u2026all the good stuff most people hear from cops as kids.  About half way through the presentation, Carl raised the teacher\u2019s chubby hand and made his way to the front of the room, his meaty thighs rubbing together under his dress the whole way.  \u201cDetective,\u201d Carl said, \u201cI wonder if you could tell the boys and girls something about\u2026uhm\u2026.what it\u2019d like to ride in a police car.\u201d  \u201cSure, mam,\u201d Trask said just as Carl had reached the front of the room and was looking directly up at Trask.  \u201cThank you, detective,\u201d Car said as he patted Trask quickly on the chest and the feeling of dizziness returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside Trask, Carl looked down at the confused, portly old lady with a chuckle and went on talking about what a cop car was like, having spent plenty of time in them himself.  He talked about all the cool dials and the lights and the PA system that every car had, and the kids ate up every word.  Toward the end of that, he invited the teacher back up, and she obliged, despite being a bit confused about how she had lost the first chunk of the presentation altogether.  He tapped her on the back, jumping back into her body.  Carl looked up through very thick glasses at the very confused Trask, \u201cAre you all right detective?\u201d he asked in a concerned voice.  \u201cUmmm\u2026yeah sure I\u2019m fine, no problem at all,\u201d he replied uncertainly.  Carl now lowered his voice to a near whisper, \u201cSpacing out in front of the kids?  What would the chief say?  Did you get into the doctor like I told you yesterday?  You better be careful or you\u2019ll make that pregnant wife of yours sick too.\u201d  Trask looked down at Carl\u2019s borrowed body with a look of shock, horror, and confusion.  \u201cBoys and girls, I have to talk with your teacher alone for a minute; you all be good till I get back.  Keep your parents in line, okay?\u201d he said, and the kids chuckled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask took Carl by the arm and walked her into the hallway, closing the heavy wooden door.  Just as the door closed, Trask grabbed Carl\u2019s pudgy little body by the dress and slammed it into the wall, lifting the teacher clean off the floor.  \u201cWhat the hell are you?!\u201d Trask demanded.  Carl could only laugh, and his belly and tits shook mightily as he did.  \u201cHa ha oh my goodness dear boy, you\u2019ve got a temper!\u201d he exclaimed.  \u201cAnswer me, dammit!  How do you know about yesterday and my wife?  Who are you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Carl began, \u201cfirst, be careful with me\u2026I\u2019m a chubby old lady at the moment, and this body ain\u2019t as durable as some.\u201d  Trask put Carl down.  \u201cAs for who I am\u2026that\u2019s a toughie.  The name you\u2019d know me by\u2026.well\u2026.that\u2019s for me to know and for you to agonize over, but I\u2019ll tell you this much:  I\u2019m whoever the hell I want to be.  I\u2019m a chubby little kid on a field trip to the police station.\u201d  Trask seemed more and more taken aback with every word.  Carl went on, \u201cThen I\u2019m a busty blonde cop lady, then maybe a chubby little janitor man with a mop and some keys.\u201d  Trask was awe-struck, \u201cHow\u2026.\u201d  \u201cHow\u2019s not the question fatty!\u201d said Carl, sounding as angry as the little sweet old lady could, \u201cit\u2019s who.  Who will I be next?  Who knows?  Maybe your mommy come to visit.  Maybe your sweet little wife.  Maybe even YOU!\u201d Carl pointed at Trask. \u201cPoint is\u2026you won\u2019t know unless I want you to know, and I want you to walk around all day every day wondering whether this\u2019ll be the day I pounce.  Wondering whether the woman who looks like your wife is really your wife.  Is Brenda really Brenda?\u201d         <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carl curled Mrs Henderson's lips into a wicked grin as he thought back to what he'd said to Trask in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, Carl slumped back in the seat and took another look down at his huge breasts.

He maneuvered his wonderful body out of the luxury automobile, closing the door and composing himself.  He adjusted his boobs and took a deep breath as if preparing for a great performance, then walked across the street savoring every jiggle along the way.  Reaching the front door of Trask\u2019s house, he knocked on the door three times and then put his hands on his motherly hips and cracked the most sweet-looking smile he could, expecting Trask\u2019s pregnant wife to answer.  A couple moments later, Carl heard the door being fiddled with and watched as it swung open.  But the person greeting him was not Jennifer Trask\u2026she was much older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was small of stature and seemed to be about 50 years old.  She had on a thin red blouse that showed off a bit of her chest, the centerpiece of which was her two large\u2014if somewhat droopy\u2014breasts.  Her belly too contained a bit of flab, as age will cause; she had her hair tied back in a tight bun, and little streaks of graying hair were visible to those with the patience to look.  Lines appeared here and there on her face, but she wasn\u2019t ugly\u2026she was probably a real looker at some point earlier in life.  \u201cUuuuhmm, hello,\u201d Carl said pleasantly surprised at the stranger, \u201cIs Mrs. Trask here?\u201d  \u201cOh no I\u2019m sorry dear she\u2019s not; Jennifer\u2019s out doing a little bit of shopping, and I\u2019m fixing dinner at the moment.  Who might you be?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nCarl thought fast, \u201cMy name is Tammy Henderson; I\u2019m a financial planner, and I\u2019m a friend of Nick.  Since he\u2019s got a baby on the way, he told me to come by and brainstorm some ways to start saving for the little guy\u2019s college.\u201d  \u201cOh,\u201d said the woman, surprised, \u201cwell I hadn\u2019t heard about that, but with the market these days it\u2019s best to start early eh?\u201d she said laughing.  \u201cIndeed,\u201d Carl agreed, smiling.  \u201cWell I\u2019m Nick\u2019s mother Beverly,\u201d she said, extending a hand, which Carl shook, \u201cwon\u2019t you come in and wait?  One of them will be home soon.\u201d  \u201cWhy thank you\u2026Beverly is it?  I\u2019d be happy to wait,\u201d and the imposter followed Beverly Trask into her son\u2019s home.  The two women walked into the kitchen, where Carl could smell the BBQ ribs and fresh-baked rolls.  Mrs. Trask took a rolling pin on the counter and walked across to a cabinet to put it away.  Before doing so, she turned to make polite conversation.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry miss your name\u2019s escaped me; who would you be again?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Henderson.\" Carl replied, flashing a smile, \"Tammy Henderson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right dear.\" Beverly answered, \"Just sit tight since Nicky should be home soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Carl sat and waited... rather impatiently at that.  He had come hoping that Nick's lovely wife would be there so he could jump into her body and instead he was stuck waiting in Tammy's while Trask's doddering mother went about her activities blissfully unaware of who she was really dealing with.  Carl entertained the thought of jumping into Beverly's body but quickly ruled it out; he had already been inside one fat old crone so he didn't need to be stuck inside another, no matter how short of a time it may have been.  Ten minutes that felt more like ten years passed but finally the door opened and in stepped Nick Trask.  Upon seeing \"Tammy\" sitting on the couch, he was taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Nicky.\" Carl said, greeting Trask with a wave and a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Trask exclaimed in surprise, \"What are you doing here?!\"  Before Carl could say anything however Trask added in, \"No, not here.  Come out front with me and we'll talk there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl, with a shrug, stood up and followed Trask out the front door.  \"Something wrong, Nicky?  You don't seem happy to see me.\" Carl asked with a malicious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you, what are you doing here?\" Trask again much more sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's pretty grin grew wider, \"I told ya, asshole, I was gonna get you back for fuckin' me overwhere.  Any time, any place, anyone.  You won't be able to so much as take a piss without wondering who's really who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom...\" Trask said, \"You better not have harmed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl laughed and shook his head, \"Don't worry she's fine.  I ain't got any reason to hurt her.  She didn't do nothin' to me... not like YOU.\" Carl's borrowed lips curled into a sneer when uttering that last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was tense, a brief moment of silence filled the air as the two stared daggers into eachother.  Trask, finally, was the first to speak.  \"Leave.\" he said while motioning with his arm, \"Leave now or I'll have the whole force on your apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl, inwardly, winced as he didn't know what would happen to him if his body died.  Outwardly, however, his facade never dropped.  \"I'll leave for now but call the whole force to the apartment.  Hell, call the FBI!  Why should I care anymore with these abilities?\" he said smirking, hopefully Trask would be fooled by his bluff.  As he turned around and walked back to Tammy's car, an Asian girl walked by him towards Trask.  Slyly, Carl listened in on the conversation as he got into Tammy's car..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mr. Trask, is Mrs. Trask around?\" she asked the cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Christina but she's out right now.\" came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well I just wanted to know if she needed any help today.\" The girl, Christina, stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Trask replied, \"Besides my mother and I are here tonight so she'll have no problems with anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then.\" Christina said, \"Well, see you tomorrow then!  Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl watched as Trask walked back into the house while Christina walked down the street.  When she had gotten a little bit ahead Carl started the car and followed her.  When she started turning up a driveway, Carl put the car in park and jumped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you!  Young lady!\" he called out to her causing her to stop and turn around.  \"Come here, I have something I need to ask you!\" he said while motioning for her to come over.  Christina, though, remained hesitant so Carl decided to sweeten things.  \"It's about a babysitting job, I could really use your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Christina's eyes lit up a little and, against her better judgement, she walked over to Carl.  Like fish in a barrel, he thought, before resuming.  \"My name's Tammy Henderson and I just wanted to ask if you'd be able to watch my daughter, Clare, for a few hours every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter?\" Christina asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, right.\" Carl nodded, \"She goes to the elementary school and gets out after you guys so just wait at the bus stop and except for days like today where I can leave early, watch her until about 5:30.\"  As he watched Christina mull it over, he sweetened the deal.  \"$15 a day for only an hour and a half of work.  Plus TV and food privelages, so long as you limit it to sandwiches, chips and sodas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, however, Christina wasn't completely sold.  \"This seems a little TOO good to be true, ma'am.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I just need you to watch over someone for a short time each day.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina, however, shook her head.  \"Sorry ma'am but my schedule's a little filled up right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started turning around, Carl grabbed her wrist.  He wanted to bring her to somewhere a little less open but this was too good a chance to pass up.  He concentrated and blacked out, coming to in a body that was much smaller and being held at the wrist.  \"God, I said NO!  Let go of me old lady!\" Carl exclaimed.  He squirmed free of Tammy's hand and dashed inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching his breath, he brushed a bit of long black hair out of his face and looked down at his smaller, much skinnier body.  He pawed at his small, developing breasts and then scanned his new memories.  Christina Yang was a 13-years-old Chinese-American girl, she was the daughter of Darryl and Eileen Yang and had an older sister, Diane, who was 16.  For the last few months she had been working as a babysitter for parents in the neighborhood for the little kids who were way to young to stay home on their own.  She had also, and this is why Carl targetted her, been doing chores and simple household work for Trask's pregnant wife so she could take it easy while Christina earned extra money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the perfect trojan horse, cute and adorable and nobody would suspect her of masking evil, deranged thoughts of revenge.  As Christina, he could be close to Trask and through little actions, breaking a TV or window here, stealing money or other things there, maybe something with that wife of his... he would slowly drive Trask nuts as nobody would suspect sweet, innocent Christina Yang of anything!  And if they did, well it's not like Carl would be caught holding the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when he hatched a potential idea that was far more devious.  Christina was cute and charming... charming in ways that might work to Carl's advantage.  She had friends.  She had a smoking hot older sister who had a reputation for being a little easy.  Her sister had friends.  Eileen, in her early 40s, had aged gracefully and was still stunning and no doubt there were other attractive women in the neighborhood, like Charlene and her friends that lived right next door to Trask.  With all of these potential bodies Carl could charm the pants off of Trask... literally!  He could use their charms to make that asshole cop look like a womanizer, an adulterer or someone who couldn't stay away from jailbait.  Ruin his reputation, ruin his marriage and completely destroy his character by making him look to be a scumbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stopped in front of a mirror on a hallway wall.  Taking a look at himself, he tucked a bit of hair behind his ear and gave a smirk.  \"Christina, girl, you're a real cutie.\" he said, it was the girl's voice but it came out lower and rougher... like she was trying to do a Carl impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Carl laughed a very un-Christina laugh.</span></div></div>",

Carl decided that he was not only going to ruin Trask's marriage and reputation, but he was going to see him sent to prison too for 'messing around' with an underage girl. He knew that meant using Christina's body for some unsavory acts, but he was cool with it, it wasn't as though she would know or have any memory of what he did while in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl stripped out of his 'victim's clothing, he got to see her cute little body first hand. The girl had not long since gone through puberty and so her vagina was sexually active. Carl ran Christina's own fingers around the outlines of her little snatch, giggling as he did so. \"Nice!\" he nodded, Christina's voice once again having a slightly lower tone to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis exploration was cut short when he heard some music go on in the room adjacent to Christina's, and the volume quickly went up also. \"Lets see who's behind door number two shall we!\" Carl snickered, before violently exiting Christina's naked body through her mouth, rising into the air as a swirl of white mist and blowing some papers off a nearby shelf in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christina's body slumped unconscious to the floor of her bedroom, Carl shot through the wall and into the next room. He saw Christina's older sister Diane sat on her bed, sending a text on her phone and moving her head in rhythm to the music. She was wearing a white tank top, a short, pink jacket and some denim shorts, her black flats were by the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's etheral form quickly moved in Diane's direction...and he forced himself down her throat...making her gag. Seconds later, after his non-corporeal form had hijacked the girl's body, Carl opened her eyes and took an admiring look down at himself. \"Ooh, good looks run in the family, always nice to see\" Carl chuckled in Diane's voice, as he grabbed at her boobs and rubbed his denim-covered crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should use this one instead to ruin Trask\" he chuckled wickedly. But then Carl shook that idea from his head, Diane was 16, that asshole Trask wouldn't be sent to prison for screwing her, even though it would ruin his marriage and his reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was worth a visit in any case\" Carl muttered, shrugging his host's shoulders. He then had a quick finger of Diane's pussy before exiting the body in the same fashion he had her sister's minutes earlier, allowing it to slump backwards on the bed. Carl quickly went back into Christina's room and re-entered the 13-year old's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Carl moved Christina's neck from side to side until it cracked \"That's better\" he mumbled, before getting to his feet and putting his young victim's clothes back on. He then decided to bide his time until tomorrow, it wasn't as though he would be bored.</span></div></div>",

He continued doing so as he went through all of Christina's photos, noticing a few of her more attractive friends, especially from her beach albums. \"Maybe I can host a little sleepover here...\" he pondered, Christina's lips turning into a smirk. \"Hey, Mom!\" he shouted in the girl's voice. \"...MOOOOOOM?\"<br>\r\n\"She's out for the night!\" Diane's voice replied from afar, sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n\"This is perfect...\" he snickered as he opened up the phone's contacts, sending several invitations to the girls he recognized from the pictures. \"They won't be here for a while, though...\" He then stood up, removed his hand from the girl's snatch and made his way to Diane's room.<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" she sneered as Christina peeked her head in.<br>\r\n\"I'm having a sleepover!\" Carl replied in a cheerful tone, fully entering the room.<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" Diane yelled. \"Mom's not home, and I don't want your bratty friends running around the house!\"<br>\r\n\"They won't be here for a while,\" Carl replied with a grin. \"I just need some entertainment in the meantime.\" He felt a piece of himself shoot off, and saw a small entity fly into Diane's body, causing her irritated expression to turn into one of surprise. After a few seconds, though, the 16-year old was feeling herself up and trying to undress.<br>\r\n\"Of course I can help, sis.\" Diane winked as she eyed up and grabbed her breasts. \"Looks like I'm a bit more stacked than you, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's see.\" Christina replied with a smirk as she took off her shirt and bra and held her B-cup breasts in her hands. Her possessed sister did the same with her D-cups, fondling them with a lusty expression.<br>\r\n\"We'll have to check up close!\" Diane giggled as she and her younger sister pressed up against each other, which soon turned into the two girls making out, shirtless, as both of them tried to undress the other in a frenzy. The two went at it for quite some time until they heard the house's doorbell ring.<br>\r\n\"Don't... worry...\" Christina squealed in between moans, currently being eaten out by her older sister. \"I'll get it...\" Carl's spirit left her body and flew downstairs and outside to see his guest. She was a petite-looking white girl in jeans and a V-neck, showing off her C-cups. She brushed aside her black hair and rang the doorbell once more, as Carl flew into the teenager.<br>\r\n\"These look just as big as they do in those pictures...\" Carl chuckled as his host's hands shot up to her tits. \"Nice ass, too.\" he mumbled, slapping the girl's ass. He opened the unlocked front door and made his way back to Diane's room, where she was still going at it with an unconscious Christina. Carl shot a clone into her and she bolted up, her tits jiggling as she laughed and grabbed them.<br>\r\n\"So who's this one again?\" Carl asked as he rubbed his host's snatch over the jeans.<br>\r\n\"Nicole...\" Christina replied, laying back down and holding back screams.<br>\r\n\"Perfect, perfect.\" he replied with a laugh as he undressed Nicole's body, soon seeing her naked body in front of the full-body mirror.<br>\r\n\"She'll make a great addition...\" Carl muttered as he sat down to masturbate to the show of incest in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more girls showed up later that night, and all of them were quickly possessed upon entering the Yang house. Morgan, a redhead with B-cups like Christina, Constance, a blonde with only A-cups but an amazing ass and legs, and Stephanie, a chubby girl who Carl accidentally invited but decided to go along with it anyways.<br>\r\n\"Now what're we gonna do, boss?\" Constance asked, lowering her leggings to reveal her ass in front of the mirror with a grin.<br>\r\n\"We can't just leave all these chicks alone, now can we?\" Carl laughed, now in Christina's body once more as he sat on the carpet, topless.<br>\r\n\"Might wanna let this one be, though.\" Stephanie replied, unamused with his host, but still feeling herself up as she sat in her bra and panties.<br>\r\n\"We can always make some adjustments, 'Steph'!\" Morgan giggled as she fingered herself with one hand on her tit, watching Nicole and Diane making out and trying to scissor in the corner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Carl jumped as he heard a door close nearby.  He suddenly looked up to see a woman coming in from a patio.  She appeared to be in her early 40s and of Asian descent, like Christina.  She had long dark hair that was let down and beautifully about her.  She had a wonderful smile, with just a few slight lines made visible by age.  She had very large breasts being held back by a thin blue bikini top, and they jiggled about with each step.  Her bouncy chest gave way to a belly that was still firm but with a slight fullness to it\u2026age again.  Bikini bottoms tightly hugged wide, child-bearing hips and a nice round ass.  This was Eileen Yang, Christina\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI come in from sunbathing to find you talking to yourself girl,\u201d Eileen said in mock disappointment, \u201coh what will I do with you?\u201d  \u201cOh\u2026.ah\u2026.mom,\u201d Carl began, \u201cdidn\u2019t realize you were home.\u201d  Carl got an idea\u2026he could use Eileen.  Ruining Trask should be a bit like a cat-and-mouse game\u2026and with all these wonderful bodies around, why pass up the opportunity to not just mess with Trask\u2019s mind, but also ruin his reputation in the neighborhood?  Carl walked Christina\u2019s little body into the kitchen where Eileen was drinking some water.  He entered silently, his vessel\u2019s face expressionless.  Eileen stood as she gulped down ice water, and Carl watched her quietly, walking around to examine her from different angles.  He took in every sumptuous curve\u2014the cushy ass, the wide, motherly hips, even the little tiny pouch in her belly.  Eileen finished her drink and watched as her daughter started at her up and down like a biologist examining a new-found species.  He struggled to remove his eyes from the jello-like tits that jostled with Eileen\u2019s every move. \u201cHoney,\u201d Eileen began, \u201care you all right?  You\u2019re acting strangely.\u201d  Carl continued staring, \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026I just like your boobies.\u201d  If Eileen had had a mouthful of water at the moment, she\u2019d have spit it out, judging from the look on her face.  She blushed and smiled quite awkwardly, \u201cWell you\u2019re only 13,\u201d she began, \u201cwait a few years and you\u2019ll have a set all your own.\u201d  Carl, tucked away in Christina\u2019s body, looked up at the perplexed Eileen.  Christina\u2019s face spread itself into the widest, most toothy grin anybody had ever seen, like somebody had just given her a pony or something.  \u201cI know a faster way,\u201d Carl declared matter-of-factly.  Suddenly, he reached his host\u2019s tiny hands out and firmly grabbed hold of Eileen\u2019s tits.  She looked incensed and started to struggle for a moment, but then Carl blacked out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision cleared, and he found himself looking down at Christina, who had staggered back a few steps.  He looked down at his own frame, moving slightly to watch the giant mounds on his chest jostle about.  \u201cWha\u2026\u2026\u201d a confused Christina began, \u201cwhat happen\u2014I remember this lady\u2026then\u2026.\u201d  \u201cStop livin\u2019 in the past young one,\u201d Christina\u2019s possessed mother commanded happily, \u201cwe\u2019ve got work to do!\u201d  Carl grabbed Christina by the wrist and pulled her into the master bathroom, his borrowed body jiggling about the whole way.  Carl sat his borrowed ass down in front of a grand mirror and looked at Christina.  He handed her some lipstick, make-up, and some eye shadow.  \u201cHere hon, fix me up!\u201d he commanded as he put the lipstick in his daughter\u2019s hand.  \u201cUuuuhm\u2026..why can\u2019t you do this?\u201d Christina asked, confused.  \u201cHard to tell,\u201d Carl replied hurriedly, \u201csomething\u2019s ahhh\u2026.something\u2019s gotten into me,\u201d he said, chuckling.  \u201cNow just do me up!\u201d  They spent the next few minutes in the bathroom while Christina applied lipstick, eye shadow, and make-up to her mom\u2019s inhabited body.  Carl watched the transformation in the mirror, his gaze alternating back and forth between Eileen\u2019s face and her heaving chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay mom, done,\u201d Christina declared after some time.  Carl looked into the mirror to see his done-up appearance.  He gazed upon a beautiful woman.  Ruby red lipstick adorned her lips, and here eyelashes glistened in the light.  She had a distinguished, refined look about her.  \u201cThanks baby!\u201d Carl said to Christina as he stood up and walked quickly into the closet that was nearby.  He threw open the door and looked around, glancing around at various dresses and bras.  \u201cFuck this,\u201d Carl said to himself as he had another idea.  \u201cMom\u2026.what did you say?\u201d Christina said, surprised.  \u201cOh nothing\u2026nothing honey,\u201d Carl said in a hurry.  He quickly made his way to a dresser and threw open the drawer, nearly pulling it out of the dresser altogether.  He reached in and thrashed the clothes about to find something he liked, discarding all the other stuff on to the floor as his daughter watched\u2026very confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw something.  He reached in and pulled out a pair of pants\u2026a pair of black leather pants, the kind that would be worn by a biker chick or perhaps an exotic dancer.  He stood quickly, throwing himself a bit off balance given the new weight on his chest.  Carl turned to see that Christina had walked away.  He excitedly forced his first leg into the pants, then the second leg.  As he forced the pants up over the bikini bottoms, Carl struggled.  He yanked and pulled until he got the tight pants all the way up to his wide hips.  Panting a bit, Carl exclaimed, \u201cthis body must have put on a little weight since the last time she wore these.\u201d  Carl inhaled as much as he could and held his breath long enough to button the pants, exhaling mightily as he watched a wee bit of excess skin peek out over the tops of the leather pants.  \u201cWell that was interesting,\u201d he said, winded.          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl walked awkwardly, leather pants riding up his borrowed ass, back into the closet.  There he saw a sort of leather vest hanging on a hanger.  \u201cJust what I need,\u201d Carl declared.  He reached out and grabbed the leather vest and put it on; it too was small.  He walked out of Eileen\u2019s room looking like a hooker.  On the way to the door, he had a thought.  \u201cDiane!\u201d he yelled out, wanting to see his body\u2019s elder daughter.  Within a few seconds she appeared.  \u201cYeah mo\u2026.what the hell are you wearing?!\u201d she said, amazed.  Little Christina appeared behind her, staying back to observe her increasingly strange mother from afar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time for that now, just zip me up,\u201d Carl commanded Diane, motioning to the vest.  Diane approached her leather-clad, middle-aged mother pensively.  She slowly reached down and grabbed the zipper of the vest, putting the two parts of it together, then pulling it only partially up.  She struggled to get it farther up, but it would not got.  \u201cMy god suck in that gut and those boobs mom,\u201d Diane said as she tried to zip the vest the rest of the way up.  \u201cWell I got this flab giving birth to you, so shut it,\u201d Carl barked as he again inhaled while Diane quickly zipped the thing the rest of the way up.  It was a low-cut vest, meaning it didn\u2019t cover much at all; it just smooshed Eileen\u2019s ample cleavage together and tried, along with the still-on bikini top, to hold the mounds in place.  \u201c\u2019Bout time,\u201d Carl said to confused Diane.  Carl then walked awkwardly\u2014the tightness of the clothes constraining his borrowed body\u2019s movement\u2014into the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of wine from the cabinet.  He walked back into the foyer where Eileen\u2019s children stood.  \u201cUm, where are you going mom?\u201d Diane asked.  \u201cTo Nick Trask\u2019s house,\u201d Carl answered, smiling.  \u201cTrask?\u201d Diane said in surprise, \u201cthe chubby cop down the street?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Carl replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026what would dad thi\u2026..and ahhhh\u2026.why are you wearing\u2026.ummmmm\u2026\u201d Diane stammered.  \u201cOh honey when you\u2019ve got a body like this one, you\u2019ve always got to keep the girls on display,\u201d Carl said as he reached up and hefted his jiggling tits up, moaning audibly a bit.  \u201cDon\u2019t wait up,\u201d the possessed mom said to her confused children.  With that, she turned and walked hips swaying, from her house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked down the street a bit, watching as neighbors gawked at his leather-clad form.  She smiled at them, making sure his ass jiggled and swayed all the more as they watched, and the onlookers included Charlene and her roommates, all Trask\u2019s neighbors.  Suddenly, she spotted the fat bastard; he was out in front of his house watering plants.  He was still wearing his suit, his dress shirt straining against his hefty belly.  Carl walked seductively up to him and tapped him on the shoulder.  He turned around clumsily and looked down at Eileen.  \u201cHi, Eileen,\u201d he glanced up and down at her full body, \u201cwhat\u2026.ahhhh\u2026.what\u2019s up?\u201d  Without a word, Carl let the bottle of wine drop safely to the grass and put her arms around Trask, pulling him into a passionate kiss.  Trask was surprised and tensed up.  Pushing the envelope further, Carl jumped up and wrapped Eileen\u2019s legs fully around Trask\u2019s pudgy midsection.  \u201cShut up and kiss me baby,\u201d Eileen whispered.  Carl would totally have thrown up, but thank god Eileen had not eaten yet it seemed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tPushed Eileen\u2019s body off him and said \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d (reserved please)<br>\r\n2)\tSaid \u201cJust don\u2019t tell my wife or my mom.\u201d  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Carl used Eileen's manicured hands to feel and grope Trask's out of shape body, he fought the urge to gag, the lengths he would go to get back at someone amazed him sometimes for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...Trask gently pushed him away and looked into his eyes, grabbing his delicate wrists as he did so. \"Woah..woah, wait Eileen, since your daughter babysits for us now and then...not to mention the fact we're both married, I...just don't think this is appropriate\" Trask said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, traditions suck, lets be wild\" Carl cooed, using Eileen's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Trask could say anything else Carl had then pushed him into his house and closed the door. \"Is your mom home?\" Carl whispered to the fat cop, knowing full well that Beverly was in fact residing in the building. Trask just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets go upstairs!\" Carl grinned, slipping his host's left hand down Trask's pants and rubbing his erect cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...I don't know\" Trask mumbled back, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" Carl countered, contorting Eileen's lips into another wicked little grin. Carl loved the way the tight leather pants were hugging his shapely legs and the way the small vest was constricting his movement a little...squishing Eileen's boobs to such an extent that they were practically spilling out. Trask couldn't take his eyes off of those 'melons' as \"Eileen\" grabbed him by the hand and quietly led him upstairs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as the two were starting up the steps, Trask suddenly stopped moving.  Carl, inside the leather-clad Eileen, looked expectantly as his chubby adversary.  \u201cEileen, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d Trask declared, \u201cJennifer\u2019s got a baby on the way, and I love her, and I love my son, and I don\u2019t want to hurt them\u2026couldn\u2019t live with myself if I ever\u2026you know.\u201d  \u201cOh come on, Nick,\u201d Carl pleaded, \u201cdon\u2019t you like my body?\u201d Carl asked in a sexy, husky voice, grabbing Trask\u2019s hands and using them to massage Eileen\u2019s cushy boobs up and down.  Trask pulled back again, \u201cEileen, for Christ\u2019s sake, you\u2019re a beautiful woman, and you always will be, but I\u2019ve got a career and a family I love to think about\u2026.and you\u2019ve got a family too.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Eileen sighed heavily, exasperated.  \u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake, I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t cooperate,\u201d Carl told Trask as he laid Eileen\u2019s hand firmly on Trask\u2019s fluffy belly and concentrated.  He felt light-headed for a moment, and his vision blurred, then he got his bearings again.  Carl found himself again in Trask\u2019s overweight body and looking down at a very confused Eileen, who staggered back a bit and nearly fell over as she ambled about for a moment in confusion.  \u201cNick\u2026..what am I doing he\u2026..,\u201d she began, \u201cwhy am I wearing these clothes,\u201d she said as she ran her hands tentatively over her leather-clad body.  Carl maneuvered Trask\u2019s plump form down a couple stairs and looked at the confused woman, who looked back at him for answers.  \u201cShut the fuck up, bitch!\u201d he said as he balled up Trask\u2019s fist and slammed it into Eileen\u2019s skull as hard as he could.  Her body went limp as her head flew back and slammed into the wall of the foyer, after which she just sort of crumpled into a heap on the floor.  Trask looked down at Eileen, \u201cThanks for the lift lady, but let the professional take over,\u201d Carl said as he acclimated himself again to Trask\u2019s out-of-shape form.  He turned around and walked clumsily toward the door, stopping along the way at a mirror hanging on the wall.  Carl looked into the mirror and contorted his borrowed face into a sick grin, \u201cI\u2019m gonna drag your reputation down kicking and screaming even if I have to do it all by my fuckin\u2019 self,\u201d he said, hoping on some level that Trask could hear him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked slowly to Trask\u2019s car and got in.  He drove just a couple blocks to McGuffy\u2019s Bar, a local place frequented by off-duty cops.  They often congregated there to talk with each other about the stresses and pressures that only other cops could understand.  \u201cHey hey Trask buddy!\u201d a couple cops yelled to Carl as he walked in.  \u201cHey fellas,\u201d Carl yelled back, having no clue who the cops actually were.  Carl lumbered his bulging form up to the bar and sat his fat ass on a stool, ordering a shot of rum, which he quickly drank, without a chaser.  Then he drank another.  And another.  And yet another.  With time, Carl, tucked away in Trask\u2019s body, started to get more than a little tipsy.  \u201cAno\u2026..ano\u2019er\u201d Carl yelled out drunkenly to the bartender.  \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve had enough man?\u201d Rage flashed in Carl\u2019s eyes, \u201cNO!  I say ANO\u2019ER FUCKING DRINK!\u201d he yelled out at the man.  He was quickly furnished with more shots.  It was just then that Brenda, the full-bodied and lovely middle-aged blonde cop, came up and sat down next to Nick Trask.  \u201cHey Nick, how\u2019s it goin?,\u201d she asked amiably.  Carl pondered for a long minute, as if calculating a quantum physics problem, \u201coooohhhhh\u2026\u2026oooohhh\u2026.it\u2019s\u2026..isa\u2026isa fiiiiiinnnee,\u201d he finally got out, \u201cis awesome hahahaha.\u201d  Brenda chuckled, \u201cHad a bit too much have you, Nick?\u201d  Carl looked very surprised, \u201cOh hella no\u2026.no\u2026.no not too much; there\u2019s no sucha thing as too mucha dis stuff,\u201d he said as he held his empty glass in the air, demanding that if be filled yet again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d Carl wined, \u201cusa be I did this all time\u2026.e\u2019ry night almos\u2026.but not samuch nnn\u2026..nnnnn\u2026.now,\u201d he said as he let out a large belch.  \u201cOh, just wait \u2018till you get to be my age honey,\u201d Brenda said, \u201cit\u2019s like when you hit 40 something happens, the metabolism slows down, so you can\u2019t eat like you used to, \u2018cause every ounce of sugar flows right to your hips and your ass.  The young kids still look at me for now I know, but in another 10 or 15 years, they won\u2019t even do that,\u201d she said solemnly.  \u201cAnd Nick,\u201d she said, leaning in close, \u201chaving a big set of boobs ain\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be,\u201d she told him.  \u201cOhhhhh\u2026\u2026.I know\u2026..trusss me I know,\u201d Carl replied.  Brenda chuckled, \u201cHow could you possibly know?\u201d  \u201cOhhhhh I shouldn\u2019t tell you dat\u2026\u2026but juss truss me\u2026I know,\u201d he said, laughing drunkenly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore people started to look at Trask, or at least his body, as it got more and more drunk.  Carl turned slowly to look at the lovely Brenda, who looked back smiling politely.  He looked straight down at her large, heaving chest.  Without a word, he reached his host\u2019s hands out and grabbed two healthy handfuls of the lovely, fleshy mounds, moaning slightly.  Brenda quickly backed away, \u201cNick?!  Nick you\u2019re drunk, honey, what the hell are you doing?!\u201d  Carl stood slowly, Hofelly\u2026.baby\u2026I\u2019m doin\u2019\u2026..doin\u2019 you,\u201d he said as he sort of stumbled forward to rest his arms on Brenda\u2019s shoulders and stopped with very little room between them.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Immediately, Brenda slapped Carl across the face so hard that he spun around and went down, landing in a confused and drunken heap on the floor of the bar.  All the cops made some room, clearing a circular space to watch a drunken Nick Trask be dragged (with great effort) from the bar by the arms.  Brenda stood with her arms across her lovely chest as her eyes watched the exit of the grabby, wasted Trask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl felt himself being tossed from the bar to land hard on the concrete next to his car.  After a few minutes of lying there, he slowly stood up and fumbled around in his pockets for his keys.  After the fifth or sixth try, he actually managed to insert the key into the door of the locked car, opening it and getting slowly in.  \u201cOhhhh\u2026.fuuuuuck,\u201d Carl lamented his condition as he slowly and after many attempts put the key in the ignition and turned the car on.  His head throbbing and his stomach feeling like hell, he slowly back the car out of the parking lot and started to weave hazardously toward Trask\u2019s house, barely missing a couple wrecks along the way.  After a short drive at low speeds, weaving about through the suburban area, Carl arrived at Trask\u2019s house.  He parked in the driveway and did a fairly sloppy job of it, with the car at a very strange angle indeed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl looked out the car window to see an interesting sight.  There were a number of people in the yard.  A couple police cars were parked nearby, with officers out of the cars and on Trask\u2019s lawn.  Sitting on a bench on the porch of the house was Eileen Yang.  She was sitting with her eyes to the ground with her children around her.  She appeared to be balling her eyes out while the very pregnant Jennifer Trask consoled her.  Yang had a large bruise on her face with make-up smeared all about her.  Trask slowly got out of the car, and some officers started walking toward him.  \u201cDetective Trask,\u201d one officer called out, \u201cstay where you are.  We\u2019re to detain you sir.  You\u2019ve been accused of assaulting Mrs. Eileen Yang.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Carl saw Jennifer Trask jogging toward him, or moving as fast as she could in her impregnated condition.  She moved quickly toward him, her inflated belly and milk-filled breasts bouncing with every step.  \u201cHoney what did you do with Eileen?  What happened?\u201d she pleaded with her inebriated husband.  Without a word, Carl reached out and put his hands on Jennifer\u2019s pregnant body, concentrating as much as he could.  His vision blurred, and he found himself looking up at Nick Trask.  Carl looked down at his own body, one he\u2019d wanted to get into for some time.  He looked down to see two fleshy mounds protruding from his chest.  He reached up with his hands and grabbed them, moaning a little, then worked his way down to feel up his swollen belly.  \u201cOh my god,\u201d he said, in a voice that was quite foreign to him.  Carl quickly felt someone take him by the hand.  \u201cThis way mam,\u201d the cop said as he guided the possessed Jennifer away for her own safety.  Carl watched as a very confused and drunken Trask was pushed into a cop car and hauled off in the back seat.  Presumably, they were going to the station to hold Trask for the night and allow him to sober up, probably even arrest him for battery against Eileen Yang.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked, hips swaying, boobs and belly bouncing, back toward the Trask home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tPass the night inside Jennifer Trask\u2026.feel her up and explore her body.<br>\r\n2)\tGo home for the night.  Torture Nick Trask some more in the morning.       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then sniffed the manicured fingers he had used to masturbate with the previous night...and he grinned as he licked them, tasting his host's bodily fluids. \"I'm a dirty fuck...aren't I kiddo?\" he chuckled, patting Jennifer's swollen tummy with her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then struggled to get up off the couch and waddled into the kitchen for another beer before heading upstairs to 'relieve himself' in the bathroom, which was an experience in itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing his hands, Carl peered into the mirror at Jennifer's disheveled reflection, he used her manicured nails to pick the sleep from the corner of his eyes and yawned, before grinning. \"Why a chick like this would pick a fat fuck like Trask is totally beyond me!\" he mumbled as he then started feeling his large, jiggling tits again. \"Especially now that 'daddy' is a criminal\" Carl grinned wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which reminds me,\" Carl said to himself as he massaged the base of his back a little and continued glaring into the mirror. \"I really gotta pay El-fucknuts a visit in prison\" he smirked. \"Wait until he sees me wearing his little bitch!\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even having breakfast, Carl downed the rest of his beer...and then let out another loud belch, and he then grabbed Jennifer's coat and car keys and headed out of the house, not even bothering to lock up or put on some make-up, he cared not for such trifles. Maneuvering his pregnant form behind the steering wheel, Carl then swung Jennifer's legs in the car, shut the door and started the engine up. Driving recklessly, he headed towards the place where he had spent many years of his life, the nearest penitentiary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back here again!\" Carl sighed as he surveyed the prison walls through Jennifer's eyes. \"But not as an inmate this time\" he then added with another grin as he tensed his toes up inside Jennifer's flats and took another handful of her milk-engorged breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then stepped out of the car and made his way towards the visitor's entrance of the prison building, passing an armed guard along the way. \"Nice gun!\" Carl mocked the police officer as he walked past him, \"I bet you got a small dick though right?\" he then chuckled at him, causing the officer to frown at what he thought was just an ordinary pregnant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was fun!\" Carl then laughed in Jennifer's voice, as he proceeded inside the building.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That being said though, as heavy as the massive weight on his stomach was, and as irritating as all the little aches and pains that accompanied it could be, the actual kinkiness of being a pregnant woman was really pretty damn hot and Carl was currently having way more fun in Jennifer Trask's body than anyone else he'd possessed so far. Here he was, a 33 year old scumbag criminal, currently inhabiting the sweet, little innocent wife of his biggest enemy, and was actually carrying <i>his child</i> inside his belly. It was like the ultimate \"fuck you\", actually getting to mess with Trask's wife from inside her own body and there being nothing he could do about it. That fact alone was enough to convince him to hang around a little longer in her form, the sheer depravity of it turning him on like nothing before. \"Yeah, not just yet,\" he decided with a smirk, placing his delicate feminine hands on his bloated stomach and giving it a reassuring little rub as he felt the baby moving around inside, \"There's still so much more fun to be had as Mrs. Jennifer Trask.\" Breaking into a laugh, Carl then moved a hand down between his legs, feeling his pussy becoming moist once more (the almost constant horniness that came with his new pregnant hormones definitely being another big plus), thinking to himself as he did, that he'd yet to actually get a glimpse of it, having so far only pleasured himself through and beneath Jennifer's clothing, certain that the sight of her naked body was bound to be an real eye opener.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, maybe I'll even send Trask a picture while he's in jail,\" he grinned, becoming rather excited at the prospect as he imagined all the depraved things he could get up to in his borrowed form, as he turned the key in the ignition and pulled out of the prison car park. \"Hang onto your hat in there junior,\" he said, giving his pregnant belly one last little tap, \"cause you and mommy are in for one hell of a ride!\" before letting out a loud, lecherous chuckle, enjoying the wickedness in Jennifer's voice as he headed for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving as recklessly on the way there as he had on the way to the the prison, not wanting to waste any time, Carl was soon back at the Trask household, and almost as soon as he'd entered the front door he began to strip, kicking the flats from his feet and tossing his coat to the floor. One thing was on his mind now and one thing only, and that was satisfying the intense throbbing that was coming from within his panties, his pussy now being so wet that it was practically soaking through his leggings. \"Jesus Christ, I'm one horny fucking bitch!\" he grunted, as he made his way up the stairs, much slower than he would have liked due to his added girth, but managing to sate himself as much as he could in the meantime by tugging and pulling on Jennifer's now rock hard nipples, each one of them feeling like tiny erections on the end of his boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocating the master bedroom, Carl ceased his nipple tweaking and examined his surroundings, noting the large king sized bed that Trask and his hot wife obviously shared. \"So this is where the magic happens, huh?\" he scoffed, still thinking it a crime that she actually slept with that fat son of a bitch, as well as feeling somewhat jealous of how pristine and perfect everything seemed inside, a far cry from Carl's own grubby dwelling, and no doubt down to Jennifer being the houseproud sort (Trask somehow not looking the type). \"Well fuck me if Jenn here isn't some lovey-dovey, goodie-two-shoes,\" Carl said to himself, spotting various neatly stacked baby books on the nearby bedside table, along with a rather sickening picture of both her and her husband cuddling inside a heart shape frame, before turning to face the mirrored closet directly opposite, watching as a devious little smirk worked it's way across her lips, \"Well, let's see if we can't soon change that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one final last look at Jennifer's clothed, pregnant form, anxious to explore what lay beneath, Carl then in one quick motion hurriedly yanked her blouse up over his head (or at least tried to, getting it briefly snagged on the underside of his huge chest in the process). The resulting image was more than enough to turn his former cock as hard as a steel pole, Jennifer's now half exposed belly and bra covered tits looking pretty darn impressive; like two ripe melons balancing on top of a flesh colored beach ball. Her belly looked so amazingly bloated and hard, being almost a perfect sphere and pushing out so far from the rest of her slim, petite body, adorned by a cute little belly button that had forced it's way out. \"Fuck me, that's hot!\" Carl grinned to himself, running his hands over the firm, taut skin towards the waistband of his leggings, which he then pushed down, exposing even more of Jennifer's belly (which was admittedly still somewhat covered by a pair of stretchy white, maternity panties). Taking in the glorious sight and turning from one side to the other to catch sight of Jennifer's rather extreme profile, Carl really couldn't believe how much of a turn on this was, having never really given much thought to the eroticism of a pregnant woman's body and thinking now that it was about one of the most awesome sight's he'd ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, if I knew they looked this good, maybe I would have thought twice when Melissa was going on at me about having a baby,\" he chuckled, recalled his ex's nagging before she'd split. Still there was more to see and Carl wasn't gonna just stand there admiring Jennifer Trask's maternity underwear all day, he had two huge, milk filled tits and a (no doubt) severely under utilized pussy to both check out <i>and</i> to play with, and he was very much looking forward to having his fun...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he tossed the leggings to one side, he used his borrowed fingers to feel the material of the panties and rub her increasingly moist snatch through them. Outstretching Jennifer's legs one at a time, Carl approved of them. \"Nice pair of 'pins' too!\" he chuckled. <i>\"Oh if only Trasky boy could see what I'm doing to his cute little wifey!</i>\" he thought. He then stood up long enough to slip Jennifer's panties down his thighs, and he at once felt the cool air caressing his crotch. \"Hot damn!\" Carl gasped to himself as he looked again at his reflection in the closet mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up again and began massaging his genital area with both of his host's hands. Jennifer's vagina was literally 'glistening' as a result of Carl's arousal, and he was sent into ecstasy when he finally inserted two of his manicured fingers into her sex. \"Oooh...FUCK ME!!\" he exclaimed loudly...then moaning immediately afterwards. The exquisite feeling he got from fingering himself...combined with the kicking of the baby inside his womb...almost sent Carl over the edge in no time at all, but he managed to compose himself and reluctantly withdrew his fingers from his stolen pussy. \"Hmm...she tastes sweet!\" Carl then laughed, as he used Jennifer's own tongue to lick her fingers clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nectar!\"</i> Carl then thought, as he went back to studying his current, heavily-pregnant form in the mirror opposite. He massaged his swollen stomach again and then he removed Jennifer's bra and went back to 'teasing' her erect nipples, watching milk trickle out of them. By now he really needed satisfying...sexually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must have a toy around here somewhere!\" Carl mused, as he started searching the nearby drawers. A she bent over, his enormous, milk-engorged breasts dangled from his chest, slapping against each other as he moved. That only served to increased his arousal, and quicken his pace for a dildo...or anything he could use as a sex toy. \"Ah ha!\" I knew she'd have one of these,\" Carl said to himself, as he retrieved a big pink vibrator from the back of her underwear drawer. \"she can hardly expect that fat, limp-dicked fuck to keep her satisfied all the time now can she\" he grumbled, thinking of Trask again. Carl was amazed Trask had even been able to impregnate his wife. He studied the vibrator as he stood up straight and swept Jennifer's hair out of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me kiddo, momma needs pleasuring!\" Carl then 'giggled' in Jennifer's voice, as he laid back on the bed and patted his stomach.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn't get over the supple, spongy feel of Jennifer's breasts or the hot, tight clamp that was her cunt. the best part of his masturbation session was discovering that he could squeeze milk out of the tits relatively easily. He clamped both hands on one of his new melon-sized tits and bent it upwards until the thumb-sized chocolate-brown nipple was right next to his mouth, and squeezed, shooting a jet of milk all over Mrs. Trasks face. However, the self-gratification came to an end when Carl realized that he was hungry. Obviously, he was technically eating for two. \"Let's see if these dumb fuckers have any decent grub\" he muttered as he marched Jennifer Trask's naked body into the kitchen.Soon,he had found a chocolate cake with a birthday greeting spelled out in blue frosting. Not caring who the cake was intended for, Carl simply scooped a large chunk of it out with his hand and shoved it into his mouth. He had never cared much for table manners, and he took being in someone else's body as an invitation to be even more slovenly than usual. Besides, he really enjoyed making Jennifer eat like a pig. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n     He was just finished with his second huge mouthful of cake when he heard a knock on the door. Carl opened the door to find a sexy black woman in her twenties. The woman was Maggie, one of the Trasks' neighbors. She had a pair of G -cup boobs that jutted firmly out from her chest, a pair of hips and ass cheeks reminded Carl of all the black booty porn he had ever watched, short, straight white teeth, and a pair of plump, cock-sucking lips. From Jennifers' mind, Carl learned that Jennifer and Maggie were good friends, despite Jennifer disapproving of the provocative way in which Maggie dressed. Today's ensemble included a hot-pink crop top that exposed her toned midriff, and judging by the indentations her rather large nipples were leaving in the fabric, she had nothing underneath. Maggie also wore a pair of tight jeans that hung so low on  her hips that they barely managed to cover her snatch, and a pair of strappy high-heeled sandles that accentuated her large ass.  In short, Maggie was more than twice as hot as several hookers to whom Carl was a regular customer. Maggie was shocked to see Jennifer answer the door naked, with cum running down her legs, and cake and milk smeared all over her hands and face. Before she could say a word, Carl grabbed Maggie and yanked her into the house. \"What has gotten into you?\" Maggie shouted, almost hysterically. Rather than reply, Carl opted to send a clone into Maggie. As always, the presence of a Carl clone in a female body was indicated by the female in question grabbing her own tits and squeezing as hard as she could. Oh God boss, this little nigger is so fucking sensitive! yelled the clone as he ripped off Maggie's shirt and began twisting and yanking on her exposed nipples. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    Carl quickly closed the door so no one would see \"Maggie\" yanking down her jeans (revealing, in the process, that Maggie had forgone underwear that day) and jamming \"her\" fingers up \"her\" snatch. \"Hey boss, this nigger slut heard about what happened to Trask and wanted to see if Jennifer needed any help. Well, she certaintely is helping us!\" the clone informed him. Carl looked at the hot black bitch who was masturbating as furiously as Carl had been two minutes earlier, and decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl stopped and sighed, his bosom expanding mightily as he did so.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a day,\u201d he thought to himself, \u201cin the little Asian girl, then into her mama, then into Trask himself\u2026.I\u2019m tired.\u201d  Carl went over and sat down for a moment, a bit away from the crowd.  After a minute or two, a woman walked over to him.  This woman was a bit plump, probably in her early 50s, and she had some garden implements in her hands.  There was also some dirt smeared on some fairly ratty clothes.  It seemed that all the commotion had interrupted the woman\u2019s efforts to landscape her house.  Her body was actually fairly sloppy\u2014overweight and sloppy all around\u2014but that didn\u2019t really matter at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooohhhh dear are you all right?  This has to be tough for yo\u2026\u201dthe woman began.  Carl abruptly cut her off, \u201cDo you have a car?\u201d  The woman looked a bit surprised and confused.  \u201cWell\u2026uhm\u2026yes dear, I do.  You know that, honey.  It\u2019s the one right over there,\u201d she said as she pointed to a blue Ford Focus just a couple driveways away.  \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed,\u201d Carl quickly declared, grabbing the woman\u2019s arm and concentrating.  He suddenly found himself standing and looking down at a very confused Jennifer Trask.  He bent down to her, his flabby breasts sagging a bit in her direction as he did.  \u201cThank you dear,\u201d he said in the woman\u2019s voice, and he reached out and patted her pregnant belly, \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be using you again.\u201d  And with that, Carl turned around and walked the woman\u2019s body to her car.  He then drove himself to not too far from his apartment, where he turned the car off.  \u201cOh fuck I still hate this part,\u201d he said as he began to concentrate, feeling his old, cellulite-ridden body tense up and convulse as white smoke forced its way from the woman\u2019s mouth.  Carl drifted back toward his apartment, where he slept for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwaking early in the morning, Carl could think of only one thing to do:  fuck with Trask more.  He quickly went to a laptop (a stolen one) to google that name of just the person to use\u2026shall we say\u2026an old friend of Carl\u2019s.  He then exited his body, as he had so many times before, and set off.  He possessed a child on a local school bus and schemed away s he sat in silence while the other children dreaded the day\u2019s assignments.  Once the bus neared the address he wanted, Carl left the school child\u2019s body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ethereal form strolled leisurely in the bright morning.  \u201cGot one!\u201d he said to himself as he found a body be he could borrow for just a few minutes.  He walked up and jumped into the body of an unsuspecting mail man, a portly gentleman in his 40s.  Carl felt odd as the man\u2019s gut strained against the blue shirt of his uniform, but he couldn\u2019t take a great deal of time to get used to his vessel\u2026he had work to do.  Dropping the mail bag, Carl strolled up to the house he wanted and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, he heard someone fidgeting with the lock on the other side, and the door opened.  Carl smiled at the woman he now saw before him\u2014Tammy Henderson!!  She looked a bit\u2026well\u2026tired and depressed.  She didn\u2019t have her make-up on, and it looked like she\u2019d been lounging around the house in what she was wearing, but it was definitely her.  \u201cHi Al,\u201d she said as she smiled weakly.  Apparently that was the mail man\u2019s name.  \u201cHi Tammy,\u201d Carl replied as his plan came closer to fruition, \u201care you all right?\u201d  The disheveled woman lost her smile and choked up, beginning to cry.  \u201cOh god, Al, my husband took the kids for the day.  He said he might leave me because of what happened!  I told the police everything I remembered\u2014the strange woman\u2026.she touched my belly\u2026\u2026and\u2026\u2026and\u2026.and then I don\u2019t remember anything after that \u2018till I woke up at the hospital, and the people told me I wrecked my car, but I don\u2019t remember it!\u201d Tammy sobbed, her tears really flowing now.  \u201cOhhh, honey,\u201d you said soothingly, \u201ccan I come in?\u201d Tammy calmed her tears for a minute and composed herself, \u201cSure,\u201d she said as she stepped aside and Carl, inside Al the mailman, entered Tammy\u2019s house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t remember anything but those little bits and pieces about yesterday huh?\u201d Carl inquired.  \u201cNo\u2026.no I just remember being at school\u2026..then in some house with a strange woman who hit me.  Then nothing again until I woke up later and this woman touched my belly\u2026.then nothing again until I woke up in the hospital.    \u2026.my husband says he might leave me,\u201d she sobbed, \u201che say I\u2019m crazy\u2026Al, am I crazy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Carl replied, \u201cyou\u2019re not crazy\u2026.and um\u2026.sorry about the inconvenience,\u201d Carl said.  \u201cWhat?\u201d Tammy asked, confused, \u201cwhat inconvenience?\u201d  \u201cWell, about my using your body yesterday, possessing you,\u201d Carl said as his face contorted into a twisted grin.  Tammy\u2019s face turned pure white and she started to back away, \u201cIt was yo\u2026..what\u2026.how did you?\u201d  \u201cNo time for questions now, but I need you again, so just stay still for a minute,\u201d Carl instructed the hysterical housewife.  \u201cOh\u2026.oh my God please\u2026..no\u2026\u2026..don\u2019t!\u201d Carl reached the man\u2019s hand out and rested it firmly on Tammy\u2019s breast, concentrating.  Just that quickly, Tammy\u2019s screaming stopped, and Carl\u2019s vision blurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\t To the police station!<br>\r\n2)\tTo Trask\u2019s house to await his release.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl regained his senses and saw a very confused mailman in front of him.  He glanced down at the ample breasts of Tammy Henderson, again taking just a moment to acclimate himself to the body that had proven so useful to him.  \u201cWell, thanks for stopping by, Al,\u201d Carl said as he ushered the man toward Tammy\u2019s door.  \u201cOhhh\u2026umm\u2026..no problem\u2026.no problem at all, Tammy,\u201d Al said in a confused tone.  Al left the house, and Carl watched through the door as Al stood outside for a moment, looking oddly around to try to figure out what the hell had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl turned around and grinned to himself as he bounded up the stairs, Tammy\u2019s breasts bouncing around with each step.  He ran into her closet and pulled out a red skirt and woman\u2019s suit jacket.  He tore Tammy\u2019s unwashed clothes from her body and cleaned her up a little bit.  He put lipstick on carefully, brushed her teeth, and fluffed her hair up a bit.  Carl then put on the red skirt, zipping it up and stretching the fabric tightly around his ample hips and ass.  He put on the suit\u2019s top, leaving just a couple buttons undone at the top so Tammy\u2019s cleavage spilled out just a bit.  He reached up with her manicured hands and cupped her breasts before heading for the door.  On the way, he stopped at a mirror, looking his beautiful body up and down.  \u201cOh, Tammy baby, I wouldn\u2019t possess you so much if you weren\u2019t so damn perfect!\u201d he said as he smiled at his vessel in the mirror and gave his backside a good slap.  He bounded out and jumped into Tammy\u2019s car, heading quickly for the jail, where Trask would be held.  He walked into the station and demanded to see Trask, claiming to be his sister.  He stood in a waiting room for a few minutes and tried not to be too weirded out by the cops oogling his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a cop came in to get him and took him into a large room.  Walking into the meeting room Trask had seen so many times was a bit odd.  It was a big place, one big room with plenty of cops around, and a large number of detainees all wearing orange suits and cuffs.  \u201cRight this way mam,\u201d the officer said as he pointed to a chair, across from which was another chair.  There was enough space between the chairs to allow for some level of privacy as parties talked.  \u201cThanks officer,\u201d Carl said as he sat down to wait for Trask.  Within a few minutes, Trask entered.  He was being guided through the people milling about.  He looked quite run-down; he was wearing the same suit he had been wearing when Carl possessed him\u2026he hadn\u2019t shaved at all and was seemingly trying to avoid the brightness of the lights, probably a bit hung over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze fell upon Carl, tucked away inside Tammy Henderson\u2019s body, and his eyes suddenly focused like lasers, flashing with rage.  \u201cYOU\u201d he silently mouthed, his head about ready to explode.  Carl smiled broadly and waved at Trask.  \u201cYou got ten minutes; no funny stuff,\u201d declared a big, burley officer as he sat Trask down in the chair across from Carl.  \u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019 buddy?\u201d Carl asked, then he lowered his voice a bit, \u201cI\u2019m glad you recognize me, figured I had to wear a body you\u2019d remember\u2026.Tammy here\u2019s had a rough personal patch, and I thought she should get out of the house, so here she is,\u201d Carl said smiling and motioning to his borrowed form.  \u201cCut the shit!\u201d Trask said quickly, \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d  Carl looked back at Nick in mock surprise, \u201cooooohhh now Nicky, is that any way to greet your sister?\u201d he asked.  \u201cI know you were in me,\u201d Trask declared flatly, \u201cIf your plan was to strand me in here, you fucked up.  I just posted bail, and I\u2019m gonna be out in a few hours, as soon as they process the paperwork.\u201d  Carl smiled and shook his host\u2019s head in disappointment, \u201cNicky Nicky Nicky, such a simple boy.  You\u2019re behind the curve; sticking you in here was just a part of the plan, not the goal,\u201d Carl said.  Trask cocked his head in confusion.  \u201cRemember all that shit you were talkin\u2019 before about having cops storm my apartment?\u201d Carl asked, leaning in close, \u201cthink that\u2019ll happen now?  You might have been able to make it happen before, but not now.  Now you\u2019re just the cop who gets wasted and gropes fellow officers AFTER being seen publically making out with Eileen Yang.  For what it\u2019s worth, her body was amazing; I was amazed you didn\u2019t drop to the ground and do me right there in the yard.\u201d  Trask got a surprised look on his face. \u201cYes I was inside her you dumbass,\u201d Carl declared, \u201cyou think a fox like that would be interested in a fat slob like you\u2026if you had just fucked me right there I wouldn\u2019t have had to possess you\u2026.but nope\u2026.you had to be noble,\u201d Carl told Nick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Carl seemed to brighten up, a large smile spreading across Tammy\u2019s face, \u201cHey you\u2019ll never guess who I bumped into\u2014Jennifer!  Granted I was only inside her for a few seconds, but she\u2019s got a hell of a body man; you did a hell of a job bedding her!\u201d  Rage flashed in Trask\u2019s eyes, and he clenched his fists and teeth, \u201cI swear to God you fucker, if you ever hurt my wife..\u201d  Carl cut in, \u201cyou\u2019ll do what?! Huh?  I got no real problem with your wife\u2026in fact it\u2019d be a damn crime to do anything to harm that wonderful body of hers, but I could hur\u2026.I could BE your wife, and you\u2019d have no clue!!!\u201d<br>\r\n1)\t Hang around the station.<br>\r\n2)\tWait for Trask at home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To find those relatives and/or friends of course he would need access to police records, which...granted wouldn't be difficult for him with his new 'unique' ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again...there was an Internet Cafe just a couple of blocks from where he lived, he should be able to find out about some of the fat pig's relatives on ANY computer.

He opened the door to Tammy\u2019s fancy SUV again and got in, fastening the seat belt and noting the strange constricting feeling it caused across his fleshy chest.  \"Time to step into the 21st Century,\" Carl said as he looked at his borrowed body\u2019s reflection with a smile, put the car in gear, and headed for the internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 a few minutes away.  He arrived in short order and parked the car.  The luxurious BMW looked a bit odd among all the beat-up Honda Civics and Ford Escorts of the place's usual clientele.  Carl got out of the parked car and walked up to the door of the establishment, Tammy\u2019s heels clicking on the blacktop and her breasts jiggling about with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl pulled the door open and stepped in, and he was greeted with some somewhat bemused looks as he did so.  Looking around, he noted the most of the other patrons were young people - - in their early 30s at the oldest - - who had scraggly hair and beat-up clothes depicting whatever band the young people of the day happened to be into.  They sat around their computer terminals playing World of Warcraft, engrossed in the conversations they were having on their headsets.  Needless to say, a 40-something motherly, cougar woman in a sexy business suit and make-up looked a bit out of place.  Carl made his way to an empty computer and sat his gorgeous, borrowed ass down in the chair.  \"Ooookaaay...\" he pondered to himself, \"where to begin?\" Carl mused to himself as he logged on to the internet and began to type away.  Then an idea came to him.  \"You know...I bet I could make this easy,\" he said with a smile as he simply got onto Facebook, everybody\u2019s favorite social network site.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a woman who appeared to work there walked by.  \"Hey,\" Carl called out, grabbing her lightly by the arm.  This got her attention, and she turned to look at the out-of-place Tammy, asking, \"Can I help you...ah....ma'am?\u201d \"\u201cYeah,\" Carl said, \u201ccan you be a doll and bring me a big 'ol thing of curly fries with hot cheese dip and a large Pepsi?\" \"Sure,\" she said, writing down the order, \"it\u2019ll be right out,\" and off she went.  Carl went back to the task at hand.  He typed in Trask\u2019s full name and gained quick access to his facebook profile.  \"The bloated tub of lard's even got his police academy picture on his profile,\" Carl mused as he sifted through all the pictures Trask had uploaded.  Trask was there a lot...so was the wife...and a few friends that were fixtures at cook-outs and other get-togethers that pop up on occasion.  On the left side of the page, below a smattering of Trask\u2019s facebook friends were a list of people related to him in some way.  \"Damn he's got a BIG family,\" Carl said to himself.  \"Here ya go,\" said the waitress as she sat a steaming bunch of greasy fries and melted cheese on the table next to Carl, along with the large drink.  \"Thanks hon,\" Carl said, shoving a bit of the greasy food into his mouth as he clicked the first of Trask\u2019s family members.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lucky first relative was Mina Torres, the adopted daughter of Trask's oldest sister, Carla.  Mina was, according to her profile, a proud member of the United States Army, and was rather excited to begin her career as an army medic at a base just outside of town.  She was 22, having been born in February of 1989, and she had just finished up a two-year degree at a local college that allowed her to be a registered nurse.  She was about 5 foot 6 with a WONDERFULLY curvy figure, as well as a kind face and a great big smile that could probably light up the whole military base.  As Carl scrolled down and looked through her recent status updates, he noticed that a lot of them talked about what a tough life she\u2019d had as an adopted kid, but she was happy to be done with basic training and eager to begin her career as a nurse for the US Army.  A couple of them also mentioned her volunteering at the hospital on the weekends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mina here looks like somebody I could use,\" Carl said as he shoved greasy, cheesy fries into Tammy\u2019s mouth.  He chuckled a bit as he patted Tammy's belly, \"Tammy, honey, I hope you\u2019re not on a diet.\"  Scrolling down the page some more, Carl noticed some other bodies that might be useful.  There was Father William, a 60-year-old local priest who had baptized Trask when he was a little boy.  Then there was Kevin Chambers, who, it seemed, had been Trask's best man at his wedding.  He was a computer programmer now.  There were really too many to keep track of, but each of them was a possible vessel that Carl could jump into and use to his advantage.  Carl shoved the last of the resoundingly unhealthy food into his mouth and left $40 on the table...it wasn\u2019t really HIS money anyway, after all.  Wiping the food grease on Tammy\u2019s blouse and belching loudly on the way out, Carl headed to the car.  The food had made him just a bit queasy, but he slowly got into the BMW, started the car up, and headed off toward the person he'd pick to fuck with next, ultimately just to get to Trask more.  That person was\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tMina, the smiling, curvy army medic eager to get her life off to a productive start.<br>\r\n2)\tSomeone else.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was one other very good possibility for Carl. Trask had a younger sister, a 20-year-old girl named Naomi, who attended the local college living in the dorms. As he pulled into the parking lot he smiled to himself. As he walked into the entrance of the dorms he wasn't quite sure how to find which room was Naomi's. He looked at the people milling about until he spotted a pretty young black woman entering the building. Without a second thought he made his way over to her. \"Excuse me, young lady, could you help me with something?\" he asked walking over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman stop and looked at her, smiling. \"Oh, um it depends on what it is but I guess I can try.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Carl smiled, \"My name is Tammy Henderson and I was just wondering if you could point me in the direction of Naomi's dorm room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman eyed him suspiciously. \"Uh, any reason you need to talk to her?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forgive me. Yes I'm here to help her go over some financial stuff for the school and make sure she's not paying too much on her loans.\" Carl exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped this woman would buy it but it soon became obvious that she wasn't. He was thinking that he'd need another way to get to Naomi when suddenly the opportunity fell right into his lap. \"Look ma'am, I'm Naomi's roommate so I can go fetch her but--\" she was cut off by Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Naomi's roommate?\" he asked, \"Well then you've just made my job a whole lot easier.\" With that Carl reached out and grabbed the woman by the arm. She started to fight for a second but quickly gasped as her eyes rolled back in her head. A few seconds later they went back to normal and a wicked smile appeared on her lips. \"Thanks for the ride, Tammy, but I figured it was better to upgrade to the newer, fancier model.\" Carl said in the silky voice of Charlene Robbins. He then left the dazed and confused Tammy standing there as he walked through the building before eventually finding the room that Charlene and Naomi shared. It would be about 45 minutes before Naomi returned from her current class so Carl made the best of it, taking a shower and getting very, VERY intimate with Charlene's body. As he walked out of the bathroom clad only in a bathrobe, he ran into Naomi just as she entered. \"How'd class go?\" Carl asked doing his best impersonation of Charlene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, boring as usual.\" Naomi stated as she flopped down on the couch. \"Lee's such a gasbag. The history stuff he talks about IS interesting but he just makes it unbearable. Way too dry.\" She then reached into her purse and after pulling some things out lit a cigarette, \"And I've still got that Psych paper due at the end of next week that I haven't started on. God, Ramos is all over my ass too about my grade in his class so I can't really afford to fuck it up and not do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi Trask was definitely different from some of the other Trask family members. She was on the slender side with small breasts, small hips and a small ass. Her dark brown hair was worn quite short in a pixie style. Combined with her black-framed glasses, multiple ear piercings (and one on her nose), olive green tanktop and jeans she definitely gave off a far more artsy or hipster or indie girl vibe. Carl preferred his women on the curvier side but there was no denying this girl was smoking hot (almost literally) and her relation to that fuckhead only increased her attractiveness to him. He was suddenly struck by being unsure what to do. He could possess her right here, right now and take her body for his own. As her he could taunt Trask, generally ruin her reputation around campus... perhaps go and pay a little visit to the Yangs, that could be fun! But Charlene was also quite hot and he was a bit reluctant to give up her body right now, not without having a little bit of fun first. Maybe he should try and have a little fun with Naomi before making her his new home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, for now, I\u2019m you,\u201d Carl said matter-of-factly, confusing the woman.  Carl quickly reached his manicured hand down and set it firmly on the woman\u2019s chest, concentrating.  The world blurred for a moment, and Carl quickly found himself looking up at a very confused Mrs. Henderson.  \u201cWha\u2026.?  How did I get here?,\u201d she asked in a very confused voice.  Without a word, Carl grabbed the rolling pin and drilled Mrs. Henderson in the gut with it.  She immediately doubled over in immense pain, groaning and grunting.  This gave the now-smaller Carl a much better shot at another body part, so he gave her another whack on the back of her head.  This knocked Mrs. Henderson out cold; she dropped like led in a heap to the floor.  \u201cI always thought I\u2019d never hit a woman,\u201d Carl marveled as he stood over the unconscious body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let the rolling pin drop to the floor, bent down on his knees and, struggling, rolled Mrs. Henderson over on her back, pushing at the mildly flabby midsection of the woman.  He then grabbed her by the hands and began to drag her.  Carl exerted himself quite a bit to do this, grunting and straining his smaller muscles.  His own somewhat droopy boobs jostled about with every labored step, as he pulled the dead-weight body of Mrs. Henderson into a side room, seeming to be a study.  This done, he let her arms drop to the floor with a thud, wiped his sweaty brow, and closed the door to the room.  \u201cDamn,\u201d Carl said, panting, \u201cBev you better start lifting some weights,\u201d he said as he walked into the living room and sat down on the couch.  He turned on the TV and spent some time watching the Ultimate Fighting Championship, cursing at the TV when his favorite fighter kept losing.  He examined his body a bit\u2026.poking his boobs a little and feeling the flab in his midsection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard the door open, then close loudly.  Carl quickly stood up and composed himself, \u201cMy baby boy\u2019s home!\u201d he said as he straightened his blouse and ran to meet Nick, his tits shaking the whole way.  He turned a corner and saw a weary-looking Trask in the entrance to the home.  Upon seeing Beverly, Trask smiled warmly, \u201cHi mom,\u201d he said pleasantly as Carl ran up to him and attempted to wrap his small arms around Nick\u2019s bulging midsection.  Trask bent down and gave his mom and warm kiss on the cheek.  \u201cHow was your day, dear?\u201d she asked.  \u201cIt was ah\u2026ah\u2026\u201d he hesitated, \u201cinteresting.\u201d  \u201cWell I\u2019ve got dinner ready, and Jennifer should be home soon,\u201d Carl played the part.  \u201cGreat mom; I\u2019ve just got to take my coat off,\u201d he sayd as he walks down the hallway.  Carl walked in and sat down at the kitchen table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard Nick scream\u2014\u201cAaaahhh!\u201d  Nick made a great deal of noise as his girth thundered through the house, and he saw his mother sitting calmly at the kitchen table.  He was frantic, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman in the office\u2026she\u2019s\u2026.she\u2019s mom\u2026\u201d  Carl cut him off, \u201cNot quite mom sonny,\u201d and smiled devilishly.  Trask\u2019s expression twisted into one of shock and rage, \u201cYou!\u201d he screamed.  Carl chuckled and stood up slowly, \u201cYou remember her from the school don\u2019t you?  I\u2019m flattered you recognize me; I\u2019ve aged just a little bit since we last met,\u201d he said running his hands over his belly and jiggling his tits.  \u201cWhat the fuck did you do to my mother?!\u201d Trask screamed.  \u201cOh she\u2019s in here with me,\u201d Carl told him, \u201cjust like the lady cop was, and the kindly old teacher was, and like Mrs. Henderson in there was when I borrowed her this afternoon.  Mommy\u2019s in a sort of coma, also like the rest,\u201d Carl said.  \u201cAnd I must say Nick, your mom\u2019s got a fine body, given her age,\u201d he said fondling his chest.  \u201cI\u2019ll bet she was a real MILF eh?\u201d  \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d Trask pleaded.  \u201cTo make a point,\u201d his possessed mother answered, \u201cthat I can get to you anywhere any time.  Maybe I\u2019ll even have mamma here commit a felony or two\u2026that\u2019d create some buzz around the office,\u201d Carl pondered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were interrupted by someone else\u2019s walking in.  Carl looked over to see Jennifer, with her swollen belly pressing mightily against a thin red dress, one with a collar cut so low that her heaving boobs were nearly falling out.  \u201cHi Beverly!\u201d she greeted Carl warmly.  She glanced up at Nick, who was trying to soften his features and play it cool.  \u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d  Carl cut in, \u201cOh, nothing too huge\u2026just talking about baby-related stuff\u2026.you know\u2026.how to burp, how to change, that kind of stuff.\u201d  \u201cThe little guy\u2019s getting so much attention already,\u201d Jennifer chuckled, looking down at her belly.  Carl moved Beverly toward the doorway, \u201cI\u2019ve really got to go and check on the nice financial planner lady\u2026see if she\u2019s all right with the paperwork.\u201d  Jennifer gave Nick a confused look.  \u201cYou remember Nicky\u2026the nice lady here about the baby\u2019s college fund?\u201d Carl prompted him.  \u201cOh\u2026.ahhh, yeah\u2026her,\u201d Nick covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick\u2019s wife kept him trapped in the kitchen discussing such matters, Beverly\u2019s possessed body strolled up and opened the closed door to the room in which Mrs. Henderson\u2019s unconscious body was held.  Carl bent down slowly, feeling his aging knees pop as he did.  \u201cHey lady,\u201d he said, patting the unconscious woman\u2019s belly to try to rouse her, \u201cHey, wake up!\u201d  The woman slowly stirred, opening her eyes slowly and feeling the pain and a lump on the back of her head, \u201cWha\u2026\u201d she began.  Her vision focused more, and she lifted a finger accusingly at Beverly, who quickly grabbed her by the arm and pulled her up.  \u201cYou took quite a spill there, my dear,\u201d Carl said.  Mrs. Henderson stood fully up and thought for a moment.  She pointed again at Beverly, \u201cYou hit m..\u201d Carl cut her off, \u201cWell dammit I only get one fucking meat suit at a time; sorry if you felt left out.  Anyway, you\u2019ve just become useful again.\u201d Carl laid his hand firmly on the belly of the woman, as her face changed to one of confusion and horror, having no idea what the hell was going on, but being pretty sure that she\u2019d awaken in some foreign place having done god knows what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl concentrated, and his vision blurred.  He found himself higher up, looking down at Beverly Trask, who, confused as hell, removed her hand from Mrs. Henderson\u2019s stomach.  Carl fought back the pain in his head (caused by the rolling pin), and shook the confused mother\u2019s hand tightly.  \u201cWell thank you very much Mrs. Trask; you\u2019ve been very helpful.  I think I have all the info I need for the little guy\u2019s college, and I\u2019ll call you if I don\u2019t.\u201d  \u201cAh\u2026.certainly\u2026.certainly yes miss, you do that,\u201d Trask said, trying to make sense of what the hell just happened.  The two women walked to the kitchen, where Jennifer and Nick were conversing.  Beverly looked surprised to see her son.  \u201cWhen did you get home, Nicky?\u201d she asked him.  Trasked frowned and tilted his head at his mom.  It was then that Carl, in Mrs. Henderson\u2019s body, gave Nick a little wave to tell him who he was possessing.  \u201cWell it\u2019s been great meeting you all,\u201d Carl said.  He looked at Jennifer Trask, saying, \u201cand don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll have your son going to Harvard in no time.\u201d  Jennifer thanked the possessed woman.  Carl continued, \u201cWell you take good care of that baby now,\u201d then Carl looked squarely at Nick Trask, the smile dropping off Mrs. Henderson\u2019s face, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to come back soon and see the little man myself.  I may just pop by and surprise you all.\u201d  The expectant father looked horrified.  \u201cBye till then,\u201d Carl said, and he turned and walked sexily toward the home\u2019s front door, opened it, and walked out into the late afternoon sun.         <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After reaching the car, Carl turned back and looked at Trask's house...just in time to see him peeking through the kitchen window. Carl grinned and did another little wave, before getting into the car and driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later however he had to slow down when his vision began to blur, and all of a sudden he lost control of the car...smashing into another parked vehicle and then driving into a small wall, which was knocked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck, this isn't good, well...not good for Tammy here\" Carl mumbled to himself, as he closed his eyes and slumped on the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Carl felt a hand tap him on the shoulder, and he looked up to see a young man (about 21 years old) leaning into the car. \"Lady...are you alright?\" the nerdy looking kid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great kid, but I need to borrow you for a while\" Carl groaned in Mrs Henderson's voice, as he quickly put on her hands on the man's chest. The usual 'shifting' sensation and blurred vision followed, and suddenly Carl was the one looking into the car at Tammy, who was now unconscious. \"Huh, might want to call an ambulance, she don't look too good\" Carl told a couple of women who were also approaching the accident site. He then walked off down the street in his latest victim's body, searching through his coat pockets for anything valuable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping off at a store, Carl bought himself a pack of cigarettes, and he lit one up before he was even back out of the store. \"Oh yeah, I needed this\" he nodded, looking at the smouldering nicotine stick between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Carl watched other people walking around him, men and women, adults and kids, and a feeling of power rushed through him. He could be any one of them if he wanted, and nobody would know anything. Chuckling away to himself, Carl then headed back towards his apartment, still wearing the body he had 'hijacked'. Once he had finished his second cigarette, he ducked into an alley and concentrated. \"Thanks for the lift kid!\" he grumbled, looking down at his current body. A swirl of white smoke then exited the young man's throat and rocketed skywards as Carl exited his body and went back to his own in his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, I still hate that part\" Carl groaned, as he got to his feet. His body was a little dehydrated and very hungry, and so he proceeded to make himself something quick to eat before getting some rest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Gotta find that asshole...\" Carl muttered to himself as he walked through the entrance area of the station. He saw a pudgy, older cop walk by and quickly reached out and touched his arm transferring himself into the older man. \"God, way worse than that cop chick,\" he grumbled, \"but I'll find something better quick.\" Carl continued searching throughout the police station but again, no sign of Tras. None at all. It was as if he had practically disappeared. Still not willing to give up his search, however, Carl came across a female cop, looked to be in about her mid-30s with her brown hair tied in a ponytail, come walking towards him carrying a small stack of papers. \"Whoa, hold on Donna,\" he said using the memories of his current body, \"where you off to in such a rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta give that other class that came in today some papers. It's for an assignment their teacher wants them to do tonight and guess who gets to play gofer for the day?\" Donna sighed. \"I swear, it's like brass is double booking these field trips to screw with his and I'M always the one who gets run ragged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother class huh? Maybe Trask had to go talk to them. \"Hey, don't worry Donna. Just take it easy, huh?\" he said while patting her on the back, transferring himself into Donna Burton's body. \"Thanks Kowalski, I'll try.\" he replied to his old host. This Donna chick was a nice little piece but Carl had more pressing matters as he walked to the conference room where the class was stationed. As he got there he saw a cute little auburn-haired girl waiting outside; one of the students problem. And so as he walked up to hand her the papers to give to the students he brushed her hand and transferred into her. He was now Cindy Thompson, 11-years-old and in the 5th grade at the local elementary school. Trask wasn't here, Carl's new eyes told him, but Cindy's brain DID tell him that they were going to have a follow-up lecture by a guest speaker tomorrow and so Carl decided to stay in her body, at least until tomorrow, to see what turned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home that evening Carl entertained himself on the laptop going to a few of his favorite porn sites. Not that Carl DID anything since this girl was only just starting puberty and besides even if Carl was a sick fuck, a fact he reveled in, even HE had his limits and doing shit like that to the body of a girl that didn't even have her tits was at the top of the list. Didn't stop him from looking around and finding a pack of smokes that belonged to Caroline Patterson, Cindy's currently divorced mother, and light up. It would've been a sight really, this cute girl taking puffs of a cigarette and shouting things like \"fuck yes\" as some blonde slut took a shot of cum right to the face. After finishing up watching a video, Carl closed the laptop just as the front door opened and Cindy's mother walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n42-years-old and had a nice management position at a financial firm here in town. Much like Carl, Caroline's husband had been a deadbeat and as she began climbing the ranks she divorced him gaining sole custody of Cindy. She had her auburn hair cropped short and looked great in her nice, dark pantsuit. She gave off the impression of one sexy businesswoman. \"Goddamn, what a fuckin' knockout.\" Carl muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say, honey?\" Caroline asked as she set her things down. As she looked over at who she thought was her daughter she gasped, \"Cindy Elaine Thompson, what on God's green earth do you think you're doing?!\" she exclaimed as she came over to take the cigarette out of Carl's mouth. \"This is the second time this month I've caught you trying to sneak one of my cigarettes. When you're 18 smoke all you want but until then you will not even LOOK at a pack of cigarettes under my roof do you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. Sorry mom.\" Carl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... I've heard that before.\" Caroline muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl watched, admiring the woman as she walked into the kitchen. She was definitely a sight and being this girl did have its drawbacks. He'd have to switch back in the morning but being Caroline for the night might be nice. She might even make a nice little permanent home, or at least a vacation spot, so why not rent her for a bit?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl carefully considered the possibility of taking over his current bodies' mother, Caroline. Especially that watching all that porn had got him all worked up without possibility of release in his current body. Suddenly he had a wicked idea. A very wicked idea. He hesitated for a few minutes on carrying out this heinous act, but finally decided that he would go though with it anyway. When Caroline turned her back to him, he projected a clone into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline went limp for a few seconds then turned around to her daughter. \"You know what? I take back what I said earlier, you can smoke all you want\" giving Carl a wicked grin. Carl's clone then grabbed his large breasts and gave them a firm squeeze. \"Mommy is stacked, don't ya think?\" the clone said while he groped his chest. \"So, <i>darling</i>, did you get all worked up earlier?\" Carl's clone said as he gave Carl a dirty look not appropriate for a mother to give her 11 year old daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes mom! I've been watching porn all afternoon like a good little girl\" Carl replied with a laugh. Carl's clone laughed, \"I know, I'm you remember? Anyway, now I'm horny, and I've got a body that can give some gratification\" the clone said with a smile while rubbing his crotch through Caroline's pantsuit. \"How 'bout we go upstairs and you watch some real live porn, if you know what I mean?\" the clone said still working his full figured mature body. \"You can even help mommy get off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I was thinking the same thing, <i>mom</i>\" Carl said with a grin that has no place on the face of an 11 year old girl. With that both mother and daughter made their way to the main bedroom, Carl's clone leading the way. Once there, Carl's clone began to disrobe immediately, starting with the pantsuit then the blouse. Once he was in only bra and panties, Carl came up next to him so that they were both looking in the mirror. \"God I'm a sick fuck\" Carl said as he reached up and started massaging his 'mother's' crotch. \"That's my baby girl!\" Carl's clone said with laugh. \"C'mon, let's get on the bed. Mommy is really horny and needs to get off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Carl's clone sat on the bed and while one hand fondled a massive breast, the other went into his panties to start massaging his pulsing pussy. Carl took the initiative to jump on the bed behind him to release the bra. He struggled a bit, still not used to his smaller, weaker hands, but finally got it, releasing the large breasts contained within. \"Wow! She is stacked!\" the clone said as he removed his hand from his panties to pay more attention to the now free breasts with large erect nipples. \"Hey, quit hogging them! Let me see\" Carl yelled from behind. \"Fine, fine. Don't get your panties in a bunch\" the clone said as he turned around and laid back against the wall to give Carl full access. Carl didn't waste any time and dived in, each breast so large he needed both of his small hands just to get a proper feel. He then looked up into his 'mother's\" eyes and grinned wickedly before taking a large nipple in his mouth to suck on. \"Oh yea\" the clone groaned, \"that feels sooo good\". After a few minutes of sucking each breast the clone then pushed Carl off. \"I'm worked up enough already, my pussy feels drenched\". With that he hooked his thumbs under his panties and yanked them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just watched in awe as his body's 42 year old mother spread her legs in front of him and started rubbing her pussy. \"Oh god, it's not gonna take me much to cum\" the clone moaned as he worked his wet gleaming pussy. Then he inserted one finger, paused, then a second and started driving them in and out in abandon. \"Wow <i>mom</i>, this is so much better than watching porn\" Carl said with a grin. The clone just moaned as he reached orgasm. \"Wow, momma's pussy is really sensitive\" the clone finally said after getting his breath back. \"Well, what are you waiting for?\" the clone grinned. \"Mommy is still horny. Get up here and help me\". Carl needed no encouragement. He scouted forward and started rubbing his 11 year girly hands along his 'mother's' labia. He then pushed 2 tiny fingers in with ease, getting a little moan from his clone. Seeing the reaction he push a third and forth finger in as well. Finally, he had his whole 11 year old fist buried to the wrist inside his clone's pussy. \"Oh god that's what mommy needs!\" the clone groaned. \"Fuck mommy! Fuck me harder\" he yelled as Carl picked up the pace. Finally he came hard, and Carl could feel his 'mother's' pussy clamping down on his small hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the orgasm died down, Carl pulled his hand out and stared and the glistening juices that covered it. Without hesitation he stuck a small finger in his mouth to lap up the sweet nectar. \"Hmmm, you taste delicious <i>mom</i>\" he said as he looked at his clone still basking in the after glow. \"The only prob is that it got me even more worked up\" Carl said rather angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his clone seemed to wake up from his orgasm induced stupor, \"Well, why don't you...\"</span></div></div>",

He then disrobed Cindy's 11-year old body for the most part and looked down at himself. \"Alright...here goes!\" Carl shrugged, looking first at the dripping, mature pussy between his clone's legs and then at his own vagina. He felt a tingling sensation and he watched as his pre-teen snatch began morphing into a very adult one. As it did so...Cindy's body reacted and Carl moaned and writhed as he suddenly became aroused. \"Fuck yeah, now that's what I'm talking about!\" he chuckled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks good on you!\" his clone winked from Caroline's prostrate body, as he viewed Carl's moist new pussy. \"Now why don't you come over here so 'mommy' can show you just how good it feels being a chick!\" the possessed Caroline added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan!\" Carl smirked rather wickedly from inside his host as he clambered back onto the bed. No sooner had he done so...his clone started using Caroline's manicured fingers to 'probe' inside Carl's new twat, and Carl groaned as he did so.  \"An 11-year old girl should just not be making sounds like this\" Carl then suddenly started laughing, eliciting an equally loud 'giggle' from his clone's host body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes ticked by and Cindy's little toes tensed up as Carl approached what was to be an unbelievable orgasm in her young body. \"Caroline' just grinned as she watched her 'daughter' getting off...thanks to 'her' expert fingering. \"Hmm...FUCK!\" Carl then exclaimed loudly...as he descended from his high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone for his part withdrew Caroline's fingers from what was a duplicate of her own vagina...and he licked them clean. \"Hmm...baby girl tastes just like her mommy, I wonder why?\" Carl's duplicate chuckled as he savored every drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its a fucking mystery ain't it?\" an out of breath Carl grinned, as he got his breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to go a step further?\" the clone suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" Carl replied, tilting Cindy's head to one side as he supported himself on her elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I could use a good old-fashioned fuck!\" the clone winked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He groaned a little, gradually working his small fingers in and out of his wet pussy. \"Damn, I can't seem to get the right angle to get my hand in like I did with you\" Carl said in frustration. Turning over to look at himself in the wardrobe mirror, he then used his small body's natural young flexibility to get a little more leverage and finally managed to get his whole hand where he wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaamn that feels goood!\" Carl whimpered as he looked at the perverse reflection of an 11 year old girl with a 42 year old pussy fisting herself licking her lips. Carl's clone laid back in the bed watching the dirty act, with one hand absently stroking his erect nipples while the other gently rubbed his still engorged clit. \"Well ok, I guess it's only fair if mommy's baby girl gets to come as much as me\" he said with a moan. \"Although you don't get the added advantage of these magnificent tits!\" he laughed, \"Mommy's nipples are <i>really </i>sensitive\" he said as he pinched both of them firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're right!\" Carl said in between moans.\"Well I guess I'll have to even the playing field then\" he said to his clone with a smirk. He slowly pulled his glistening hand out of his snatch and sat back up, took a quick glance at the luscious orbs decorating his 'mother's' chest and then concentrated while looking in the mirror. First, his nipples started to stick out and get larger, followed by his chest slowly inflating as if someone were pumping air into it. \"Oh god this feels weird\" Carl said staring at his innocent looking face in the mirror. Finally his chest stopped growing, and now his 11 year old body had some large mature tits to match his pussy. \"Wow these might be a bit big for this small frame\" he chuckled, \"but damn if it isn't a turn on\" he said as he looked in the mirror to the young girl with breasts down to her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he started fondling his large pendulous breasts, paying special attention to the nipples that were becoming more erect by the second. \"You're right, these are sooo sensitive\" he moaned in his little girly voice. His clone just grinned at him. \"Wait till you get them sucked, it's even better\" his clone said with a smile. Not waiting for his 'mother' to come to him, he lifted one large breast so that the nipple was right in front of his face before going to town on it. His other hand went back down to his drenched pussy and he shoved it in as far as it would go. Carl's clone watched his 'daughter' shoving his tiny fist in and out frantically while his moans were muffled by the large breast as he suckled on his erect nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the amount of stimulation and the perverse image in front of him, it didn't take Carl very long to come to an earth shattering orgasm that made his tiny body nearly have convulsions. \"Oh god! Fuck yea that's awesome! Carl screamed as he reached climax. Carl's clone meanwhile had gotten all worked up looking at the perverse masturbation session happening inches away from him. This was also not helped by the fact that he had not stopped toying with his engorged nipples or wet slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl finally came down from his orgasm he released his large breasts and brought his tiny hand covered in juices up to his mouth and began to lap up the sweet nectar. He finally noticed his clone still touching himself and turned to admire the scene. \"Well <i> mom</i>, you mentioned a good fuck before\" he said pulling an innocent smile on his cute little face. \"But the question is: who's doing the fucking?\" Carl's clone just moaned. \"I don't really care, plus you're the boss so you choose\" he said, not missing a beat playing with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, in that case I think...\"</span></div></div>",

Only this time his clitoris lengthened and morphed into Carl's 8-inch cock and his hairy balls 'popped' out underneath. \"Ooh yeah...I know that feeling!\" Carl chuckled in Cindy's voice...as he felt his cock growing rigid...standing fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks pretty weird!\" his clone laughed from inside Caroline's busty body as he continued fingering his snatch. Yet at the same time, the sight of an 11-year old girl with a big pair of tits and a large cock was also 'arousing'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird? Try fucking amazing!\" Carl responded to his duplicate's comment, as he let go of his loose-hanging breasts and wrapped both of his dainty hands around his manhood. He then began jerking himself off, moaning in his girly voice in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't waste it dude!\" his clone complained, as he spread Caroline's legs as wide as they would go, inviting Carl in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl chuckled menacingly from inside his young host. \"Oops, my bad!\" he mumbled, and then he got into position...and moaned out loud as he thrusted Cindy's body forward...and buried his cock deep into her mother's cunt. \"How's that feel...huh??\" Carl grunted...as he began a rhythmic motion...back and forth.

Even Carl had to admit that it was the best sex he had ever had. And when he'd 'recovered', Carl got off the cum-stained bed and lit up a cigarette. He stood there, puffing away, his semi-flaccid cock hanging limp between Cindy's small legs. And he couldn't resist having another feel of his huge tits as he stood there, being watched by his prostrate clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...we done here?\" the clone asked his 'daughter' as he watched Carl playing with himself and coating Cindy's lungs with nicotine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'' \"Go sit! You're gonna hear about that at school'' said the driver angry. Cindy was now the attraction of the whole bus having confronted authority so openly. Searching little Cindy's memory, Carl found out that the bad girls were hanging out at the back, there were three little evil bitches, but they were Cindy's friends, they were Anna, Sarah and Tanya. ''Woah nice little shit you did right there Cindy '' said Sarah.''Yeah totally cool, you still have more?'' said Tanya, looking at them. Carl was laughing inside, they were pitiful little girls trying to look bad. Carl just looked at them, took another cigarette and lit it. He was the queen of the bus without even using his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus finally got to school and Carl saw a cop car in front, without any cops inside. He would probably be make a presentation on front of Cindy's class. When he finally got to his class he saw that the cop was a young female that probably just got admitted, she was at most 22. ''Damn!\" said Carl, another Miss'' He decided that it was time to leave little Cindy's body and when he saw his female teacher he knew he had the right body right in front of him.</span></div></div>",

He wanted the process to be slow, but he just couldn\u2019t wait to begin.  Carl walked calmly out his apartment door and down the building\u2019s stairs into the cool night air.  At the corner opposite his building, he saw the city bus making its rounds.  He\u2019d had to get used to the bus a lot\u2026.no one would hire him for steady work, so he couldn\u2019t afford a car; thank god for that shit-box on wheels of a bus.  Carl jogged across the street and calmly walked on to the dimly lit bus, giving a grunt to the overweight, underpaid driver named Willy and slowly making his way down the thin aisle of the bus, occasionally stepping over the sticky remnants of used chewing gun and a couple of condoms.  Carl took his usual seat in the almost-empty diesel giant, looking about and seeing only one disheveled fat guy in the back of the bus reading The National Enquirer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl relaxed as the bus rolled noisily through the city streets, trying to think of something to do to his tormenter, that fat-ass Trask.  Of course, he had to find out where the guy lived first\u2026he got off at 8 AM, and it was now about 5:30, so Carl had to devise a plan in fairly short order or be stuck waiting until Trask came into work the following midnight.  The bus eventually pulled up to a stop right across from the police station\u2026located conveniently next to a doughnut shop.  Carl left the bus and walked toward the doughnut shop, not figuring it was a good idea for a man such as he to be in the police station just yet; plus, he didn\u2019t have clothes to wear if he were to shapeshift, and he didn\u2019t have a safe place to stash his body if he wanted to posses someone.<br>\r\nHe found one of many empty tables in the run-down establishment and took a seat to think.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was quiet\u2014only one fat, smelly guy behind the counter and an older woman mopping the floor.  It was now 6 AM, and time was running a bit short.  Carl\u2019s fruitless thinking was interrupted by a customer who entered the doughnut shop\u2014a cop Carl had seen a couple times\u2026but not many.  Her name was Lilly Hernandez; she was a 35-year old Latina woman.  She had long, dark hair, tanned skin, and curves in all the right places\u2014big boobs and an ass to die for, both of which jiggled with every wonderful step.  She had a good, full body\u2026.not like one of those anorexic models or actresses you see on TV; she had the body the cell guards used to sit around at night and talk to each other about.  She went to the counter and got a couple doughnuts and a coffee, then ate them in peace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hernandez finished and got up to head to the restroom, Carl got an idea.  He vacated his table and followed her to the door, walking up and just catching her as she was about to go in to do her business.  \u201cMa'am,\u201d Carl said, putting on his most innocent, pleasant face.  \u201cHi, I\u2019m Bill Horton (lying was no problem for Carl).\u201d  Somewhat surprised, Hernandez smiled back and extended her hand politely, \u201cHello, I\u2019m Lilly Hernandez.\u201d  \u201cI thought you were\u2026hey you\u2019re a friend of Nick Trask, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Carl asked nicely.  \u201cWhy, yes, yes Nick and I are friends; I work with him a lot,\u201d Lilly replied.  \u201cWell, I\u2019m an old friend of Nick\u2019s, and I thought you might talk to him for me,\u201d Carl said.  A bit unnerved by this polite but odd stranger, Lilly kindly said, \u201cWell, my shift starts soon, but if you want to see him he\u2019s right over in the station there\u201d she said motioning across the way and turning to head into the restroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Carl followed the unsuspecting officer into the room and grabbed her shoulders firmly.  As she started to move for her gun, Carl concentrated.  He looked up and saw the officer\u2019s eyes glaze over\u2026they glazed over with the same kind of misty smoke that was Carl\u2019s body before when he had tried to possess Trask.  Hernandez seemed to struggle and grunt for a couple seconds; then she calmly stood up, her eyes regaining their normal color.  \u201cNow are you ready to help me?\u201d Carl demanded of his own clone now possessing the policewoman.  \u201cSure thing, boss,\u201d the inhabited cop replied, running her borrowed hands over the ample boobs and ass of her new form.  \u201cAll right, just jiggle that little ass of yours on into the police station and find Trask.  Get me his home address.  Understand?  His home address.  Make up a story\u2026like you need it for sending out the office Christmas cards or something.  Got it?\u201d Carl demanded of his clone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet buddy,\u201d Hernandez said as she smiled and still explored her voluptuous curves.  She turned and walked out of the women\u2019s restroom, her wonderful, wide hips swaying about as she made her way to the station as ordered.<br>\r\n1)\t She comes back in a few minutes with the info.<br>\r\n2)\tA very large cop comes in determined to arrest Carl\u2026apparently he\u2019s got a warrant or two.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The clone then reached over to a plate and retrieved a half-eaten doughnut, studying it for a moment before stuffing it in Lilly's mouth. \"This chick really loves these\" \"Lilly\" laughed, with her mouth full of doughnut. \"I put down his home address, the names of his family members, annual income...you name it\" the clone then mumbled, as he swallowed the left-over doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl grinned, then put the piece of paper in his pocket. \"Fucking great, thanks...me!\" he chuckled. Then the sight of his clone licking his \"borrowed\", luscious lips gave him an idea. He had always wanted a blowjob from a policewoman, and he knew that his clone would probably do whatever he told him to do, until he extracted him from his host body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl felt an erection straining against his pants as he stared across at the possessed officer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl needed a way to get to where Trask lived and an opportunity soon presented itself.  He saw a car pull up and out exited a pretty young black woman, she looked to be around college age so she probably went to the local community college.  This was great!  Carl began formulating his plan.  The girl hadn't bothered to lock her car so he opened a door and climbed into the backseat, waiting until she returned.  As she closed the door and set her coffee and donuts down, he sprung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, gorgeous.  Lovely day ain't it?\" he said sneering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl let out a yelp and panicked.  \"Wh-Who are you?!  What do you want?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want?  Hmm, well...\" he said, proceeding to eye her up.  Her short-sleeved and low cut purple shirt covered a pair of nice C-cup breasts and as he saw earlier, her fantastic ass could barely be contained by her tight, low rise jeans.  Her smooth skin was a light mocha color and her curly black hair was quite luscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, please!\" she exclaimed, \"Please don't hurt me!  Don't... oh god, I've... I've got money.  Have it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just chuckled a bit, \"Oh don't worry babe, I don't plan on hurtin' a sweet little number like you.  And I don't wan't your money either... at least, not right now.\" he flashed her a smile, \"Nah, ya see I'm in need of some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Help?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" Carl nodded, \"Ya see, I've got this asshole cop who's made my life real shitty over the last few years so now I plan on getting a little bit of revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's eyes widened at that.  \"Nuh uh!  No way!  I'm not helping you kill a cop!  I'll... I'll call the police myself.  Or--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I ain't giving you a choice.\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he concentrated and watched as his body collapsed into the backseat.  He was now the smoky aura again and with that he jumped straight towards the girl.  She gasped and stiffened a bit as her eyes became a clear white.  Soon however the color returned and she began breathing normally.  She looked down at her body, pulled her hair a bit and ran her hands over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, fuckin' jackpot!\" she said to herself as she began squeezing and fondling her breasts.  She took a hand and simultaneously began rubbing her pussy through her jeans though stopped shortly after.  She smiled; Carl was in control of her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this bitch's body is great!\" he said in her voice, \"I might have to send a clone into her later on.  Keep her around for a little fun.\"  And suddenly he was hit with a realization; he could read her memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlene Robbins, 20 years old and single.  She went to the local community college and lived with her two friends (both cute white girls) in a house... that happened to be right next door to Trask's place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' perfect!\" Carl exclaimed as a plan began to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl smiled to himself as he, in Charlene's body, walked into the front office of Herbert Hoover Middle School.  He walked up to the front desk where the lone receptionist sat and greeted her.  It was now 2:30 PM, about an hour before school got out, and he had spent most of the day getting \"familiar\" with Charlene and her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ma'am, my name's Charlene Robbins and I'm here to check out Sarah Trask.\" he said in a friendly tone.  He could access her personality as well as her memories so posing as her wasn't particularly hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ms. Robbins but I can't allow that.\" replied the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl proceeded to flash one of Charlene's pretty smiles, \"Aww, please?  I'm her nextdoor neighbor and her uncle had asked me to pick her up early from school since she's got a doctor's appointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I'm sorry but that's against the rules.  We have a list of names for each person allowed to check out a student early and you, unfortunately, are not on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stupid middle-aged bitch.\"</i> Carl thought angrily, though never letting the friendly facade he wore with Charlene's face drop, <i>\"I'll get her to let me check the girl out.  There's nobody else around anyway.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no options, Carl made a clone and had it enter the body of the secretary.  \"Oh, sorry dude, turns out you ARE on the list.\" she replied with a wink, \"I'll send out a call for her, you sign that dumbass cop's name on this paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl did so and in a few minutes Sarah Trask came walking up.  \"Oh, hey Charlene!\" she said enthusiastically, Charlene's memories told Carl that the two had a sisterly relationship, \"I didn't expect you to pick me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair proceeded to walk out the building toward's Charlene's car.  As they got in, Carl extracted the clone from the receptionist and then sized the girl up.  Sarah was 14-years-old and on the tall and skinny side; a pretty girl with great legs that she knew drew the boys in her class wild as accentuated by the short shorts she was wearing.  She was also possibly \"developing\" a little faster than the other girls her age and Carl found some memories of her telling Charlene about various boys that liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't Trask's daughter, he was far too young to have a kid that old, but rather his niece.  His older brother worked a job in the military and got stationed overseas.  His wife went with him and not wanting to pull her out of school, they left Sarah in Trask's care.  Trask was, right now, single though Charlene's memories told Carl that he definitely had a thing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl laughed inside, this couldn't be anymore perfect.  As he looked at Sarah, he realized that he could easily surround Trask using her, Charlene and Charlene's friends to make his life hell.  A dilemma presented itself though: Sarah was going to get possessed, this was fact.  Carl just wasn't sure if he should take her body himself and leave a clone in Charlene.  Personally taking over his beloved niece and using her to fuck with Trask would be glorious... however he would probably do some rather \"questionable\" things with her body and he wasn't sure if he wanted to personally control it when that happened.  Plus Charlene's body was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?  Possess Sarah himself and send a clone into Charlene or send a clone into Sarah and keep Charlene's body?</span></div></div>",

Carl's actual body...covered in the back seat, remained unoticed by the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C...Charlene, what are you doing, are you drunk?\" she questioned her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked grin apppeared on the young black woman's pretty face. \"In a way sweetheart, you could say that, drunk with power!\" Carl laughed. \"Care to join me?

I make most of it up as  I go\" Carl explained in Charlene's voice. He then put his own seatbelt on, which emphasized his new breasts still further. Then he thought about his next course of action regarding his asshole of a nemesis Trask. He had possessed one of his neighbors and his cute little neice, but he knew he could go further. There was just one thing on Carl's mind and that was to fuck with Trask's mind. And his clone now possessed the body to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally made his decision.</span></div></div>",

Sarah just nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl made his grand entrance into the house, legs swinging gracefully as the 14 year old Sarah followed behind. \"Chloe! Jennifer!\" Carl yelled while trying his best not to sound too different than how Charlene would call her roommates. His clone however was still entranced with the body he's now inhabiting, cupping both of Sarah's quite developed boobs with her own hands. \"Stop that will you! At least until we have those bitches working for us!\" Carl muttered to his clone. Sarah's arms dropped to her side, a look of discontentment appeared, but it was soon replaced by a flash of smile \"Okay boss! Whatever you say\" Sarah grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe! Jennifer\"! Charlene's voice boomed again in the house, this time it was filled with impatience, Carl and his clone hastily stride into the house, checking every room they could find for signs of Charlene's roommates. \"Shit, those bitches aren't home yet?!\" Carl muttered. \"Seems not boss\", Sarah's voice yelled out from upstairs, \"Their rooms are still locked\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl took out another cigarette, lighted it up and draw a lungful of breath in and exhaled the smoke. \"I should prepare then, gonna miss this bitch's body\". With that he dropped the cigarette to the wooden floor below and with a stomp, extinguished it. In that moment, Carl left Charlene's body which instantly would've crumpled to the floor, if the clone in Sarah had not stopped the fall. Carl's spirit flew out from the house and entered his body on the back seat of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl gasped for breath, seems like his choice to return to his old body was right. The air inside the car was beginning to run out and the heat began to make it into an oven. Carl quickly exited the car and made his way into the house, to be greeted by the sight of Sarah Trask examining the body of an unconscious Charlene Robbins on the floor. Carl laughed, the view of a 14 year old teenager kneeling over a 20 year old, caressing her body and fondling her boobs is something that he had never seen before, but he would see them often now. In fact, as much as he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl thought about the Latina beauty that his clone has possessed this morning. \"What the fuck, it might just happen\", Carl closed his eyes and began to visualize Lilly Hernandez. The fact that his clone had been inside her enabled him to clearly make out the shape of the voluptuous police officer. The curve of her body, her impressive boobs and that ass to die for are all vividly engraved in his mind. Carl's body melted into a silvery puddle and soon enough it was no longer the body of an ex-criminal standing there in the living room, but the police officer by the name of Lilly Hernandez in her uniform. An evil smile flashed on the police officer's face. Carl shot out a clone of him to Charlene which was about to wake up. </span></div></div>",

The owner of the house was Bruce Jennings, who was currently at work at his office, but at home were his wife Catherine and their 10-year old daughter Samantha. It was Samantha who answered the door when Carl rang the doorbell, and Carl smiled warmly as he looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie, are your parents home?\" Carl asked the girl in Lilly Hernandez's soothing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom is, but my dad is at work\" she replied. \"MOM,\" she then shouted, \"there's a police lady here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl kept smiling at the 'loud' girl, he turned around momentarily and saw two young women walking across the street, heading for Charlene's house.

As the two women inched closer and closer to Charlene's house, drops of sweat began to form on the forehead of the police lady he was impersonating. Samantha then just ran off inside, resuming her activities, whatever that were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, shit, shit!\" Carl thought aloud. Just then Carl thought up an idea, \"Better than nothing.\" Carl silently cursed with a slight Hispanic accent. He concentrated his willpower to Catherine. The lady stopped in her track, eyes clouded with a white mist, the sign that Carl observed always to happen as his clone attempted a hostile takeover of the helpless victim. After an agonizing two seconds, the eyes now become clear again, although an oddly cheesy grin has appeared in Catherine's face. Quickly she ran to the front door, and skidded to a halt just inches from Carl, took a lungful of breath and yelled, \"Chloe! Jennifer!\" The two women who had just crossed the street (to get to the other side obviously) jerked their head to the source of the familiar voice. Carl smiled, licking his now luscious lips, his plan has just succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe and Jennifer hastily made their way into Catherine's front yard, believing that their kind neighbor had gotten herself into trouble. The clone waved her hand at them, beckoning Chloe and Jennifer to come. \"Good\", Carl whispered in a somewhat seductive tone, \"Now try to keep them busy, while I prepare a surprise for them\". Carl then turned around and gave a smile to both girls. \"Oh, hi,\" Chloe awkwardly started the conversation ,\" I hope Mrs. Jennings here is not in any trouble at all\" She finished as she gave a worried look to Catherine, while Jennifer also gave the same look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not at all\" Carl answered, making use Lilly's Hispanic accent, \"I'm here just to ask Mrs. Jennings whether she had seen any suspicious or weird behavior by anyone around here\". Mrs. Jennings just nodded in agreement. <i>Yeah, right, like someone that can get any bitch's body and make them fuck each other</i> Carl sneered in his mind. Jennifer just frowned \"No, Ms... err Hernandez, if we see any of that, we'll be sure to report it to the authorities.\" \"Yes, we'll be sure to tell you.\" Chloe quipped. <i>Don't waste your energy bitch, I'm here</i> Carl sneered. \"Well, I'll be off then,\" Carl smiled and took a step sideways then walked away from the front door. He could hear Catherine's voice as she tried to persuade the girls for a cup of tea. As Carl walked away, he glanced to the door, which was now partly closed and could see his clone winked at him. Carl grinned, everything was running well. Carl looked at his body's bosom which jiggled as he intentionally walked with exaggerated steps and thought about his next move...</span></div></div>",

Carl stood up, and he had a brilliant idea already formed in his mind. Luckily he had locked the door beforehand, it would be pretty ironic be surprised while he was preparing a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They won't suspect a thing</i> Carl grinned devilishly. He strides to the mirror in the living room and willed himself to change. In that instant, Lilly's form melted into a puddle of silvery substance and quickly reformed itself into an exact replica of Charlene, still wearing her purple shirt and jeans. Carl let out a hushed \"Perfect\" as he felt his new disguise up and walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Charlene, so early to return? I thought you had an afternoon class too.\" Jennifer greeted Carl as the women made their way inside. \"Uh yeah, I had to pick up Sarah, she was sick, but it's okay now, she's resting upstairs\" Carl covered. It seemed that shapeshifting did not come packaged with the ability to read the mind of someone he assumed disguise. \"Ah, right, we shouldn't disturb her then\" Chloe quipped as she made her way to the sofa. Carl just smiled <i>Good</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you girls wants?\" Jennifer yelled softly from the kitchen. \"Macaroni please!\" came Chloe's reply. \"I'll take the same too!\" Carl continued. He had not looked into Charlene's favorite food earlier, deeming it was unnecessary. \"I thought you didn't like macaroni,\" Chloe gave Carl a puzzled look \"And finally you have learned to lock the doors! I must have rubbed off on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just smiled, a smile that Chloe took as a friendly smile from her 20 year old friend, Charlene Robbins. Unbeknown to her, it was a fiendish smile. \"Hmm, I just want to eat something different and yeah, just to keep us safe from criminals\" Carl replied as he sat down beside Chloe. Chloe shifted her ass, allowing Carl to sit \"We just had macaroni yesterday! And you sulked the whole evening because of it,\" Chloe raised an eyebrow \"You sure you're okay girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn bitch, does she have to be this talkative?</i> Carl cursed. \"And have you noticed that you smell like cigarettes too?\" This time, Carl had enough, listening to Chloe was like a worse hell then being jailed. Making sure Jennifer would take a long time from the sound of repetitive knocks on what he suspected to be a chopping board, Carl took a deep breath and looked at Chloe's eyes intently and did not take his gaze away until his victim's eyes became clouded with the white mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe blinked a few times, then she grinned the same cheesy grin that Carl had. \"This bitch giving you trouble b...\" Carl's clone did not finish his sentence as a slender hand quickly covered up her mouth. \"Yes,\" Carl muttered \"And I don't need any from you either\". The clone just nodded, gave a muffled \"Okay boss\" and like all Carl's clones, began to feel up the hapless victim. <i> Now the surprise</i> Carl sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl silently crept upstairs and entered the room where his two clones still continued their making out. \"Fuck, you're still going?\" Carl demanded his clone as he entered the room. \"You\" Carl pointed to the clone in Charlene, \"Go downstairs and cover my absence, Chloe is one of us now\" The clone in Charlene licked her lips \"Sweet!\". And quickly went downstairs after fixing his host body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, you get dressed too!\" Carl said to 'Sarah'. \"Aww,\" the clone in Sarah pouted her lips seductively and rose from the bed. Carl took off his disguise and assumed his scruffy form, it was then he noticed he had a hard on as he looked to the clone which inhabited Sarah's body as she began to put on her thong.</span></div></div>",

Her voice trailed off as Jennifer checked her temperature. \"Hmm, that's strange, you seems to be perfectly fine\" Jennifer concluded. <i>Fuck, it's all or nothing now</i> Carl thought as Jennifer's wandering gaze scanned the whole room, it came to the crack in the wardrobe door. Carl fixated his gaze to Jennifer's and willed his clone to takeover the last of the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Jennifer chirped,\"Well, even if you're not sick, I think someone else is.\" Suddenly the wardrobe door was flung open. Jennifer smiled, \"Oww, it looks swollen and hurt lemme see if I can take care of that\". And without any hesitation she dropped to her knees, and enclosed her mouth on Carl's penis, sucking it.

Carl stopped for a moment. \u201cShit, in all the fun I\u2019ve been having with these bitches, I've not even got a solid plan!\u201d Carl chuckled. The other clones joined in on his joking. \u201cSo, your all me. Lets get some ideas going\u201d. The clones began to brainstorm for a moment as they put and idea together. \u201cCouldn't we get Jiggy to give us some of that paralysis stuff?\u201d \u2018Sarah\u2019 asked, referring to the drug dealer Carl regularly bought from and worked with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u2018paralysis stuff\u2019 was a pretty powerful LSD that numbed the muscles and pretty much paralyzed the victim. It was a pretty radical date rape drug, one that Carl had known others to use before. \u201cWe've got less than an hour till Trask gets here! Jiggy won\u2019t be able to get us some on time\u201d \u2018Jennifer\u2019 quickly input. \u201cThis bitch knows a dealer who does her weed on the regular. Maybe he has some!\u201d \u2018Charlene responded. \u201cDamn, these bitches aren't so innocent are they!\u201d Carl laughed. \u201cWell we\u2019d better be quick, old pigface will be back soon\u201d. Carl decided to possess Chloe, leaving his body with the other clones. He and \u2018Charlene\u2019 headed out to the local 7/11, knowing from Charlene\u2019s memories that the local dealer operated round back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching down the alley in a very unladylike fashion, the two \u2018girls\u2019 found the dealer shifting out some cocaine to teenagers. As the teens scrammed, Carl approached. \u201cHey Charlene, I've got some good green if your lackin\u2019 babe\u201d the dealer said as he addressed Charlene. \u201cEr, not today\u201d the clone in Charlene spoke. \u201cYou got any of that paralysis stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe date rape drug? Damn, what man you planning on catching?\u201d the dealer chuckled. The two Carl\u2019s didn't share in the joke. \u201cLook, you got any or not?\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 demanded, the aggressive tone sounding foreign on her sweet voice. \u201cChill babe! I've got some. But it will cost you\u201d the dealer informed them. \u201cIt ain't costing us jack!\u201d Carl noted as he shot a clone inside the dealer. He spasmed for a moment before sporting the same cheesy grin the other clones did. \u201cHere\u2019s what you need boss, plenty here!\u201d the former dealer exclaimed, reaching into his coat and handing him two vials worth. \u201cThanks me!\u201d Carl chuckled as he once more extracted the clone, letting the dealer drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Carl\u2019s laughed at their efforts. With a little time to spare, they decided to raid the 7/11 for some cigarettes. The cashier stacked a bag full of the most expensive brand, all free of charge of course, before dropping to the floor as the two young girls exited. Lighting up on the way home, the clone in Charlene noticed another pair of girls walking past. He admired them as any \u2018man\u2019 would. \u201cLook at the fucking arse on that!\u201d Charlene exclaimed. \u2018Chloe\u2019 gave him a smack around the head to bring back to his senses. \u201cThat wasn't very ladylike was it \u2018Charlene\u2019\u201d Carl glared. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t what the whole fucking neighborhood getting suspicious\u201d. \u201cOops, sorry dude!\u201d the clone in Charlene laughed as they arrived back at the house.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

''You will find out soon enough'' said the lovely Catherine who was now close to Chloe. ''You have such a great ass, it's gonna be a pleasure'' said the young Samantha and that made Chloe totally freaked out: ''What are you saying Samantha and what's wrong with all of you!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think I played enough with my food time to eat my prey'' Carl said now concentrating on Chloe.Seeing her eyes change color you knew it was working and soon enough Chloe was gone.

As Carl and his gang entered the house, they are greeted by the sight of Sarah Trask about to undress herself.

Come here you little fucker.\" Carl called out to Sarah, the possessed girl made her way to Carl as he unzipped his pants. Sarah just chuckled, as though she had instinctively knew what to do. Sarah's soft hand took Carl's awaiting member and dropped to her knees, her hands skillfully massaged the warm member and teased Carl's balls. Finally Sarah held out her tongue, wrapped it around the shaft and slipped the shaft into her throat, before sucking on it eagerly like a lollipop. Carl just grunted and moaned, relishing the pleasure of Sarah's blowjob and soft lips, while the other girls looked in complete lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Carl blew his load in satisfaction, Sarah licked the dick clean of semen. \"Yum,\" the possessed Sarah cheekily grinned. Not long after that, Carl mused aloud, \"Too bad only one me is here, don't worry though, I'm sure I can impregnate you all!\" As soon as he said that, the girls all turned into an exact copy of his old male self, much to the surprise of Carl and his clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, cancel! Cancel! I ain't gonna screw and get screwed by myself.\" Carl concentrated, and in an instant the girls' bodies were back to normal, much to the relief of everyone in the house. Carl's brilliant mind quickly schemed up a plan, \"Little girl, you be me!\" Carl commanded to Samantha. The little girl then instantly became Carl, \"Much better boss!

Nothing special yet, but soon it would. Carl gave a chuckle at that thought. He thought about releasing Catherine from the possession and let her to grow her 'daughter' up.

He tried again and this time turned into an image of Jennifer, her dirty blond hair flowed freely.

I had the perfect plan for tonight the fucker always seems to be lucky. But not this time I will control all the people close to him to make him suffer until he wants to die'' Carl, still in Samantha's cute form, said. Then in a really weird sight Carl got a cigarette to calm himself, smoking as the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Damn it, said Catherine, why does my ''little girl'' smoke when I don't!'' Carl then came close to '' his mother''  blew a stream of smoke in 'her' face and then kissed her. For a normal person, the scene would have look totally not normal but for a lot of Carls in the bodies of hot chicks. It only made him laugh while wanting to fuck and smoke with all the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl then switched back to his form and possessed the real Samantha to get more used to being the real her. Then he took another smoke before throwing his pack at his other selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Get used to those bodies, cuz you gonna be them for a long time '' said the new evil Samantha, blowing smoke from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his clones now had now a cigarette and anyone who knew them would be in shock seeing all those gentle girls smoking. That's when \"Charlene\" said ''Maybe we could recruit more members boss, the more people the funnier it gets and the more power you have!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Not bad for an idiot clone in an stupid bitch'' said \"Sam\", still having 'her' way with her sexy Mother.  'The more people we corrupt the more the world become a world for us. I like the idea of a corrupt world.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Your new father should be coming back soon' 'said \"Catherine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah almost forgot him, well go wait for him and when he comes back make him so pissed off that he don't wanna come back for a while'' said the little girl of her father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Pissing off people his my speciality\" said \"Catherine\", blowing smoke and going back around to her house''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I will go and recruit with Sarah, see if there's some good prospects around here while you chick trio have fun while waiting for us'' said Carl to his minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nicceeee!\" said \"Sarah\", while leaving with Carl, \"I will try to get real good girls to join us guys, we will choose just like if we were all there... even if in fact we are all the same haha''. </span></div></div>",

Has your daughter decided if she is going to be transferring colleges yet?\" Christina asked her partner. Christina was a young woman of 26 about 5'7\". She was a thicker white girl who wasn't fat but wasn't skinny either. Her breasts were large but looked even bigger due to the Kevlar vest under her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy on the other hand was taller and well built standing at 5'11\", she had an impressive build from time spent at the gym. \"No. She thinks she wants to stay in San Marcos but isn't 100% just yet. And Bill just wants her to make up her mind because she is calling the the house to much asking for us to choose for her.\" Betsy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the dating pool?\" Betsy asked. Christina rolled her eyes and scoffed. \"Women are bitches. Can't find a decent one.\" Christina said causing her friend and partner to laugh. Betsy shook her head. \"Oh, Tina you are too much.\" The major difference between the two women wasn't the marriage factor but the orientation. Betsy was heterosexual were as Tina was a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina then watched as a girl no older than 11 or 10 walked past her smoking a cigarette. \"Hey!\" The young female officer said to the passing girl. The little girl stopped and spun on her heels and blew a stream of smoke in the face of the cop. \"Yeah?\" The girl asked as of nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy watched on with shock and amusement as her partner had a verbal exchange with some delinquent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who gave you that cigarette?\" Tina asked concerned for the health of this girl. Samantha smiled and casually approached the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it myself.\" she answered truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina giggled as Betsy shook her head. \"Honey... No, seriously who gave you the cigarette.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was standing right next to Tina as she smiled at the cop. \"No one gave it to me you stupid bitch, are you deaf? I said I got it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was stunned at the lack of authority and language that the girl used. \"Honey you shouldn't speaking like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut the fuck up you prude bitch.\" Betsy then cut off Tina. Tina whipped her head around to find Betsy sitting behind the wheel of the squad car rubbing her crotch through her uniform pants. \"What the fuck Bets?\" Tina asked horrified as her partner grinned wickedly and continued to rub herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry....\" Samantha said as Tina turned her head and saw an older girl standing next to her both smiling the same wicked and demented smile that Betsy had on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna like being one of us.\" Betsy, Samantha and Sarah said at the same time as Tina felt a wave of darkness overcome her.</span></div></div>",

He got out of Jen and the asian chick slumped to the carpet. She recovered a few moments later, only to be possessed by a clone of Carl and tasked to watch the driveway from the window, just in case someone would come. 'Jen' just dutifully obliged and did as she were told, while at the same time...groping herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, Samantha, I'm gonna give you a new baby brother or sister,' Carl chuckled at that thought,' And Catherine, you're obviously going to help me!' The announcement was greeted with laughter as the rest of the clones expressed their agreement. 'Catherine' and 'Samantha' are just too happy at that thought. 'Another that I would need is Trask' at the end of that sentence, Carl melted into a silvery puddle and re-emerged as an exat copy of the 26 year old detective. 'Perfect' he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage was then set up. Carl, as Trask would fuck Catherine in the kitchen after extracting the clone. The two 'policewomen' would then help him to restrain her. The main idea is to create a very bad impression of Trask and made him to look like a serial rapist. A suggestion which all the clones agreed to happily, although to their dismay, they wouldn't be allowed to see it except for 'Samantha', 'Christina', 'Betsy' and of course, 'Catherine'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Which way are you going to fuck me boss?' Catherine asked delightedly as she continued to smoke and touch herself. 'Whichever way, as long as Trask's face would be imprinted in this bitch's mind forever, you're not gonna be there anyway, I'm gonna extract you soon.' Carl then amused himself by squeezing Catherine's ample boobs, much to the delight of the clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now, you lie down'. Carl told the clone in Catherine. 'You two,' Carl instructed 'Christina' and 'Betsy' as he kneeled, ' Hold her arms'. As the cops made an attempt to hold 'Catherine's' hands, the clone inside her playfully grabbed their boobs and gave them a squeeze before surrendering. 'Ohh, you're gonna pay for that, bitch!' 'Betsy' exclaimed. 'Get serious will you!' Carl demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carl then continued to pound deeply into Catherine and she woke up with a start to find a well-known detective was fucking her. Catherine shrieked at the top of her lungs and struggled to get herself free only to find that she was held down by two police officers. Carl, from his experience, had chosen a good position and didn't get kicked by Catherine's flailing legs and he soon shot a load of satisfaction into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What... are... you...doing?' Catherine gasped between tears and moans of pleasure, but as she saw 'Samantha' sobbing, she tried to calm herself down and tried to not look like a slut, although, it was futile as Carl just pounded her quicker. 'Well, as you can see, ma'am, you're going to have a baby, and I'm just helping you out.' Carl said out of amusement. 'You sick bastard! Get out now or I'm going to call the police!' Catherine shouted, as she mustered her bravery to confront her assaulter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just laughed, 'No need to call them, there are two right there\" he said, as he pointed to officers 'Christina' and 'Betsy' who...to Catherine's horror, smiled at her while they kept her hands restrained. 'And I myself a detective, I'm sure you've seen me on the TV sometimes.' Carl finished with a chuckle. Meanwhile 'Samantha' kept sobbing audibly. This was a total nightmare to Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive more minutes went by as Carl kept pumping his load to Catherine. Catherine was reduced to tears, but had no other options except to comply, Carl however was getting more and more aroused, as well as the two policewomen, as they eyed each other in lust and then eyed Catherine. Finally, Carl got tired, even though he would have liked to continue, he was tired and he thought that by now Trask would be screwed. He then thought of a brilliant idea, but he decided to do that later, maybe with the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you like it?' Carl grinned as he shot his last load into Catherine, 'Well your body certainly does, it keeps begging for more, I just have to serve the community, don't I?'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'You'll pay for what you've done, you monster\" Catherine managed to get her words out between sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'll see about that, we'll see.' Carl looked at Catherine and a familiar grin appeared in her face. 'How is it in there?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, you fucked her prim and proper boss! I'm sure this bitch will be pregnant, first thing in the morning!' The possessed Catherine now stood up and put her clothes and panties back on, with cum dripping from its outer rim. 'Sure is sticky down here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That pig won't have any alibi that could prove he wasn't fucking this bitch, he's on his way back here after all! We sure have this in the bag.' Carl triumphantly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, let's put her back in her house people!' With that said, he sent Catherine and Samantha back to 'their' home. They'd come later on when called. 'And you two, get back to your car, lets see if you can spot Trask before he makes his way here, leave me your cellphone number here.' Carl motioned to Christina and Betsy, 'Don't grope yourselves too much bitches! We don't want the whole street to look at you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the clones then memorised the numbers and Carl sat down, tired from his set-up, but very pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was now just Charlene, Jennifer, Chloe and Sarah left in the house, in addition to himself, Carl wondered what he should do next....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cocking his head from side to side, Carl then massaged his neck and sat down, spreading his legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...you!\" he said, pointing to the possessed, 14-year old Sarah. \"I'm still feeling horny despite that fucking session back there\" he grinned, as he unzipped his pants and beckoned his clone over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clones inside Chloe and Jennifer began kissing each other again, sliding their tongues into each others' mouths, a grinning \"Sarah\" sashayed over to Carl and dropped to her knees. \"What can I do you for boss? As if I didn't know!\" the clone asked in the girl's voice. Carl just smirked at the possessed girl and waved his cock from side to side, as it quickly became erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goody, sausage time again!\" the clone rolled Sarah's eyes, giving a little attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelivering a quick slap to \"Sarah's\" face, Carl put his clone in his place. \"Cut the sarcasm fuckface!\" he said firmly. \"And suck it!\" he added, pointing to his erect penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone dutifully slipped Carl's 'member' into Sarah's mouth and began sucking on it, making Carl groan out loud. And all the while, the clone inside of Charlene was watching...slipping his own manicured hands into his host's panties and fingering her moist slit. \"Ooh...fuck yeah, this feels soo good!\" the clone cooed in the sexy, ebony girl's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl grabbed Sarah's ponytail and repeatedly pushed her head down onto his cock, the clone moaned in pleasure, his petite mouth full with a meaty shaft that tasted so good. And as he enjoyed his blowjob, Carl pondered his next move.</span></div></div>",

Carl was searching for his first victim but first he had to find a place to hide himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw a sexy mother that was bringing her young daughter to school. She looked a little bit over 35 but still had a sexy body, while her daughter seems to be a pure with an angelic smile. Carl had found his first two victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey there Miss, could you help me ?'' asked Carl to the unsuspecting mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You don't look too good, what do you want with me'' responded the mother with a superior attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Bitch, you're going to help me whether you like it or not'' he said. Then Carl focused his power on her and suddenly he WAS her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey boss, long time no see, nice milf you found here!\" the mother said, touching her boobs. \"Her name is Jessica O'Neil, and her daughter you saw earlier is Veronica'' said the now possessed mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Call her back, I want her to be my vessel, and you are going to take care of my body while I'm inside'' said Carl giving strict instructions to his new acquisition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Veronica, sweetie come here you forgot someting!!'' then yelled the mother, Carl was hiding in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What did I forget mom??'' said young Veronica with the sweetest smile possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Just check in the car sweetie it's a suprise you're going to like'' \"Jessica\" said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow very excited, she checked in the car to see Carl...and she didn't have the time to say anything, she was now possessed by Carl.

Both girls then turned and followed Carl inside the school building that they had just left. \"Stay close, no wandering off, and feel free to play with yourselves\" Carl informed his two clones with a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you boss\" the blonde said, still squeezing her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRLS!! What on earth are you doing?\" a 30-something brunette teacher suddenly said, when she saw Carl's new recruits feeling themselves up. Carl looked the teacher over, guessed her age at about 36, she was conservatively dressed in a long black skirt, a pink blouse, black jacket and a pair of sensible, 2-inch heeled black pumps. And around the teacher's neck...hung a gold crucifix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe in god bitch?\" Carl said to the shocked teacher, \"You should believe in me...since I have the power around here!\" he winked, before projecting another of his clones into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe in you boss!\" the teacher now said, as she too began feeling herself up, fondling her large (covered) breasts. \"And to say this bitch is a religious nut, she's got a body built for sin under these clothes boss\" she winked, as she peeked down her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now lets move on shall we\" Carl said in Veronica's voice, gesturing with his head. \"Right behind you boss\" the cute blonde girl said, as she and her possessed redheaded companion followed close behind.  \"Fuck...wait for me!\" the possessed teacher hollered, clicking after the trio in her heels.

A sly smile curved on Veronica's lips as she lead her friends and teacher to the office which they recognized as there was a placard hung on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl and his lackeys stepped inside the heated room, they saw a woman engrossed in her work. Carl didn't wait for a cue and ditched Veronica's body and flew straight into his target who gasped as Carl's ethereal form phased into her while the unfortunate Veronica free fall to the carpeted floor before any of Carl's lackeys could catch her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This bitch is fucking expired!'', Carl cursed after he examined his new form. He glanced inside his blouse to discover two sagged boobs. ''Fuck, if I knew it, I wouldn't have bothered possessing her!.'' He cursed again, this time standing up. Meanwhile his lackeys stifled a grin as their hosts' memories told them that their boss has possessed. The principal was a wrinkled old woman of 60 something by the name of Mrs. Sophie McKellan. She dressed conservatively with blue blouse and skirt, even if she was a knock out in her youth, there was no trace of that whatsoever now. Her head was predominately full with greying hairs with a streak of blonde, while her back was a bit bent of old age, not to mention her wrinkly appearance, like a piece of paper crumpled again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let's see how you'd like to be here!'' Carl muttered and scowled to the clone in the cute blonde which made no intention whatsoever to stifle her laugh anymore. Within minutes, Carl removed the clone inside the blonde and possessed the cute blonde himself. Carl then sent a clone into Mrs. McKellan's unconscious body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aww,'' Mrs. McKellan groaned as the clone realized the body he's now in. Carl gave a satisfied grin as he wiped away blonde strands which covered his eyes few moments ago. ''Much better, much better'', Carl then re-adjusted Veronica so she lay face up as he straddled her limp body, ready for some action, not before he had instructed a clone to lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Veronica began to stir, she could groggily see a blonde haired girl on top of her, pinning her to the floor beneath. She didn't have time to react as suddenly the girl lunged towards her for a kiss. She tried to shriek, but the girl persisted, implanting her lips firmly against hers, suddenly she felt and knew nothing anymore as darkness shrouded her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's other lackey just stood and saw as suddenly Veronica's lifeless body gave a slight jolt and hugged her assaulter's body tightly against hers and returned the kiss. The two of them then looked like as if they're bitches in heat instead of high school girls, indulging each other in sloppy kiss as they tried to finger each others' pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the heat subsided, the two finally broke off, Veronica lied spread eagled on the floor as she panted for breath, while the blonde girl stood up, gave a maliciously contented grin and wiped her lips off the excess saliva. ''That's nice boss, what's next?'', Veronica gasped in orgasm as the other clones watched, nearing their own after the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Give me your cell phone,'' Carl demanded to Veronica who dutifully obliged, handing over her red Nokia that she kept in one of her pockets and slumped her hand back after doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl dialed a number and waited, the sound in the other side however were just of moans of pleasure. ''Bitch, get my body inside the school parking ground!'', Carl ordered,''It's time to have some fun.'' His answer were unintelligible mix between moans and mumbles, after he heard the revving sound of an engine, Carl cut off the conversation as he flew out from the blonde's body and into his own which had been waiting in the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's body shook a bit as his soul came back to him. He quickly shapeshifted into Veronica's young body and smiled at the rear mirror, showcasing his beautiful set of white teeth, something his old body had lost a long time ago. He then slapped Jessica to bring his clone back to his senses. ''The bitch really gave great orgasms boss!''. Jessica grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them then walked back to the principal's office...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just because he could...he then pointed at the possessed redheaded girl...and her sexy little body morphed into Carl's, except her clothing. \"Now that don't look right\" Carl stated, as the other clones all laughed at the sight of Carl's body (or a copy) dressed in the teenage girl's ill-fitting school outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back you go\" he mumbled, morphing the girl's body back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to Veronica's 'hijacked' body, Carl then studied it for a moment, his own body was now an identical copy of the girl's. He started kissing the body and sliding his tongue into its mouth...and the clone inside it was only too eager to reciprocate. \"Fuck that's hot!\" the possessed blonde girl groaned, as she rubbed her cunt, \"two identical chicks making out...wow!\" she continued.</span></div></div>",

He then strolled to a microphone which during his short moments in the real Mrs. McKellan's body was identified to be the school's announcement system. He cleared his throat, ''Would all classes send a student to the principal's office to take a very important announcement. Thank you.'' He sounded shrill and raspy, just like the real principal would. Carl then waited patiently with a malicious grin in his now wrinkled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps sounded outside the door as the unsuspecting girls walked. Some were chatting with each other while others seemed to be occupied with their own mind. Carl ordered the clone inside the brunette teacher to wait for them outside. The school was not quite big and with some classes going on a field trip, there would not be too many girls he would need to possess. He could corrupt the school slowly and at his leisure pace, a thought which amused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sat himself down while the real Mrs. McKellan's body lay limp under the table, unknowingly jostled and bruised while the other clones took their place behind him. All of them faced the door. Soon the solid oak door opened, and the brunette teacher let in three students while she grinned devilishly. As soon as the door shut, Carl wasted no time to send the clones to the poor girls. ''Now you remember the drill, tag the bitches worth adding to our gang.'' Carl grinned, tapping his long fingers against the desk in a business-like way. ''And the ones that give great orgasm.'' the clone in Jessica quipped, although with a look from Carl, she went quiet, ''We'll know that when we get inside their snatch.'' Carl finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly possessed girls smiled as they got familiar with their new assets. ''Looks like we got a winner already boss.'' a girl spoke. She was petite and cute, with a stylishly cut hair which she dyed brown, a definite Asian.  ''Too bad her boobs are too small.'' she complained. The clone next to her who were less lucky to have possessed a slightly overweight stocky built girl looked a bit pissed. ''Huh? So you want to swap?'' she asked angrily, extending her hand to grope the possessed Asian's assets. The other clone did not complain much, his host was a quite tall and rather slim basketball player by the name of Liz. '' Whoa boss, how does this bitch play ball with these babies hanging to her?'' the possessed Liz exclaimed as she cupped her breasts in her hands, fondling them as though they're alien to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two clones then identified themselves as May, the Asian chick and Julie, the quite chubby girl.  After Liz and May had compared their hosts' assets, much to the distaste of the clone in Julie, the three of them went out. The girls on the other side of the door didn't know what happened to the three of them, why Liz and May went out smiling and Julie with a sour face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was in his normal form again when the last four girls were finally possessed and checking out their assets. The brunette teacher had gone back inside and locked the door behind her. Carl's latest recruits were Sarah, Mitchell, Heather and Jenny. Carl then possessed Jessica after he took his clone back, and transformed the redheaded girl into a copy of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let's see whether this bitch really gives great orgasms.'' Carl mused as he leaned Jessica's body against the desk, her butt sticking out, ready to be screwed by a former girl-turned-Carl. Carl's double then proceeded to screw his new body. After much moaning and a couple of orgasms later, Carl decided to get a fresh snatch as Jessica's was too sore from getting pounded. He went out of the school and ditched his host's body outside her car before floating back to a nearby girl who was unfortunate enough to witness the sight of a disheveled woman with cum dripping from her skirt. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was about 14 years old, had a short, cropped blonde hairstyle and had the normal school uniform on...along with a pair of high heels that Carl was sure violated the school's uniform code. \"Damn this one feels tight, I think I'm gonna enjoy getting pounded in this skin\" he grunted, as he vigorously rubbed in between his legs, soon getting himself aroused in his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then hurried back into the school, clicking down the corridor in his heels but taking very manly strides, not walking like a girl at all. \"Alright you fuckers, I got us a new one to try!\" Carl informed his clones. He was shocked to see the possessed, religious teacher giving the morphed redheaded girl (currently in his form) a blowjob. \"Hmm...sorry boss!\" the teacher clone apologized, as she slipped the redhead's cock out of her mouth and wiped the cum off her chin with her jacket sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait your fucking turn!\" Carl grunted in Mindy's voice, as he hitched up her skirt and re-took his position bent over the desk. \"Do me again!\" he then ordered the clone inside the morphed redhead, whose name was Tammi, (her blonde friend, also possessed, was called Rachel, they had been Carl's first two victims after Veronica and Jessica). \"Tammi\" then proceeded to thrust her cock into Carl's new snatch...and he moaned out loud in Mindy's voice as his double pummeled away into him. \"OOH...FUCK...YEAH...I knew this bitch was tight!\" he grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, his other clones were watching, almost transfixed by the show going on in front of them, each possessed girl and woman rubbing their own cunts and tits repeatedly. The room at that moment was overflowing with female hormones...all of them controlled by a very horny Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter \"Tammi\" had shot her load into Mindy's snatch (and giving Carl a most incredible orgasm in the process)...she pulled out of him, cum dripping all over the floor of the principal's office. \"Boss...my dick hurts!\" the clone suddenly complained...albeit with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can have a time out\" Carl said, as he stood up straight, cum pouring out of his host's pussy and down her legs. \"This bitch is the best so far\" he then grinned. Carl then shot out of Mindy's body and into Rachel's again, and before Mindy's body could slump unconscious...he put another clone inside it. He had decided to keep her around a little longer. He then morphed Tammi's body back to normal...much to the clone's relief, and he turned to the clone inside Veronica. Concentrating again...he morphed her body into a copy of his own. \"Your turn to fuck me!\" he said in Rachel's sweet voice, as he hitched up his skirt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure boss!\" the clone grinned.And all the other clones all looked on in continued delight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Carl enjoyed his new found bodies. Trask was driving furiously to a friend's house, a mentor during his days in the academy. Shayden O'Connor was a retired detective of 75 years old, living in a flat by himself in a secluded area of the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask parked his car and rushed to the elevator. The old man was wise and experienced, after the Don wannabe case that took place nearly 35 years ago, he became renowned throughout the whole country, after he retired, he had taken a job as an instructor while occasionally helping cops and detectives to solve difficult cases from behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he reached the flat, Trask knocked and did not bother waiting for an answer, he let himself in to find that his former mentor asleep on the couch. He did not dare to bother the old man. He scanned the entire flat. It was rather small, with a compact kitchen and  small lounge for visitors, only one bedroom too. Certificates hung on the wall, alongside some black and white photos which featured the old man in his glorious days with an overcoat. There were photos of various people as well, none of his family as for unknown reason, O'Connor was not married and his family were already dead or living far away, which explained why the old man was living alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask inched forward as he took an old battered brown fedora hat and examined it. Another remain of O'Connor's  former glory which now lay gathering dust on a coat hanger. '' Nick my boy, is that you?'' a small voice quipped, which made Trask jump. Turning around he saw the old man stretched his fragile body and yawned as he straightened himself up. Trask just smiled, he knew he could confide in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Connor's blue eyes twinkled as Trask told him his stories after he left the academy. O'Connor nodded as Trask told him of the cases he had solved and the criminals he had helped to put behind bars. As he talked to Trask, he looked much younger, and much more energetic, the creases around his eyes seemed to have lessened, although at times he need to go to the bathroom, he was very attentive to Trask's stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The truth is, I came to you because I have a problem.'', Trask finally told the old man ,'' I know you'd think that I had gone crazy, but I just want you to listen.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask then recounted the weird encounters with Carl. He did not know who the criminal was, but he was certain that the criminal had some supernatural abilities, how else could the girls have acted weird. Shapeshifting and possession certainly were not found in your everyday crook. He described the girls' weird attitude, how Catherine and Samantha framed him and Sarah's weird threat. However, he knew the crook meant business and sooner or later he would have cops on his tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs O'Connor listened to Trask's story his face became grave, he did not laugh at all or question the sanity of his former pupil. His face however grew graver and graver as Trask's story rolled. His blue eyes seemed to have lost their light and he reverted back to look like a 75 years old, if not older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Trask finished his tale, he looked up, to see his former mentor sat with shoulders drooped. There was a deafening silence between the two men as they sat motionless. ''Do you think I'm crazy?'' Trask finally spoke to break the silence as he saw that his mentor had not moved a muscle since he finished his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I believe you...'', the old man slowly spoke. Trask was relieved, albeit puzzled that O'Connor did not ask a thing, it was unlikely of his former mentor who always want to know the details of everything. Then suddenly the old man vanished from his sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask was bewildered, either he was going crazy or there were really supernatural things happening around him. He was then surprised when a 30 something woman walked calmly inside the flat. ''... Because I have this power as well.'' the woman seemed to finish the old man's sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I could possess people, a thing which came in handy during my active years.'' the woman spoke after she had assured Trask that she was in fact O'Connor.'' But just that. The powers you described to me, seemed to be more advanced than my own, although I have no idea which one is stronger.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask was stunned.'' You remembered the Don case 35 years ago?'' the woman continued, which Trask just nodded.''I possessed one of the Don's mistresses to implant evidence against him.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But that's against the ethics!'' Trask protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah? If I had not done that, who knows how much more damage he would have done?'' the woman shot back. ''Sometimes you got to break some rules and be less idealistic. Everyone knew he was up to no good, but he was organized and handed out loads of bribes, he was untouchable by the law unless I could find some big evidence, something that could not be overlooked.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What if he wasn't brought to prison then?'' Trask questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'd possess his other mistress, crook or whoever and have him shot dead myself.'' the woman snapped coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask was silent, he did not expect this. ''Power tends to corrupt, and I found myself tempted to abuse it, just like the criminal you talked about.'' the woman continued as she looked at her manicured fingers. ''Sarah Edwards, 39 years old, divorced, no kids, works in Imagitech as a sales representative, American, ID number 89121231XXX, date of birth 29 July 1971.'' She then handed her purse to Trask.''Check it.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask went through various papers in there, her credit cards, ID all confirmed what he had heard. ''Once I possess people, I can access their memory, knowing everything that he or she knows. Enabling me to pass as them to gather the information I require.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then shuddered and went limp as suddenly O'Connor materialized beside her. ''Now you believe me?'' he asked in a barely audible voice. Trask, too stunned to say anything just nodded. ''Now get some smelling salts.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they waited for Sarah to regain her consciousness, Everything sank in Trask's mind. These supernatural powers were too real. ''Where am I?'', Sarah asked groggily,'' You fainted dear, it was lucky that this young man found you in front of your doorstep.'' O'Connor lied with a straight face as Sarah helped herself out. She thanked Trask although she could not remember what had happened and went to her flat, which was just next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Often times, I found myself tempted to pleasure myself in those bodies.'' O'Connor chuckled, seemingly lightening up a bit after the much grave talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And what did you do?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I just yielded to it, as long as I don't screw anybody's life, I felt entitled to do so.'' O'Connor smiled as he remembered his past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then entered his bedroom, only to emerge later with a smooth black stone of the size of a palm. ''I put my power in here, it's yours now, if you want it. I was going to give it you, but I never thought this fast.'' O'Connor beamed with pride as he made his way back to the couch with Trask's assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask hesitated, but he reached out and took the globe from the old man. In moments, he glowed and eerily dark purplish aura surrounded his body. ''Good, it accepted you, I can't see you now.'' The stone however dropped to the coffee table below it and cracked in two. ''Don't worry, the stone is of no use now.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Connor then taught Trask all that he knew and Trask practiced his new powers on the unsuspecting neighbors. ''It's for the good of the people.'', O'Connor assured Trask and it helped him to alleviate any guilt of the thought of invading others' privacy, minds and bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour days had passed and Trask had learned all that he need to know. He had worn all the bodies in the building and quickly scanned his body's memories to pass successfully as them as well as to extract important information. '' I've taught you all I can, now go and bring justice for the people.'' O'Connor said to Trask, who was currently in Sarah Edwards' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask could not show his real self much, as the police had found his car and confiscated it. Catherine had reported him to the police, and he became a wanted criminal, much to the delight of Carl. With his connection to O'Connor, now the police department would no doubt be putting watchmen in the building, just in case Trask would try to contact his former mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What about you?'' Trask asked as he fidgeted with Sarah's blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'll just live my days here quietly. Now stop that, if I get aroused anymore I might have a heart attack right here...right now.'' O'Connor gave a toothy grin,''Just give me a visit sometimes, it gets lonely here without my powers, I used to like going next door for some company.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask thanked his former mentor and he flew out of Sarah's body. The groggy Sarah woke up moments later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh dear, you seemed to have developed a habit of fainting in front of my doors.'' O' Connor said with a grin as Sarah blushed and quickly excused herself. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Momentarily, Trask rematerialized in the hallway in his own, pudgy, disheveled form, and he looked down at himself in disbelief. Possessing all of O'Connor's neighbors had been 'interesting' certainly, and it had given him experience with his new power, but he preferred being himself. The situation he now found himself in however would necessitate him having to 'hide' in other people until he could clear his name...somehow. Trask though...was the exact opposite of Carl, he found being in female bodies 'uncomfortable'. He admitted to himself that being in a woman's body (like Sarah Edwards') was definitely a turn-on, but Trask still had his conscience intact, unlike his nemesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a noise behind him, up the stairs, Trask decided not to linger in O'Connor's building, the cops would soon be there he knew. Briefly checking his 'tired' reflection in a nearby mirror, Trask neatened his hair and adjusted the collar on his shirt, then he walked out of the building. Once in the street, he looked around carefully, luckily all his years on the force had given him the ability to spot any cops who might have been on a stake-out. He seemed to be in the clear...so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transport!\" he muttered to himself, scratching his head, he wanted a car to get around town 'normally'. However he knew that his car was an impossibility because it had been impounded by the police. \"Here goes nothing!\" Trask sighed, before disappearing again. He floated towards the road and waited for an appropriate car to pass, a medium-sized, beige sedan...nothing too flashy. The driver, a young man (and father of two small children) named Robert Criel, knew nothing as Trask entered his body and took over control. \"Woah shit!\" Trask then blurted out, as he regained control of the car, narrowly avoiding hitting another vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey watch where you're going dickhead!\" the man in the other car shouted, as Trask drove away in his new 'acquisition'. \"Right, where the fuck do I start searching to find this asshole?\" Trask mused, as he drove the streets, trying to keep an eye out for any girls acting 'strangely'. For he knew that the criminal, whoever he was, would undoubtedly be in a girl's body, since he was a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would I go, where would I go?\" Trask repeated in his head, muttering in his host's voice as he tried to get into his rival's mind...as scaary a thought as that was. \"Oh no!\" the disgraced detective then grumbled...\"I'd go to a school!\" he sighed. \"Or...a strip club!\" he then shrugged. But he settled on the former, and Trask knew where most of the schools in town were, it would just be a matter of checking them for any 'odd' or even 'slutty' behavior from one or more of the girls present...he assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries!\" Trask tried reassuring himself, I got plenty of time now\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Trask drove off in the direction of the nearest school, Carver Elementary School (about four blocks from St. John's high school for girls). Trask slammed his foot on the accelerator to get there faster.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trask did not only learn a possession power, he had also exercised his own body in the time he had. As he materialized some blocks away, he looked slimmer and fitter as he used to be in his twenties. From a far he could spot cops, faces he could recognize. He harbored no hard feelings on them, they were only doing their jobs, even if that means to capture a person whom they had knew so well. Trask sighed, he need to find the criminal quick, before he ruined anyone's life any further, but to do that, he would need a body that he could use. With that in mind he floated towards the group of cops, in a cop, he would be able to search for anyone suspicious without a hindrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So you're going now Officer Hernandez?'' a cop asked his colleague which happened to be Lilly Hernandez. Trask hovered inches from her face, he remembered that Lilly had suspiciously asked for his personal details a week ago. He deducted that there were some fishy connections between these events. ''Yeah, my shift is up, I just wanted to find Trask. I know he is innocent, he has to be.'' the Latina frowned as she took off her cap and turned around to her police car. Trask followed her, he was quite uneasy at the idea, but to find out more about this criminal, he need to possess Lilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilly sat herself, Trask phased into her, an eerily purplish glow which seemed to disappear inside her navel. Lilly's eyes went dull, and Trask let out a sigh as he was now the one sitting down facing the wheel. Lilly's eyes shut as Trask delved into her mind, searching for her memory of a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much searching, he finally found himself inside the doughnut shop, he was viewing from Lilly's viewpoint, but he could not do anything as the scene unfolded. A criminal that he had known by the name of Carl Jason Edwards lied to her and gripped her shoulder tightly, then everything went black. Moments later, Trask, or rather Lilly woke up in the men's bathroom, her mouth tasted like cum. The officer then wondered how she got here before she left the place promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enough for Trask and he opened Lilly's eyes again. He knew who was responsible for all of this and he was not going to let it continue. He glanced down, inadvertently caught sight of his new boobs and began to question himself. Did he really possess Lilly to gain knowledge or for something else. He brought his hands in front of him, during his training, he had possessed various women, although Sarah Edwards was the one he possessed the most. However, he never possessed anything of this beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Lilly, you okay?'', a voice surprised Trask and broke him from his thoughts. Raymond Smith was leaning against Lilly's car. A senior cop, Trask had been working with him on a lot of cases. ''Uh, yeah officer, just wondering where Nick could be.'', Trask answered in Lilly's Hispanic accent, he was surprised as well to be able to speak like Lilly usually did. Raymond just sighed as he glanced away, Trask took this few seconds to put Lilly's hand on the steering wheel. ''He was a good guy, I'm not sure as well that he is guilty, but all the evidences are against him. Mrs. Catherine's report and sample DNAs of sperm found in her pinpoint to Nick. We have no other choice but to arrest him.'' as Raymond finished his sentence, Trask sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look, don't think too much about it'', Raymond spoke as Trask started Lilly's car.'' Take two aspirins and sleep well, you're relieved from this case.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask did not object, as it meant that he could have more time to look for Carl. He revved up the engine and drove off to Lilly's flat. It was situated quite close to a police station where he could access the database and it was getting dark as well. He used Lilly's memories as guide and after a good thirty minutes found the place where Lilly lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trask went in, he saw that it was good sized, spacious lounge with an equally ample room in the kitchen. Lilly's dainty fingers reached for the switch, just like countless time she did. Trask stepped inside and locked the door. He could remember from Lilly's memory about her master bedroom, big, with lots of photos and decoration, which he confirmed as he went inside her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask looked at a mirror, which reflected a well endowed Latina woman. He looked at his new body through the mirror, and felt like an alien. Lilly's hands then found themselves on her buxom, traced her curvacious figure and stopped on her shapely ass, as temptation gripped Trask like a hook. O'Connor was right, it was hard to resist the temptation of the power, but if he was not careful, he could become the demon that he had sworn to bring to justice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's okay, as long as you do not screw up their lives. We have a great power, we are entitled to enjoy it. Pent up desires are not healthy.</i> O'Connor's words rang in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask closed his eyes and took off Lilly's clothes, and inspected her body in her naked glory save for her panties which he left on. She had a knock out figure and face, and would easily become a model. In the past, Trask and a couple of interested male police had asked her, only to be answered with a curt smile. He knew the answer now. In the past a kind cop had helped her family, a family of illegal immigrants to settle into this country. So she aspired of one day to be like her hero, helping others in need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trask read her memories, he felt a bit of guilt and dressed Lilly back in her casual clothing, jeans and a shirt, which were lying neatly on her bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't at school because she was sick but Carl knew right away that she was only faking so she wouldn't have to go to school. \"Well this bitch would pay much more then she tough her little faking.

As much as Carl wanted to get out of the area, he was also curious what was creating the feeling he was getting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked outside of the building and crossed the street to a busy row of stores, where he realized the feeling he was getting was just becoming more powerful. Whatever the hell it was, it was close by. Carl looked around, trying to see if there was anyone unusual around him, but the only people he could see were some guys in their early twenties wearing business suits, talking to some girls who looked like they were from the local community college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Probably just some local business types trying to get an easy time in bed.</i> Carl thought, remembering that the new lawyers in town had been known for things like that. There were six of them in total. Three guys in suits and three girls, all of whom were dressed in rather revealing clothes thanks to the warm weather, which served to give the guys a nice view of their great assets. Nothing struck out about any of the six except that Carl could tell that the thing he was sensing was somewhere in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, how about we get to know each other a bit better in private?\" One of the guys asked. He looked like the youngest of all his coworkers. He was probably only 19 or twenty, one of the interns the law firms hired to do their boring work. He was a bit overweight and had a some hair growing on his face. The girl he was talking to looked like she was about his age, with long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, shining white teeth, and a face to die for. Her body had curves in all the right places, which were only accented by the fact that she was wearing a College Cheer Uniform, with its short sky blue skirt and tight sleeveless top that left her firm midriff showing for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I need to get to practice, how about another time?\" She asked, clearly annoyed by the guy. She started to turn and walk away when the guy grabbed her wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, please? I promise we'll have a great time together. Why don't you reconsider?\" He asked. Though nothing would look weird to any of the people around them, due to the girl facing the opposite direction, Carl could see the girls eyes become clouded over by a black smoke and her face go into a daze. Soon a smile grew on her face and she turned around to face everyone else again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I think I've just reconsidered, handsome.\" She said seductively and put her arm around the guy. He smiled at her and the two walked away from their friends. As they passed Carl, the guy looked right at him. Carl knew that was the power he was sensing. It was another like him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After turning back to where the other two girls were stood, Carl smirked when he saw the other two guys had left. \"Time to tail that slimeball!\" Carl uttered...as he sent clones of himself into the bodies of the two other girls, whose bodies convulsed as they were possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, her name's Sasha!\" the inhabited brunette (Kirsty) suddenly said, as she crudely grabbed her breasts and started squeezing them. \"The blonde chick...that's her name!\" the clone repeated. He had already searched his host's mind and knew everything about her and her friends, including Tanya, the other blonde who the second clone was now inhabiting. \"Damn this bitch is tight\" Tanya's body groaned, as the clone reached up her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut that shit out!\" Carl ordered his two duplicates. \"I want you two to follow that piece of shit and tell me where he goes\" he then grumbled. \"And no stopping off anywhere to finger fuck yourselves!\" he scowled at the possessed girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha boss!\" \"Tanya\" replied in her high pitched voice, as she stood in a very manly fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...what you waiting for, a fucking invitation? GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!\" Carl shouted, gesturing in the direction where Sasha and her 'admirer' had gone moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth 'girls' rushed past Carl, grumbling to themselves, and that left Carl standing there alone. He ducked out of the pleasant little alley they had been in and made his way into a store to buy some more cigarettes. Well...'buy'...maybe wasn't the right word. He picked a shop that had a cute teenage girl in glasses behind the counter. \"Can I help you sir?\" she greeted Carl enthusiatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you can honey!\" he grinned qickedly. He then exited his body (leaving a clone inside) and shot straight into the clerk's petite body...possessing her. He then straightened the glasses on his nose and peeked down his blouse. \"Ahh shit, not even a C-cup!\" Carl grumbled in the girl's timid voice. \"Oh well, can't win 'em all!\" he then shrugged, as he filled up a carrier bag with cigarettes and put a couple of bottles of whiskey on the counter, 'free of charge'. \"Go...go!\" he ushered his clone, and he watched his body leave the store with the stuff. Carl had time to shove one of the girl's hands down her pants and finger her pussy before his body returned. \"Thought so, still a virgin\" he laughed, withdrawing his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're done here!\" Carl stated firmly, before leaving the girl's body and entering his own. The girl slumped unconscious behind the counter and Carl just leaned over and smiled at her. \"Thanks for the smokes and the booze cutie!\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl then left the store and located where his clone had stashed the stolen goods.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carl couldn't remember the last time he had a chance to relax and think things over. Carl thought back to when he first got his powers, and finally ruining Trask's life. That had reminded him that he still hadn't known what had happened to the guy. Maybe he'd try to find out as soon as he knew more about this newcomer he had seen. After ten minutes of waiting, Carl noticed his two clones were walking over to him, still feeling up their host bodies, but this time their were two others walking with them. It was the other guy, and the chick he had sent one of his clones into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Carl.\" The brunette, Kristi, said. Carl just stared at the four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't look so surprised. We knew we were being followed right away, and overriding a clone is the simplest thing in the world.\" The other blonde, who Carl had also sent a clone into said, smiling at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry, we're not mad at you.\" \"Sasha\" said, \"We only want to talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, then why is it four to one?\" Carl sneered at the kid in the business suit, who just smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. That is pretty unfair of me. How about you pretty bitches leave us alone for a little?\" He asked, shooing them away. His clones wasted no time leaving the area. In the distance Carl saw their bodies collapse onto the ground. \"I never like having clone's inside people longer than needed.\" He said, before sitting down on the bench next to Carl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you're like me.\"  Carl said, looking at the slightly overweight young man. Even though he was dressed like one of the big financial guys, he was definitely no older than 19.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you're a career criminal names Carl John Edwards. When I override your clones, I got all of their memories, which means I know everything about you, Mr. Edwards.\" The kid said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't know anything about you. How about you even things out between us.\"  Carl demanded. The kid may be pretty experienced with his powers, but Carl could easily overpower him strength wise. The kid sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. My name is Sven. I'm 17 years old and go to high school in town. I have a side job interning for the firm to get some extra money. My family just moved here from a small town in America. Long story short, I touched something that fell out of the sky and got powers. I was just having fun, like usual when I saw your clones and checked out what was up. Now here we are.\" The kid, Sven, said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl could tell he was telling the truth, but that didn't mean he was completely honest. Carl had been a conman all of his life, and he could spot another a mile away. Maybe the two of them could make a good team.</span></div></div>",

Not taking his time to pick, he started sending copies of himself into the bodies of the people around them. First he possessed man in his 50's sweeping outside his store, then a chubby Latina woman...a 10-year old girl and her mother...a dumb looking blonde with big tits...a businessman...a geeky looking teen boy...a woman in her 60's...two college coeds...a male police officer...and a skinny red-headed woman wearing glasses. \"Okay...that's...1...2...3...that's 12\" Carl muttered as he clones all started checking out the bodies they occupied. Some were happier than others, but Carl didn't care, this was only a test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...keep going!\" the possessed 10-year old girl chuckled at Carl, as if giving him encouragement. \"Yeah dude, show this kid who's the best!\" the clone inside the girl's mother then mumbled as he groped his tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling...Carl then projected another clone into a young brunette woman wearing a grey skirt suit and black heels, she was taking a drink of water when she was possessed. Coughing a little, the clone looked down at himself and grinned. \"Woah...nice!\" he exclaimed. But seconds later...the grin disappeared and the woman's body convulsed...ejecting the clone and the woman just passed out on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya!\" Sven muttered smugly, as some un-possessed people rushed to help the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Carl grumbled. He hated when other people were right and he was wrong. \"Okay, you were right\" he admitted, quickly extracting his clones from the 12 other people and letting their unconscious bodies slump to the ground.

Carl had ordered a coffee and Sven just sat across from him and stared out the window at the Police Station. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny place for a criminal to eat lunch,\" He said to Carl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just say there's someone I want to check up on in there.\" Carl said.

Carl hated that the kid knew all about him, but decided not to waste time arguing about it. The kid clearly wasn't the type of person to use that information against him, or he would have already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right.\" Carl said. \"And since you know all this about me, and I know very little about you, how about you spill the beans on your past. I mean, if you know my whole life story and I only know three sentences about you, what good does that do me?\" Carl asked, hoping for the kid to explain himself some more while he decided how the two of them could best work together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I was born and raised in New York City and moved between different foster homes for most of my childhood. When I was fifteen, I finally got into a permanent home, but the people who took me in were career criminals, just like you. They taught me how to make a buck on the street without getting caught and that I could never fully trust anyone. A year later, they were gunned down by a police officer in front of my eyes. I don't blame the officer though, it was their own fault. I lived on the street for two years and then some British guy found me and offered to give me a home. I moved here a few weeks later, with a new life and everything. My first actual night here, I saw something drop from the sky and touched it. It gave me powers and now here we are.\" Sven said. He sounded honest enough but Carl could always tell a liar when he heard one. Carl just started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty funny kid. But do you honestly expect me to believe that load of shit?\" Carl asked. Sven just smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't but it was worth a shot.\" He said with a smile. Carl wanted to be mad at him for lying to him, but just wasn't. Sven kind of reminded Carl of himself as a kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'd better get home to my family. If you need me, here's my info.\" Sven said, writing down his contact information on the back of Carl's napkin. The kid only lived a few houses away from Trask and the chicks he had used to help get his revenge. That would be a fun way of getting to know each other better if Carl ever got bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven walked out of the shop and started walking, and Carl thought about what to do now. Maybe he'd finally see what had happened to Trask, or maybe he should just follow Sven home and see what he could find out about the kid that wasn't complete shit...</span></div></div>",

After glancing at the police station again through the window, Carl stood up and walked into the restroom of the doughnut shop. As Carl looked around, he couldn't help but have pleasant memories about the shitbox of a restroom. It was where Officer Lily Hernandez (with one of his clones inside her) had sucked him off. \"That bitch had a talented mouth alright!\" Carl chuckled, even though it hadn't been Lily operating her own mouth at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, can't be getting all fucking nostalgic, I've got shit to do!\" Carl then went into one of the cubicles, one where the lock was still working and he locked himself in.

The older of the two was a male who looked like he was around 35 with a ragged beard and dark brown hair. He was a bit on the bigger side, but it was more muscle than fat. The other cop was a young woman, probably around 23. If Carl had to guess, she had probably just graduated from the police academy. She had long red hair and a slender frame and a nice rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl wasted no time phasing through the roof of the car and right into the unsuspecting cop. Her body briefly spasmed to try to fight off Carl's possession, but it was useless. After a few seconds, Carl was in control. He smiled from the woman's body and he quickly rubbed his new boobs, pretending to fix his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you alright, Gwen?\" The man next to Carl asked. Carl quickly read up on his newest hosts memories. Her name was Gwen Summers and she was 22, years old, the youngest on the police force. She had always had a strong sense of justice, and wanted to catch criminals. The man next to her was her partner, Tommy Rayes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay Tommy, just got dizzy for a second. What were you saying?\" Carl asked innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just saying how horrible it was to hear about Trask. You never met him, but he was a great guy. It's a damn shame.\" He said with a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to him?\" Carl asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, his niece called us up awhile ago, scared out of her mind. She said her and a bunch of girls woke up naked across the street from where she lived and that Trask had come in screaming his head off. He thought they were all possessed by a demon or something. Had to be put in a psyche ward. Now there's even a rape accusation against him.\" Tommy said. Carl had to try his hardest not to scream in joy. Trask was finally finished, and it was all thanks to him. He had single handedly ruined the life of his long time nemesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's horrible. What happened to his niece?\" Carl asked, trying to keep up the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's staying with some friends next door. I feel horrible for her. No parents around, and now her Uncle locked away,\" Tommy said, \"Well, let's get onto our shift now,\" He continued, getting out of the car and opening Carl's door for him. Car briefly felt his breasts again before leaving the officer's body and flying across the street and back into his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in his body, Carl laughed as loud as he could. He had won. Trask would never recover from this. It was perfect. But what was their for Carl to do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carl was too happy to bother with him right now. \"Whatever dude, I don't even fucking care!\" Carl replied as he walked out of the dingy bathroom, a spring in his step. Heading for the exit, Carl took in a breath of fresh air as he stepped into the outside world again. He ironically began coughing a bit afterwards, years of smoking tampering with his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've earned an evening off\" he mused to himself as he noticed the setting sun.

Besides, he was due a bit of fun. And Carl knew how he liked his fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems good to me\" Carl told himself as he picked out a target. A young girl, possibly in her early 20's, was walking in his direction. She was a knockout, with a tight, slim body that had curves in all the right places. She had bright, auburn hair that flowed down over her shoulders. She was wearing a tight pair of jeans, along with a low cut floral top that gave a nice view of her generous cleavage. \"I think she'll do for the night!\" Carl told himself as he approached the girl. \"Hey hot stuff, whats a pretty young thing like you doing in a place like this?\" he began, chatting her up without a care in the world. \"Erm, do I know you? I'm waiting for my boyfriend anyway...\" she began. She had a hint of eastern European in her accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, screw that loser. I think you'd be better getting to know me anyway. Or vice versa\" Carl told her. She didn't have a chance to reply before Carl shot a clone into her body. She convulsed slightly before coming to her senses, Carl now firmly in control. \"Well this is definitely one way of doing that!\" the clone quipped, cupping his new tits with glee. Carl would never get tired of that outcome. It would be any bitch he wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where we headed dude?\" The clone asked.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy having fun with this one\u201d Carl noted, eyeing up his now submissive prey far more intently than before. The possessed girl kept fondling herself without a care as the clone enjoyed his new habitat. \u201cI think we should go back to her place. It\u2019s a nice little apartment, a bit less of a dive than our place!\u201d the clone chuckled as he rubbed his new snatch through his jeans. \u201cSeems like a good plan to me. I've gotten a taste for exploring new things\u201d Carl replied, groping his new toy on the ass as to confirm what he intended. The clone just gave a Carl like chuckle, sounding alien upon her sweet accented voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading Carl back to her car, the pair slumped themselves down in a very Carl-esque fashion. The young lady stretching with her legs wide open certainly wasn't feminine. Reaching for the compartment, the clone pulled out a pack of cigarettes, pinching one for herself before tossing them to Carl. \u201cShe smokes? Now that\u2019s my kind of girl!\u201d Carl exclaimed as he lit one for himself. \u201cWell they are her boyfriends, though their fucking ours now\u201d the clone laughed. He cupped the generous tits of his new host, signifying that not only was her boyfriend\u2019s stuff now Carl\u2019s, but she was too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this little numbers name anyway?\u201d Carl asked. \u201cPfft, like you care who it is your fucking\u201d the clone laughed. \u201cHey! Ever since I fucked the pigs niece and neighbors, I don\u2019t mind a little back story\u201d Carl smirked as he puffed on his cigarette. After a moment of accessing her memories, the clone spilled the details on his new host. \u201cHer name\u2019s Jessica. She was originally from Poland but her folks moved over here when she was little\u201d \u2018Jessica\u2019 began, explaining the accent. \u201cShe\u2019s 22, got a little part time job while she studies. Currently dating some smug prick working in an office. Seems like a right cunt\u201d. The harsh language towards her own boyfriend was definitely alien on Jessica\u2019s tongue.<br>\r\n\u201cWell like I care about him now. I just Carl about screwing this little number\u201d Carl quipped, giving one of Jessica\u2019s tits a quick fondle. \u201cWay ahead of you dude\u201d the clone moaned as he started up the engine. \u201cOff we fucking go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone sped up the car and began recklessly driving to Jessica\u2019s place, handling the car just like Carl did, one hand on the wheel whilst the other smoked his cigarette with Jessica\u2019s dainty hands. After a little while of speeding and traffic dodging, the pair arrived back at Jessica\u2019s place. The place seemed a bit more upscale than the average apartments in the area. Carl wondered if her boy toy was forking out for the rent. He\u2019d be a sucker to do so. Carl was definitely out of place here it seemed, a few of Jessica\u2019s neighbors giving Carl awkward looks as he proceeded upstairs with the svelte little madam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for fucks sake\u201d \u2018Jessica\u2019 suddenly cursed, digging out her phone and finding her boyfriend calling. \u201cProbably wants to know why we weren't there for work\u201d the clone murmured. \u201cJust feed him some bullshit\u201d Carl replied as they trudged up the stairs. \u201cHey baby. Sorry I couldn't pick you up today, I had to rush out. Had a bit of an emergency\u201d the clone lied, using Jessica\u2019s normally sweet and bubbly voice. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019m fine! You just go home and rest, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Love you, bye bye\u2026bleh\u201d the clone finished in disgust. \u201cI hate all that cutesy shit\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just smirked at his corruption of the otherwise innocent young girl. \u201cI fucking love these powers!\u201d he laughed as the pair approached her apartment. \u2018Jessica\u2019 opened up, waltzing in without a care in the world. Carl took a moment to observe his surroundings. The place was small but neatly kept, Jessica obviously very house proud. There was barely a thing out of place, with an assortment of cute little trinkets on the tables and dressers along with pictures of her and her man and friends on the wall. \u201cI wouldn't mind getting to know a few of those\u201d Carl mumbled as he observed the pictures of Jessica\u2019s friends scantily dressed on a beach somewhere warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis \u2018Jessica\u2019 was definitely different from the normal one however, slumping back on the neat sofa, kicking off her shoes and proceeding to stick her hand down her panties. \u201cFuck this bitch is wet\u201d the clone moaned as he proceeded to abuse his host\u2019s clit. Just watching such a sight was giving Carl a stiff erection. The sun was going down outside now, so he flicked on a small light as he approached the now masturbating clone. \u2018Jessica\u2019 was oblivious to Carl\u2019s presence, caught up in the sheer ecstasy of bringing her to orgasm. Carl quickly pulled his cock out of his jeans and grabbed the clone by his hair, pulling his body forward. The clone instantly took hold of his cock and began sucking on it intensely. Carl just produced a lopsided grin as he let the sexy young lady go to town on his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl spent the evening enjoying the company of \u2018Jessica\u2019, fucking her over and over again, experimenting with his powers as he enjoyed his perversion for sex. \u201cLife is just so much better now\u201d he mused to himself as he pounded away at Jessica\u2019s rear, causing cries of pleasure from the clone using her voice to echo throughout the room. He morphed himself and \u2018Jessica\u2019 several times, enjoying some lesbian sex in the guises of girls he\u2019d possessed earlier such as Charlene, Tammi and Chloe. Likewise, he morphed the body of Jessica, allowing the pair to frantically keep going at it until the earlier hours of the morning. At that point, they both pretty much passed out from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl awoke the next morning, alone in an unfamiliar room. He knew it was Jessica\u2019s, it just looked different in the daylight. Rubbing his head from the exhaustion he\u2019d experienced prior, he felt longer and straighter locks than his normal scruffy hair. Looking down and noticing his heaving chest, he realized that he\u2019d fell asleep Jessica O\u2019Neil, the milf from the school yesterday. He simply laughed it off as he morphed back into his regular form, his voice changing mid laugh back to his own sinister cackle. Walking out of the bedroom and into the main one, he saw the clone had made himself at home, kicked back on the sofa with some cereal whilst watching porn. He flicked at Jessica\u2019s clit before spoonful\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving fun there fucker?\u201d Carl asked as he noted how the clone made himself at home. \u201cSure am boss! I would have woke you but I realized you don\u2019t have this bitches body clock like I do\u201d \u2018Jessica\u2019 replied, her mouth still full from eating. \u201cWhatever, we got any bacon?\u201d Carl asked, his stomach now rumbling. \u201cYou can fuck right off if you think I\u2019m making you bacon\u201d the clone quipped. \u201cWhy the hell not?!\u201d Carl replied, seemingly arguing with himself. \u201cDude, you wouldn't be assed to make yourself bacon, neither am I\u201d \u2018Jessica\u2019 replied. Carl calmed down at the hilarity of it all. The clone truly had all his traits. Carl made him budge up as he spread himself on the sofa too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, I feel like stealing something today\u201d Carl told his duplicate in mind. \u201cWhat like some auto theft or that sort of shit?\u201d the clone replied. \u201cNah, we can go for bigger now. Much bigger\u201d Carl replied. \u201cI think I get where you\u2019re coming from\u201d \u2018Jessica\u2019 replied, a sinister smirk on her innocent face. \u201cYou should do, your me\u201d Carl replied, hitting \u2018Jessica\u2019 on the leg. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to rob a bank like we've always wanted?\u201d the clone asked. \u201cDamn right, I think it\u2019s time I stole some megabucks!\u201d Carl chuckled. He began to formulate a plan in his mind as he too munched on a bowl of cereal. Today would be a productive day for Carl\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl knew a bank just up the road from where he lived. It was a pretty well-known one in the town, with a lot of money exchanging through its doors every day. It would make for the perfect target. \u201cCome on, get dressed fucker, your dropping me down there\u201d Carl told his clone. \u201cAw, no fair! I was enjoying this bitch\u2019s body\u201d \u2018Jessica\u2019 replied, putting down her cereal briefly as she sunk further into the sofa. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t wait around, now move it!\u201d Carl ordered, pushing his clone off the sofa. \u201cYou\u2019d think differently if you orgasmed in her body\u201d the clone replied in a snarky tone. \u201cI did last night! Three times\u201d Carl reminded him, remembering the sensation he\u2019d had last night. \u201cWhatever!\u201d \u2018Jessica\u2019 replied, storming off into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just chuckled as he went to the bathroom and ran himself a quick shower. The sensation woke him up a bit more, though his adrenaline was already at peak anyway, the feeling of what would pretty much be certain success a gracious thought. He finished up fairly quickly, getting redressed and headed for the living room. The clone was still in the bedroom it seemed. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking you so long?!\u201d Carl shouted. \u201cOops, sorry, got a bit distracted when I stripped\u201d came the reply from the other room. \u201cStop fingering yourself and hurry up!\u201d Carl demanded as he switched off the TV. Eventually, the clone emerged clothed in a skimpy, floral summer dress with a matching hat and sunglasses. Clearly he hadn\u2019t bothered with a bra, Jessica\u2019s errant nipples poking at the fabric of the dress. \u201cHow do I look dude?\u201d the clone asked, striking a pose in order to tease Carl. \u201cYou like the sort of classy girl that needs a good fucking! But we\u2019ve got shit to do\u201d Carl replied, resisting the urge to strip Jessica\u2019s body down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mismatched pair headed downstairs, jumping into Jessica\u2019s car. Again, \u2018Jessica\u2019 sped off towards the bank, cursing at passers-by, cigarette in hand. Carl just enjoyed the chauffer service as he puffed away. Eventually, the pair drew close to the bank. \u201cBest pull up somewhere round the corner. Don\u2019t want little madam here to remember me\u201d Carl noted to his clone. \u201cGood point boss\u201d the clone agreed, pulling into a backstreet. The pair pulled up and the clone turned off the engine. \u201cDamn it, I\u2019m not keen on leaving this body!\u201d the clone sulked, cupping his tits for possibly the last time. \u201cIf you stop moaning, I\u2019ll find you a good looking bank clerk to finger fuck or something\u201d Carl replied, not knowing how annoying he could sometimes be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know who you\u2019ll pick when I see her. I\u2019ll be with you after all!\u201d the clone laughed in Jessica\u2019s sweet voice as she finished her cigarette and threw it out the car window. Carl just smirked at her one last time before extracting the clone, letting Jessica\u2019s body go limp as it passed out. He simply stepped out of the car and walked down the street towards his target destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, how to do this\u201d Carl thought. Normally he just made things up as he went along but this might take some thought. He knew there was a money exchange every two hours, which could allow him to simply take over the driver and speed off with the money. Or he could just walk in and take the place over, though it might prove complicated at a busy hour. He\u2019d have to pick his targets wisely within the allowed limit of 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does he got about it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI guess I\u2019d better do this slyly, there are far too many people to watch out for in bank of that size\u201d Carl noted to himself. Looking at the clock on the front of the bank, it told him that the time was only 1:30pm and the exchange probably wouldn't happen for around another hour. \u2018I need a temporary base of operations\u2019 Carl thought as he put his plan into motion. He briefly thought over why he\u2019d use such an elongated term for what was technically a hideout. It must have been something he picked up from one of the many people he\u2019d already possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, seems like a good place\u201d he smirked as he looked at a hairdressers salon directly across from the back entrance to the bank. He wasted no time in entering at getting to work. Having a brief look around, he saw that the place was only a small salon, with a little front desk, a sofa, and a few chairs for customers set up in the room in front of him. He also saw what were to be his targets. Sitting down closest to him on the sofa was a young Asian girl, looking roughly in her early twenties. She had a full, curvy figure, with a cute face, long black hair and a cushiony set of large tits. She wore a simple ladies t-shirt, jeans and a cardigan. She was the first to go, giving Carl an awkward look as the scruffy criminal eyed her up. It didn't last long however as her eyes began to cloud over with white mist as Carl moved on to the next targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the salon part of the room, there were another 5 girls. Two were customers, a nice looking girl in her early twenties, with brunette hair and a generous rack (he assumed her to be the girl at the fronts friend) who was just being shown how her hair had turned out in the mirror. She wore a low cut blouse, with a pair of slim fit jeans and expensive looking boots. The other was an older looking messy blonde, around the age of 30, with a slimmer figure than the other two and a nice appearance too her. She wore a simple t-shirt and jeans combination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the three hairdressers, the one dealing with the younger girl looked to be around the same age herself, with curly brunette locks and slim, trim body. The other was a slightly curvier black girl, in her late twenties, wearing stylish glasses and purple highlights in her straight black hair. The final girl looked to be in her late teens, tidying up any mess. She was a shy looking thing with a curvy body hidden beneath conservative clothes. She had short, blonde hair and a pair of less trendy glasses than her colleague. She was defiantly more cute than hot, something Carl would definitely corrupt. All the salon workers wore a white company outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl wasted no time in sending clones into all of them. They all ceased in what they doing, jolting slightly as their bodies were possessed. \u201cNice work dude, decent bitches!\u201d the brunette customer announced, jiggling his now generous mounds. \u201cEven got a virgin here!\u201d the shy blonde announced as he shoved one of her hands down her panties. \u201cRight, I think it\u2019s time to close for lunch don\u2019t you?\u201d Carl chuckled as he put his plan into motion. \u201cCouldn't agree more dude\u201d the curly haired worker announced as she went to the front, drawing the blinds and locking the door, turning the sign in the front to \u2018closed\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl spent the next hour keeping a window side vigil from the upstairs window, only peeking through the curtains as to avoid suspicion. The clones entertained themselves as they best saw fit, going at it upstairs in the kitchen, the place erupting into a mad, lesbian orgy. Carl alternated in girls from his perch, letting the curvy black girl ride his cock as he watched. Between the moans and grunts, Carl watched the clock. \u201cShouldn't be much longer now\u201d he muttered. The clone payed no attention, lost in sheer orgasmic bliss as he flicked his host's clit whilst riding Carl. He soon finished up, shooting his load deep inside the sweating babe. \u201cFuck that was\u2026intense\u201d the clone panted with her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I need to get ready\u201d Carl began as he pulled up his trousers. As he said this, the armored bank van pulled up at the traffic lights just down the road. He needed to make a split decision on how to go about the job. He could take a tour around in a new host and use it to future advantage or just take whatever money the guard came out with. The choice was his. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need you to get dressed and come downstairs, now\" Carl ordered. \"Awe, why me?!\" Chloe protested. \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t fucked you yet.

Does she have a car?\u201d Carl asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, it\u2019s parked out back\u201d the clone replied. \u201cGood. Right, I\u2019m going to possess the driver and take a look at how much money I can snag. You can look after my body in the meantime, make sure nothing happens to it. I\u2019ll shoot it a clone when I\u2019m done\u201d. \u201cGot it boss\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 replied as she picked up her clothes. \u201cRight, I have a job for you fuckers\u201d Carl addressed his clones before he headed downstairs. \u201cI want you all to stop with the fucking and squeeze as much money from this plan as you can. Empty any cash, bank cards and details, whatever, into the Chloe dudes bag\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood boss\u201d the black chick replied, pulling the curly haired salon worker away from the orgy she was currently in. Carl just laughed as he and \u2018Chloe\u2019 went downstairs into the main salon. \u201cRight, I\u2019m going to sit my body here out of sight. Just watch my body and make sure those fuckers do what you say, go it?\u201d Carl ordered. \u201cUnderstood dude. We\u2019re gonna be minted either way!\u201d the clone reply as she fumbled with her bra. Carl smirked before focusing, willing his spirit out of his body. Speeding his ethereal form out of the door, he looked across the road. The armored van had pulled up outside, the driver fiddling with an on-board system as he prepared to head inside. He was a man roughly the same age as Carl, though a lot more presentable, wearing tough riot gear to keep him protected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem, signing off\u201d the guard replied, hanging up the radio call as he prepared to move out. Before he could react however, he felt his body go numb and everything go black. When the guard opened his eyes, it was Carl in control. \u201cThank fuck he ain't immune!\u201d Carl cursed in his new voice. The guards name was Glenn and he\u2019d been in the service for around 10 years. \u201cSorry Glenn, but time to commit some crime!\u201d Carl chuckled. Stepping out of the van, he was great by one of the banks security guards before he could buzz on the intercom. He was an older looking gentleman, possibly in his early 50\u2019s as life\u2019s little weathers became evident on his face. Searching Glenn\u2019s memories, Carl found out his name was Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow it going Glenn, good day?\u201d Lee greeted him, shaking his hand. \u201cHey Lee. You could say it\u2019s been pretty eventful so far\u201d Carl replied, smirking in his manipulation of the situation. As Carl walked through the bank with Lee and bluffed his way through idle chit chat, his criminal instincts glanced around at the security system. It was all pretty high tech, designed to keep out even experienced bank robbers. \u2018Bet they never saw me coming\u2019 Carl thought to himself. Approaching the vault door, Carl tried to catch a sneaky glance as Lee punch in the door code. He managed to get the first two numbers, though he\u2019d have to get the others at another stage. He didn't want to risk using any more clones at the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vault was abundant with metal draws, each most likely containing thousands. Carl had to stop himself from gleaming with joy as he took a look around. Cameras in the vault meant he couldn't take any extra, though he\u2019d be walking out with more than enough. Lee unknowingly helped him load two cases full of money. All in all, they must have loaded around $200,000. Carl couldn't help but smirk. \u201cYou seem happier than usual today\u201d Lee queried, noticing Carl\u2019s upbeat approach to things. \u201cWell, you can enjoy the job sometimes\u201d Carl replied as he graciously took the money away. Moving it outside, they loaded the cases into the back and sealed the door tight. Carl thanked Lee for his help, for which he was generally truly grateful. The old man had just helped Carl pull off his biggest ever heist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the street, he saw \u2018Chloe\u2019 peeking through the blinds of the Salon. Carl nodded to her as he looked to the first floor. Concentrating, he extracted his clones from the other girls. He couldn't give a shit what they were doing, he didn't need them anymore. Shooting one back into the building, he waited a moment as he disabled all communication with the security firm from the van. Looking back toward the window, he now saw his own body give him a thumbs up. Carl started up the vans engine and waited a moment for his two lackeys to pull around. Surely enough, a little compact pulled up to the foot of the back road, Chloe driving with Carl in the passenger\u2019s seat. Focusing again, he morphed Carl into a copy of the Jessica girl he\u2019d fucked earlier, much to the clone's delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl pulled down the hand break and sped off, his clones in tow, far richer than he\u2019d ever been before. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl managed to get away with the van with a lot less hassle than he\u2019d originally anticipated. The traffic flow was fine, there hadn't been any suspicious signs and the clones had managed to keep in tow for the whole journey (despite the fact that they drove as recklessly as him). It was the perfect heist and it was soon to deliver the perfect outcome. Pulling into a discreet location beneath the freeway, Carl made sure to fully survey the area for any signs of being watched before he pulled up. Making absolutely sure the coast was clear, he pulled up the van into the shadows. It just about fit, with \u2018Chloe\u2019 and the other clone pulling up alongside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stepped out and took in a deep breath of fresh air. Thankfully, it was a lot smoother to do this with Glenn\u2019s lungs than his own. He had done what he set out to achieve however. And now he was significantly richer for the result. Walking over to the young girls car, clunking along in his padded clothing, he saw the two \u2018girls\u2019 feeling themselves up, as was the form for the copies of Carl it seemed. \u201cRight you, out of the car. I need help with these\u201d Carl ordered his clone, seemingly enjoying Chloe\u2019s form as he cupped her seemingly hefty tits. \u201cYou've got it boss\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 replied, shutting off the car\u2019s engine and stepping outside. \u201cAnd you, don\u2019t get too used to that, I\u2019ll need my body back soon\u201d Carl ordered the morphed version of himself. \u201cAwe, I was enjoying this form too\u201d the clone said in Jessica\u2019s accented voice, a hand firmly down in between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just rolled his eyes as he opened up the back of the van. Grabbing the cases with \u2018Chloe\u2019, he opened up the boot of her car and tossed them in, along with anything else of value the van had to offer. Closing the boot, both version of Carl had a satisfied and sinister look upon their host\u2019s respective faces. \u201cNow that\u2019s what you call a fucking result!\u201d Carl exclaimed, perfectly approving of the simplicity of the robbery. \u201cDamn right. Let\u2019s get this loot home now for some quality time!\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 added, cupping her tits as she indicated her frustrations to Carl. \u201cHold your horses, still got one last thing to do\u201d Carl noted, walking back up the passenger door. The version of himself currently morphed into Jessica was still having the odd fondle here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry dude, time's up!\u201d Carl notified the clone, instantly morphing him back into Carl\u2019s scruffy visage. \u201cDammit!\u201d the clone exclaimed as he was extracted. Carl then took a step back and let Glenn\u2019s body slump to the floor as he re-entered his own. Cracking his neck, Carl felt glad to be back home. He looked down at the unconscious body of his former host as he slumped back into his seat. \u201cThanks for the ride dude! Hope you enjoy prison!\u201d Carl said sarcastically as \u2018Chloe\u2019 drove them off. The journey home was a satisfying one for Carl, the feeling of success about him as his clone went about the reckless driving duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the pair arrived back at Carl\u2019s flat. After a few days away, it felt good to be home, even though he\u2019d been gotten better living accommodation in the past few days. This pit was his pit. The clone mirrored his sentiment, despite the fact \u2018Chloe\u2019 had never actually been to Carl\u2019s before. The two sat the cases and Chloe\u2019s bag on the table, opening them up to see how much money they actually had. \u201cDude, we\u2019re fucking minted!\u201d the clone noted in his host's sweet voice, echoing what Carl was thinking. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m minted\u201d Carl corrected him. \u201cOf course, I am you after all\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 winked, understanding where he was coming from. Emptying out Chloe\u2019s plush handbag, Carl surveyed the amount of cash they managed to steal from the salon. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fucking plastic?!\u201d Carl asked, wondering why his score was hampered. \u201cDude, it wasn't worth taking their cards, they\u2019d just cancel them anyway\u201d the clone replied. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can get when 6 of us hack the bitches minds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl simply grabbed a massive chunk of the cash and threw it in the air. \u201cFucking minted!\u201d he shouted, echoing what the clone had already said as he laughed manically. He was feeling in the celebratory mood now. He went to the fridge and pulled out one of his last remaining beers, cracking it open as he took a congratulatory swig. \u201cHey, what about me?!\u201d the clone asked in disappointment. \u201cFuck off, I have something better for you\u201d Carl replied as he set his beer down. Closing in on \u2018Chloe\u2019, he grabbed her dainty form and pushed her onto the table. Rather than resist, the clone just laughed as Carl went to work on deflowering the innocent young girl. \u201cBest. Fucking. Power. Ever\u201d Carl spoke as he began to tear \u2018Chloe\u2019s\u2019 clothes off and abuse her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an intense evening of fucking, Carl and his captured prize lay naked on his bed, a cigarette each in hand. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to put some of that money to good use!\u201d Carl noted as he took a drag. \u201cDude, with these powers, we don\u2019t even need money. We can take whatever the fuck we want\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 replied as she slipped a finger into her cum filled snatch. \u201cFuck, if she hadn't been penetrated before, she has been now!\u201d the clone noted, feeling Chloe\u2019s now sore pussy. \u201cThat other fucker fisted you earlier?\u201d Carl asked, remembering what the clone had said back at the salon. \u201cOf course, it was pretty kinky. You should have seen it but you were fucking the other chick\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 told him. \u201cOf course. I had to have a bit of fun\u201d Carl replied smugly. \u201cI would have fucked her for sure. Would have love to have spunked all over these big tits\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 replied crudely, licking her cute lips at the thought. \u201cGood job I did that to yours then!\u201d Carl laughed. \u201cI didn't know she have such a sweet little body\u201d. Carl observed her once more, noting her enticing breasts that must have been at least D-cup. The rest over her body had decent curves in the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying back once more, Carl truly felt content for the first time in years. His criminality could run wild now. The options were limitless. So what would he do next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl woke up early the next morning to an empty bed. As his eyes adapted to the early morning sunlight, he looked around the bedroom to see that Chloe was getting dressed back into her street clothes. \"What the fuck are you doing?\" Carl asked his clone, confused. If he had woken up so early in that bitch's body, he would have been masturbating his head off, not getting dressed. 'Chloe' turned to look at Carl with an angry look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a real piece of work, you know that?\" She asked as she finished putting her clothes back on. \"This girl was an innocent virgin, and you took that away from her. I may be just as bad as you when it comes to some things, but there's no chance in hell I would ever do this to someone. How can you not even feel guilty over this?\" she asked Carl in a scolding voice. It didn't take Carl long to realize what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, kid? You override one of my clones again? How the fuck did you even find me, Sven?\" he asked, angry at the lack of privacy he had but also curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have to ask? I could feel you a mile away. The two of us are like magnets for each other. I felt you and decided to drop by to say hello, but got a bit caught up when I found out what you did to poor Chloe here\" she said. \"Do you really get off from raping kids, dude?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, kid? This power is meant to be used to my advantage and I use it to fuck bitches like her. Besides, I would hardly call it rape. Trust me when I say that that little bitch was one eager customer\" Carl said, licking his lips a little. 'Chloe' just sneered at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, willing as long as your clone was in control of her. This girl is going to wake up soon with no memory of any of this. She won't have any idea what happened, but she'll know that she lost her virginity and that she'll never be the same. You really don't have a heart, do you, Carl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we can debate this all you fucking want, or we can end this discussion. I don't know about you, but I woke up feeling really fucking good. I have more money than I ever had before, and the greatest thorn in my side is now behind bars for a very long time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you still committing crimes? When will you have enough, Carl?\" she asked, still being defensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough will be enough when I say it is. I'll repeat myself one time, Sven. I was in a very good mood until you came here. You'd better leave right now if you want me to stay that way\" he said, practically growling at the kid who had stole one of his clone's bodies for the second time now. The possessed Chloe just shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, be that way. But I'm taking this girl away from here. If I see you trying to rape another girl this age, I'll stop you before you can\" she said to him, turning to leave the apartment. As she was half way out the door, she turned around. \"By the way, I came here because I have something important to tell you about our powers. Come find me in a few hours. If you concentrate on me, you won't have a problem feeling where I am\" she said, slamming the door behind her as she left the apartment. Carl watched her go with his fists clenched. That Sven kid seemed like he'd be very useful at first, but now the kid was starting to get on his nerves. Who the fuck did he think he was, Carl's conscience? His guardian angel or some shit? Still, the kid did have a certain look in his eyes. A look of someone willing to use others to get his way. Maybe Carl could corrupt Sven into a way of thinking more in line with his. That would certainly be fun. Even if Carl didn't, there was no doubt that he was very interested in what Sven had to say about their powers. Meeting up with him later would definitely be an interesting way to kill time, which he now had a lot of. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Carl and 'Chloe' were up bright and early (10am being early by Carl standards) in order to plan out another day. \"Fucking Wi-Fi!\" Carl cursed as fiddled with a tablet. He had swiped it from Glenn\u2019s van when he stole the money yesterday. \u2018Chloe\u2019 just munched on some toast, dressed on in her panties, her tits slumped across the table as she slouched forward. \u201cCheck the connection\u201d the clone said between mouthfuls of toast. \u201cFucking prick upstairs probably hasn't cleared his browsing history or some shit\u201d Carl noted as he tried using the open network someone upstairs. Carl thought about going to rob him, but it was too early for that. Eventually, he connected to the website he was looking for. It was an online banking application. Handing the tablet over to \u2018Chloe\u2019, he let her type in her details as she hacked her own bank account. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet, not a bad figure!\u201d the clone exclaimed as he handed the tablet back to Carl. She had just over 5k in her account, definitely worth Carl\u2019s plunder. \u201cWell let\u2019s head to the bank, make a cheeky withdrawal\u201d Carl chuckled as he relished in the thought of becoming even richer. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d \u2018Chloe\u2019 replied as she finished up her toast. After getting dressed and one cheeky blowjob later (Carl couldn't resist), the pair headed to the bank in Chloe\u2019s car. Pulling up, nearby Carl just waited for the clone to put on his best sweet act and swindle the money from the bank. He had a look around as he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing a few of the random pedestrians, a few targets caught his eye. A cop was on duty, having just left a nearby shop that at some point or another had gotten his window smashed in. The cop was just about to leave, giving some final info to the shopkeeper. As he prepared to turn away, Carl shot a clone at him. The officer froze momentarily before turning away from his cruiser and walking toward Carl\u2019s car. \u201cWhat do you fancy dude, pistol or taser?\u201d the \u2018officer\u2019 began, giving Carl a cheeky grin. \u201cBoth! I like to have my fun\u201d Carl demanded. The officer reached into his holster and pulled out both the taser and a colt pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl felt over the gun briefly, admiring the weapon before throwing it onto the back seat. He looked around to have more fun as \u2018Chloe\u2019 hadn't returned yet. Looking to the corner of the street, he saw a group of school kids hanging out, most likely bunking off as they still had their uniforms on. Two boys were seemingly trying to court two girls, the girls not seeming interested though still finding this better than school. \u201cHey dude, check this out\u201d Carl said to his clone as he focused. Concentrating, Carl began to morph the bodies of his unwilling subjects as all four of them changed. The two boys lost their height advantage whilst the two girls gained some. The two boy\u2019s skin color changed from black to white and vice versa for the girls. Both parties continued to change until they had become copies of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls screamed, the sound seeming strange with their new masculine voices. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I\u2019m a gross guy!\u201d one of them shouted. The other broke into tears, distraught at the situation. The two boys in the meantime began to feel up their new bodies, shocked but amazed as they groped their new found developing melons. Carl and his clone laughed at the peril unfolding before them. As they chuckled away, \u2018Chloe\u2019 returned and got back in the car. \u201cWhat are doing?\u201d the clone asked, confused. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll tell you in a minute\u201d Carl replied, wiping away a tear of laughter. \u201cWhat did you get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Chloe\u2019 pulled out a big clip of money. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me take it all, so I have about 3k there\u201d the clone told him. \u201cGood enough\u201d Carl noted. Eventually, he released the police officer, letting him slump to the floor next to the car. As they drove off, Carl leaned out of the window and shouted at the kids. \u201cHave fun getting to know each other you little cunts!\u201d Car cursed as he wound them up. He laughed manically as \u2018Chloe\u2019 drove off. \u201cSo what now dude? We keeping this bitch?\u201d the clone asked, signalling to his cute little host. \u201cHmm, well she has been good to us but I don\u2019t know\u201d Carl pondered. \u201cShe\u2019s got some hot friends. I can take you to them if you\u2019d want?\u201d the clone replied as he scanned her memories. \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Carl mused as the thought appealed to him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her aunt also owns a tidy little beauty salon.\" the clone answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sounds like fun, salons, clothes stores, plenty of bitches to have fun with, both staff and customers\" Carl nodded, drawing nicotine into his lungs. \"Lets head to the mall first, get the two in the clothing store. What are their names?\" Carl grunted to his clone, as he casually ran his hand up Chloe's thigh, reaching in between her legs as his clone kept driving the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie and Claire. Natalie's a short blonde, permed hair, perky tits, very girly type, and likes to party.\" Chloe smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Claire?\" Carl inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's more 'reserved' you might say, from what I can tell from this bitch's memories,\" Chloe explained, \"she's taller, about 5' 9\", bit on the skinny side and has bobbed brunette hair, mid-neck length. She wears glasses, and she has small tits, but um... that shouldn't be a problem for you with your power boss\"\" she added with a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck you waiting for then, get us to the mall, I'm getting hornier by the second here\" Carl muttered, cigarette in his mouth as he flicked through the wad of bank notes his clone had stolen from his host's bank account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe slammed her foot on the brake pedal and screeched the car to a halt, before quickly putting it in gear again and speeding off towards the mall, narrowly avoiding several other vehicles. \"Hey bitch, watch where you're going huh?\" a woman shouted out from one of the cars, causing the clone-possessed Chloe to slam her foot on the brake again almost immediately. Both she and Carl then glared at the woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna move the damn car?\" the woman sighed as she stepped out of her car for a moment in frustration. She was a brunette woman in her early 30's, 5' 7\" tall, with her hair held back by a butterfly clip. She wore designer glasses and had a pretty decent body. Her breasts were a large C-cup and she was dressed in a red blouse, a black pencil skirt, tan hose and a pair of black patent pumps with heels that boosted her height to 5' 10\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just grinned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They'll probably be looking for her after she was the only one missing from that salon yesterday\" Carl planned as he thought ahead. \"Good point boss. So how we doing this?\" 'Chloe' asked as she continued to drive. \"Show me where her friends live and then we'll ditch this bitch\" Carl replied as he lit up another cigarette. \"Let do it then!\" the clone replied chirpily in Chloe's sweet voice, speeding off on another high speed car journey again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the pair came to a more suburban neighborhood, certainly less congested than the inner town. As 'Chloe' entered one of the smaller streets, she suddenly pointed out a house. \"There! That's where they live\" the clone told Carl, signalling out the location of her two friends. \"Hmm, so Jemma and Louise are my next victims then?\" Carl smirked as he thought about who he'd enter next. The clone had given a brief description to Carl about who the pair were. Their names were Jemma and Louise respectively, best friends who, along with Chloe, all studied together. They had bought their own place after falling out with some flatmates. Jemma was 19 whilst Louise was 22. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into a dark alley a few blocks away, Carl couldn't resist fucking the innocent Chloe one more time before he let her go. The car rocked back and forth as Carl pounded her on the backseat, pulling at her hair as he grinded into the young girl. Though the clone was in pain from the intense fucking, he laughed along in her sweet voice, showing no remorse for his host, just as Carl didn't. Eventually, Carl came deep inside the young girl and she lay back onto the seat, exhausted. He quickly composed himself before withdrawing the clone and leaving Chloe unconscious  and exposed on the back seat of her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back up the street, Carl retained his confidence as he walked up to the door. Ringing the bell, he only had to wait a moment before one of the girls answered. From what his clone had described, it was Jemma. She was shorter than Chloe, at around 5\"5 though much curvier and far prettier. She had a generous set of double D's and a cute appearance and blonde hair. Her face quickly soured as she saw Carl however. She barely had time to let out a 'who are you?' before Carl shot a clone into her. A brief moment later, the girl was feeling up her own body, the clone content with his new home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl sauntered in and kicked back on the sofa without a care in the world, the clone now in Jemma doing likewise. Eventually, Carl heard a voice. \"Who's here Jemma?\" Louise called out. \"Come on down and find out for yourself!\" 'Jemma' replied back, her shirt now unbuttoned as she fondled her generous melons. Louise began to waltz down the stairs to meet their guest. She had clearly been getting ready, dressed extravagantly in little black dress that showed off her slim form. She wasn't quite as curvy as Jemma though she was still pretty sexy, with flowing red hair her most recognizable feature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl simply rubbed his hands together as he jolted out of his body and moved in on his new victim. Louise barely had any time to question why a strange man was kicked back on their sofa and why her best friend was fondling herself before she saw nothing but darkness. Her body shook on the outside as Carl took over. Eventually, she began to regain her senses as Carl now surveyed the world from his new perspective. \"I never get tired of this shit!\" Carl exclaimed in his sweet new voice, shoving a hand up his dress in order to rub his pussy. \"Best feeling ever eh?\" 'Jemma' replied, her tits now in full view as she began to unbutton her jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl just smirked with his hosts new face as he marched on over. Pushing 'Jemma' back into the chair she occupied, Carl forced himself upon her, sticking his new tongue down her throat as he went to town on his new captive.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Louise' definitely hadn't made evening at her friends place she first anticipated. Her crush most certainly wasn't seeing her tonight either. Instead, her pretty black dress had been kicked off like common rags as her housemate and best friend, now controlled by a horny clone of Carl, had proceed to eat our her pussy. The two had been fucking for well over an hour before Carl called time on the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...fucking intense\" Carl gasped as he laid back into Louise's bed, still rubbing his clit as the clone in Jemma now savored her taste as he lay besides him. \"She tastes great, that's for sure\" 'Jemma' blurted out, savoring the taste of her 'friend'. \"Hmm\" Carl wondered before leaning over to snog the face off of Jemma. The taste was most certainly still evident. \"Guess your right again me!\" Carl laughed as he knew the clone thought exactly like him. It was now around 9:30pm. Carl kicked back and reflected on how successful the day had been. He'd certainly had his fair share of fun. Now it was capped off by another night having his own brand of fun with two lovely young ladies. Both with a few mental modifications of course, courtesy of Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at his clone, he noticed he was still fondling Jemma's impressive tits. \"Don't you ever run out of energy?\" Carl gawked, wondering how the clone still could go on after that. \"This bitch is hyper dude! Besides, with a body like this, can you blame me?\" 'Jemma' chuckled. \"Point well made\" Carl replied, pinching Jemma's ass as he reveled in his fun. All of a sudden, Carl heard a vibration on the desk next to the bed. Rolling over, he found it to be Louise's phone receiving yet another text message. \"I wish this dude would fuck off, he's like a fly on shit!\" Carl cursed, noting it was this supposed crush once more. \"Just turn the phone off\" 'Jemma' replied. \"I would but I'm still to read that text from that cute little number Chloe\" Carl told him. He had received a message earlier, no doubt her crying from waking up naked in the back of her own car. Carl just giggled at the sinister thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which\" 'Jemma' suddenly interrupted. She grabbed a remote on her side of the bed and turned on the rooms TV. Switching it to the news channel, the main story was focusing on a series of blackouts among the citys residents, adding the events of yesterday, including a bank robbery and the disappearance of a Salons finances to the timeline, which started at an all girls school across town. Both Carl and his clone laughed hysterically at their work, finding their handiwork a joke as for once, it was other people suffering but him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a fucking smoke man\" Carl suddenly exclaimed. Rooting around for cigarettes however, he found he had run out. \"Fuck! This is why I don't like sharing with you clone fuckers\" he cursed in frustration. \"Don't blame us! You made us this way\" the clone in Jemma replied defensively. \"True. I guess there are downsides to me being the best company ever\" Carl joked. \"Still, smokes are needed. Lets go find a shop or some shit\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, the one on this road is closed now. It's nearly 10\" 'Jemma' replied as she sat watching the news. \"Fucks sake. We could rob it I guess. But I'm pretty comfy here\" Carl noted as he brushed some of his ginger hair from his borrowed face and looked down over himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he decide?           </span></div></div>",

From 'Jemmas' twitching, Carl could tell his clone felt the same way, despite being a little more obedient about it in front of his original. \"Right, fuck this. Get some cloths on, we're going to get some shit!\" Carl cursed in his hosts otherwise sweet young voice. \"Sounds good to me boss!\" 'Jemma' replied, smirking at the idea as she began to gather some clothes. Carl just flung open Louise's wardrobe and began to pick out some easy clothes. He simply slapped on a pair of jeans, the only looser fitting kind on offer compared to her regular tighter ones, and an old shirt. Carl didn't bother with a bra as he wasn't bothered with the fumbling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the clone in Jemma had redressed herself, the two headed out of the door. Using he girls memories, the two Carl's managed to find their way down the street to the shop in question. It was just a little convenience store on the corner but it had everything they needed. \"How do we get in then?\" the clone asked. \"Like this\" Carl began. He picked up some solid litter from the ground and proceeded to throw it at the upstairs window. 'Jemma' joined in, picking up a small stone and lobbing it upwards. It collided with the window and made a large thump. The two 'girls' ducked out of sight as someone came rushing to the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly Asian man appeared at the window, eyes bulging as he attempted to find the people attacking his property. \"Quick, add him!\" the clone in Jemma hissed as she watched the old man look in their direction. Carl looked up and felt another entity break off of him. It shot up toward the old man and froze him solid as a clone took over. Eventually, the shopkeeper turned to face them and signaled that he'd be down in a moment. Carl and his lackey waited patiently by the back door until at last, the shopkeeper appeared. The clone in control stroked his thick, black mustache as he eyed up his companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in ladies, we're open at any time for your needs\" the clone chuckled, Carl's gruff tone coming through in his Indian accent. \"Thanks me!\" Carl quipped as the pair entered through the back. \"There's a wife upstairs you may want to silence. Thankfully their son is away at university, though there is a decent 17 year old daughter asleep upstairs\" the 'shopkeeper' explained. \"I'll deal with them then, you two grab some decent shit. Smokes are essential, though throw in some food and drink. May as well why we're here!\" Carl ordered the pair. The clones both nodded in unison as they went into the main shop downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl crept upstairs slowly, trying not to draw the attention of the concerned housewife upstairs. She was waiting for her husbands return inevitably it seemed, so the sight of a young, white girl certainly confused her. She didn't have much time to react however before she seemingly blacked out. On the outside however, her body behaved very differently. \"Bit past the expiry date to be honest!\" the clone joked as he surveyed the form of the Indian housewife he has acquired. \"Whatever dude, you can go help out downstairs if you want. Where's the daughters room?\" Carl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just at the end of the hall there\" the clone replied. With that, 'she' headed downstairs to raid her own shop as Carl crept up on her daughters room. Slowly creaking the door, Carl surveyed the dimly lit room and found the girl sleeping in her bed just next to the door. She seemed like a decent type, with a cute face that still maintained a hint of innocent. \"Let's have a better look\" Carl muttered as he released another clone. The girls body began to spasm somewhat as Carl sat at her bedside and lifted off the covers. The girl had a nice body, slightly more heavyset than his own current host but with some nice curves in place and a generous set of double d's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl climbed on top of her as the girl's body came back to it's senses. Looking up, the clone saw Louise's body mounting his form form. \"Bit kinky eh boss? Want to know her name?\" the clone asked with his new, timid voice. \"I really don't give a fuck, lets just have some fun for now\" 'Louise' answered as Carl began working his way into her pajamas. He proceeded to go to town on the young girl, exploring her body as the clone gleefully played along. \"Those are good blowjob lips. If only I had a cock!\" Carl laughed as he finished making out with the young girl. \"You'd be surprised. Besides, you can always fix that!\" the clone replied as she cupped her now exposed melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point me!\" Carl replied as he began to lower Louise's jeans. As he concentrated, he watched a large bulge began to appear in Louise's panties as he morphed his cock and balls onto her form. Once he was finished, he flopped it out for all to see. \"Now suck me dry you slut\" Carl ordered. The clone was more than happy to take it in as Carl began to face fuck her. The clone worked his cock quite expertly, leading Carl to believe she'd done this before. 'Bet mummy and daddy don't know' Carl thought as he felt himself draw close. Eventually, he pulled out of her mouth and marked her face with his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's fucking hot\" Carl noted as he watched the clone lick up the remains. Eventually, he got her to clean up as he morphed his hosts body back to normal. He took her name, Jasmine, for future reference if he ever wanted to use any of her and her friends for his purposes. With the girl now curled up in bed again, Carl released his clone and headed back downstairs to check on his clones progress. They were waiting for him evidently, a few bags of stuff lined up on the floor along with some money out of the table. \"Took your time, I knew you wouldn't be able to resist\" the 'shopkeeper' exclaimed, noting Carl's lengthy absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you'd know!\" Carl laughed. \"What have we got then?\"<br>\r\n\"Plenty of smokes, some decent beer and a few snacks\" 'Jemma' replied. \"I swiped you the hard cash from the register as well\" the 'wife' replied, holding up the wad of cash. \"Nice work me's! I think we'll take our leave now\" Carl commanded. He let the owners head back upstairs before extracting them and gleefully heading back 'home' with 'Jemma' in close contact. As they rounded the corner once more however, 'Jemma' suddenly stopped dead. \"Dude, look who the fuck it is!\" the clone exclaimed, keeping her voice quiet at to not draw attention. The surprise factor caught on as Carl caught a glimpse of who his clone was referring to...   </span></div></div>",

The woman, a petite redhead with a gorgeous figure, then shook her head and grinned as she looked down at herself and admiring the short black dress, white sash and white high heel sandals she had on. \"Now this one is nice!\" Sven's clone commented in the woman's voice, causing her boyfriend to ask if she was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, shame the same can't be said for you\" the clone answered the man, before kneeing him in the nuts and punching him in the face. \"I'm tired of you, you've got a small prick and I've decided I'm going home with this hunk!\" Sven's duplicate then laughed, as he clicked up to the real Sven in the woman's heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you just ain't got it buddy, I'll take care of her for you!\" Sven then winked to the man writhing in agony on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked home together, Sven admired the sexy body his clone now inhabited, and the clone enjoyed the attention from...'himself'. \"You're in for a treat,\" the clone told Sven as he fidgeted a little and adjusted hist host's knickers in the street, \"this chick feels like she's really tight. I guess her boyfriend did have a small prick\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know!\" Sven grinned, as they disappeared into his apartment together for a night of 'pleasure'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike Carl, Sven actually had a conscience and really felt bad about it. He'd have to do something for the guy another day to make up for it. He didn't know how Carl could handle ruining peoples lives without a second thought. Maybe it was just in his genes or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look babe, I want to have my fun with you and everything, but I think we could have seriously ruined that guy's life in some way. I don't want to feel bad about hurting him, and doing his girlfriend too.\" Sven said. His clone nodded in agreement. They both felt bad about it at least a little. Sven didn't even know what made him possess the chick in the first place. Maybe after seeing Carl's memories he wanted to be more like him, but at the same time, he didn't want to hurt other people too much. Having fun with a few girls he had met at a party was one thing, but taking a girl who was clearly walking and having a good time with her boyfriend and not only bringing her home, but also physically hurting the guy was just too much. His days of hurting people were over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly removed his clone from the girls body, who quickly ran back to her boyfriend, clearly worried about him. Sven continued to walk home. Since it was night time, the houses he passed were all dark inside, except for the Trask's house, which was surprisingly lit. <i>I guess Sarah's having trouble sleeping,</i> Sven thought to himself. He always liked Sarah Trask. She was the first person he had met when he moved to town, and she was a nice girl. Even if she was only 14, well 15 now since her birthday passed, she was still very mature. Not just physically, but mentally too. Sven had already started to think of her like a younger sister. when he first got his powers, she was the first one he tried it on. He'd started to have a lot of fun in her body, but stopped when her memories told him that that Sarah had  crush on him.  That had just made things awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if he should go knock on the door to make sure she was okay but decided not to. Whatever happened was her own business, and he was sure he'd find out about it eventually. Sven couldn't help to think of Carl, who seemed to have no problems ruining other peoples lives to get what he wanted and wondered if he had anything to do with this. Carl was a disgusting man, but Sven had to put up with him as a partner, not only because they both had powers and it was best to stay on his side, but also because he needed to find out for sure if what his dad had told him before he deserted his family was true. If Sven's real father was a criminal named Carl Edwards. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He let out a sigh as he sat up on his bed and rested his head in his hands. The last thing he wanted to do was end up like Carl...to behave like Carl, even if he did turn out to be his biological father. He hated the guy and what he did to innocent people without hesitation or guilt, and nothing would change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven fixed himself a cup of coffee and then sat down in front of the TV drinking it. He turned on the local news channel and listened to all the murders, rapes and robberies that had taken place recently. With another despondent sigh, he couldn't help but wonder if Carl was responsible for any of them. There was quite a bit of coverage about women and girls going missing and other being found unconscious in various parts of town, and Sven knew that at least some of that was definitely Carl's handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asshole!\" he muttered to himself, switching off the TV and finishing off his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock on the door, and in walked Sven's brunette neighbor, 45-year old Cindy Watson, wearing a floral-print dress and a pair of white flats. She was a handsome (if exhausted) woman, mother of two kids who had left home and she was a widower who suffered from migraines and a bit of arthritis in her back. \"Hey!\" Sven greeted her as she walked through the door. \"Anyone try to break in while I was gone?\" he then asked Cindy, or rather the clone he had put inside her yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy took a lot of medication for the pain she was in and was often asleep for most of the day, so Sven saw no harm is using her body now and then for one his clones. There had been a lot of break-ins recently and Sven wanted to try and catch the guy responsible. \"No, all quiet last night!\" \"Cindy\" responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sven nodded, feeling relieved, \"Go and put Cindy back in bed, I'll extract you in a minute\" he told his clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" his dutiful clone responded with a nod, before turning and walking out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven then walked over to the window and looked out into the street, wondering how to start his day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sven headed out from his house and decided to just walk around the street, not really wanting to do anything in particular. He lived in the house by himself, since his mom had died a few months ago, and the man he thought was his dad had left him. Getting the house was pretty easy when he could just send a clone into the person selling it to give it to him for close to free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out of his house and got to the side walk he took a deep breath in. Sven had always loved nice days, especially nice Saturdays where he could just relax and take in the day. Carl would no doubt try to find Sven sometime during the day and want to talk with him, but Sven didn't care. That man was the last thing on his mind right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven walked down the block, but stopped when he saw Sarah's house. Sven wondered if he should drop by to say hello and see if she needed anything. Sven thought he had seen her uncle's name in the paper earlier, and Sven wanted to make sure everything was okay. Sven walked up to her door and knocked a few times. Before long someone opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can I help you?\" asked the girl who opened the door. Sven instantly recognized her as Charlene Robbins, who went to the community college and was Sarah's neighbor. He knew the two of them were good friends, and Charlene had spent the night at Sarah's house a lot when her uncle wasn't around. She was wearing a tight black crop top and black leggings that fit her amazing body perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm a friend of Sarah's. I thought I had heard something in the paper about her uncle and wanted to see what had happened.\" Sven said. The girl just looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah's resting right now, but I guess I can tell you what happened. A while ago, Me, some friends, and Sarah had all woken up naked and feeling abused in my house. None of us had remembered what happened and we were all terrified. Then Catherine, who lives next door came saying she remembered getting raped by Sarah's uncle. He was a good man and we all thought he couldn't have done anything, but then he came back trying to attack us for being possessed or something. He's in a mental hospital now.\" Charlene said, looking terrified about remembering the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may not have known what happened, but Sven had a pretty good idea. There was only one way to find out for sure though. Sven quickly concentrated on willing himself out of his body, and instantly felt himself separate. a split-second later, his own body dropped to the ground and he was in his spirit form. Charlene freaked out and knelt down to pick him up and see what was wrong when Sven took his chance. He quickly phased into her body and felt a rush as she surrendered control to Sven.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Charlene has a great body,\" Sven said to himself, as he briefly felt over his sexy new form. Sven may not have been like Carl in the sense that he would ruin a girl's life, but he didn't mind having his fun when he could. <i>No, down to business,</i> Sven thought as he read through Charlene's memories. Sure enough, one of the last things she remembered was Carl sneaking up on her from the back of her car. The memory was hazy and it took Sven forever to find, but once he found it he knew who was responsible for all of the things that went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven clenched Charlene's fists and thought he was about to punch something. Carl could have destroyed Sarah's life. Sven couldn't take it. He had to do something about Carl if he ever had the chance. His father or not what he did was wrong. But to get to Carl he would have to pretend to be Carl's partner. He would have to act like Carl, and Sven wasn't sure if he could do that, but whatever happened would all be for the best in the end. He'd keep getting close to Carl until he was trusted completely and then confront him about both what he did to Sarah and about being his dad. Carl's time would come, but not for awhile. The question was what to do right now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sven then gazed at her motionless body and pulled the front door shut, leaving her to wake on her own. Sven just kept repeating to himself in his head that he wasn't like Carl..like his father. As nice as it felt being in a girl's body, Sven respected his hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, where would that pervert be hanging out at?\" Sven wondered, thinking of all the 'attractions' in the town that Carl may have gone to. As uncomfortable as it felt, Sven tried to put himself in Carl's place, thinking where he would go for some 'fun'. And the first thing that popped into Sven's head was 'strip club'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue Minx was the local club for all the guys to go and slip dollar bills into slutty girls' panties, and Sven knew where it was. \"Good as place as any to try!\" he shrugged, setting off in the direction of the seedy establishment. Along the way Sven carefully studied all the attractive young women and teenage girls he passed, to see if they were acting 'out of character', but none of them it seemed, were. <i>\"I bet he overslept after a busy day abusing his hosts!\"</i> Sven grunted angrily. Arriving at the Blue Minx, Sven looked over the facade of the building and it wasn't impressed. \"What a class joint!\" he mumbled sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then approached the bouncer on the front door and chatted with him a little, seeing if he had seen someone matching Carl's description...OR...any girls who were acting weird or kinda 'masculine'. The answer was no to both questions. \"Alright, well...er...if you do see anything, I'll be inside\" Sven told the guy as he slipped him a $20 bill. The bouncer just nodded and let Sven enter the club.There was an R&amp;B song playing loudly inside, and from what Sven could see there were three girls dancing around their respective poles, reacting to the wolf whistles and howls of the drooling losers stood around their platforms. The first girl had blonde pigtails and was dressed like a schoolgirl, wearing a skimpy white blouse, a loosened tie, a short plaid skirt, white knee socks and a pair of ankle-strap stiletto pumps. The second girl was black, and was attired in a fake police uniform of sorts, name a low-cut velour top with police logos, tight black shorts and black patent, knee-high stiletto boots. And the last girl, a redhead, was dressed as a french maid, her skimpy black dress and white apron were complimented by fishnet stockings and  black suede, 5-inch heel platform pumps. All three of them were very versatile and 'blessed' in the breast department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh baby!\" Sven muttered, as he tilted his head a little. <i>\"Yeah I'd say this is a good place to wait for him\"</i> he thought. Sven then got himself a drink and sat down at a table that was near the 'action', and there he waited.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just after he had a sip of his drink Carl walked into the place and looked around for a suitable host, which he quickly saw in one of the strippers. Before Carl had time to make any moves, Sven walked over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look who it is. Aren't you a bit young to be in this place kid?\" Carl asked, but Sven just smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a bit too smart to go to a strip joint? Anyone who knows you would know where to look to find you.\" Sven said, cockily. Carl just looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I stopped by your house earlier, but you weren't around. You do have some very hot people on that street of yours though. How about we talk a little more outside?\" Carl offered. Sven gladly accepted. The less time he spent in a place like that the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't mean to sound rude or anything, but why is it you're like this? Why are you so cold hearted?\" Sven asked, honestly curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story. Most of it goes back to a certain asshole of a cop I just ruined.\" Carl said, clearly referring to Trask. Sven had met him a few times when he was with Sarah, and had always thought he was a nice guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay then. So what do you want to do?\" Sven asked, just wanting a break from boredom. He'd need to let Carl be the boss for awhile before letting Carl know what it was he had really wanted to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a pretty good idea...\" Carl said, staring at a group of girls walking across the street from them. Sven had recognized them as members of his high school's cheerleading team, who were on their way to weekend practice at the school. Carl kept looking at them and eventually looked back at Sven. \"What are we waiting for? Let's get some new bitches...\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's half the fucking fun!\" Carl told Sven, who folded his arms and stayed firm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, you can send your clones into them and they can feel them up, but we're not screwing any of them, they're only teenagers, and I know them!\" Sven explained. \"If you send clones into them and try to have sex with them I'll just override your clones with my own\" he warned Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, but I'm gonna personally spend time in one of them myself, I don't see why my fucking clones should have all the fun\" Carl grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven just shrugged. \"Fine by me, but first we need to go somewhere less public, we can't have your body just slumping down on the sidewalk now can we\" he said. As he and Carl then followed the girls, Sven acted first, choosing the two girls he knew were still virgins, Kristy and Megan. In a few seconds he had 'fired' two of his own clones into the girls' bodies, which spamsed slightly as they were possessed. He intended to keep them virgins, just incase Carl decided to break their agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First pick huh?\" Carl laughed, then he gestured with his hands and shot his two clones into the two other girls, Kelly and Lauren. All four girls, especially 'Carl's two bitches' immediately started feeling themselves up in the street and grinning. It was obvious the clones approved of their temporary new 'homes'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...this bitch has definitely had her cherry popped!\" blonde-haired Lauren grunted as the clone inside her reached under her skirt and slipped a finger under her panties. \"Oh well, I didn't expect a virgin\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one has been fucked too, several times!\" red-haired Kelly then laughed, as she gyrated her hips, the clone obviously enjoying the feeling of her tight panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven's two clones, inside Megan and Kristy were not quite as 'crude' once they were inside their host bodies, and even they clearly disapproved of the behavior of their counterparts. \"Alright, I think we should go somewhere a little less public don't you?\" Sven suggested to Carl, who was wild eyed at the sight of the four teenage beauties. \"What? Oh...yeah okay kid, lets find somewhere, and quick, I want to get inside one of these little sluts myself\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Sven sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on bitches, cheerleading practise is cancelled until further notice!\" Carl laughed, and then the 'six' of them walked off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the perfect place of Sven and Carl to stash their bodies while they had their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sven and Carl laid down on the ground behind a dumpster in the alley and both instantly left their bodies. Sven noticed that while they were both outside of their bodies, both Sven and Carl could see eachother's spirits. The only difference was that while Carl was a white haze, Sven appeared to be made of a black smoke. Sven saw Carl quickly phase into Kelly, the hotter of the two he sent his clones into. Sven followed his lead by possessing Kristy, who was one of the hottest girls in his school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he had control, he felt over his new body. He knew he could have fun in Kristy, but he also needed to keep watch over Carl to make sure he didnt do anything too serious with his bodies. As he finished his thought, he saw that Carl already had one of Kelly's hands down her skirt and was moaning in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven just sighed. He didn't understand how Carl could be like that. He didn't care at all about who his hosts were, or what they were like before he possessed them. Sven always had fun with his hosts too, but never to the extent that Carl went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh, you've got to try this, it feels fantastic.\" Carl moaned in Kelly's normally sweet sounding voice. Though, when Carl used it, it sounded wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven looked around and saw that Carl's other clone was doing the same thing with Lauren's body, while his other clone, inside Megan, was just watching in disgust, while she placed her hands on her breasts. Sven just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, kid. Loosen up and have some fun!\" Carl said, removing his hand from his victim's skirt.</span></div></div>",

How could he have not noticed this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea. You see, I can't keep you alive, and I definitely can't kill you, because that would just cause problems. I'll give you one last chance to be a nice little boy and work for me. But from now on we play things my way. Otherwise, I'll turn little Sarah here into the biggest slut you'll ever see in this town. Trust me, I can make her a star!\" Carl said laughing as he squeezed Sarah's boobs. Sven wanted to punch him as hard as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. There's not a chance in hell I'll work for you...dad!\" Sven said. Sarah looked thrown off by the statement but then smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you looked so familiar. You have your mom's eyes kid. I remember when I first met her. She fought, but I got her eventually. And it looks like you were my present to her.\" Carl said in Sarah's voice. He didn't even care that Sven was his son. He just wanted to thrill of possessing the next host. \"Last chance, kid.\" Sarah said with a sinister smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Sven said firmly. There was no way he would let this continue. He thought fast and knew what he could do to stop Carl... He could send himself into Sarah's body and override Carl completely, effectively killing him for good. But that was risky. It would be a battle of will and if Carl's was stronger then it would be Sven that was dead. His clone would still be alive in Charlene though. In theory before he died he could transfer at least enough power into him to keep him from being possessed by Carl. Sven decided it was worth the risk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As this 'internal struggle' was going on, Sarah's body remained on its feet...but was spasming violently, her perky tits jiggling away under her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Sven realized that he wasn't going to be strong enough to defeat Carl, so instead...while he held Carl's spirit off for as long as he could...he transferred his main essence and knowledge to his clone downstairs in Charlene's body. \"Game over kid!\" Carl then said in Sarah's voice...as he managed to overcome Sven and sent him 'into the void'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you could beat your old man did ya?\" Carl then chuckled as he looked down at Sven's lifeless body. He peered down at his stolen teenage body and felt his breasts. \"All the clientele are just gonna love stretching out this little bitch's pussy\" he then then chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, downstairs, Sven's clone (now in essence Sven himself) became aware of what had happened. \"Damn!\" he exclaimed in Charlene's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked down at himself, dressed in the girl's pink sweater, blue jeans and ankle boots and he started to head back upstairs. Sven knew that Carl had been severely weakened by the struggle just now, and Sarah's body was exhausted. He suspected that Carl wouldn't be able to survive another 'fight', and would at the least be ejected from Sarah's body. Carl was slightly puzzled when he saw Charlene walk through the door and close it behind her, but he soon caught on. \"Don't know when to stay down do ya?\" he shook Sarah's head, as he stood there rubbing her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's one thing I did get from you, its the unwillingness to lie down and 'take it'\" Sven responded in Charlene's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a good trait to have!\" Carl nodded, as he started pacing in Sarah's body. \"Along with a couple of others\" he then grinned, cupping Sarah's breasts with her own hands, an act he knew only infuriated Sven. \"And so it comes down to this, two possessed bitches having a 'cat fight', how exciting!\" he continued. Carl tried to make it appear as though he was still as strong as ever, but Sven knew otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round two!\" Svene suddenly exclaimed...as he projected himself out of Charlene's body, which fell unconscious on the floor of the bedroom. He shot straight into Sarah's body, which began convulsing again as he fought his dad for control. And this time, Carl quickly found himself beginning to lose control of Sarah's body. Having learned lessons from the first struggle, Sven knew all the right moves to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye...dad!\" Sven uttered in Sarah's voice, as Carl was expelled from Sarah's body, and now unable return to his own body, wherever he had left it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But we will see what may happen</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieutenant Lilly Hernandez was beat. Crime rate in the city has not gone down since two years ago and with the now bigger population and less people wanting to be a cop with all the recent nationwide bad press, it had been quite strenous at the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only upside for the lieutenant was that she had received a promotion two years ago and another one followed in quick succession just half a year ago, which meant that the money was better but mostly, she liked the authority that her new position afforded her. Some of the more experienced and older cops were retiring or being moved to other cities. That opened up slot for promotion, one which the lieutenant took with both hands, under her watch and guidance, the office had performed significantly better than when it was under her predecessor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously, a half-smile crept on her face. There were sacrifices of course, she had to spend a long amount of hours working, but it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ding!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the elevator in her apartment building brought her back to reality. The door opened to reveal two men, probably older than she was, taking the elevator down. The lieutenant felt their stares on her body, especially on the crevasse between her bosom visible between the buttoned down trenchcoat, but she knew better than to flinch or to get offended. As the two men walked past her, Lilly was reminded of the times when a few guys back at the police department used to talk about her at night over coffee and doughnut. A few of the criminals or delinquents that came across her paths had the same predictable reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly licked her lips, if they want to stare, then let them. If they were going to do it anyway, might as well gain something from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, Lilly's hand reached into the jacket of one of the men and fished a wallet out discreetly, using her trenchcoat as cover. The two men, more eager to leave the apartment than to pay attention to their surroundings, didn't suspect a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punched in her number. <i>Floor 15</i>. That's where she had been living for the past one and a half years after her husband died in an accident in a trip to Borneo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her husband's death, she became a changed person and began spending long hours at work. Throwing herself at her work to move past the grief. To accommodate for that, she put their only daughter in the care of her deceased husband's family in another city, who were really too keen on having their granddaughter live with them. Lilly visited them at least once a month, she wanted to see her daughter growing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment wasn't too bad, in fact it was quite upscale, compared to the ones in the neighbourhood. Lilly heard the click on the door and entered her room. One that she bought using the sale proceeds of her former house as well some insurance money paid out on her husband's death. The room itself was polished with decor fitting one of a penthouse, without the size of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took out the wallet she previously lifted from the man. \"Thanks buddy,\" Lilly said to herself in her accented voice, a grin forming as she moved a few crisp bills from the wallet to her trenchcoat. There were a few debit and credit cards there, as well as IDs, but she wasn't really interested in them. Lilly opened a window that faced the dark and quiet street below and tossed the wallet out into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lieutenant took off her trenchcoat and grabbed a cold can of beer from the fridge. She had began liking them two years ago. A bottle of beer in hand, Lilly admired her uniform-clad body in the full body mirror attached to her wardrobe door. It wasn't easy to keep in shape after a few years of marriage and having a child, but somehow, Lilly was able to look as good as she did. She used a free hand to unbutton her uniform, letting her prodigious bosom, encased in lacy black bra into view. She took them off and lifted her left boob up so she can kiss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the best,\" Lilly said to her reflection in the mirror, before she chugged the bottle down and let out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl remembered the showdown and the day he 'died' in a battle of control with his son. The day when he was erased out of existence. He remembered feeling helpless, searching frantically for a body that he could inhabit, only for his sense of self to be reduced to nothing in a matter of minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to his surprise that he woke up in the dead of the night inside the body of then Officer Lilly Hernandez, with cold sweat and gasping for air exactly four weeks later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl feasted at the reflection of Lilly Hernandez's body, one that he has called home for the last two years ever since his defeat at the hands of Sven and he liked what he saw. Now at 37 years old, the sergeant was still the same with how she looked two years ago when Carl took control of her briefly in the donut shop. Long, dark hair, tanned skin, and curves in all the right places\u2014big boobs and an ass to die for, both of which jiggled with every wonderful step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tough to maintain his borrowed body's strict diet and regiment, Carl cupped his borrowed body's boobs. It was even harder for him to settle into the life of a married - mother of one cop, even when he had her brain to pick. The first few days were spent trying to 'move' out from his current host, or to shoot 'clones' at other people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was forced to live the life of Officer Hernandez, his only respite was that he was able to sneer at Nick Trask's whose career he had destroyed and was living his life behind the closed confine of psych ward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that Carl found out was that he enjoyed working on the other side of law, from a career criminal to a cop. He had his street smarts and knew the working of what his borrowed body was against and it was only a matter of time before Officer Lilly Hernadez spent more and more time at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Carl grew accustomed to his predicament, giving up on the idea that he would be able to vacate his current body, something unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came to him slowly, sporadically at first and Carl wasn't able to predict when his reduced powers would manifest. However, everytime his borrowed body fell asleep, Carl was able to turn into his ghost form. Much to Carl's disappointment, it was the same as when he lost to Sven, he was unable to possess anyone, merely passing through them when his astral body came into touch with a body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reduced powers even had further limitation. Carl was unable to go too far away from Lilly's body and when her body was about to wake up, his astral body would be yanked. In theory, it was something useless, but Carl knew what he had to do to capitalize on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his astral form, Carl was able to get into places. Places like, meetings between the higher-ups in the police force, cell guards gossips, private life of the other cops,  dealings between criminals and much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl found out that by nabbing the right crook, blackmailing certain people in position and generally being aware of whatever he was able to glean from being in astral form, it was easy for him to get Officer Hernandez noticed by the higher-ups for all the right reason. When her husband started to complain, about how much time Lilly spent away from home, Carl knew it was time for him to get his current host much needed independence. It was time for her husband to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about time as well that Carl noted that he was able to control his powers better. Instead of only being able to turn astral when Lilly was asleep, he was able to control when he want to turn astral with the borrowed body slipping into sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly ran her hands over her body, only to stop to rub herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this state Carl knew he would be no match for Sven and he had kept his distance away from Sarah Trask, knowing that his son made Nick's niece her permanent home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was fine for Carl. He can wait and bide his time for his powers to manifest again in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin crept on the lieutenant's face as she continued to rub herself with much more gusto.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following her fun with herself, Lilly took a long shower before sliding on her thin nightgown and sitting laying herself in bed. She had pretty much the same routine every night since she decided that it was time to get rid of her wifely and motherly responsibilities. Once her head was comfortably on her pillow, Lilly closed her eyes and concentrated. As Lilly's body faded into sleep, Carl's spirit rose and hovered over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for another night of work\" he said to himself as he looked down at his ghostly form. Carl noted that what used to be an exact replica of his original body had slowly been loosing details. As he looked at his ghostly hands, he noticed that they no longer had fingerprints. Was that because Carl no longer remembered the exact details of what he originally looked like? That was certainly possible. It was also the case that the more time Carl spent in Lilly's body, the more he genuinely thought of himself as Lilly. While his personality would always be at the forefront, it was only in his spirit body that Carl could genuinely think as himself. That was one of the reasons that he relished his night time \"strolls\" so much. Of course, the other reason was that it gave him the valuable information that he would make use of as Lilly over the next several days. While Lilly's body slept and rejuvenated herself, Carl's spirit trekked across the city, getting any and all information that he could on the criminal activity that he was once a part of but now would so eagerly put to an end if it meant advancing his new career. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was also that glimmer of hope that the longer Carl stayed in his ghostly body, the greater chance there was of his powers fully returning to him. Though Carl had learned to keep that hope buried as far back as he could. He had learned a long time ago that hope meant nothing. Reality was harsh and unforgiving. It would have its way with you regardless of what you wanted to do. With that in mind, Carl flew a few blocks south, to one of the most crowded hangout spots of the city. It was known to be the place where all of the local college students would go to drink and buy drugs which made it the perfect place for Carl to begin his stakeout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl watched the kids doing their stuff, he wished that he could fly into them, possess them and get a glimpse of their life. Find out who they were and get all the juicy information that they had for him. And if they were good looking...well, he had other types of fun in mind. Of course, Carl knew that there was no point in thinking like that. It would be a long, long time before he could possess anyone again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Carl was looking for the nearest drug dealer to spy on, a smoking hot young woman caught his eyes. She was wearing a tight pink crop top and black leggings which served to accent her shapely figure. If Carl were in his physical body right now, he knew he'd be hard as a rock. then, suddenly, he realized that he knew this woman! She was a bit older but it was definitely Charlene Robins. Carl remembered her like it was yesterday. She was Sarah Trasks babysitter and had just started college when he took her body for a joyride and used it early-on in his initial plot to ruin Nick Trask's life. Somehow, she looked even better now than then, and her presence here gave Carl one of the few things that he never wanted to experience again...hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl had spent many hours trying to figure out why his spirit was pulled into the body of Lilly Hernandez. He eventually came to the conclusion that it was because she was one of the first people that Carl had both possessed himself AND sent a clone into for an extended period of time. As a result of that, Carl's spirit must have left some kind of residue in her body that he could latch onto and use to rejuvenate himself. Charlene was another of those people. In fact, the raw emotions that he was feeling while he had been using Charlene's body both himself and as a clone, would likely have left an even more powerful impact. Maybe, just maybe, Carl could use her body and activate the power of his leftover inside of her. Maybe, just maybe, it could snap him back to something closer to full strength. Of course, there was also the chance that Carl was completely wrong about this. and even if his theory was right, it had been two whole years since the last time he or one of his clones inhabited Charlene's body. Anything that would have been leftover in her could potentially be long gone by now. But still, it was worth a shot. Without even thinking, Carl through his spirit at Charlene's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl allowed himself to hope for the best as the world faded to black around him...</span></div></div>",

It was as if someone up there - or perhaps down below- was playing a cruel trick on him. The bright sunlight that shone on Carl's borrowed face just served to piss him off further.  \"Fuck,\" Lilly let out a low guttural growl that would normally be out of character for her two years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" Lilly said, loud enough so that whoever had knocked her door could let themselves in, \"Morning Gwen, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was a young woman, around 25, 2 years ago she had just graduated from the police academy when Carl possessed her for the first time. She had long red hair and a slender frame and a nice rack, something which she kept until now. That was one of the reason why Carl promoted her quickly and kept her by his side, so that he can enjoy the view whenever he wanted. Aside from that, Gwen Summers had always had a strong sense of justice, and wanted to catch criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's someone who wanted to talk to you,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone from the force?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighed as Carl knew what it could mean. An audience with a member of the public, something that he really disliked about Lilly's present job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Handle it for me would you?\" Lilly returned to her PC and she wasn't lying. Carl was actually in the middle of writing a report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's how Carl didn't see Gwen gasped and stiffened a bit as her eyes became a clear white. Soon however the color returned and she began breathing normally. She looked down at her body, pulled her hair a bit and ran her hands over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you boss, <i>she</i> can be really persuasive,\" Gwen said with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't what Gwen said, but how she said it that caused Carl to stop typing at the keyboard. Just as Lilly's pretty face turned to look at Gwen, Charlene's familiar face appeared from behind the young cop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey <i>boss</i>,\" Charlene draped an arm around Gwen's shoulder and let the palm of her hand rest on Gwen's rack, \"What can I say, <i>I</i> can be really persuasive,\" Charlene said, echoing what Gwen just uttered moments ago.</span></div></div>",

She had no idea why she let her best friends drag her to these sorts of places. Unlike the two of them, she had grown out of her partying phase two years ago after watching the girl that she used to babysit nearly die. It was then that she decided to put in as much time as possible studying so that she could go to med school and be a doctor. Still, Charlene supposed that it was nice to get out of her room from time to time, even if she knew that she wouldn't end up in any bed other than her own once she was done with her martini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to find a relatively quiet corner to escape to when Charlene suddenly felt a chill down her spine. Her body shot to attention and then shook violently, causing her to drop her drink. Her body fell to the floor, still convulsing as her martini glass shattered next to her. People assuming that she had one too many drinks began gathering around to watch the show as Charlene held her head in pain. Suddenly, as soon as it had come, the pain stopped. One of Charlene's eyes became white but soon faded back to it's natural color as the young woman stood up, and felt herself over, apparently making sure that none of her drink had gotten on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, hot stuff?\" A man asked, putting his hand on her bare shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlene nodded. \"Yeah...yeah, I'm fine. I just need to get to a bathroom\" she said, pushing the man's hand away from her and heading to the nearest restroom. Once she got there, she stared at herself in the mirror and smiled at her reflection with an evil smile that had not been seen on her face in a little over two years. \"Well, this is an interesting turn of events\" she sad as she cupped her breasts and gave them a tight squeeze. \"Oh yeah...I'm going to have lots of fun with this little reunion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Now*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, tell me all of this one more time\" Lily Hernandez said before taking a long sip of coffee. As the hot liquid made its way down her throat, she stared at Charlene, who was now playing with her hair. The clone that was sent into Gwen was removed as soon as the younger woman had established who she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how many times I have to tell you this, but if it makes you happy I'll go through it one last time. And then you can either respond to me with more than just a request for repetition, or I'm going to walk my sexy black ass out of here. Deal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" Lily said before she nodded and took another sip of her coffee. \"Now tell this to me again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night I went out with two of my girlfriends. I felt a familiar chill come over my body and fell down in pain. When I got up, I found my head full of thoughts that weren't mine. I went to the bathroom and spent some time feeling my body over, swearing up and down that I was a man named Carl Edwards. A man who started out as a criminal, acquired powers beyond my wildest dreams, and used those powers to make that son-of-a-bitch Trask as miserable as possible before being nearly killed by my own bastard son. Then one night, I woke up as a sexy cop and have been living so ever since. But after I had a few minutes of fun, I realized something important. I'm <b>not</b> Carl Edwards and never have been. My name is Charlene Robins. I'm a 22 year old woman studying my ass off to one day be a doctor...\" she leaned forward so that her face was only inches away from Lily's. \"But I certainly acquired some of Carl's petites\" she said, licking her lips as she leaned back in her chair and crossed her legs. \"Like I said before, I suspect that this is what happened: Once you saw me, you hoped that going into me would awaken whatever powers of yours were partially in my body. You thought that just maybe, you would be able to possess me and be back to your old self. If didn't work, of course. Once you tried to possess me, you got yourself pulled right back into your new home. But you did manage to wake up something in me. Whatever of you was left inside of my body woke right up and filled me with power. At first, it overloaded my mind and convinced me that I was you. but once the clouds cleared up, I became something more than I ever was. I'm certainly not fully Charlene anymore. But I'm not Carl either. I'm a little of both. And I love it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your powers?\" Lily asked as she put her now empty cup on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlene shrugged. \"I can make clones possess people, but not a lot. When I was experimenting the other day, I capped out at three. Once I tried making a fourth, my first victim passed out. It's funny, isn't it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\" Lily asked, her hand clenching into a fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make clones but can't leave my body while you can leave your body but not possess people or make clones. And while you are certainly the original Carl, you're also slowly sinking more and more into your new life. Even the astral form that you use is starting to look more feminine. Neither of us are fully who we claim to be. We're two sides of the same coin, you and I. We're each part Carl Edwards and part someone new and we each have parts of the original Carl's powers. Let's embrace out uniqueness and help each other out. What do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looked down as Charlene extended a hand towards her. Obviously, Carl didn't like the way any of this sounded. He would have been far happier if he was able to regain his powers last night. But this presented an interesting idea. He could definitely use this to his advantage. If Charlene was really willing to work with Lily, her powers could be used very effectively. But there was always the chance of being stabbed in the back. The only reason that Carl had ever trusted his clones was because there was something built into how they thought that made them subservient to his will. Charlene was right in that she was not Carl, at least not fully. Her clones would be loyal to her first. That alone was enough reason to tempt Carl to tell her thanks but no thanks and to just go on living her own life. On the other hand, it was already established that working with Charlene would be useful for Lily's job as well as her overall fun. In addition to that, it was clear that Charlene was a very intelligent woman. She could be of use to help figure out why Carl was fading and brainstorm ways to slow that down. She could even be used to help figure out a way to reverse that process and bring Carl back to his full strength. In addition to that, Charlene gave Carl an in with Sarah Trask that he didn't have before. And if he said no to her, she could easily go to the former Sven and tell him everything. With all of those factors in mind. Lily responded to the offer by...</span></div></div>",

As the two laughed about it Carl tried to phase into Charlene's body, but found it impossible. He couldn't possess Sarah's or his own body either. Not even the kids currently unoccupied body would be possessed by Carl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, what the hell did the fucker do to me?</i> Carl thought to himself. As he looked down at his ghostly form, he knew that he was fading more every second, and that if he didn't get a body soon, he would be erased into nothing...But how could he find someone who when it looked like he could no longer use his powers? <br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Charlene left the room, Sven left Sarah's body and returned to his own. As soon as he sat back up, he realized that something was wrong. Sarah wasn't moving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, as soon as he left someone, they would wake up after a few minutes, but Sarah was completely still. Sven placed his hand on Sarah's neck and saw that her pulse was still there. at least she wasn't dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven wondered what was wrong with her, but then realized what had happened. He didn't know how he knew it, but Sarah's mind was ripped apart when he and Carl fought for control of her body. Her body was still perfectly healthy and alive, but her soul was dead. It was like being in a coma, only she would never wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven felt tears dripping from his eyes as he embraced Sarah's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Sarah...I wish there was some way to keep you alive.\" He said as he kissed Sarah's forehead. Carl wouldn't be an issue anymore. Sven made sure he didn't have his powers, so eventually he would just fade into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven thought for a minute and then realized that there was a way of keeping Sarah alive...at least in body. Sven could leave his own body permanently and become Sarah... since Sarah's current body had no soul living in it, it would just die within a few hours. Sven didn't have anything to live for in his life anyway. His parents were dead and he never had any friends. Sarah had all of those. She had parents who loved her but were far away, and good friends who she could always confide in. She had a life that Sven always wished he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Sven knew that he would be able to do it. He could completely transfer his soul into Sarah's body and become it's permanent soul. Sarah's body would become his real body and his own would simply die. He could become Sarah Trask and keep living as her, but at the same time still use his powers and have fun. He wouldn't go too far like Carl but he did enjoy his fun in girls when he could. And that would be easier to do if he became one permanently...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sven wasn't sure...he felt bad that he would be stealing Sarah's life, but Sarah was dead anyway...the least he could do was live out the rest of her life for her to atleast keep her alive in body...Its not like it would change who <i>he</i> was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was hard to imagine that in only a few days, she would be starting at her dream college. Following the events that lead to her new life, Sarah had returned home to her parents house. Uncle Nick would still visit from time to time, but Sarah made it painfully clear to her parents that she never wanted to return to his house. There were just too many bad memories there for her to ever be comfortable. In the back of her mind, Sarah was terrified of Carl somehow managing to put himself back together from oblivion and regain his powers. She knew that wouldn't happen, but the thought was paralyzing enough that she refused to even step foot within miles of where all of that happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sarah still remembered her life as Sven, it was feeling more like a dream every day. Of course, if she used her powers to leave her body, the spectral form that she would see was Sven's body. However, Sarah never had much of a reason for this. She didn't have to possess someone else to be in the body of an attractive girl, she WAS one. And most of the fun that she would want to have on the side was done with clones anyway. Speaking of that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah winked at the boy that she just walked past. \"Hey, I'm Sarah\" she said with a cute smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake\" the boy said with a smile back.

We were going to the beach remember Jakey?\" she said, giving Sarah a glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's so fun!

She coughed on the first try but then she did it like a pro, exhaling smoke a totally different way then Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I knew it, I fucking like it!\" said Eva exhaling smoke while talking and I'm sure my mom and sis would totally like being like us.''  <br>\r\n''Good girl I sure look forward to seeing this Eva'' said Carl.</span></div></div>",

The alien's head was crested by four small horns and a slimy, forked tongue occasionally sprung out of his mouth, which was lined with razor sharp teeth. Attached to the belt of his suit was some kind of device, which the alien now took a hold of as he stealthily flit across yet another street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering around a wall, the reptilian alien saw someone approaching, a man who seemed to have trouble walking, the effects no doubt of too much alcohol in his system. Giving a look of distain, the alien let the man stagger past. Another person, this time a younger...more healthy human male approached, hurrying home from a friend's house, but he crossed the street before reaching the hidden alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChattering from nearby then drew the reptilian's attention, and he studied the human female that was conversing with the driver of a vehicle. The woman was white, about 30 years old and was wearing a very provocative black dress that barely covered her ass and showed most of her generous cleavage. A short black jacket kept the cold off her back and her height was boosted considerably by the black patent, stiletto pumps she wore on her feet. The man in the car, a lonely guy in his 40's looking for some fun, had waited until tonight to find himself a nice looking prostitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a silent hiss, the alien's tongue again leapt out of his mouth...and flicked around before quickly retracting back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the street were a couple of other human females, dressed in the same fashion as the first, and obviously in the same profession.

The thing couldn\u2019t afford to draw much attention to itself at the moment...to do so would blow the whole mission.  Shaking its scale-covered head in frustration, the creature hit a button on its leathery uniform, activating a cloaking device. The creature was suddenly invisible, hidden behind the effect of an advanced alien technology humans could only imagine.  Hidden by the device, the reptile moved smoothly and with impressive speed through the run-down parts of town, past the crack houses and closed businesses with the broken windows.  Humans would stumble by...potential vessels, each one, but many of them were hopelessly intoxicated or in groups too large for a possession to go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter moving about for some time with no luck, the creature began to come into a different place...a nicer part of town.  The ground went from being hardened, broken concrete to the warm and welcoming feel of trimmed green grass.  The homes were quite luxurious; the streets, quiet and clean.  The alien walked silently through the quiet suburb, glancing about at the well-kept houses and listening as the wind blew pleasantly through the leafy trees.  Suddenly, a sound!  The lizard-like creature\u2019s head perked up, and its tongue shot out and tasted the air furiously, suddenly interested in its surroundings.  Its cloaking device running low on power, the creature ran over behind some full bushes and disengaged the thing.  It crouched down to observe the thing that had made the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature beheld the source of the commotion.  Coming down the road was a young woman named Rose Wittington.  Rose was the quintessential good girl.  Her family was wholesome to the last drop.  Her father, William, was a pastor at the local church.  He was loved by his congregation and sank his whole life into the church and caring for the people who went there, as well as for anyone else who sought his help.  He was a large man, standing at about 6 foot 2 inches tall with thick, blonde hair covering his head.  He had begun to gain some weight with age, weighting about 220lbs with a large belly jutting out before him, but he was perpetually in a good mood.  He was the sort of man who commanded enough respect of people that he did not have to yell...when he wanted to rip somebody a new one, he'd get super quiet and start patiently but intensely quoting bible verses at people.  Rose\u2019s mother, Julie Wittington, was strikingly beautiful.  She was 44 years old with long, blonde hair cascading down her back.  She\u2019d begun to put on some weight as the years weighed on her...she was not fat or anything, but her hips and ass gave a wonderful jiggle as she took each step, as did the absolutely beautiful mounds that swung from her chest.  She was, of course, quite conservative, often wearing a pant suit with the front fully buttoned up, hiding her wonderful cleavage from the world. She also liked fluffy turtle-necks was always smiling.  Rose\u2019s younger brother, Rory Wittington, was a boy of five.  When he was born and Julie was 39, young Rory was dubbed \u201cour little miracle,\u201d and he dressed and acted the part.  He wore a button-down shirt and nice pants to school each day, wanting to help pretty much everybody with pretty much anything pretty much all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose herself was a chip off the old block.  At 20 years old, she was a couple years from finishing college with a double major in education and social work, hoping to join the Peace Corps after school to help the poor.  She was about 5 foot 5 inches tall with dark hair running down her back.  Today, she wore black suit pants that hugged her full frame, making clear her wide hips and generous backside.  Her classy heels clicked as she walked along the sidewalk.  Her chest was impressive in size, with her breasts bouncing a bit as she went along.  Her shirt was a nice white blouse made of beautiful silk and buttoned all the way up.  Rose was slightly overweight, which had the effect of filling out all the right places\u2014her hips, her chest, and her ass.  Her arms had a tiny bit of flab, and her belly boasted a wee bit of a muffin top. Her curvy form was still in good enough shape that she could probably get guys if she wanted, but she was more focused on school and the church at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Jenny, hey I'll see you at class tomorrow all right?\u201d Rose pleasantly said as she neared the house.  She carried her bible across her chest, having just finished teaching a youth ministry class at the church where her father ran things.  The creature looked about from its perch behind the bushes...indeed, no one else was around.  With superhuman speed and agility, it leapt from its cover, clearing the bushes easily and landing right in front of the unsuspecting young Rose Wittington.  Rose looked up at the...the...THING in front of her, and her eyes went wide with horror. She was speechless; she dropped her bible in terror and backed up slowly, her eyes fixed on the reptilian creature who looked expectantly at her.  \"Oh...my...my go...what are ...\u201d Rose finally stammered out, but then she tripped and fell quite roughly on her backside, landing on the grass.  The alien came still closer to her, and Rose\u2019s heart beat harder, and her mind spun.  The thing gave a sort of sick smile and a flick of the tongue as it neared it target, beginning to get down on its knees to get closer to the horrified young woman's body.  Rose tried to back up, dragging her nice church clothes across the ground.  She finally drew breath, about to scream.  Suddenly, the alien, about atop her now, grabbed her firmly by the throat, and she began to choke and gag, trying without success to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature drew breath above the terrified, gasping Rose, and it exhaled mightily, shooting from its mouth a sort of green gas into Rose's mouth.  Suddenly, Rose went limp.  Having inhaled the gas, Rose\u2019s eyes glazed over, and her body relaxed...her facial expression went blank as though she were asleep.  The creature's tongue slithered from its mouth again, and it sort of smiled and chuckled, as much as such a creature can. The reptile hit a small button on its uniform, and its whole body seemed to kind of shimmer. It slowly turned over, still holding itself off the ground above Rose.  Slowly, the creature lowered itself into Rose's limp body.  Rose jerked, shook, and jiggled a bit as the creature wrested control of her own body from her.  Her muscles tensed up, and she grunted and moaned as her inhabited flesh rolled around on the ground, her body trying to eject the thing that had possessed her.  Suddenly all that stopped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose\u2019s body sat up off the ground slowly.  She, or rather the thing in her, looked down at its new form, putting her arms out before her and turning her hands over a couple times.  The new Rose took one of her fingers and prodded her slightly cushy stomach with it.  The creature noticed the full, fleshy mounds that hung from her host\u2019s chest.  It poked them too, laughing little.  It wasn\u2019t Rose\u2019s voice that came out; rather, it was a deep guttural noise that escaped her lips.  The thing inside Rose slowly moved to get up, first going to her knees, then standing the rest of the way.  Once erect, the thing breathed slowly, looking around and trying to get itself used to its new body.  Rose's possessor walked slowly and clumsily and jerkily toward the house, her body jiggling with each awkward step.  Her face was blank, and the creature hadn't yet had time to process all the information in his host's head--names, places, human norms and social expectations, muscle memory, etc.  These things would come, but for now the creature was a little bit like a kid trying to drive for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing left Rose's mouth hanging open because it didn\u2019t know any better; she'd begun to drool a little.  Grass and grass stains had soiled Rose\u2019s nice clothes as her possessed form awkwardly walked toward the door. Deep, alien noises escaped her lips and she breathed. A tiny, sick smile spread across the possessed girl's face as she reached for the door handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The thing enters the house and familiarizes itself with its new body.<br>\r\n2) It enters the house and is soon joined by a visitor.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rose entered the home and looked around, the alien inside her curious about its new world.  She walked awkwardly into the room not far from the door--the kitchen.  The possessed girl looked around curiously at all the gadgets in the place, settling on a large box that seemed to stick out of the wall.  The creature opened the box and was greeted by a burst of cold air and a dizzying array of food items inside what it had not yet figured out was a fridge.  Rose's body gave a slight grunt and a small smile as she figured out what was inside was nourishment.  She reached into the refrigerator and pulled out a small brown container, one that contained chocolate syrup.  She examined the bottle, turning it over in her hands.  She banged it loudly on the table a couple times and gave a little start when a bit of the syrup shot out the top.  Delighted at what it had learned, the creature held the bottle more or less above its mouth and squeezed.  The liquid chocolate shot from the bottle.  Some of it actually ended up in Rose\u2019s mouth, while still more ended up in the area of her face near her mouth.  The creature enjoyed the taste and downed the whole bottle, then simply tossed it to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sloppily wiped the syrup from her face with her nice white shirt sleeve.  It didn\u2019t do a very good job, and the syrup basically got smeared all over her face.  \"Rose, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d the thing heard from behind its back.  \"I found your bible on the ground outside...is everything all right?\u201d came a woman's voice as she put the book on the kitchen counter.  Rose slowly and awkwardly turned around to face her mother, who had a rather concerned look on her face. Still unfamiliar with its body, the creature said nothing and gave only a slight, guttural grunt and a little smile.  Julie Wittington, Rose's full-figured mother, stood there in her nice pant suit having just come from church.  Her eyes went wide when she saw Rose\u2019s front covered, as it was, with grass stains and chocolate syrup, the latter smeared all over her daughter's face and chest.  \"My goodness, Rose, what have you done to yourself?\u201d Julie demanded in amazement as she grabbed her daughter's arm with concern.  \"Are you all right?  Did something bad happen at Bible study?\u201d she said, clearly worried.  Rose stood more or less expressionless, breathing slowly with her breasts rising and falling with a steady rhythm.  \"Rose?!\u201d Julie cried, \"explain yourself!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose smiled a little, tilting her head and laughing a bit in the low tone the possessor had.  She reached up and put her hand on Julie\u2019s belly, feeling out its new companion.  \"What are you...?\u201d Julie said as Rose got more curious.  She looked Julie up and down, as if examining her with a scientist's eye.  She reached out again, this time with both hands, and grabbed Julie\u2019s heaving breasts, cupping them once or twice and lightly beating on the bouncy mounds sort of like one would with drums.  The wonderful mounds jiggled beautifully.  Julie Wittington was aghast, \"Rose!!\u201d she said in amazement, \"what\u2019s gotten into you?!\u201d and she started to back away.  Not willing to let this happen, Rose pushed her mother roughly to the ground, now possessed of superhuman strength.  Rose was immediately atop her mother\u2019s voluptuous body when it hit the ground hard.  Rose straddled Julie's form, and her heart beat as its possessor got more excited.  \"My GOD!\u201d  Julie yelled, lifting her hand as if to swat away the thing that controlled her normally very clean and proper daughter.  Rose effortlessly caught Julie's arm and smiled a bit.  \"Your God......not...save...you,\u201d she said slowly, the voice escaping her lips a strange combination of Rose\u2019s voice and the guttural moan of the creature inside her, \"my children.....want...like...your...body,\u201d she said as she reached down and pulled Julie close, pushing Rose's mouth to Julie's as if in a passionate kiss.  Rose injected some of her eggs into her mother's waiting, heaving body.  The eggs slid, smothered in a slippery fluid, from Rose's mouth to Julie's and slid down the latter's throat, settling in her belly.  Julie shook and fought, much as Rose had, then fell back with a thud on to the floor.  With some slime still dangling from her mouth, Rose smiled a bit, then collapsed from all the strain on to Julie's unconscious body, simply lying on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The two wake up a bit later.  They are starting to get a bit used to their new bodies.  They'd like to examine them in greater detail together.<br>\r\n2) The two wake up a bit later, and Rose has a job for Julie.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Across town in the early morning air, an industrial haze coated the warehouse district.  The city had been hit by the same industrial decline that had afflicted many other urban cores in the United States; most of the factories were gone, and real estate values in those areas were down considerably.  A couple of factories remained, and their smoke stacks reached like the arms of god himself into the sky. Some of that haze made its way back nearer to the ground; this and the silence of the abandoned are made for a particularly eerie feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo police officers, Brenda Nelson and Nick Trask, rolled through the quiet scene without even the lights on their car flashing.  Nick was thinking that a call was a waste of his talents; the man had an MA in criminal justice for fuck sake, and he was stuck in a patrol car in an abandoned end of town instead of making the next big drug bust.  Nick was a portly young man of 25 with immense capabilities; these capabilities included eating hot dogs, which explained why his belly jiggled with every trip over the railroad tracks or every encounter with a pot hole.  He wore a suit and tie to work every day, but felt himself the big fish in the little pond.<br>\r\nBrenda Nelson was older than Trask.  At 45, she\u2019d been around a little bit, seen a few things.  The years of tough experiences that had given her street smarts did quite little to diminish her beauty, though.  Sure, at 45 a wrinkle appeared here and there on her face, but she had the most beautiful curly blonde hair and a smile that would light up a room.  She\u2019d packed on a little bit of weight the last few years\u2014not much, mind you\u2014enough to fill out her body and give her a very curvy frame, complete with a bubbly, round ass, jello-like boobs that swayed and jiggled, and also a slight flab in her belly, just a little pouch that formed mostly because, with her long hours, Brenda couldn\u2019t eat as healthy as she\u2019d have liked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the story with this one, Brenda?\u201d Trask asked.  \u201cOh, nothin\u2019 major,\u201d she answered, \u201creport of some weird stuff here, some noises and such\u2026this place should be abandoned.  Probably just some kids got stoned around here and blew somethin\u2019 small out of proportion.\u201d  The officers came to a stop outside a broken gate, which they opened and walked through.  \u201cYou go left; I\u2019ll got right, and we\u2019ll meet up in the middle, and radio if you hear anything weird,\u201d Brenda told Trask.  \u201cAll right,\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda walked off to the right of the big dark building, walking in the midst of giant steel beams and industrial equipment the owners of the last factory probably thought was not worth moving.  Brenda\u2019s husband had left her years ago, and this job was all she had, all that excited her, and boy did she love it.  Sure it was a bit weird working around an overwhelmingly male police force all the time, and jokes about the size of her tits knew no end.  She could put up with that, though, and at least it wasn\u2019t as bad now as it had been years ago, when she was 25 instead of 45.  Some of it was perhaps an honor, really.  She certainly didn\u2019t want her looks and beautiful figure to overshadow her work, and any joke could wear out its welcome if told enough times, but for the young guys who were just fresh from the academy and new to the force, it turned Brenda on a little that they still thought she was beautiful.  There was a measure of pride in being the cougar of the police force.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked through the darkened warehouse, hearing the echo of her every step and not a great deal else.  Then, she heard a metallic clanging sound, and her muscles tensed up; she instinctively put her hand on her gun.  \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d she tensely called out.  No answer.  \u201cTrask is that you?  Stop fucking around!\u201d  Again, no response.  Brenda walked a few steps farther through the dark building.  Suddenly, out of nowhere comes a monstrous creature.  It jumps at the unsuspecting Brenda Nelson; it walks on two legs and has a facial and body configuration like those of humans, but there the similarities stopped.  This creature was covered in moist, gooey green scales, and it had a long lizard-like tongue.  It had some electronic devices implanted around its eyes that emitted a blinking red light, and a bracelet on its slimy wrist was some type of computer device.  The creature lunged at the officer, and, just as Brenda tensed up and drew breath to yell for Trask, the thing opened its mouth wide and spat a sort of green vapor into her face.  Suddenly, the woman\u2019s mind went blank; her body was paralyzed.  Her head dropped forward to where she could see only the two heaving mounds on her chest through deadened eyes; her arms hung limply to her side.  The creature walked around her for a moment, poking and prodding her full-bodied and cushy form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the creature tapped a button on its wrist device, shimmered momentarily like a hologram, and stood directly in front of the immobile woman; then it simply backed up into her body.  The officer\u2019s head perked up, and her eyes gave off a green glow.  A long lizard tongue popped from her mouth, slithered about in the air for a moment, then went back in.  The creature used its new body to take deep breaths of the morning air, its host\u2019s bosom and belly seeming to expand and contract mightily with each breath.  Rather awkwardly, the officer turned and walked in an almost robotic fashion toward the door of the warehouse\u2026nearer the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick Trask ambled through the dark steel behemoth.  He was self-assured, being an educated man with an exemplary record, but the brass in the administration wanted to keep him where he was; promoting him would mean losing his talent, and the guys the next rung up on the ladder would have to compete with him; they didn\u2019t want that.  Add to this the fact that Nick\u2019s wife Jennifer was very pregnant; he needed to make his kid proud of him, and that\u2019s tough to do just being a beat cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter suited for knowledge work behind a desk or strategizing the next big bust, Trask\u2019s out-of-shape body lumbered through the warehouse, his pudgy belly straining against a thin dress shirt. Suddenly, he heard a faint noise\u2026.a sort of slithering sound.  \u201cBrenda,\u201d he called out, \u201cwhat the hell is that?  A broken steam pipe or something?\u201d  No answer.  Trask walked on bemoaning the soiled state of his new dress shoes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a creature lunged at him!  This was a slimy, reptilian thing with human-like features and some cyber enhancements, as shown by some electronic equipment seemingly melded into the creature\u2019s body.  The thing lunged at Trask, who began to yell out, \u201cWhat the f\u2026\u201d only to have the thing open wide and spit a sort of vapor into his opened mouth and nostrils.  Trask immediately went unconscious, but his body stayed up.  His head dropped limply down, and his arms hung weak at his sides.  The creature examined him for a minute, pressed a button implanted into its wrist, and simply walked into Trask\u2019s waiting, limp body. Immediately, his head shot up, and a green glow came from his eyes.  A reptilian tongue escaped his lips for a moment, then slithered back into his mouth.  Silently, the creature walked its new vessel toward the front door of the warehouse\u2026toward civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two officers\u2019 bodies made their way into the now-bright morning outside the warehouse.  They approached each other, each looking at the other.  The creature in Trask spoke first, \u201cYou found a vessel, 2112?\u201d he asked, referring to his companion by a designated number.  His voice was not Trask\u2019s, but rather a gravelly, guttural noise far lower than a normal human voice.  \u201cIndeed I have, 5150,\u201d replied the creature in Brenda in the same strange vocal pattern.  \u201cI think\u2026just a moment,\u201d Brenda said as the alien adjusted something about her body, \u201cI think these forms will be quite useful,\u201d the alien declared, now in the natural, womanly voice that was his host\u2019s.  \u201cThis body is female,\u201d Brenda explained, examining her breasts and groin region, \u201cand our records indicate it is the sort many desire for mating.  She is of breeding age, and we can use her belly to incubate our young so our numbers will grow,\u201d Brenda said, running her hands across her stomach.<br>\r\n\u201cMy body is\u2026.none of those,\u201d Trask declared.  \u201cBut we are both enforcers of sorts on this planet, and that will be useful.  We shall find the human who dares use our proprietary technology, rip him from whatever body he hides in, and GRIND HIS BONES INTO DUST!!!\u201d Trask declared emphatically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should use these bodies when possible,\u201d Brenda said, \u201cbut if you must inhabit a new husk, you need only press your hand against the body you wish to have and will the transfer to happen.\u201d  \u201cRight,\u201d Trask responded.  <br>\r\nNext\u2026<br>\r\n1)\tFrom the POV of Trask\u2019s alien go home to see him try to get used to life on this planet\u2026he\u2019ll meet Trask\u2019s family.<br>\r\n2)\tFrom the POV of Brenda\u2019s alien, return to the police station and use the records to dig up info about where the human in question might be. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few minutes later, the possessed officers arrive at their destination.  \u201cI will go to the hall of records and search for the man,\u201d Brenda declares, \u201cyou try to establish for us a base of operations\u2026a place we can reside and from which we can plan.\u201d  \u201cI will,\u201d Trask says, \u201cand remember to nourish your body\u2026these forms must eat more frequently than we usually do.  Mine seems to eat more often still,\u201d Trask says as he reaches down and cups the fat rolls hanging from his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Trask got out and slowly stood.  His body walked across the driveway and up the stairs to the porch and to the front door.  The whole way, his body moved in slow, labored movements, as if the creature possessing it were learning to work for the first time.  The aliens could take over people\u2019s bodies, but they could not duplicate the muscle memory that comes only when people do the same thing again and again.  He opened the door and walked into the darkened home.  He lumbered slowly and loudly through the front area of the house; a few steps in, a woman the creature identified as his host\u2019s mother, Beverly Trask, appeared in the doorway and ran quickly to greet her son.  Smiling, she ran up, heels clicking the whole way, and practically leapt into Trask\u2019s arms, putting her arms as much around his pudgy as she could manage.  \u201cHey honey!  Glad you\u2019re home!  How was your day?\u201d she said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creatures could possess bodies and get some detail from the memories of their hosts, but acquired things like social customs, little verbal tics, and the like were lost on them entirely.  Trask cocked his head as he looks down at the smiling woman.  Without smiling back and in a monotone voice, he responded, \u201cIt was\u2026agreeable.\u201d  \u201cWell, all right, but try not to sound so excited about that,\u201d Beverly responded with a laugh, thinking her son\u2019s response had been odd.  She begins walking into the kitchen, where she is cooking dinner for the night.  \u201cI will try to calm myself, then,\u201d Trask said in the same deadened voice, Beverly\u2019s sarcasm lost on him as he followed her into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly Trask was a woman of 48; she was short, and the years had begun to wear on her body.  She was still quite beautiful, but some flab in her belly and hips had filled out her figure a bit, and her boobs had started to sag a little with age.  A wrinkle appeared here and there on her face.  She walked into the kitchen pulled out two chairs at the kitchen table, and instructed her son to sit in one of them.  Again, rather ungracefully, the creature moved its new-found girth into the seat.  His looked stone-faced forward out the window, even though Beverly was sitting to his right.  \u201cSo Nicky,\u201d Beverly began, \u201canything unusual at work today?\u201d \u201cNo, nothing,\u201d Trask answered flatly.  \u201cSo\u2026Jennifer will be back soon; she\u2019s buying baby stuff with friends,\u201d she said, hoping for a normal reaction.  She got none from her boy.  Trask started to get too warm, so the alien inside him stood his body up and silently removed his suit jacket.  Then it unbuttoned his dress shirt, letting both items of clothing simply drop to the floor.  His top half was covered now only by a quite thin (and stretched) white undershirt, and he sat back down in silence.  His mother was quite surprised, \u201cNicky, are you just going to leave those there on the floor like that?  Jennifer might trip and hurt herself\u2026and the baby.  I never raised you like that,\u201d she said, disappointed, as she stood to clean up the mess left by the thing she thought was her son.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Trask stood up too, towering over his mother.  He moved quickly in her direction and grabbed her firmly by the arm.  \u201cNicky!  Ouch!  You\u2019re hurting me!\u201d she protested as her son shoved her strongly against a counter.  \u201cYou talk too much,\u201d he said sternly as he bent down nearer to her.  He pressed his lips hard against Beverly\u2019s.  She struggled and tried to yell but could not.  Then something happened\u2026spherical objects began to make their way up from Nick\u2019s belly, into his mouth, and into Beverly\u2019s.  The objects were thin, slimy, mucus-soaked balls\u2026.eggs in fact.  (*Go with me on this; they\u2019re aliens.  The males can lay eggs.)  As Nick kept his lips pressed firmly to his mother\u2019s, the eggs came faster and faster, each its own lump that Traveled from Nicks\u2019s belly to his mouth, then into the body of Beverly Trask.  In all, 10 to 12 of them flowed into her.  Nick broke the embrace and stepped backward away from the woman, breathing heavily.  He wiped a bit of mucus from his mouth to his thin shirt sleeve.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly staggered back against the wall, her chest heaving as she struggled to catch her breath.  She did not even know it, but the eggs had already affected her.  The eggs did not, strictly speaking possess her body, but they had begun to secrete a chemical to her brain, one that would change the way her body worked.  It was a mechanism by which the eggs were kept safe even if the one carrying them was of a different species.  This chemical made Beverly very calm and docile in general.  She would be inclined very much to listen to Nick, doing anything he told her to do.  To provide the babies with enough nutrients, the chemical would increase her appetite a bit, and it would give her a taste for fairly uncooked red meat for the sake of protein.  Beverly would not notice the differences, but they would be present just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick walked over slowly and lifted up the bottom of Beverly\u2019s blouse.  The 10 or 12 eggs had already caused a slight swelling of her belly, and he bent down and heard the eggs sloshing about inside her.  Putting her shirt back down, Nick backed up and addressed Beverly.  \u201cFind meat to ensure the survival of my young.  Do nothing to endanger your health or theirs.\u201d  \u201cYes, Nicky,\u201d Beverly responded, her mind made a bit hazy by the chemical.  She smiled lightly, happy to please her boy, and she sort of clumsily waddled toward the refrigerator.  Nick went into the living room and sat down.<br>\r\n1)\t Jennifer gets home soon.<br>\r\n2)\tNick says, \u201cI\u2019ll need more young; call more females and get them here.\u201d      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And as it did so, in the kitchen, Beverly got a steak out of the fridge and plopped it in a pan, only cooking it slightly before starting to eat it, tearing chunks of it off with her teeth. The bizarre scene played out for another 15 minutes, and Beverly just consumed the steak in time for the arrival home of Trask's wife Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm home!\" the perky young woman called out to her mother-in-law.

She ran her fingers through her permed, shoulder-length, brunette hair a couple of time and then turned around. \"NICKY!\" she exclaimed in delight, rushing forward to hug her husband. \"What are you doing home at this time sweetie?\" she then said, drawing away and looking up at him, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what to say, Trask just returned her stare for a moment, then he forced out a smile, the alien realized that apparently it was what humans did when they were content. \"I got off from work for a while\" Trask then said, in a 'slightly' more interested tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...ok, that's nice\" Jennifer chirped. \"Hmm, that smells good\" she then said, sniffing at the air, catching a whiff of the meal that Beverly had been cooking before Trask's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Trask mumbled, nodding again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Jennifer frowned a little. \"Are you alright? You don't seem yourself!\" she questioned her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask cocked his head, thought a moment, then gave yet another smile. \"I'm fine!\" he stated bluntly. The alien inside of him then looked down at Jennifer's swollen tummy, and its smile quickly disappeared. \"I know right, I'm so big now, I can't wait until the little fella's out\" Jennifer laughed, running her dainty hands over her belly. \"Well, I need to pee, can you take all these bags upstairs for me please?\" Jennifer said, before kissing Trask on the cheek and disappearing upstairs as quickly as her delicate state allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at the bags, Trask then ignored them and walked back into the kitchen, where Beverly was stood, not moving. \"Continue preparing the meal and do nothing else\" he said coldly. \"The young female is with child, I cannot use her as an incubator\" Trask said, staring at his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are plenty of others you can use Nicky\" his mother replied, equally as cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time!\" Trask muttered, as he heard Jennifer moving around upstairs. Then he returned to the living room and sat down, leaving the shopping bags in the hallway and his jacket and shirt on the kitchen floor.</span></div></div>",

The being paced around the vehicle a few times, the heels of Brenda's boots clonking on the ground as it did so. \"But it will be sufficient for our needs\" he then said in a low tone. Both of them then got into the vehicle and the alien accessed Brenda's memories so it knew how to operate the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the passenger seat, the alien wearing Trask's form loosened the tie around his neck and looked at his compatriot. \"Take me to this creature's home!\" he said in Nick's own voice, getting a nod in exchange from 2112.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the tires of the car screeched and kicked up some dirt as it sped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking 5150 to Trask's home, the alien inhabiting Brenda's middle-aged body made its way to the police station.

The one thing the alien did do as his host body began 'overheating', was unbutton the top few buttons of Brenda's blouse, revealing the tops of her ample breasts, which seemed not to interest 2112.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unconcerned alien just continued going through the files, throwing the folders on the floor when they proved useless...one by one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hours rolled by, and the possessed officer continued to pour over the files one by one.  Still standing alone in the file room, Brenda went through each file as she looked for concentrations of strange, unexplained activity.  If the creature discovered a city block or a street around which there was a cluster of incidents no one could explain and no one had solved\u2014phone calls about suspicious activity, witnesses who suddenly changed stories, etc.\u2014that would be a good place to start.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature was so obsessed that it did not notice the hours pass.  Outside the dark, stuffy file room of the police station, the sun hung low in the hazy sky as the evening set in.  The humidity had made a miserable day, the kind where you can\u2019t get enough to drink, and you can barely move.  As the alien had stood transfixed before the wall of file cabinets, its host body, officer Nelson, had perspired further.  Sweat beaded down her face and on to her full, voluptuous chest.  The sweat hat added a sort of glistening shine to the officer\u2019s exposed skin and had collected on the heavy fabric of her dark-blue police uniform.  The wet cloth, already strained because of Brenda\u2019s full, wonderfully curvy figure, clung all the more to her sweat-soaked body as she searched away in the files.  Suddenly, she spotted something!  \u201cThis could be useful,\u201d she declared as she looked down at a collection of incidents that seemed to cluster around a run-down block toward the edge of town.  Around the block were a gas station, a few run-down apartment buildings, a small grocery store, and a few other things.  Looking further into the file, Brenda noticed a bunch of activity\u2014people suddenly acting out of character, becoming violent, only to seem fine when the police actually showed up.  When questioned about the odd occurrences, even the witnesses who had reported them seemed not to know what had occurred, or they seemed to suddenly recant their earlier stories, which itself was quite odd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature in Brenda looked up with a start as it heard a noise.  Looking suddenly sideways toward the door, Officer Nelson saw the door swing open and a young man begin to step inside.  \u201cOh\u2026oh Officer Nelson I didn\u2019t realize you were in here,\u201d said the young man in an apologetic tone.  Seeing the files strewn about the floor of the room, the young man looked surprised, \u201cWhat\u2026.what ah\u2026.have you been doing in here Officer Nelson?\u201d the young man asked as he closed the door.  The alien scanned its host\u2019s mind and discovered who the young man was.  His name was Jesse Wilkinson, and he was a 19-year-old criminology major at the local college.  He worked as an intern with the police department for a little bit of college credit and some experience, hoping one day to be a big-shot detective himself.  He was a skinny, awkward boy with dark glasses and a small stature, but he was admirably devoted to his job.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda thought it\u2019d be best to wait to contact Trask before going after the lead she had discovered\u2026.but here was this boy in her midst.  Brenda\u2019s possessor was intrigued.  The creature turned its vessel awkwardly toward the boy talking, exposing her front to him.  Immediately, the young Jesse began to blush.  \u201cOh\u2026oh gosh Officer Nelson,\u201d he said trying to maintain his composure and trying desperately to look somewhere other than the sweaty, shiny, and jiggly chest of the possessed officer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesse, are you\u2026experiencing illness?\u201d Brenda asked.  She walked jerkily toward him, her chest and all her wonderful curves bouncing a bit with each labored step. \u201cOh\u2026..oh\u2026.ahhhh\u2026.jee\u2026\u2026you\u2019re ah\u2026ah\u2026\u201d Jesse stammered, pointing in the general direction of the possessed woman\u2019s cleavage.  She looked the boy over, more with interest than with anything resembling emotion, \u201care you\u2026.\u201d she began, \u201care you aroused?\u201d she said glancing down at the bulge in his pants.  Jesse reached a whole new level of uncomfortable, \u201cAma ama ama\u2026.am I what?\u201d  he eventually stammered out.  \u201cWould you like to have intercourse?\u201d Nelson asked in her monotone, emotionless voice, though she did reach her hands up and undo a few more buttons on her shirt, bringing her bouncy cleavage and lacy bra further into view.  The boy was practically hyperventilating now, \u201cYou\u2026.you\u2026.ya. ..yahhh\u2026..you\u2019re old enough to be my mother!\u201d he exclaimed, eyes darting about the room but always finding their way back to Brenda\u2019s middle-aged, wonderfully full breasts.  The alien inside her just cocked its host\u2019s head with curiosity, \u201cIs that pertinent to mating?\u201d she asked plainly, reaching her arms up and putting them on Jesse\u2019s shoulders, pulling him close to her.<br>\r\n1)\tHe\u2019s a red-blooded male; of course they do it!<br>\r\n2)\tHe is too damn nervous and ducks out the door, leaving the possessed Brenda standing there alone.<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The alien stood there in Brenda\u2019s voluptuous body, drenched in sweat with her heart racing.  Without emotion, the creature cocked Brenda\u2019s head in bewilderment.  He glanced down at his host\u2019s heaving breasts and lacy bra, her wide hips and meaty thighs.  \"This is not logical,\u201d the alien declared as he ran Brenda\u2019s hands over every full curve of her form, \"this body is well-proportioned; its breasts and posterior are desirable according to our records of human standards.  Perhaps the boy is defective,\u201d the creature concluded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the search, Brenda reached into her pocket and pulled out a cell phone, which she used to phone her colleague, the alien inside Trask\u2019s body.  \"I have found a place worthy of our attention,\u201d she told him flatly, \u201ccome to retrieve me and my host at this body\u2019s place of employment, and we will search together.\u201d  \"Understood,\u201d Trask responded.  Brenda stood motionless in the heat of the evening as her body perspired in the unventilated file room.  After a few moments, the creature walked Brenda\u2019s body out of the station and into the car where Trask waited, eliciting more than a few gawks along the way, given her exposed breasts' bouncing about with every step.  Trask waited in a car outside, and the creature robotically maneuvered Brenda\u2019s body into the passenger seat of the car.  The two rolled through the city streets toward the location of the anomalies Brenda had noticed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I attempted mating,\u201d Brenda declared to Trask, \"its breasts and rear are especially desirable,\u201d she said as she reached up and cupped the mounds on her chest, \"the young man with whom I tried to mate seemed\u2026.excited but too nervous\u2026..and he left.\u201d  \"I trust the incident was the boy\u2019s fault,\u201d Trask replied plainly, \u201cyour form is pleasurable to my host\u2026.he is\u2026..stimulated\u2026.by the curvature of your form.\u201d  The two officers rolled on in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they reached the area of town where the anomalies had occurred.  Trask brought the car to a stop on a street that, like the rest in that area, was fairly run-down.  A few disheveled passers-by walked about among the run-down buildings and dilapidated stores.  Brenda and Trask got jerkily out of the car, looking over the area for some clue as to where the hunted man might be hiding.  \"Be on the look-out,\u201d Brenda told Trask, \"if the human knows enough about his powers, he may be hiding inside a body.\u201d  The two officers strolled through the streets, eliciting more than a few odd looks, especially as people noticed Brenda\u2019s exposed chest.  Then Brenda noticed something.  \"Stop\u2026there,\u201d she said to Trask, pointing to the odd thing she had noticed, \"she\u2019s not like the others,\u201d Brenda said as she pointed to a woman who stood out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to a woman of about forty, Judy Ying.  Ms. Ying was a beautiful woman who had come to the United States from South Korea at about age 5.  She had a slim figure with breasts of moderate size and hips that swung back and forth with each step.  Her long dark hair hung down far below her shoulders, and she wore a tight-fitting suit that hugged her firm form.  The plunging neckline drew attention to her chest.  She didn\u2019t belong in this neighborhood, though.  This was a neighborhood of outcasts, people with industrial jobs who couldn\u2019t afford to leave as their wages fell and factories closed up shop.  Those who lived here did so only because they had no other options, but this woman was different.  Judy Ying was a prosecutor, and a quite good one at that.  She was an educated woman by any standard, and she had a fairly healthy and steady paycheck.  She didn\u2019t have to be here, so why was she?  Brenda and Trask examined her as she walked down the street heading their direction.  Brenda\u2019s eyes focused\u2026as she looked closely, she could see something surrounding the attorney.  Wisps of grey smoke seemed to emanate from her body as she walked.  Mere humans would not have noticed this, but the aliens inside Trask and Brenda could tell, and it was a red flag.  The officers looked at each other, excitement obvious in their hosts\u2019 eyes.  \"We must pursue her,\u201d Brenda declared, and Trask nodded.  The two set off with some hurry toward Judy Ying, or at least toward her body.  The two awkwardly jogged toward their quarry, Brenda\u2019s curvy body shaking and jiggling with each step, as did Trask\u2019s fat ass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYing turned down an alley, and the officers caught up with the unsuspecting woman.  As they neared a dead end, Ying turned around, a bit surprised.  She glanced over at Brenda, \"Hey babe,\u201d she said walking toward her, \u201cwanna give me a squeeze of those big, juicy melon\u2026\u201d  Then she abruptly stopped as the alien reached Brenda\u2019s hand out and grabbed the woman by the throat, lifting her clean off the ground and slamming her into a brick wall.  The alien had imbued its lovely host with superhuman strength.  \"Be silent!\u201d Brenda said, with Trask at her side, \"you have stolen our technology, and you will pay!\u201d  Ying struggled and gagged, kicking her feet to no avail.  With her free hand, Brenda reached up and grabbed Ying by the mouth.  She began to\u2026sort of pull.  As she did, a swath of grey smoke began to emerge from the lawyer\u2019s mouth, while she gagged.  Brenda pulled more and more, and more smoke came.  Finally all of it was out of her, and her body went limp, so Brenda dropped it roughly to the ground.  Judy Ying lay there, out cold.  The grey smoke coalesced into something like a human form; it seemed to struggle and kick for a moment, then it simply dissipated, as if taken by the wind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\u201d Brenda said angrily.  \"What?  What is the difficulty?\u201d asked Trask, confused.  \"That thing was not our target!  It was merely a clone!  He had sent a clone into her body,\u201d Brenda said as she gestured to the unconscious lawyer, \"he probably used the clone to help him mate with her, but we want the real thing, not the clone!  He would have returned to human form if he had been the one we want.\u201d  The two stood there for some moments as they looked down at Judy\u2019s body.  \"I think we can still use this one,\u201d Trask said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tThe alien inside Trask wants to use Judy\u2019s body instead of Trask\u2019s, at least for a time.  Keep Trask\u2019s body handy though.<br>\r\n2)\tThey have some kind of mind control device, something that will allow them to control Ying enough to help them search for Carl.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My host body recognizes this female as Judy Ying. She is a prosecuting attorney. Her expansive knowledge of this planet's legal system as well as knowledge as well as her vast connections are enough to use her already. But on top of that, she may recall how she came to be possessed by our target's clone. Her memories will be a valuable asset in our search.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda nodded in agreement. \"Well said. How would you propose that we use this female, Judy Ying?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask looked at Brenda with a grin. Suddenly, Trask's body fell backwards onto the sidewalk as the lizard-like alien stood over Judy Ying's sleeping form. The alien looked at the unconscious woman for several seconds, placing a hand on it's hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to inhabit Judy Ying's body?\" Brenda asked, wondering what her partner had in store for the prosecutor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien that until recently had been wearing the body of Nick Trask shook it's head and made a hissing sound before transitioning to a rather stressed English that had been picked up by spending the time in Trask's body. \"No. Other bodies too useful. This female will just be an aid.\" The alien then put it's hand on the holster that it was wearing on it's uniform. From the holster, the alien removed a strange looking gun. Brenda grinned once she realized what her partner had planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien leaned over Judy Ying and breathed deeply onto her face. Judy cringed from the smell and opened her eyes, only to gasp from the sight of the reptilian creature standing over her. Just as she was about to scream, the alien pointed the gun at her and pulled the trigger. Rather than a bullet shooting out of the gun, it was a ray of light that seemed to be adsorbed directly into Judy's eyes. Judy's body stiffened up as the light entered. Her eyes glowed brightly for several seconds before the light dissipated and they returned to their usual color. Her body then relaxed and Judy stood up, brushing the dirt off of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy Ying, correct?\" Brenda asked as the alien returned the gun to his holster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy nodded politely. \"That is correct, mistress\" she said as the alien pressed a button on his belt, becoming transparent in preparation to repossess Trask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to aid my partner and I in capturing the human who stole out technology and put one of his clones into you for his enjoyment. You are also to aid us in any experimentation that we may have interest in while on this mudball. Is that understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Judy nodded politely. \"Yes mistress\" she said once again in a submissive voice. Trask's body shook just a bit as the alien reentered his unconscious body. Once the possession had finished, Trask's eyes opened and he stood up, cracking his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take it from here\" he said to Brenda before looking at Judy and smiling. \"Aside from reprogramming your rather small human brain to serve us, the control beam that I shot you with has also opened your memory banks. Whatever was erased thanks to the effect of our technology has been restored. Please tell us everything that you remember.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy nodded. Without skipping a beat, she began to tell her story to her new masters. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After waking up and walking around the city for a bit, Carl had found his way to his usual diner where he was thinking out the rest of his day over his usual coffee and omelette. Suddenly, a gorgeous girl walked into the diner. She looked to be somewhere between 18 and 22 years old and had long golden blonde hair with a few black stripes mixed in. She wore a tight black tank top, black leggings and pink scandals. Carl could barely contain his boner just watching the girl as she walked inside and sat down by the cashier and ordered a salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Carl now knew exactly what his powers were and how to use them, he decided that the first person that he should possess himself might as well be this bombshell. Carl ate his food slowly, catching glances at the girl as he did to make sure that things would be timed just right. Once the girl was just about finished with her meal Carl got up and headed to the bathroom in the back corner of the diner. After locking the door to ensure that no one would find him, Carl sat on the toilet and closed his eyes, concentrating on leaving his body. Carl felt his body shaking and then noticed a white outline around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stood up to find that his body remained on the toilet, appearing to be unconscious. Carl himself was now a white transparent spiritual version of his own body. \"Damn this is fucking strange!\" Carl yelled, not worrying about being heard since he knew that no one could see or hear him in this form. Carl then stepped right through the bathroom door and into the diner where the girl was now paying for her food. Carl smiled as he confidently walked over to her and stood next to her, letting himself get a closer look. To Carl's surprise, the girl was even hotter up close. Her tank top showed off her huge rack and was also not long enough o cover her midriff, revealing a diamond naval piercing. Her leggings complemented her wonderful ass and Carl now noticed that her toenails and fingernails were painted black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you very much\" the girl said to the cashier as she finished paying for her meal. Carl noticed that although she certainly had a sexy voice, it didn't sound particularly confident. Also, her hand was shaking nervously which was a sign that Carl learned to pick up on after years of being a con man. \"I wonder what you're so worried about, baby\" Carl said with a grin as the girl opened the door to walk out of the diner. The moment that she stepped outside, Carl took a moment to admire her ass before walking straight into her body. The girl stiffened up for only a second as Carl's spirit forced himself into the driver's seat. Her eyes became glazed over by what appeared to be white smoke before returning to their natural brown color. An evil grin that would have looked more natural on Carl's face appeared on her beautiful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck yes!\" she exclaimed, immediately moving her hands onto her breasts and giving them a tight squeeze which was followed by a moan of pleasure. \"Oooh shit, this is too good to be true!\" she said before quickly removing her hands and looking around. Luckily, there weren't too many people that seemed to notice her little outburst. \"Fuck, I have to remember that I'm in public. Still, this isn't my body so it's not my fucking problem if this bitch makes a scene\" she said with a grin before looking back at the diner. Carl's dream had explained to him that his body would be out of commission while he possessed someone else, but the diner bathroom wasn't the best place for his body to be stored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl turned the girl around and walked back into the bar, strutting inside far more confidently than the girl had done before. \"Excuse me, but would you mind if I just used the little girl's room quickly?\" She asked, making puppy dog eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier blushed before answering. \"S..sure...it's in the back\" he said, clearly trying to avoid looking at the girl's boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, handsome!\" Carl said, blowing the cashier a kiss before walking to the back of the diner, giving her hips an extra sway as she did. As Carl got to the back of the bar, he placed his stolen body's hands on the Men's bathroom door. Carl concentrated and exhaled, watching as a white puff of smoke exited the girl's mouth and slipped through the small gap between the floor and the door. She grinned as she heard the toilet flush. Seconds later, the door opened, revealing Carl's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, looking hot, boss! What a steal!\" 'Carl' said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud, knucklehead. And this bitch's name is Kate so you might as well call me that to avoid any suspicion\" the real Carl said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Carl nodded. \"Gotcha boss...I mean 'Kate.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Here's the deal. You're a clone of me that I put in the driver's seat of our body. You're gonna continue on with our normal life while I'm in this slut. Just stay out of trouble and stay safe, got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Have fun\" the clone said with a wink before returning to his seat to finish the meal that Carl had started earlier. The possessed Kate grinned and then entered the woman's bathroom. Once the door was closed and locked, the girl's shirt came right off followed by her bra. She grabbed her dangling breasts and gave them another hard squeeze causing her to moan in pleasure once again. Then she took off her leggings and sat down on the toilet just before inserting her finger into her clean shaven snatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\nA little under 15 minutes later, a redressed Kate exited the diner bathroom and walked back to the cashier. She immediately pulled him into a deep kiss. \"Thanks for letting me use your bathroom\" she said to him. Before he even had a time to respond, Kate had already left the diner and was now walking through the street. While she had been \"getting to know herself\" physically, she had also been getting to know herself mentally. She now knew everything that there was to know about herself. Katherine 'Kate' Winthrop was 21 years old and did not have a very happy life. She had been raised in an orphanage for most of her childhood before running away and living on the streets for a few years. She had been found by one of the cities most popular pimps, who offered her a life of luxury in exchange for providing sexual services for him and his customers. Kate had recently been arrested for prosecution as well as drug possession but had struck a deal with the prosecutor, a surprisingly attractive Asian woman named Judy Ying. In exchange for information on her pimp, Kate was going to be released and sent back to her work. Once she knew her pimps latest hide out, she would report it to Ms. Ying. Once everyone was arrested, Kate would be given a minimal sentence. The reason that Kate had been so nervous at the diner was because she was on her way to give Judy the location of her pimp and then let herself be taken in for her jail time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Katie. You're a girl right from my own heart\" Carl said in Kate's voice as he thought about some of the ways that her life had mirrored him. Carl had grown up on the street and even lost his virginity to a hooker working for the same pimp that Kate was employed by. \u007fUnfortunately, there was nothing that Carl could do to change her fate. Even if Carl turned her around and went back to her apartment for some fun, she would still be killed by the pimp if she didn't retain her job for him. she was not an ideal body for Carl to occupy long term. Judy Ying on the other hand, was very promising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, Kate found herself in a dingy apartment building. She went to room 32 and knocked four times, the arranged code. The door then opened, revealing Judy Ying. \"Kate, I'm so glad that you came\" she said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be for long, bitch\" Kate said as she closed the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call me?\" Judy asked, confused. Suddenly, Kate pounced on her and kissed the prosecutor deeply. During the kiss, Carl shot a clone into Judy just before pulling away. The Asian woman's eyes became filled with the white smoke and then her look of horror was replaced with the same evil smirk on Kate's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for some fun, boss?\" Judy asked, pulling off her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, you idiot!\" Kate exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy frowned and put her clothes back on. \"What's the matter boss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time these two spoke, you told this bitch that you'd have other here, is that true?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy frowned and seemed to be thinking. \"Yeah, the next room over is filled with a whole team of cops waiting for the address of her pimp.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate nodded. \"So doing anything now would be a really stupid move. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to give you the pimps address and you're going to give it to those cops. Make sure that everything works out. After that, you're going to go back to my house and bang me. I'll be back in our real body by then. Okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, boss!\" Judy said with a grin, doing a mock salute. Once she left the room to tell the cops, Kate laid down on the couch and looked up at the ceiling. It was a shame that Carl would not be able to stay in Kate's body. While it was true that he could use his powers to get her completely off of her prison sentence, Carl just didn't think that she was worth it. Carl could possess anyone that he wanted to so it wasn't like Ka\u007fte was such a huge loss.On that note, Carl left Kate's body and flew out of the building. He'd do some experimentation with his powers and return to his real body right on time for some well deserved sex with Judy Ying's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Carl had no idea that the clone within Judy was going to be intercepted on her way back to his apartment. </span></div></div>",

Though the memories of her time while possessed by the clone would usually have been repressed, the control gun had brought those memories back enough for Judy to remember everything that she did while under the clone's control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the clone was bringing you to his house of residence at the time that we found you?\" Brenda asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy nodded. \"That is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the possessed girl explicitly said that she would be back in his real body by now?\" Trask asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" Judy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you tell us about the one who was in control of you?\" Trask asked. Occasionally, a clone would leave some mental overlap with it's victim that would only be perceptible if the memories were restored. Both aliens exchanged a look that revealed a hope that this was one of those rare times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was silent and appeared to concentrate for a few seconds before responding, \"I do not remember a lot. However, I recall the address that I was on my way to before the two of you freed me from his control. It is an apartment not too far from here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thank you Judy. Please wait silently while we decide an appropriate course of action\" Brenda said with a smile. Judy nodded and stood still as Brenda turned back to Trask. \"What do you think our next move should be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that we should go to this man's apartment and neutralize him before things get out of hand. Once we get him restrained we can figure out what to do with him. Depending on the type of human he is, we can either enlist him to work for us, or kill him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what should we do with Judy Ying?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask thought for a second. \"The man who found our device is expecting Judy Ying to come to his house. I do not believe that there is a reason to stop this. While he is distracted with Judy, the two of us can make our move on him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree very much with that course of action\" Brenda said. \"But we need to be careful. If the bodies that we currently inhabit are targeted by his clones, we should be able to burn them off, but if he himself tries to possess one of us, we do not know what will happen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then perhaps we should leave these bodies? We can turn them into our servants like we did to Judy and then make ourselves invisible. He will not be able to see us and it will give us the additional element of surprise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda nodded. \"That is certainly something to consider, but if we do that, we make these bodies vulnerable to clone possession. After all, we do not know how this man will react once he realizes that his clone no longer inhabits Judy Ying's body. I think we need as much of an edge as we can get.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is more worth it? The element of surprise, or potentially becoming outnumbered in the event of confrontation?\"</span></div></div>",

The alien used the same weapon as used before on Judy. The ray of light shinned onto Trask's eyes before they glowed brightly while his body stiffened. After a few seconds, Trask relaxed and sat up.  \"What is your command Master?\" Trask said in a monotone voice. \"I require you to resume your normal duties but remain patrolling the streets for any suspicious activity.\" The alien then accessed his cloaking ability  and starting walking alongside Brenda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the gym, Brenda and her unseen partner made their way to  the overweight teen operating the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brenda!

Let's keep up this momentum tomorrow morning\"  said Tina in a chipper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a series of women departed, Brenda and her partner entered the empty yoga room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brenda!!

Brenda's partner then shut off his cloaking device and walked in a circle around his future body. \"She will be acceptable.\" With that, the creature spat a green vapor at Tina's fear stricken face causing her head to drop. The creature then pushed the button on his wrist and walked into Tina's body from the back. After Tina momentarily convulsed, a long, reptilian like tongue shot out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to back in a host. Human's has such interesting anatomy\" Tina said as she examined her body in the mirror behind her. This female was different than Brenda. She had long, black hair, in a pony tail touching her lower back. Her skin was a lot more tan, along with the fact her body was just as curvy as Brenda's. The creature noticed the clothing that his host was wearing to cover up it's legs. \"This body wears such tight clothing, it shows human men her desirable traits\" it noted while studying his large rear and the lack of undergarments. The creature could see his body's nipples become visible through the clothing covering his breasts. \"Become a female will take time to become normal\" Tina said as she took her eyes of her reflection and looked at Brenda who was retrieving more of her host's memories. \"It was an adjustment, but I believe this will help up catch that idiotic, human criminal\" replied Brenda. Tina then took one last look at her cleavage and squeezed her chest. \"Let's get moving\" stated Tina before the pair departed the yoga room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He still felt that he had some control over the body but now he couldn't do anything about it. He looked around the inside of her mind and just saw a random jumble of fashion, boys and makeup. The noises were too loud and the colours were too bright, making Carl feel both nauseous and trippy. <i>\"LET ME OUT!\"</i> He banged against the mental barriers that constrained him, pushing desperately until he finally broke free and took control again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I'm controlling my body again!\" He looked back in the mirror. \"Well, kinda.\"</span></div></div>",

I e spent too much time working on it to let some WEIRDO like you to ruin it!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl felt a familiar tingling sensation as he felt his consciousness being sucked back inside to be replaced by Jazmine's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey lady! Stop doing that! Do you really think I wanna be stuck like this! At least you've got a body that matches your gender!</i> Carl smashed against the mental barriers keeping him regaining control. He felt them break quicker than the last time, probably because he had already weakened them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instantly felt himself gaining control of the body again as he tumbled out of the unconscious mind. \"Yes! Oh God, I think I've got a migraine...\" Carl mumbled as he clutched his temples with his delicate hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, no, NO!\"</i> Carl heard Jazmine rage inside his head. He could tell that she normally got what she wanted so she was becoming more flustered and frustrated. \"Calm down cupcake. You've got to stop or else we'll never...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl would have gone on to tell Jazmine about the aliens and how they'd imprisoned him in her body when he felt a quick left hook land square on his jaw. \"Ugh!\" Carl reeled from the blow- he hadn't expected that the girl could punch THAT hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"I can take control of individual body parts?! Cool!\"</i> Carl was then attacked with a rapid combination of a punch to the gut, one to the bridge of the nose and a quick uppercut to the chin. \"Please...stop...\" Carl pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                        ***<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a few feet away another young woman was stirring from her sleep. Gail was wondering why she was laying down on the floor. \"Eh, maybe yoga was TOO relaxing today,\" she told herself. What she didn't know was that two aliens disguised as middle aged women had sent her to sleep, alongside wiping her memories of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked her black locks with blue highlights out of her face and rearranged her bra around her DD knockers then dusted down her volt yellow workout attire. She had wanted to stand out today and she made a big show of it. She quickly looked around for her best friend, Jazmine, spotting her by the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to ask what was happening but stopped herself as she saw Jazmine punch herself across the face. \"Oh yeah, well take this!,\" Gail heard Jazmine say as she swung at the other side of her face. It was weird to Gail though (aside from the obvious reasons) - Jazmine had less of a feminine stance and her voice, while still hers, was gruffer and more masculine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                    ***<br>\r\n<i>\"Ha ha! This is fun!\"</i> Jazmine taunted Carl. \"Why you little...\" Carl muttered as he cocked up a fist and fired it back into his (Jazmine's) gut, injuring him in the process.<i>\"HA! Priceless!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was starting to get REALLY aggravated at Jazmine. He hadn't known that she could randomly control random parts of her body, let alone throw a solid punch (Jazmine had done boxing for 7 years and had been in many fights in previous years). It also annoyed him that even if he punched back it always backfired and hurt him more than it hurt her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a light popped up over Carl's head. \"Hey Princess-Punch-A-Lot? How about a taste of this..\" he started as he pulled down the tracksuit bottoms she was wearing. <i>\"What are you do-UGGHH!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't contain herself as Carl plunged first one finger, then two, then three fingers into her vagina. She was helpless as a wave of sexual pleasure flooded through her body. Carl felt their mutual body getting aroused and continued by using her free hand to gently caress her large boobs, causing their nipples to go erect. \"Like that, huh?\" Carl asked, now sliding his new fingers in and out of Jazmine's clitoris. Jazmine just moaned sensually in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                           ***<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room Gail was now completely confused and horrified by what he was seeing. First her best friend was trying to beat herself up and now she was publicly pleasuring herself where anyone could watch. She would never admit it but she was slightly aroused by it and she felt her pussy starting to get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JAZMINE! WHAT THE F*@# ARE YOU DOING!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl and Jazmine both quickly turned, looking like deer caught in headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWELL?! YOU GONNA ANSWER?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazmine's mouth flapped open a few times before...</span></div></div>",

Two officers stepped out, a male and a female, they were chatting and laughing, on about something or other that Carl didn't really give a fuck about. Before heading into the store, Carl noticed the male officer looking at him. Carl fought the urge to give the police officer the finger, and instead turned his head and cleared his nose, one nostril at a time. Carl then just groaned loudly and tipped his head back, closing his eyes for a moment. He then seemed to drift off into a sort of daydream, the half empty bottle of beer dropped from his hands as they hung between his legs. Then Carl's body jolted slightly...and just like that...he felt himself rising upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What the fuck!\"</i> he thought, looking around. He seemed to be off the ground, though that wasn't possible right...? Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" Carl then exclaimed, as he looked down at his body sat on the bench. He raised his hands in front of them and they appeared ethereal, like the rest of his body. He managed to float down and land on the floor, but then the obvious question entered his head. \"Was he dead?\" \"Oh man...this is fucked up!\" he said, starting to panic. Closer inspection of his body revealed that it was still breathing, and he calmed down a little. Perhaps inevitably, Carl thought back to his encounter with the weird meteorite or whatever it was. \"I can turn into a ghost?\" he frowned, skeptical at first...but then another look at his hands flushed away any remaining doubt. \"Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Carl looked back at the bearded guy he had argued with in the store. The fat fuck was sat in his car talking on his phone. Carl started walking towards his car and then stood in front of it, waving his arms. He apparently couldn't be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fucking whacked!\" Carl laughed in disbelief, then he headed back towards the store itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two police officers were inside buying some doughnuts, what a surprise. The male cop had a gluttonous look on his face. Carl could pretty much guess where all those snacks were destined for. The male cop was about 6' 1\" and definitely on the heavy side, but not overly fat. His female partner looked to be about 5' 6\", average build for a woman in her early 30's and had her dark brown hair in a small ponytail. From the look of her wide hips Carl could tell she'd popped out a couple of kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder...\" Carl mused, a wicked grin forming on his face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Probably some filthy rich douchebag living off his daddy's fortune. If I had as much money as that fucker did, I wouldn't be stuck in this kind of situation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl began unzipping his pants, he felt a bit light headed. Putting his hand against the wall for support, he started to sway back and forth. Barely conscious Carl muttered, \"What the hell is happening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, his body suddenly fell to the floor but Carl had not fallen with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... the hell? What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself and saw that he now seemed to be completely invisible with just a few small wispsof smoke emanating from him to indicate his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, since my body's on the floor, I guess I'm some sort of ghost now and if I'm a ghost, I should be able to possess people! Here I come asshole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl flew out of the bathroom in his new incorporeal form, just in time to see the \"asshole\" walking out of the store. As the fat man turned to close the door behind him, Carl quickly lipped out and leapt at his unsuspecting victim's face. The smoke suddenly became more streamlined and it began forcing its way down the man's mouth, nose and ears and with such sheer force that the man's eyes rolled back into his head, revealing only the whites of his eyes. The man's entire body shook violently and he let out a tiny whimper of panic before the inevitable occcurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Carl was swamped by a tsunami of new sensations. He was now wearing a silky black suit with a crisp white dress shirt and his body was no longer a bare skeleton but on the contrary had a distinctive paunch barely contained by the shirt. Instead of being completely bald, his head was now covered with thick curly hair and he had a greying beard growing right out of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fucking weird...\" Carl said before jumping back in surprise as he heard the rich man's deep booming voice instead of his own. Laughing to himself, he childishly mimicked what the man had said to him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dude, I haven't got all night you know.\" Roaring with laughter, he picked up the six pack the man had dropped due to the convulsions while being possessed and fished the man's wallet out of one of his numerous pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see... Holy shit, this asshole is Jacob Harlan? He and his family were the lawyers responsible for jailing me! Well now that I am one of them, I say it's time the Harlan household gets what they deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He lives at 335 Riverside Court. Well Jacob old boy, I think it's about time you get yourself home eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at his own joke, Carl was about to leave when he remembered his unconscious body in the toilet. Heading back inside, he found the clerk leaning over his unconscious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to see the newcomer, all the clerk saw was that the rich patron had come back in, oblivious to the fact that the portly gentleman was now possessed by the very same criminal he was currently examining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi, it seems like the asshole passed iut in the toilet, probably drunk way too much, the clerk said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was just about to fly into a rage at his smartassery when he remembered his current identity. Calming himself down he responded with a wide grin and said, \"Tell you what, I'll take him to the hospital and out of your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow thanks! This guy is always ending up in here so it'll be nice if I don't have to ring up the hospital or the police for once.\" With that, the clerk stood up and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to reign in his anger, Carl quickly tried to lift up his body. Surprisingly, it felt no heavier than a feather and he was able to easily carry his unconscious form all the way out of the store with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I just have to find this ashole's car,\" Carl muttered, luckily, the only one on the street was a sleek black car right in front. As Carl got closer, he realised that it was actually the latest BMW model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing well aren't we Jacob? Living well and living large, don't mind if I do.\" Carl said as he took the keys out of his pocket and put it into the ignition. Laying his body on the back seats, carl eased his now plump figure into the luxurious driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking down as far as he couls into the chair, Carl said,  \"You know Jacob, revenge is overrated. Now that I have these powers I could just take anybody's life and enjoy it for them, starting with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the rearview mirror to adjust his new curly hair and to straighten the custom made Italian designer suit he now wore, Carl slammed his foot onto the pedal and roared off into the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Carl weaved his way through the late night traffic, he found himself driving through a much classier neighbourhood with big mansions and extensive courtyards lining up the sidewalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be fun!\" Carl exclaimed and rubbed his plump hands together in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a right turn Carl felt his jaw drop as he now found himself looking at what was the larget and most luxurious mansion yet, with a sprawling courtyard and a gigantic fountain in the middle. Pulling up to the gate, a camera swivelled around to focus on him. For one paranoid moment, Carl was reminded of all those times he had been through this neighbourhood and having the people telling him that he better get away from their property and mind his own damn business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his enormous relief, the voice that crackled out of the speaker said, \"Good evening Mr.Harlan sir, just a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gates began moving away from each other, leaving Carl free to drive through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home sir,\" the voice continued as Carl drove past the speaker and pulled up in the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out, he quickly made his way to the back and picked up his unconscious body. Using the card and keys he had found, Carl made his way past the high security front door and quickly located Harlan's study. Finding a large empty chest within, he gently laid his body down inside of it and locked it. Apparently the chest had only been for decoration but now it would serve to hide his body so that he could monitor his orginal body's status as well as masuerade as Jacob Harlan, the respected lawyer, the loving husband, the caring father and most of all, the privileged asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading downstairs to park the car, he was promptly greeted by the sight of an elderly gentleman in a suit walking in through the front door. As he was pondering the identity of this new face, the old man looked up at Carl and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are sir. I've already parked the car. Take your shoes off and wash your hands before dinner please, I expect your wife will be home soon. You might wish to freshen up a bit before that as I doubt she will be accepting of your current appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he set off with a smart pace towards what Carl perceived as the sounds of food being prepared in another corner of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I suppose that's Jacob's butler. Well now he serves me but I better not display who I really am to anybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his formal black shoes at the door, Carl moved back up to Harlan's study room and spying a closet, he opened it up and picked out a smart black and grey pinstriped shirt. Changing out of the white dress shirt he had managed to spill beer on as he chugged the six pack while driving, he pulled it on and picked out a clean tie as well. As he left his soiled clothes in a pile in the corner of his study, Carl went into the bathroom to straighten up for Mrs.Harlan. Adjusting his suit slightly, Carl picked up a comb and brushed at Jacob's disheveled hair. However, he had not had much experience with this kind of activities being a career criminal and only made the tangled mess look somewhat less untidy. Figuring it would have to do, he examined his new face. Jacob had a naturally ruddy complexion but after guzzling six beers in a row, Carl now resembled a hairy tomato more than anything else. Washing his face to try to reduce the effect, he found that the beard kept getting in the way and so simply dried himself off with the face towel. Scanning round the room, his eyes fell upon a small bottle labeled \"Eau de Cologne\". Guessing that it couldn't hurt to try, he patted abit around his face and turned to look at his reflection once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before him, was the tall imposing figure of Jacob Harlan, with a full head of hair and an exquisite beard cared for by the tender management of Jacob Harlan, in addition to the new crisp clother he now wore, Carl completely fulfilled the role of the successful lawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuoting one of the cases he vaguely remembered, Carl took an accusatory stance and said to his reflection, \"Your Honour, it is my duty today to inform you that the accused is guilty of all charges!\" Although it wasn't quite what Jacob had said that day (indeed Carl had gotten the entire sentence wrong save the starting), he still felt powerful and he completely embraced the new position which had been thrust upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fatass, let's go have dinner with our wife, hope you at least had the sense to marry somebody beautiful, after all I may be having some fun with her considering your impressive 'equipment'.\" Carl said as he glanced down at the black pants he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to leave the bathroom, Carl took one last glance at Harlan's face in the mirror and headed downstairs...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While waiting for Harlan's wife to return home, Carl took himself on an introductory tour around the house using Harlan's memories. Although he was possessing his body and thus had access to his mind, it seemed that Jacob was subconsciously fighting against Carl's spirit causing Carl to have a constant trickle of information. Although he would eventually learn all about Harlan, for now it was barely enough to be able to impersonate him at work, let alone to his wife. However, he had managed to assimilate some of Harlan's ticks and idiosyncracies and found himself doing them without thinking. As he stroked his new beard thoughtfully (Carl would normally never even deign to think), he realised he would have to devise a system where he could live as Harlan, sustain his body and also possess other people whenever he wanted. Easing his now plump form into an armchair, he absentmindedly opened a hole in the wall, where Harlan stashed his secret supply of cigars. Taking out a lighter, he set it aflame and left it dangling in his mouth. Eventually, with Harlan's mind and wits, Carl was finally able to devise a plan where he would bring his own body food and water as Harlan, leave the asshole lawyer's body and re enter his own in order to nourish it. He would also be able to leave his body in the confines of the chest and go out into the neighbourhood to wreak havoc, after all there were so many little lives to play with, so many people who were undoubtedly more fortunate than him and so many ways to have fun with the powers that had been handed to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Carl heard the low hum of a car coming closer and looking up, realised he had somehow made his way into the library. Hastily putting out the cigar, which he wondered how he had ended up smoking in the first place, he tossed it into a Ming vase on the way out, after all it now belonged to him and he was free to choose what to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a part of his act as Harlan, Carl walked up the steps to the second floor, only to walk down again moments later, in order to make it appear as if he had been waiting for \"his\" wife in the study and was now coming down to welcome her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door knob turneed and in anticipation, Carl liftd up his arms and spread them out, as if he was the tender husband offering a loving embrace to his spouse. Rolling his eyes at the strange things that married couples do, he quickly focused again as a slender foot in a high heel appeared teasingly from behind the door. His attention captured, Carl watched as a tall lady in a wide brimmed hat and a strapless dress emerged as she closed the door behind her. Barely catching himself, Carl managed to hurriedly boom out \"Welcome home darling!\" At that, the lady tilted her head upward and Carl's mind went reeling. He knew that a rich man like Harlan would be able to easily find a pretty wife but Mrs.Harlan was absolutely stunning. Where her husband's hair was black and short, hers was ginger and trailed past her shoulders. The two pale grey eyes Carl now looked through were contrasted by the sparkling green which was evident in hers. Her body was slim but not bone thin, allowing her to show her figure to its full extent as compared to the short pudgy body which Carl now occupied. Carl suddenly realised he had stared at the woman who was supposed to be his wife far longer than was considered acceptable but managed to squeeze out some of Jacob's charm to defuse the awkward situation. Taking hols of one of her dainty hands, he said in as suave a manner as he could manage, \"My dear, I apologise for my manners but you are... ravishing today.\" Although the line was so cheesy it could have made Carl lactose intolerant, the woman seemed to accept it as the corners of her mouth tugged at her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to think that you saw me like this just this morning, one would think you had suddenly suffered from short-term memory loss!\" She said in jest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this was somewhat true owing to the fact that Carl had only managed to figure out what Harlan had been doing at work today in the past half an hour, he thought it best not to say anything. Instead, he responded with one of Harlan's deep booming belly laughs as he followed behind her to the dining room. Taking a peek at his newly acquired wife's posterior, it was all he could do from licking his lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl joined his wife at the small ornate table meant for the two of them and made small talk as they waited to be served. Although Carl found it difficult with his hamperes access to Jacob's memories, he somehow managed to stumble through causing Mrs.Harlan to believe her husband was simply tired out from work as the conversation continued. Fortunately for Carl, the butler came out bearing two bowls of soup before he could do anything else to raise suspicion. Although he knew that with Harlan's income, the food he ate would be of a considerably higher standard, he had not expected there to be course after course of expensive and exotic foodstuffs. Having never been treated to this kind of fare before, Carl tuck in, grinning to himself that he would now be able to dine like this everyday, he spent the hour in pure ectasy, marvelling at the advantages of his new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carl's borrowed paunch began to threaten to break out of the shirt that contained it, he set down his knife and fork and retired with Mrs.Harlan to the bedroom upstairs. As she locked the bsthroom behind her to bathe, Carl decided to follow suit as after all, Lady Luck seemed to be shining on him tonight and if he played his cards correctly, he might find himself partaking in the most exclusive of all activities with the wife he now had.</span></div></div>",

After nearly burning his hands from the hot water gushing out of the tap, he flung his clothes off into the same corner where his discsrded shirt lay and draped a bathrobe he had found around his now plump figure. He struggled a bit to tie it round his waist, eventually giving up and resorting to a simple knot. He paced the room, thinking about how much he was going to enjoy this if he could pull it off. Frankly, Carl was aroused not only by the lovely Mrs. Harlan but also because he could have sex with her in her husband's body and no one would suspect a thing. Taking a quick glance at the clock, he remembered that if he wanted to return to his body tonight, he had to unlock the chest he had left it in and did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt jittery s he entered the tub, attempting to compose himself and clean himself as quickly and efficiently as possible, all the time reminding himself that it would be worth it, just to bed Jacob's wife. After a vigorous scrubbing and washing off, he seized a towel from the rack and dried himself off, nearly ripping out a chunk of his beard in the process. Finally, he grabbed a pair of boxers and pulled the bathrobe over himself again. Heading down the hallway, he closed the door of the master bedroom behind him just as Jacob's or now his wife stepped out of the bathroom, drying her hair. Trying to control his movements, Carl moved Harlan's rotund body behind Mrs. Harlan and embraced her from behind causing her to give a small yelp. The combination of Mrs. Harlan's beauty and the emotions Jacob's body felt towards his wife had caused Carl's borrowed genitals to become increasingly rigid. Although slightly shocked, Jennifer Harlan turned around to see the man she had been maried to for the past forty years, sporting a quickly growing erection and her expression changed from bewilderment to amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she sahayed towards the bed, slowly revealing more and more of her clothes as she flicked them playfully across the room. Carl quickly clambered onto the bed and laid himself beside her as they began to embrace and pet each other, becoming increasingly aroused as they did so. Finally, Carl could wait no longer and penetrated Harlan's wife, and the sensation of his penis entering caused Carl to reach even greater heights of ectasy. As the two approached climax, Carl was overcome with waves of pleasure and before he knew it, it was already over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly disappointed but satisfied, he rolled over onto Jacob's side of the bed, chest heaving and drenched in sweat. Jennifer lay beside him holding his hands, also slightly short of breath. She managed to pant out, \"Jacob, that felt like we had just been married all over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReviewing the memory in his head, Carl was slightly surprised that this plump lawyer had once been so wild in bed and chuckled softly to himself as he patted Jennifer's hands. Soon, he heard gentle snores emanating from her and knew that as fun as it had been, it was his cue to re-enter his body for the night. Wondering how he ws to go about doing this, he attempted to concentrate with all his might on leaving Harlan's body. At first , nothing happened and Carl begin to feel a little worried about whether he would be able to exit but then a sensation began building up in his chest and stomach, causing him to feel relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, his relief had turned to agony, as waves of pain swept through his body, causing him to feel like his chest and stomach muscles were splitting apart. Gasping for breath, Carl continued to endure the pain but it was like being showered in white-hot metal. As his body felt like it was tearing apart, Carl finally felt a small wisp force itself up from his throat. The pain began to subside as more and more smoke emerged from his nose and mouth. As the last tendrils emerged from Jacob, Carl watched as the lawyer's body, no longer controlled by the force of Carl's spirit fell backwards onto the bed, landing with a soft thump. Carl noted that despite the ordeal Jacob had been put through, he was still alive and breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, that hurt but I managed to get laid. Mrs. Harlanwas worth just about anything, even having sex as you, asshole.\" With that last insult, Carl floated away back to Harlan's study and entered his body again. Instantly, he felt dehydrated and hungry. Sneaking downstairs, he pilfered as much as his arms could carry from the kitchen and devoured it as he walked back upstairs. Deciding he had had enough of being Harlan for a little while, Carl decided he would possess someone else tomorrow. He just didn't know who... yet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Carl woke up, he realised he had failed to foresee the fact that all of his worldly possessions were still at his old home. Sighing to himself, he decided that whichever poor shmuck ended up as his body today would have to be used to bring it to him. Not even bothering to open up the chest and survey the study, he concentrated and soon felt the familiar sensation of losing his physical body. In his wispy form, Carl slipped through the keyhole and saw Harlan preparing to leave. As the door closed, Carl quickly managed to get through before it shut with a dull finality. Even though he knew he would return to it that night, he still wondered if leaving his body alone for so long was right. As Harlan and his wife went about their daily activities, Carl hitched a ride in the back of Harlan's BMW. Apparently, although he could see the wisps of smoke coming off him as clear as day, he was effectively invisible to mortal eyes. As Harlan drove through the streets, Carl waited patiently and looked out the window, hoping to spy someone he could have fun in. As Harlan turned a corner, Carl found himself in a familiar neighbourhood. Realising his old house was not far from here, Carl decided that this was as good a place to get off as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying, \"See ya, asshole!\", Carl aimed an incorporeal kick at Harlan, only serving to give him an extremely brief migraine. As Jacob clutched his head, Carl flew down the streets, looking for his apartment. Soon enough he had located his old residence. Wondering how he was going to get his stuff out, Carl suddenly remembered that not too far from here, there was a police station. After all, he had been arrested just as he was getting in to his apartment enough times to know where the cops had come from. It would be delicious to have one of them doing the grunt work for him. After a few minutes of flying, he found himself at the doors. Slipping in, Carl looked around, trying to find who he most wanted to take revenge against. Although he had had brushes with almost all the police officers, some had been more... relentless than others. Flying past the toilets, Carl almost passed on until he saw who was leaving. It was Lieutanant Bennett, the man who had given Carl his first prison sentence. Although it had only been one arrest, Carl had never forgotten how the man had been so determined to bring him to justice. It seemed fitting that the first police officer Carl would possess would be the one who he hated first even if there were other even bigger targets for revenge. Having made up his mind, Carl flew down into the oblivious man's path. As he drew closer, Carl readied himself and pounced just as he was within reach. Even though Bennett was unable to see him, it seemed that the man had some premonition of his impending doom as Carl leapt at him, his face had begun to form the smallest hint of a frown, that something was not quite right. By the time he had shrugged it off, Carl coincidentally landed on the breath he was about to take and rode it in. The man began to shake, jerk and he lost complete control of his body as he slumped to the floor, twitching uncontrollably. The officer tried to regain control but all he seemed capable of was uselessly scrabbling at the floor, wondering what was happening to him with his quickly diminishing control of his brain. As he struggled to piece together a final coherent thought, he blanked out. Now with Bennett's consciousness out of action for the time being, Carl's evil spirit assumed control of his pilotless body. As Bennett's soul slumbered, Carl filled out the nooks and crannies, seizing control of the muscles and organs for his own use. Finally, Carl invaded the brain, and as the last wisp of smoke slithered into the grey matter, Carl opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor next to the water cooler. Apparently Bennett had been thirsty and come out of his office for a sip. Wondering why the station seemed unusually empty, Carl looked at the board and saw that most of the offices were undergoing training and Bennett had apparently come in just to do a bit of administrative work. Carl tried sitting up and begin to orient himself to his new body. Bennett had once been a fit and healthy individual when he had arrested Carl but after working himself up to his current office, had decided to let himself go to seed. He wasn't fat per se but was beginning to put on a little bit more weight than average and his belly had begun to strain ever so slightly against his shirts. Sighing, Carl got up and returned to the office of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he searched the untidy desk for the keys to Bennett's car, Carl chanced across a picture of the entire force in a small black frame. Grinning to himself, Carl grabbed it and stuffed it roughly into his pants, it would come in useful for further ventures. Finally finding it under a small mound of paperwork, Carl waved goodbye to the officers that he walked past, smirking as he did. Locating the car, Carl got in, finding a box of aging donuts on the dashboard. Helping himself to one, Carl greedily stuffed his or Bennett's mouth full of the sweet pastry, licking his fingers when he was done. Looking into the rearview mirror, Carl decided to take the moment to fully examine his host. Bennett had an impressive handlebar moustache with the beginnings of a small goatee below his mouth. He had small watery eyes with brown irises. His eyebrows were bushy, nearly touching his eyelashes. Bennett had a head of neatly combed back brown hair but had begun balding, with a small patch beginning to form at the back. Carl was currently wearing a dark blue button-up shirt and a black tie with gray stripes running across it. He had on a pair of long black pants and shiny black shoes, the normal uniform of a police officer. Noticing the glinting metal badge proudly pinned to his shirt by Bennett, Carl grinned and childishly turned it 45 degrees sideways to indicate Bennett was not quite the cop he had been before. At least, not while Carl was in control. Around his waist was a holster and when Carl checked, sure enough he found a small loaded sidearm. Deciding he had wasted enough time, Carl turned the key in the ignition and smiled wickedly as the engine roared to life. Grabbing another donut and washing it down with the small cup of coffee on the other seat, Carl made his way back to his old apartment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl, tucked away inside the pudgy body of officer Bennett, pulled the car slowly into the pat-hole ridden parking lot outside his apartment.  He slowly climbed out of the car as he looked around.  The couple people who were walking about in the rising heat of the late morning eyed him oddly.  Carl chuckled as he pondered the oddity of the reaction; after all, the people who spied him were a couple local drug dealers and a hooker.  They hadn\u2019t a clue he was every bit their criminal equal, just inside the body of a cop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked slowly up the stairs to his apartment door, his host\u2019s jello-like belly jiggling a bit as he walked.  \u201cToo many doughnuts buddy,\u201d Carl said to the slumbering conscience of his host as he tried to acclimate himself to his new body.  Carl quickly picked the lock to his apartment and entered, looking around as he stood in the musty, dirty apartment.  It wasn\u2019t the best, but hey it was home.  Carl lumbered slowly around the apartment, picking up things here and there.  He picked up a tooth brush, his razor, a couple changes of clothes, and carried them back down to the police car, tossing them into the passenger seat.  Carl walked back up, locked the apartment door again, then set off in the direction of the police station for more fun inside his old adversary\u2019s body.  \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll find a hooker and use you to have a good time with her, provided your equipment still works,\u201d Carl said to his body\u2019s reflection in the rear-view mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl again reached the police station, hoping to crawl around in the belly of the beast, as it were, and perhaps get some other ideas of people he could possess later on.  Still inside Bennett, Carl exited the police car and headed back into the station.  He walked in like owned the place as the double door automatically opened when he got close enough to them.  Carl smiled as he looked around at all the cops who went on about their business having no idea who he really was.  Carl walked by an officer named Nick Trask, a man who had never arrested Carl but who was a frequent topic of conversation in jail cells, as he had arrested many others.  Trask was concluding a conversation with another officer.  Walking by, Carl heard him say \u201c\u2026just about to head in and handle a bit of the Harlan investigation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl immediately stopped, his interest piqued by what he had just heard.  He walked over to Trask and tapped him on the shoulder.  \u201cTrask?\u201d he said, and Trask looked up, \u201cwhat do you mean about a Harlan investigation?\u201d  Trask paused to explain, \u201cWell, you know Harlan?  The lawyer family in town\u2026.we think they\u2019re involved in some shady financial shit, and we\u2019ve asked a former secretary to come in and talk to us about it.  This is our first witness\u2026hopefully we\u2019ll get good stuff.\u201d  Carl nodded pleasantly and kept walking, trying to contain the alarm that had just sprung into his mind.  Carl quickly and discretely ducked into a near-by restroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Carl exclaimed as soon as the door closed behind him.  He paced quickly and nervously, the shined shoes of his host body clicking loudly on the tile floor of the men\u2019s restroom.  \u201cDammit!\u201d Carl said as he nervously ran his hands through the thinning hair of his aging host, \u201cthese cops are going to ruin everything!  How much use will Harlan\u2019s fat-ass body be to me if he\u2019s in jail?!\u201d Carl pondered as he nervously walked up to the bathroom mirror and beheld the body of Officer Bennett.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused as thoughts raced through his mind.  \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing to do,\u201d Carl declared to himself as he looked in the mirror, \u201cthanks for the lift fat boy,\u201d he said to his reflection as he turned around and headed into one of the bathroom stalls.  Carl plopped his host\u2019s plump body down on to the toilet and simply concentrated.  \u201cThis is gonna hurt,\u201d he declared as he began trying to eject his spirit from Officer Bennett\u2019s body.  Suddenly, Carl felt a terrible tightening and pulling inside his chest.  Bennett\u2019s whole body tensed up and began to spasm.  It was as though the body were being torn apart from the inside.  After a few seconds, wisps of smoke began to escape from Bennett\u2019s mouth\u2014slowly at first, then faster.  After a few seconds of that, Carl had successfully removed himself from the officer\u2019s body, which promptly collapsed back, unconscious, and slumped on to the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was right\u2026hurt like hell,\u201d Carl declared as he peered down at the unconscious officer.  Carl then simply phased his way through the closed door of the bathroom stall and out of the closed door of the bathroom.  Upon reaching the hallway again, Carl looked across the hall and beheld the person he knew had to be the witness, talking with a couple officers next to one of the interrogation rooms.  This person was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tMichelle O\u2019Brian, 45, a beautiful red-haired mother of three whose looks made her the object of affection of many men around the office, including Jacob Harlan, her boss.  Mrs. O\u2019Brian has a wonderfully full body with curves in all the right places.  <br>\r\n2)\tMindy Brixton, 21, who interned in Harlan\u2019s office last year for college credit toward her accounting degree and, as part of that position, handled some Harlan\u2019s incoming cash.  Mindy is a five foot four inch (and rather chubby) blonde girl with an infectious smile and a sunny outlook. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl looked across the hallway at Ms. Michelle O\u2019Brian, a 45-year old mother of three\u2014one boy and two girls.  Michelle had worked for Harlan\u2019s law firm for a number of years, during which time she had served as Jacob Harlan\u2019s secretary, among other capacities.  \u201cWow,\u201d Carl said to himself as he started invisibly at the beautiful woman.  See, Michelle O\u2019Brian was a wonderfully voluptuous woman.  At 45 years old, she was not exactly a spring chicken; indeed, she\u2019d given birth to three children, and her body indicated as much.  Her breasts were very large and seemed to jiggle like tubs of jello with each beautiful step she took.  Her belly had developed the slightest pouch that stuck out just a bit over her tight-fitting pants, presumably the result of stress and age.  The woman\u2019s upper body was clad in a white silk blouse through which a black lacy bra, struggling to contain the jiggling mounds on her chest, was visible.  Farther down, a set of wide, motherly, child-bearing hips swayed from side to side as she walked.  A set of meaty thighs were tightly encased in form-fitting black pants, and black boots were zipped up so that they came about half way up her lower legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to freshen up a bit,\u201d Carl heard the woman say to an unseen cop on the other side of a door, \u201cI\u2019ll do that and be in momentarily.\u201d  Michelle then walked, her hips swaying and ass jiggling slightly, into the women\u2019s restroom.  \u201cFucking figures she\u2019d go in there,\u201d Carl declared as he began to move his ethereal form in the direction of the door.  Carl was pensive as he phased through the door into the women\u2019s restroom, as he felt as though he were somehow behind enemy lines in there.  His eyes darted around as he remained unseen and noted no other presence in the bathroom but his own and Michelle O\u2019Brian\u2019s.  The beautiful woman stood at the in front of the sink and messed with her hair a bit in front of the mirror a few feet away.  Carl moved closer and admired the woman\u2019s wonderful body\u2014her voluptuous and curvy form, wonderful ass, jiggling breasts, to say nothing of her stunning green eyes and bright red hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou certainly got some meat on your bones in all the right places lady,\u201d Carl declared as he admired the woman.  He walked up behind her as she stood, oblivious to his presence, fixing her hair in the mirror.  \u201cNot sure how the hell to do this,\u201d Carl pondered to himself.  He slowly reached his hand up and began to phase it into Michelle\u2019s shoulder, but as quickly as he did so, she reached her hand up to her shoulder as if to scratch an itch, and Carl withdrew, a bit startled.  Michelle then went back to fixing her hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl waited a minute and took another deep breath.  He decided to try again, reaching his ethereal arm this time into Michelle\u2019s lower back.  As his hand phased in, the middle-aged woman began suddenly to shiver, as though she could somehow sense another presence in the room.  Suddenly, she spun around, a look of fear clearly on her face.  \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d she demanded with worry in her voice, her eyes staring right at Carl, though she didn\u2019t see him at all.  Her gaze darted about the seemingly empty bathroom in search of an intruder she could not see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of this, O\u2019Brian shook her head as if to get a grip on herself.  She turned back to the mirror and smiled at her own reflection in amusement.  \u201cThere\u2019s nobody there, Michelle,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cnow what\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stood behind her and chuckled.  \u201cNothing just yet,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut funny you should ask,\u201d he said as he moved decisively in the direction of the woman\u2019s voluptuous body.  Carl felt his ethereal form begin to merge into the woman from her back; he simply stepped inside of her.  Michelle\u2019s eyes went wide as she realized something was off, and her body began to jerk and spasm as Carl\u2019s ghostly form forced its way in.  The woman gargled and tried to fight the thing forcing its way inside her, but after a few seconds of jiggles and jerks, it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stood with his eyes closed.  A new fullness and firmness seemed to surround him.  Slowly opening his eyes, Carl noted that bits of curly red hair hung down into his eyes.  He reached up with his hand and brushed it out of the way, marveling at how dainty and feminine his hand was.  He looked into the mirror and saw the face of Michelle O\u2019Brian staring back at him, her expression one of awe and wonder because of her body\u2019s new occupant.  \u201cOh my go\u2026.\u201d Carl began, and then quickly clasped his hand to his mouth.  Needless to say, the feminine voice was not what he expected.  A smile spread across Carl\u2019s borrowed face as his feminine hands made their way farther down and directly to the massive globes hanging from Michelle\u2019s chest.  \u201cThese are fucking wonderful,\u201d Carl mused as he cupped the massive, jello-like mounds in his hands, \u201cif I had this bitch\u2019s body I\u2019d never leave the house.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl felt father down, his hands now exploring the woman\u2019s belly, including the slight pouch that peaked over her tight-fitting pants.  Next were Carl\u2019s meaty thighs and bubble-butt.  \u201cI\u2019ve never been a woman before, but I could sure as fuck get used to being inside you,\u201d Carl said with glee to his host\u2019s reflection in the mirror.  He then turned and made his way to the bathroom door, his host\u2019s voluptuous body jiggling with every step.  His hips swayed sexily from side to side, and his borrowed breasts let forth a wonderful shake as he walked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl opened the door and headed into the hallway.  Cops walked all over the place, and Carl\u2019s new body wasn\u2019t helping his nerves any.  Even tucked away inside Michelle O\u2019Brian\u2019s body, Carl was afraid he would somehow be found out as he made his way sexily toward the room with the waiting officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tCarl, inside the beautiful red-head\u2019s body, makes it to the room and is does his best to throw the cops of the trail off Jacob Harlan, or at least slows them down.<br>\r\n2)\tOn the way to the interrogation room just across the hall, Carl accidently bumps into someone and accidently jumps out of Michelle\u2019s body and into a new one.  Can he get his bearings and jump back into her body in time to stop her from spilling the beans to the cops?  Or did Carl\u2019s life just get more complicated?<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stopping in front of the interrogation room door, Carl inhaled deeply, getting himself ready to use Melissa's body to throw the cops off Harlan's trail. \"Let's give them your story, alright babes?\" he said smiling, a slight gruff tone overlaying Melissa's usual sing-song voice. Putting forward his right arm, he walked in the room. There was a gray, metallic table in the center, with two chairs on either side of it. Nick Trask, the cop from earlier, was sitting on one end, surveying Melissa as she walked in the room. Carl walked to the other end, still getting used to the extra sway, and jiggles from his new body. He sat down, and enjoyed the feeling of having a cushion there, with Melissa's ass providing a nice support. Her pants tightened up a little bit, and Carl felt her thighs become firmer from being held in place. He smiled a bit and looked down, with strands of red hair licking his forehead. Placing his hands on his thighs, vaguely aware of the other presence in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. O'hara?\" the officer suddenly asked, trying to get the woman's attention, as her mind seemed to be somewhere else. Carl roused from his self-admiration and looked at the officer. He noticed a mirror, most likely a two way, opposite from where he was sitting. Other cops were watching this interrogation. <i>Good</i>, he thought. <i>The more the merrier....I'm sure I can make this bitch give a good performance</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, sorry, I was distracted for a moment. Where were we?\" Carl asked, keeping a smile on Melissa's face and making eye contact with Trask. The cop seemed flustered for a moment, obviously taken aback by the gaze of such a beautiful woman.  Composing himself, he answered \"You were just telling me that you had some evidence that could help incriminate Mr. Harlan. Would you mind telling me what that is?' He was speaking clearly and loudly so the microphone would pick up every word, to be used for later research. Melissa raised one eyebrow, and looked past Trask, directly in the two way mirror. She was studying her reflection, looking in her own eyes.  with an almost disgusted look. <i>You bitch, I bet you always get in other people's business. </i> She then smirked and replied to the officer, \"Well, I may have exaggerated that. You see, as his secretary, I see the man every day. I am a little embarrassed to say, but after working with him for so long, I started to develop feelings for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask leaned back in his chair, a creaking sound making evident the stress his weight put on the piece of furniture. \"Feelings?\" he said, thinking to himself that he may have landed upon a dud. \"Yes Officer. These feelings became stronger, until one day I approached him, and offered to well...you know...have sex with him. I wanted him.\" Carl said, looking back at Melissa's reflection smiling, before continuing. \"The fact that he rebuked me because of his wife upset me greatly. So I made up the whole shady business angle. I wanted to get back at him.\" Carl finished, contorting her face into a sort of frown. He starting gently rubbing her thighs with her hands, beginning to get aroused that he was getting himself (or his other body) out of trouble. And he was doing it as someone else! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have no evidence to help me in my case?\" Trask said, obviously very pissed at having wasted time on this woman. \"No sir, I am sorry. I thought I should come clean\" Melissa said, still frowning.\"Ma'am, with all due respect, please get the hell out of here.\" Trask said, fuming. Carl got up, almost thrown off by the weight of his breasts. \"Gladly!\" He said, before practically running out of the office. Walking down the hall, he felt victorious. \"Good job bitch.\" He said to himself, in Melissa's voice. He was talking to her, and he hoped that some part of her could hear that. Passing the front desk, he heard a younger call for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am!\" the voice said. Carl turned around, streaks of red hair hitting his face, and his body jiggling a bit. \"You forgot your purse!\" the young man said at the front desk, and held up a Gucci bag that looked really expensive. Carl walked up to the desk and took the bag. \"Thanks doll\" he said, and winked at the young man. Walking out of the station, he opened Melissa's bag. Inside was her pocketbook, random items, and her car keys. Her Audi car keys. \"Hmmm, don't mind if I do!\" he exclaimed in Melissa's voice, an expression of joy on her face. \"I've always wanted to drive on of these!\" the possessed woman said, as people walking in and out of station observed her and her strange behavior. Pressing the lock button on the remote, he found Melissa's car easy. It was an all black, two door Convertible Audi. Unlocking it, he maneuvered her body inside, once again feeling the tightening of his pants as he got inside. Starting the car up, he looked into the rear view mirror. Looking directly into her eyes, with a smirk, he said \"Now let's see if we can't have a little fun as you babe. Consider this your punishment.\" He then kissed the mirror, leaving a lipstick imprint. Taking a handful of his breasts, he marveled at the feeling again. He squeezed them, his hands below the blouse but still above the black nylon bra, and enjoyed the feeling of holding breasts and having his breasts held at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered his possibilities....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Go to Melissa's house and pick around. Maybe she has some evidence lying around? You could also get familiar with her body in greater detail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Head back to Harlan's house, and leave Melissa's body.  </span></div></div>",

His vision blurred for a second and then returned. \"Hey, watch where you're going you fucking...\" Carl started but stopped. His voice sounded different and in fact he looked to be going in a different direction. He turned and looked to see Mrs. O'Brien walking away from him. \"What the fuck?!\" he grumbled and ran back to the bathroom, a pair of high heels clicking on the floor. He shut the door and looked at the mirror to see a young woman with large, fake breasts, a tight dress, large blonde hair and a small coat staring back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, I'm a fucking whore!\" he replied, the woman's voice affecting his gruff manner of speech. \"Shit, any other time I'd like being in a hot piece like this but I gotta get back to that old, fat bitch before she ruins everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he threw open the bathroom door but was immediately greeted by a cop, a black woman who didn't appear to be terribly old. \"Alright, Kiki. You said you had to go to bathroom but it's time to take you in for your booking.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booking? Shit, I don't got time for that. Get outta my way, bitch!\" Carl exclaimed as he reached out to shove the cop out of his way... and then in a flash he was looking at the hooker he had just been. He looked down and saw the telltale uniform of a police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" the hooker asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your lucky day, sweetie. You're free to go. Now get out of here.\" Carl stated as he marched in the direction of the interrogation room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Michelle nearly to the door and made a dash. However he bumped into someone and before he knew it he was in their body and not the cops. This gave him an idea and he proceeded to reach out, jumping from body passing to where the interrogation room was. However by the time he reached the end Mrs. O'Brien had already entered the room and the door was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, miss, but no one is allowed in or out while there's an interrogation going on. You're just gonna have to wait for your mom to come out.\" the police officer near the door said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom?\" Carl asked, he then turned and headed back towards the bathroom. He saw a girl in her early teens, her auburn hair pulled back in a ponytail. She was a pretty girl and her memories suddenly entered Carl's head. She was Sarah O'Brien, Michelle's 14 year old daughter; one of Michelle's three children along with her 10 year old sister Danielle as well as a 19 year old brother in college. \"Shit,\" Carl said, Sarah's sweet voice sounding much more gruffer trying to speak in Carl's style, \"I can't even go back into that fucking room. If I take her over while she's already being questioned they're gonna get suspicious. Guess I'm gonna have to wait until she finishes and hope that bitch didn't fuck the whole thing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave himself another look over: with her ponytail, jeans and zip-up hoodie Sarah was definitely tomboyish. \"I'm liking this body though.\" he smiled before turning back and heading back to the waiting area. There he saw another auburn haired girl, her hair longer and with freckles dotting her face. This would be Danielle it seems. Wanting to try something Carl reached out and touched her and immediately he was in Danielle's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' sweet!\" Carl said as he looked at his hands, \"Seems I can jump into bodies with a touch. Wonder if I can control it though.\" He reached a hand out and touched Sarah but this time didn't think about jumping into her body. Sure enough, he stayed where he was. \"This is fucking amazing!\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what was that?\" Sarah asked looking over at who she thought was her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, don't worry about it.\" Carl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a half hour later when Michelle came out. \"So how'd it go, mom?\" asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I told them I didn't know anything and they eventually got the message.\" Mrs. O'Brien replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, the fat bitch kept her mouth shut. Car looked at her and felt a kind of revulsion. Perhaps it was just due to it being his first female body but he wasn't sure what he saw attractive about her before; fat, saggy tits and skin everywhere. Old too. But her girls... ooh, Carl could have fun with them and their friends. Or he could just leave and find somewhere else to have fun. If he could be anyone why not enjoy it?</span></div></div>",

He was busy playing with Danielle's hair with one hand while the other began to move around her body when their mother piped up. <br>\r\n\"I'm gonna have to go to the store, so you two girls will be home alone for a bit.\" she said, not taking her eyes off the road.<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom.\" Carl said with Danielle's voice, trying to hide a smirk. This was a perfect situation; there wouldn't be any interference in the fun.<br>\r\nAs the two girls were dropped off at their house's driveway, Carl couldn't help but look at Sarah's ass as she entered the garage door code. As soon as she had finished, Carl reached out a hand and grabbed her ass without switching bodies.<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Danny!\" Sarah shouted as she whipped around to see her sister with a cheesy smile.<br>\r\n\"Uh, whoops!\" Carl said, grinning. \"Guess my, uh, hand slipped.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Sarah muttered as the two made their way inside. Carl saw that the interior of the house was very fancy, with expensive decorations in every room. Sarah made her way to the couch as she laid down and turned on the TV. Carl wasn't done with her just yet, as he used Danielle's body to bend over the couch and cup Sarah's breasts, jumping bodies in the process.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're getting a little touchy, sis.\" Carl teased with his new voice as he \"adjusted\" his bra. \"Maybe save it for when you've got some tits of your own.\" He reached out and grabbed his sister's chest as she leaped backwards with a squeal.<br>\r\n\"Sarah, what are you doing?!\" she stammered in shock.<br>\r\n\"Just having a little fun.\" Carl smiled at her. \"Care to join?\" Carl then willed a part of his soul out of his body and propelled it towards the young girl. Her eyes rolled back as it entered, but they soon returned to normal and she smiled at her big sister.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sis!\" Danielle agreed, feeling up her body as the clone got acquainted. \"Think this one's just starting to develop\" she mumbled as she slipped a hand into her shorts.<br>\r\n\"These bitches have any friends we can invite over?\" Carl said as he began to remove his hoodie, t-shirt, and bra, letting Sarah's breasts hang exposed. \"It'd be a shame to only let these two enjoy themselves.

So, dashing quickly across the street, noting the name on the sign, \"Teasers\", Carl headed towards the club, remembering how smoking hot some of the girls that had worked there the last time he was in it, especially one particular huge titted redhead named Strawberry, having had more than his fair share of lap dances from her, as well as spent a good few sleepless nights whacking off to her in prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh-heh, hope she still there,\" he chuckled to himself as he headed in the door, the bouncer, giving him a less than savory look as he entered, something that Carl was pretty much used to where ever he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, it was exactly as he remembered, badly lit, smokey, with a horrible purple and red color scheme, packed with fat, sweaty businessmen and sleazy two-bit thugs like Carl, not exactly the clientele you'd find at the Ritz. Fortunately, it was just hit kind of scene, and as he looked over at the main stage, he saw this gorgeous, skinny asian chick with fake tits wearing nothing but a thong, gyrating for the crowds and getting a whole heap of whoops and hollers in return. It had been a while since Carl had seen a naked women in the flesh, having just been released from his last stint in jail two days ago, so watching the stripper working her tight ass on stage instantly got his juices flowing, and he was glad he'd finally found an outlet for all of the pent frustration he'd worked up these last three months, rubbing his hands together with excited glee as he found himself a decent seat to watch the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this'll do nicely,\" he grinned, as he called over a waitress to get him a beer, \"Then maybe later I can see if any of these easy bitches want a roll in the hay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pretty blond waitress returned with his beer, Carl chugged it down, realizing that he was feeling surprisingly sober considering all that he'd had to drink so far tonight, his thoughts turning for a moment back to that weird glowing rock, or whatever the hell it was from earlier, having been pretty drunk before he'd touched it. \"Eh, who the fuck cares,\" he shrugged, returning his attention to the stage where a sexy policewoman was currently grinding a baton between her legs. Carl laughed at the sight, hating the cops with a passion and thinking to himself how awesome it would be if they were actually like this stripper, chuckling to himself, \"It'd make getting arrested a heck of a more fun, that's for damn sure!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took him a moment however to realize just who the guys were. They were Vladislav Karvitch and Dimitri Voskoy, the Serbian right hand men of a Russian loneshark (Oleg Bulgarin) whom he owed quite a bit of money to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Carl blurted out, as he sank into his chair and tried shielding his face from view. He cursed himself for having come into a place where these assholes would come looking for him, and all for the want of seeing a naked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking around, the two muscular slavs spotted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Carl vaulted over the railing in front of him and hurried for the back exit, with Vlad and Dimitri in hot pursuit.  Tripping over the leg of a chair in the darkened room, Carl unleashed a tirade of expletives as he hit the floor, before swiftly picking himself up. But his little mishap allowed his two pursuers to gain the ground on him that they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, what do we have here, a fucking loser who doesn't know how to pay back his debts!\" Vladislav growled in his heavy Serbian accent, as he slammed Carl up against a wall at the back of the club, still within whistling distance of the girls on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, look, please...I'm getting Oleg his money okay, I just need a little more time\" Carl pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all say that!\" Vlad laughed, punching Carl in his stomach while Dimitri stood guard. \"Unfortunately, your time is running out my friend, Mr Bulgarin wants you brought to him...NOW!\" he then informed a spluttering Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, the other patrons who could see what was happening, went about their usual business, not wanting to get involved, as did the pretty blonde waitress. With this muscle-bound henchman now pinning him against a wall with his shirt, Carl wondered for a moment if he'd come to the end of his miserable, dead-end life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started looking around the Strip Club, desperate for anyone to help him.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, \"Vlad\" was able to help him out. \"Dude, relax, I'm you!\" Vlad told a skeptical Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you're me, I'M ME!\" Carl responded, as he straightened his disheveled clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are, but so am I, I'm your clone!\" Vlad laughed, totally out of character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it!\" Carl mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVlad just let out a sigh, and as Carl watched him, he vaguely recognized his movements and mannerisms, they were exactly like his own. \"Okay dude, lets try this again, you can take over other people's bodies by sending clones of yourself into them, you know...possess them!\" Vlad told Carl, who at least started to think that maybe this wasn't as far fetched as it first appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That artifact?\" Carl muttered, barely audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" \"Vlad\" winked. \"Though there will be some people who are immune to your power, but not many\" he then explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's lips immediately curled up in a wicked little grin as he looked first at the unconscious Dimitri, then at Vlad. He then turned his attention back to the scantily dressed stripper attired as a police officer. \"Possession!\" Carl then whispered to himself, as his clone (still inside Vlad) dragged the unconscious Dimitri into one of the empty back rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, the clone returned to Carl's side and explained to him in detail the extents of his new powers.

Carl wanted to understand the details of how this worked.  After all, if he were going to use this to his advantage, he'd need to. \"I am thinking of a number,\" Carl announced to Vlad.  \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" Vlad replied. \"I remember everything about you before becoming Vlad.  Every emotion, desire, and memory that you have had are mine as well.  In addition for some reason know all the details of the artifact, but that's it.  Everything you've thought since is foreign to me.\"  Vlad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl thought about this for a moment.  Carl noticed that he certainly wasn't aware of everything that Vlad was thinking either.  He realized that their minds weren't quite the same, but close enough to be to his benefit.  Certainly they'd have the same goals and desires, as evidenced by the new Vlad coming to Carl's rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the hot blonde waitress walked by.  She looked at them with a strange look.  She had seen the altercation earlier and so she decided to keep going.  Carl saw her and decided to experiment.  He tried to push a copy of his consciousness into her.  It took him a minute to figure out how to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot blonde waitress suddenly stopped in her tracks.  She turned around and walked right up to Carl and Vlad.  \"Fifty Three,\" She announced as she approached.  \"That's the number.\"  She was of course correct.  Carl smiled as he looked over his newest incarnation.  This Carl was smoking hot and wearing a very skimpy skirt with a bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Carl started checking herself out.  She squeezed her breasts and ran her hands over her nylon clad legs right in front of Carl and Vlad.  She tentatively looked at her two mental twins.  \"I hope I don't regret deciding to do this,\" She said as she gave her new breasts another final squeeze.  \"And don't either of you think I'm fucking you.  Yeah, I know what you are thinking because that's what I would think.  Just remember, neither of you two would fuck a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Carl and Vlad's hopes were dashed slightly as that is what they had both been thinking.</span></div></div>",

She's hot as fuck!\" he said, showing his approval, before describing as best he could how to actually go about the process. \"All you got to do is concentrate real hard on her and kind of let your body go all limp, then all you have to do is float right on over there and her body is yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll give it a shot,\" he replied, taking a deep breath as he stared intently at the stripper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though, you might wanna take a seat first,\" Vlad suddenly added, grabbing onto Carl's arm, \"Otherwise your body's gonna end up face down on the carpet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at this, both men then walked back over to the booth Carl had been sitting at earlier, and taking a swig of his beer for courage, Carl began the process again as his clone kept watch over his soon to be lifeless body. At first it seemed as if nothing happened, as Carl sat there gazing at the girl on stage, willing himself into her, and he was about to give up out of frustration, when he then felt a rather strange sensation course through his body, as if he'd grown lighter all of a sudden and that gravity was no longer working against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck...\" Carl thought, as he gazed down at himself, finding that instead of his normal flesh and blood self, he was now nothing but a hazy, almost smoke like outline, hovering a good few feet above where both him and Vlad had just been sitting, \"...it fucking well worked!\" Turning himself over in the air and looking down at his former body, which currently looked like it was sleeping, Carl excitedly called down to his clone, wondering if he could see him, but finding that no sound escaped his lips, and Vlad continued to appear as if he was completely oblivious to him being up there. Chuckling at this for a moment, Carl's attention then went back to the stage where the stripper was strutting up and down, flashing her pantie covered ass to the crowd underneath her tiny little excuse for a skirt. \"Now for the next part,\" he grinned, heading straight towards her, his ethereal body gliding effortlessly through the air and over the rest of the unsuspecting patron\u2019s heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the stage, there was a gasp from the crowd as the stripper suddenly gagged, and her body began to spasm, almost as if she was having a fit (the resulting image being rather off putting to everyone watching). For Carl however, it was a much different experience; feeling himself almost dissolve as he came into contact with the stripper's beautifully toned flesh, his smoke like shape being funneled into a long, thin stream that began to push its way in through her mouth and nose. It was the strangest sensation as he entered her body, feeling himself suddenly filling out again, gaining weight and shape as the two separate beings instantly became one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what a fucking rush!\" he then gasped, finding himself now looking on the world with a new set of eyes, his voice no longer his own, but that of the stripper. To say it was slightly odd would be an understatement, as Carl's brain desperately tried to cope with all the information, as well as the strange new sensations he was receiving from his body. The first thing that hit him was the hefty weights on his chest, and looking down he saw the stripper's considerably large breasts pushing there way out of her bra, blocking out pretty much the rest of his view. It was really weird to be seeing tits from such an angle, and the rather restricting feeling of the tight bra on his flesh wasn't the most comfortable it had to be said, but still, Carl was utterly captivated by them, his gaze aimed directly at his immense new cleavage as he brought his slim, feminine hands up to his chest and gave them a good hard squeeze. \"Fuck me, that's hot!\" he smiled, feeling his fingers pushing into the firm, soft flesh, as well as two little tingling sensations from what was clearly his hardening nipples, a sensation that was quickly working it's way down towards his groin, where one of his hands instinctively now headed. Rubbing a finger over the material of his now pantie covered crotch, where his package usually sat, Carl instead felt the soft and delicate folds of his new, feminine sex, and he let out a rather throaty little moan as he gently prodded the area, feeling a distinct wetness forming in his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo caught up in his new female form was Carl, that he'd completely forgotten where he currently was and what his new body had previously been doing, that was until someone in the crowd suddenly shouted, \"Hey sweetheart, want me to help you out up there?\" followed soon after by, \"Come on baby, quit teasing us and get your fucking clothes off!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What do <i>I</i> fucking want?!\" Harry angrily responded, clearly not used to being talked back to in such a way by one of his strippers, his rather fat, grizzled face turning a deep shade of red. \"I'll tell you what I fucking want, I want you back on that fucking stage, that's what I want! You think I'm paying you to just fucking well saunter off whenever the hell you feel like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was of course used to dealing with people like this; greasy two-bit assholes who thought they were the lords of all just because they'd somehow managed to get themselves a tiny bit of power, treating others like crap and managing to get away with it. Most of the time he made sure they didn't <i>just get away with it</i> (which was one of the reasons he'd landed himself in jail so often), having no patience for people who thought they were better than him, and he was sorely tempted to just clock this fat, sweaty fuck square in the face to take him down a peg or two. However, just as he gritted his teeth and clenched his fist ready for action, he remembered that this was no longer his body he was in...this was a woman's body, a petite, waif of a woman who probably didn't even have the arm strength to cause any real pain. Add to that the fact that this was Harry's club and Carl and his clone were surrounded by not only Harry's clientele but his employees as well (the bouncer directly behind him looking particularly imposing), there was only one real way a fight like that could end. No, it was time to play it safe, after all he'd just placed a copy of himself inside a Serbian thug and possessed a female stripper, he didn't really want to draw anymore attention to himself than he had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What are you doing still standing here, get your pretty little ass back on that fucking stage NOW!\" Harry continued, no longer waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly on his feet, Carl looked over at \"Vlad\", indicating with a glance to go along with whatever he was about to say, as acting all put out, he explained to the club owner, \"But what about Mr. Bulgarin? I can't leave him waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis clearly confused Harry, as he snapped back, \"What? What the fuck are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Bulgarin. This guy here's employer,\" Carl continued, indicating towards \"Vlad\", \"He told me he's requested to see me.\" The mere mention of this name seemed to catch Harry's attention, just as Carl had hoped, as his anger quickly lessened and was instead filled with a sort of concerned reverence. \"<i>Bulgarin?</i>\"  Oleg Bulgarin?\" he asked, knowing full well who Carl meant, the Serbian lone shark being quite a intimidating presence around this part of town, especially in seedy joints like this where many of it's patrons had ended up with either broken fingers, arms, legs or even worse after dealing with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is correct. Mr. Bulgarin would very much like the presence of this young lady's immediate company,\" \"Vlad\" then interjected, going along with the ruse, standing up quickly from his seat, showcasing his impressive stature (as well as doing his best to block Harry's view of the seemingly unconscious man behind him) and doing his best to imitate Vlad's pattern of speech, \" He sent me down here to personally escort her to him. And Mr. Bulgarin does not like to be kept waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, of course not...who, uh, who does?\" Harry stuttered, becoming quite flustered as he desperately tried to cover his tracks, \"It's just I, I didn't realize he was a fan of Chloe here, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Harry clearly following for his lie, Carl decided to wrap things up, asking, \"So...what do you want me to do? Go with him, or get back on stage?\" acting naive and innocent like the compliant young stripper he appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that obvious? You go with him, you silly girl!\" Harry barked, knowing full well of Bulgarin's reputation and wanting to survive the night with his balls in tact. \"You heard the man. Mr. Bulgarin doesn't like to be kept waiting, so off you go. Get moving!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Carl turned again on his heels, smiling happily to himself that his trick had worked and that his lying skills hadn't diminished any during his last stint inside. \"Nicely played, dude,\" \"Vlad\" told him with a chuckle as the two of them headed toward the exit, Carl assuming that the two Serbian heavies must have a car waiting outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they left the club however, Carl suddenly remembered his lifeless body was still slumped against a chair inside. \"Oh shit, I forgot about my own fucking body! It's still inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, just clone that bouncer and get him to go retrieve it,\" \"Vlad\" told him, clearly wanting him to get used to his new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, fucking A!\" Carl replied, remembering that he could do that now, chuckling for not thinking of it himself (although in a way he guessed, technically he did). Looking towards the bouncer, he then tried to replicate what he'd done to Vlad, as well as remember what his clone had told him about his powers, willing himself into his large, muscular frame. About a second or two later, both Carl and \"Vlad\" watched as the bouncers eyes clouded over and he suddenly jolted slightly as if waking from a trance, before flashing the two of them a smile and heading into the club. \"Oh sweet, I didn't even have to tell him...I mean <i>me</i> what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" \"Vlad\" informed him, \"he's a copy of you, he knows everything you know. Just like I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, less than a two minutes later, the bouncer reappeared carrying Carl's body out the door, having positioned him in such a way as to appear like he was just some drunk being escorted out of the club as he made his way over to the both of them. \"You guys forget something?\" the bouncer smiled, passing the body over to \"Vlad\" before turning back round and repositioning himself at the door. Once again spurred on by his clone inside the Serb, realizing that having a muscular heavy around to help out was useful, but having some knuckle headed bouncer from a strip club was probably not, Carl focused on him again and tried pulling the clone back out of his body, finding that it was actually just as easy as placing one in. \"Fuck me, having these fucking powers rock!\" he once again laughed as the bouncer's own mind suddenly took back over, almost falling over in the process and looking more than a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing \"Vlad\" over to a fancy looking Merc parked not twenty feet from the club (having been right about the car being outside), Carl climbed into the passenger seat while his clone gently placed his former body in the back and waited for him to get in, using the opportunity to feel up his smoking hot body once more,still utterly amazed and captivated by the fact that he was now a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the plan now, \"<i>Chloe</i>\"?\" \"Vlad\" asked as he joined him inside the car, eying up Carl's sexy female form  himself, the same thoughts clearly running through his mind as they were through Carl's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think we should introduce ourselves before we get down to 'business', you know...be polite and all that shit!\" Carl laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't agree with you more buddy\" his clone winked, then he set off driving them back to Chloe's apartment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It may have been a few years since he'd last seen her, but she hadn't changed a bit, her body every bit as incredible; toned, slim and voluptuous, while her face all but screamed \"fuck me!\", her big brown eyes and full, red, pouty lips amazingly sensual and seductive, looking almost like Jessica Rabbit brought to life. \"This has gotta be my lucky night,\" Carl thought to himself as he gazed at her, the prospect of a lap dance getting him very excited indeed, as he sat up from his seat and made his way towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer, he could see she was clearly working her magic on the guy at the bar, pushing her large chest into his face and gently whispering into his ear, presumably hoping he'd cough up some dough and take her through the back for a private dance. Carl however, horny as hell (just from looking at her) wasn't about to let that happen, and noticing that the guy appeared to be pretty darn wasted, slurring his words and looking like he was about to fall over at any minute, quickly made his move, hoping to intercept and get a dance of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd watch out for this one, babe,\" he said with a grin, as he rocked up beside them, giving the drunk a friendly pat on the back, \"Looks like he might puke over those pretty little boots of yours at any minute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunk guy just mumbled inaudibly in response, while Strawberry simply raised an eyebrow, presumably wondering what Carl's intentions were, being a seasoned pro when it came to dealing with customers, especially ones who looked like they might be trouble. \"I think we'll be alright thanks,\" she replied, fobbing Carl off, her attention then returning to the guy in the suit, clearly hoping to get something for her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm just saying,\" Carl continued, trying his best to be smooth, but coming off a little creepy himself, \"there's no way a drunk guy like that can't appreciate a beauty like you, If you know what I'm saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly is it you're saying, Mr...?\" she asked, finally biting, realizing that the drunk might indeed be a lost cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl,\" he told her, his grin growing wider as she turned to face him, pulling out a couple of fifty's from his pocket, \"And what I'm trying to say is, why settle for drunky there when you've got an eager and willing customer right here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the money made an appearance, Strawberry's disinterest in Carl suddenly changed, a incredibly sexy smile creeping its way across her face, forgetting about the drunk at the bar and moving closer to him, wiggling her hips as she did and pushing out her chest, while a delicate finger teased its way up the front of his shirt. \"Well, why didn't you say earlier, big boy?\" she smirked, giving him a playful wink, her soft, sexy voice dripping like honey, practically making all the hair on Carl's body stand on end, \"Why don't you come through the back with me and I'll put on a little show for you, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way, babe, lead the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing him by the hand, Strawberry then turned and lead him through the club, his eyes remaining glued to her gloriously tight ass, her full, peachy ass cheeks separated by only the tiniest strip of red, causing his rising semi to grow even harder, as he followed her through a curtain to a small darkened back room, one he remembered well from his previous visits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My names Strawberry,\" she told him, pushing him backwards onto a red velvet couch, then slowly running her hands down her curvy, half naked body, \"and honey, I'm about to rock your world!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carl almost felt like he'd died and gone to heaven, such an amazing beauty being so far out of his league at any other time, but in here, in this private little room, she was all his, a fantasy come to life, and he was going to enjoy every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrawberry meanwhile, was an expert in her field, having done this well over a thousand times before, being considered one of the club's top dancers and certainly the one who walked away with the most money every single week. For her, every customer was just another face in the crowd, each one melding into the next, caring little who they were or what they looked like, as long as they could pay, and while she loved what she did, the power her body and sexuality gave her, she could have been dancing for anyone and would have felt just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this the first time you've been in here, honey? I don't think I've seen you before,\" Strawberry softly whispered in his ear, as she began thrusting her cleavage towards his face, not really caring either way, but experienced enough to know that a little conversation usually resulted in a lot more money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I used to come here a few years back,\" Carl replied, licking his lips as he stared at her large quivering mounds, having wrongly assumed she might have remembered him (thinking himself much more important than he actually was), \"You used to dance for me before, so thought I'd stop in, relive a few memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrawberry simply smiled at this, bringing her fingers to the catch in her bra and telling him somewhat playfully, \"Well don't worry bout that, honey, I'll give you some memories you'll never forget!\" And with that she whipped off the garment, letting her large, full breasts spill out, jiggling and bouncing for a moment, before coming to a rest on her rib cage, each globe being far larger than any Carl had ever seen before, capped with two incredibly hard, dark pink nipples, the kind that just begged to be sucked and tweaked and pulled, something that he would be only too happy to oblige, if the opportunity were to present itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember these babies, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, yeah!\" Carl grinned, his eyes glued to her naked chest as it bounced around in front of him, watching as Strawberry sensually cupped and squeezed at them, bringing them right up to his face, before teasing them away again, driving his body wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dance progressed, and Strawberry began grinding her ass up against his rock hard cock, Carl wasn't sure he could take much more, his insatiable lust growing wildly out of control, wanting this woman more than he'd ever wanted any woman before. He of course knew that strippers didn't usually hook up with customers, at least not these kind of strippers, and that there was probably a bevy of mean looking bouncers waiting outside, ready to storm in at the first sign of trouble if he tried anything, but Carl wasn't thinking about that right now, he was only thinking about getting his end away and satisfying his libido (besides, the two of them had a history he figured, and there was no harm in trying).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, Strawberry, girl like you do any sort of \"special\" extras, if you know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is about as special as I get, honey,\" she said with a smile, presumably getting asked that question a lot and quickly putting him in his place. Carl however, wasn't going to give up that easily, having been teased enough by the stripper and wanting a little relief, figuring, in his own twisted way, that he was owed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, baby, don't make me beg,\" Carl laughed, his hands slowly sliding their way onto her slim waist, gently squeezing at her soft flesh, \"you started a fire in my pants here, don't you think it's only right you put it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrawberry immediately pushed his hands away and jumped back onto her feet, clearly not happy about being touched, as she crossed her arms and scowled, telling him quite plainly and angrily, \"Alright, buster, you've had your fun. This dance is over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over? We were just getting warmed up!\" Carl responded, with a disbelieving chuckle, seemingly oblivious to what he'd done wrong, and certainly not wanting the fun to end just yet, reaching out and grabbing her by the arm. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"GET THE FUCK OFF ME!\" Strawberry suddenly shrieked as Carl tightly gripped her wrist, attempting to pull away with little success. Not that it mattered of course, her high pitched scream having surely alerted the bouncers, who would no doubt be there any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cock teasing bitch! Why the hell'd you go and have to do that?\" Carl angrily replied through gritted teeth, seething with frustration at the stripper's unwillingness to show him a good time and having his whole night ruined. As the stripper continued trying to get away, hitting at him with her free hand and shouting expletives, Carl refused to let go, and instead considered for a moment giving her a good hard slap to shut her up. It was just then, while he was staring angrily at her exceptionally beautiful, hate filled face, thinking about all the fun he could have had with her, and the things she could have done to him with her incredible body, that her eyes suddenly appeared to cloud over, and her entire body ceased it's struggle, almost as if she'd fallen into some sort of trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?\" Carl thought to himself, wondering what she was doing, before he was abruptly interrupted by two very big, very burly looking bouncers, rushing in past the curtain to see him still holding Strawberry's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your greasy fucking hands off of her now!\" one of the bouncers shouted, immediately rushing for Carl and grabbing him by the collar, thrusting him aggressively up against the back wall. Before he even knew what was happening, Carl then felt a heavy blow to his stomach, and found himself being not so much pushed, but thrown out of the back room and back into the main club, managing to overhear the other bouncer asking Strawberry if she was alright just before he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, after doing his best to escape the bouncer manhandling him (without much luck, due to the guy being almost twice his size), Carl found himself once again out in the street, this time however, face down in a puddle as he landed hard on the sidewalk. \"And don't ever come back here, you piece of shit!\" the bouncer shouted at him as he scrambled back onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you asshole! Fuck you and your stupid club! All your girls are frigid little bitches anyway!\" Carl shouted back at him, wanting to actually have a crack at the guy instead, but thinking it probably wasn't a wise idea, especially seeing as there was two of them now, including the guy minding the door. Besides, Carl was pretty used to getting thrown out of places, most of his nights out usually ending in the same way, and so, flipping the bouncer the bird and dusting himself off, he then turned and made his way back up the street, grumbling angrily under his breath as he went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid fucking big titted bitch,\" he mumbled to himself as he searched his jacket pocket, looking for his smokes, pulling them out to discover the punch he'd taken inside had left them all crumpled and worthless. \"SHIT! That's all I need!\" he yelled, throwing the packet to the ground and slamming his foot into a nearby wall, cursing his luck and thinking that this night just couldn't get any worse. It was at that point that a very familiar voice suddenly called out behind him, a woman's voice, one that he'd last heard shouting and cussing at him moments before inside the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh--wait!\" Strawberry nervously yelled out, scampering up the street after him. still in those same red boots but with a thick brown fur coat now covering her practically naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning round to see her running towards him, stumbling every so often in her heels, her expression one of utter panic and confusion, Carl didn't know what the hell to think, being rather surprised and wondering if she'd come to have a go at him...or had perhaps even had a change of mind. \"What the hell do you want?\" he asked, deciding to take no chances, checking behind her to see if she had any of those bouncers or anyone with her (which thankfully she didn't).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we need to talk,\" she said getting closer, her tone of voice rather serious, if a little freaked out. \"You...you won't fucking believe what's happened, it's...it's fucking insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you on about, lady? You wanting paying or some shit? Cause if you are, you can just fuck off right now, I ain't giving you a dime after all that shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, you don't understand,\" she said, now standing right in front of him, a creepy little grin appearing across her plump red lips, \"Carl, dude...I'm you! I'm fucking <i>you</i>! Whatever the hell shit you pulled back there in the club, you turned that hot ass bitch into you...or at least like a copy or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to help himself, Carl suddenly burst into laughter, having heard some pretty stupid stories in his time, but this one definitely taking the biscuit. \"You're fucking nuts lady!\" he told her, shaking his head, presuming she must be on drugs or something, before turning back round and continuing on his way, still laughing as he went. He didn't get five feet however, before Strawberry yelled out something that made him stop completely in his tracks, making him question everything he'd previously just thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know dude, what's more fucking nuts, me being some sort of copy of you, or a dude finding a strange ass glowing fucking rock and being thrown back 30 odd feet after touching the thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell do you know about that?\" he instantly replied, spinning back round to face her, knowing full well that there was no one else around when he'd found the meteor, and even if there had been, the chances that it was some big titted stripper he'd just so happen to get a lap dance off later being pretty slim to none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same way I know about you pissing your pants back in the 6th grade, and the same way I know about every time you whacked off thinking about this bitch in jail; <i>because I'm fucking well you!</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Strawberry, what's going on?\" another familiar voice suddenly called out, causing both Carl and the stripper to stop and look round, spotting the same burly. bald-headed bouncer who'd thrown him out the club moments before walking quickly towards them. \"What you doing chasing after this loser? Harry wants you back inside, you're on stage in five minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrawberry didn't answer, but instead glared at him with a look of anger in her eyes, before turning to meet Carl's own gaze again, flashing him a knowing little smirk. Although still reeling from what this strange woman had just told him (not entirely sure if he could believe it or not), as soon as Carl saw the look in her eyes he instantly knew what it meant, as if there was some sort of weird telepathic link between them, and breaking into a grin, he watched as the agitated bouncer walked up behind her. \"Come on girl, lets get you back inside- -\" were the last words out of the his mouth as he placed his hand firmly on Strawberry's shoulder, the wind being taken right out of his lungs as he suddenly received a 6 inch stiletto heel straight to the crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I give you one of these instead, you fucking asshole!\" Strawberry said, taking great pleasure in her colleague's pain as he grabbed at his injured nuts and stumbled around rather comically. Before he'd even had a chance to recover from the blow, Carl was suddenly on top of him, taking full advantage of the opportunity now that the odds had changed in his favor and punching repeatedly at the bouncer's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fucking tough now are you buddy, huh?\" Carl laughed as he happily took his revenge, releasing all of his earlier pent up frustration on his head and body, pounding him like a piece of meat while Strawberry continued kicking at him on the ground, \"Getting your ass kicking by a \"piece of shit\" and a fucking girl! That won't go down well with your little bouncer buddies will it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a minute later, the bouncer was left sprawled out half unconscious on the sidewalk, battered, bruised and covered in blood, utterly clueless as to what the hell had just happened; why this woman that he'd known and worked with for years had suddenly turned against him. Carl on the other hand was suddenly feeling much better about everything; wholly satisfied with his revenge and actually ready to accept the fact that this gorgeous, red haired woman standing in front of him was indeed himself (the attack on the bouncer convincing him enough of that).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, \"Strawberry\", I believe you,\" Carl then said as he pulled himself up off the ground, breathing heavily after his rigorous workout, \"It's fucking crazy as hell, but I believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Strawberry replied, looking back down at the bloodied bouncer, and adding with a smile, \"God knows I'd rather be stuck with myself than this ugly mother fucker!\" As if to punctuate her thought she then gave him one last kick to the ribs, causing Carl to let out a chuckle. \"So what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking quickly around to see if anyone had been watching them (the street thankfully being rather deserted) Carl then grabbed Strawberry's arm and said, \"Well for starters we get as far away from here as possible, we don't want this guy's buddies showing up, and I especially don't wanna go back to jail for no assault!\" before hurriedly fleeing the scene and heading in the direction of Carl's apartment, his need to avoid the police taking precedent over any questions he might have for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once they'd gotten a few blocks away, Carl's curiosity and need for answers soon kicked back in as he tried to figure out the whole crazy (and seemingly impossible) situation, something that the new \"Strawberry\" seemed keen to do as well. \"So let me get this straight...you're me, or at least a copy or a clone or some shit...inside this stripper's body?\" he asked her, repeating what she'd told him earlier, \"and you think that somehow it's got something to do with that weird hunk of rock I touched back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, I can't think of any other explanation, can you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest with you right now I can't think of a God damn thing other than how fucking hot you look, and how fucking weird it is that it's me inside that body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, well just think how I feel,\" Strawberry replied with a chuckle, pulling open her coat and gazing down at her sexy female body, causing Carl to do the same. It may have been a copy of himself inside, but Strawberry's body still elicited the same reaction and he could feel his cock rising once again inside his pants as he stared with lust at her giant, naked orbs that were bulging out obscenely. Suddenly remembering that they were still out in public, as well as feeling a little self conscious now that \"he\" was a girl, Carl's clone quickly closed the coat once more, putting an end to the free show as the real Carl then returned his original line of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I do remember now that you...I mean, <i>she</i>,\" he said, correcting himself, \"had this funny kind of turn after I touched her, like she was in a trance or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's exactly when it happened!\" his clone agreed, becoming rather animated as she spoke, \"One minute I was grabbing for her arm, the next I was her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, you think that maybe I got like some kind of super power, that I can turn other people into copies of myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it sure looks that way, doesn't it?\" Strawberry grinned, indicating back down at her body again, a mischievous little glint appearing in her eye, a glint that was soon mirrored in Carl's own, as the possibilities of possessing such a power were suddenly made clear to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Imagine the things I could do with that...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He thought that the effect of his power might worn out or his clone had disappeared or whatever. A few seconds later, however, the woman started to talk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Her name is Catherine. She is 36 years old. She is a widow and currently living in an apartment with her daughter.

Wasting no time, Carl shot another clone to the clerk. As his other 'victims,' the store clerk froze and his eyes seemed to be clouded over. Seconds later, he returned to 'normal' and smiled at the three guests.<br>\r\n\"Welcome. Tonight, we have a special discount. You can take anything... for free,\" the storeclerk said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"You heard him, girls. Take everything you want,\" Carl ordered, an evil smile on his face.<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Catherine and Strawberry returned with two dozens of canned beers and some bags of potato chips. Carl ordered them to go straight to Catherine's car. After they had exited the store, Carl looked at the store clerk.<br>\r\n\"Now, how to release control of the clone?\" Carl wondered outloud.<br>\r\n\"Why asking me? I don't know either,\" replied the store clerk.<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I know that!\"<br>\r\nCarl then concentrated at the man and tried to extract his clone out.

Carl grabbed a few packs of cigar from a stall and looked at the fainted clerk with a sinister smile.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the discount,\" Carl said before exiting the store.<br>\r\nCatherine had been waiting behind the wheel with the car engine's turned on. The front passenger seat was full with beers and chips. When Strawberry saw Carl, she oppened the back door, gesturing him to sit beside her.

Then we'll figure out something bigger to do with these new powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine nodded her head and put the car in gear.  Catherine seemed to know exactly where she was going.  Carl turned his attention back to Strawberry.  She was so incredibly hot and still wasn't wearing her top.  Carl absently reached over and squeezed her magnificent breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing.\" She yelped at him and smacked his hand away.  Carl was so tempted to simply take her right there anyway, even if it was his own mind inside.  Hell, it wasn't like he'd have to endure it, at least not the copy of himself that he cared about.  He absently advanced toward her.  Strawberry tried to back away but there was nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the commotion Catherine pulled the car over.  \"Carl!\" she exclaimed.  \"I sure understand where you are coming from.\" She said, \"I have half a mind to jump her myself, but remember, we are you,\" she scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl regained control of himself, though not because of Catherine's words.  There was still this weird link of sorts between them.  Carl could feel Strawberry's fear trickling through it.  It became his own fear.  They were still separate people for the most part, but there was still a connection beyond their memories and personalities.  \"OK, OK\" he muttered.  He was really starting to think that he was being a pain in the ass.  \"I won't ever fuck myself without my own permission.\"  He promised both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine began driving again.  Carl quickly apologized to Strawberry and she tentatively accepted.  Carl noticed that she sat as far away from him as possible.  Carl cursed his bad fortune.  He finally had two gorgeous women all to himself and he couldn't do anything about it without feeling what they felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they all arrived at Catherine's house.  Strawberry and Carl followed Catherine up the stairs to the second floor of her apartment building.  Carl was watching Catherine's toned legs below the hem of her business skirt as he followed her up the stairs.  He noticed that Catherine had no problems walking in the heels that had come with this new body.  He must have also inherited some muscle memory.  He fought the feelings of lust that were beginning to form.  Catherine opened the door to her apartment and they all walked into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" a teenage voice emanated from the back room.  \"Are you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Catherine exclaimed as she turned to Carl and Strawberry.  \"I forgot about Ashley.\"  Soon a teenage girl came into the living room.  She was young, about fifteen or sixteen, and quite pretty.  She looked like she was about to go to bed.  She was wearing some short shorts and a baby tank top that left her flat stomach exposed.  She had small but pert breasts on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came into the room and froze when she saw that her 'mother' had company.  She gawked at Strawberry's magnificent bare chest.  She finally broke herself out of her gawking and asked, \"Who are these people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl thought to himself, \"We need to deal with her.\"</span></div></div>",

He was horny and was tempted to go for it with her since he'd been denied several times tonight.  She was young enough however that even Carl had serious reservations about forcing himself on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\"  Catherine started.  \"These are my friends.  They'll be staying here for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had a horrified look on her face.  It was clear to Carl that this arrangement wouldn't work out without bringing Ashley into the group somehow.  He looked over at Catherine and Strawberry and realized that yet another copy of himself was about to be thrust into the body of a woman.  Twice now that had happened and Carl wondered to himself what that would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt free.  It was hard to describe.  It was as if all of his mass was no longer his to bear.  He felt completely unencumbered.  He looked down to see himself falling, yet here he was still standing.  It made no sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Catherine exclaimed as she ran over to Carl's body that was in a heap on the floor.  Carl stood there over his body wondering what was going on.  He looked at his hand and saw that it was somewhat transparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm OK.\" Carl yelled but to no avail.  Nobody could hear him.  Carl looked around the room.  Catherine was attending to his seemingly lifeless body.  Strawberry was standing back and looking at the situation.  Ashley looked like she was about to freak out.  \"I wonder ...\" Carl thought out loud as he looked at Ashley.  This whole thing had happened when he wondered what it would be like to be thrust in the body of a woman.  Perhaps this was in response to that somehow.  Carl could only hope as the alternative was that he'd dropped dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked over to Ashley who was looking at her mother tend to a strange guy that had just collapsed in her living room.  Carl reached out and touched Ashley.  His hand went right through her body but he could feel some resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Ashley shrieked.  She too felt it.  Carl gathered his courage and rand right into Ashley.  The sensations that Carl felt next were strange.  All sensation was cut off.  His vision went dark and for a moment he fumbled around in a complete void of all sensory input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all of his senses came back to him.  The frantic activity of Catherine was more vivid now, stronger somehow.  It was as if everything that had happened in the room after his body collapsed was muffled slightly.  Now it was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl looked down and was shocked at what he saw.  He saw Ashley's pert breasts protruding from his own chest.  Carl, now Ashley reached up and cupped them in her hands.  It felt strange.  These little mounds of flesh were part of him now.  He could feel with them just as he would have been able to feel things with his old chest, just larger.  They were more tender and sensitive though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys.\"  Ashley announced to her other selves.  \"I'm over here.\"  Strawberry and Catherine looked at her quizzically.  \"I left my body and possessed Ashley here.\"  she said as she pointed to herself.</span></div></div>",

The thought of fooling around was certainly exciting, but for the moment destroying the entire police force in this town appealed to her more.  Strawberry and Catherine agreed though they were slightly disappointed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not taking over the police force as a teenage bitch.\" Ashley said as she looked at herself.  \"I'm going back, then I'll put a clone in her.\"  Ashley fumbled around for a moment in her mind trying to figure out how to do this.  It wasn't obvious but soon she had it.  She felt physically unencumbered just like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl watched as Ashley's body staggered around.  It didn't drop to the ground like his own had earlier.  The real Ashley regained control of her body and Carl was now in a non-corporeal form like he had been before taking Ashley's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was quite disoriented.  \"What happened?\" She asked everyone.  \"How did I get over here?\"  Carl was amused by Ashley's confusion but he forced himself to focus on returning to his own body.  He walked over to his own body and hopped right in.  It only took a moment before he had control of his body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl cupped his hands to his now flat chest.  He was both relieved and disappointed to be back to normal.  \"Mom, these people are weird.\" Ashley said.  She was still freaked out by these people.  Add to that her disorientation from the short time that Carl had possessed her body and she wasn't comfortable with things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl, I think you need to take care of her.\" Strawberry said as she nudged Carl.  Carl stood up and began the now familiar process of pushing a copy of himself into another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have to be a teenage bitch after all.\" Ashley suddenly exclaimed as Carl finished up.  Ashley cupped her chest in her hands.  She had mixed feelings about this just as Carl had when he had returned to his own body.  Strawberry and Catherine both looked at the new Ashley with amusement and empathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets march down to the police station and clone all those fuckers right now.\"  Carl said.

''You're not calling the shots here!'', she said, folding her arms to support her well endowed bosom. Strawberry looked around to Ashley and Catherine, clearly she was expecting that the other two clones would back her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her dismay however, Catherine and Ashley shot her a disapproving look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What?!'', Carl seethed with anger towards this apparent act of mutiny. ''Either you obey me or I'll extract you from her.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrawberry hesitated for a moment, clearly Carl's ultimatum was working. Much to the dismay of the clones, they were not able to manifest the same power that the 'original' Carl had. Strawberry sighed, realizing the game was up and she was in no position to disobey. ''Fuck it!'', Strawberry grumbled,''Fine.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good, I'm glad we understand each other.'', Carl sneered as he lead the group back outside. It was a rather weird looking group, a businesswoman and her daugher trooped behind a scantily clad strip dancer and a unkept man, before filing back inside the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm taking the wheel.'', Carl announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a long drive before they managed to reach the nearest branch. However, upon reaching their destination, suddenly Carl was hit by a sudden discomforting thought. <i>These guys got too much free will</i>, he thought to himself. He also noted that how each clones seemed to be rather different, being projected at different times. Those in Catherine and Strawberry definitely got more free will than the one in Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl calmly got out from the car and smirking, he willed his clones to return to him. ''Noooooo.'', the clones wailed, but soon the real Catherine, Strawberry and Ashley were back in control of their respecting bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We'll be getting better stuffs soon</i>, Carl calmly walked to a nearby low budget accommodation. He did not want to bother using his powers on the staffs and there was no need to as he had Catherine to give her all her cash that she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We hope you enjoy your stay.'', the receptionist smiled, unfazed by Carl's appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thanks.'', Carl mumbled, clutching his magnetic keycard, taking the lift and found his room. From the window, he could see the rather empty street below and more importantly, to the police station situated nearby. He could see that the lights were off, there would not be many people at this time of the day. As Carl laid down on the bed he realized how tired he was.</span></div></div>",

You idiot, I'm a copy of you, and you put me into this bitch's body, pretty neat huh?\" Strawberry said. \"And why settle for a dance when you can screw this teasing whore?\" the stripper then said, as she slipped a manicured hand into her thong panties and fingered her slit...moaning as she did so. \"Oh fuck yeah...that feels sooo good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's erection grew even firmer as he watched Strawberry playing with herself, and his mind went back to his encounter with the strange artifact in the grounds of the abandoned warehouse. \"You saying I can possess people?

Carl felt himself begin to left go as he came all over Strawberry's chest and face. The clone tried catching as much as she could in her mouth. There was a lot it seemed.

He walked past the graffiti and stepped nimbly over the broken bottles, always on the look-out for trouble, a phenomenon that seemed to follow him around quite a bit thanks in no small part to his own actions.  The smell of cigarette smoke and beer filled the air as Carl passed one of the town\u2019s many bars and music and yelling spilled out into the street.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl walked by, he beheld something a bit odd.  A woman staggered out of the bar on the other side of the street.  This much was not all that strange, but the woman wasn\u2019t just milling about in a drunken stupor; rather, she held her hands tightly to her head and mumbled incoherently, seeming to be in quite a lot of pain.  \u201cHeadaches usually don\u2019t come until the next morning,\u201d Carl mused to himself as he gazed at the woman.  She made her way in his direction, still making an effort to soothe what must have been a throbbing head.  \u201cFind the man\u2026.find the man\u2026.must find the man\u2026.why don\u2019t you just get out of me?!\u201d the woman said, clearly crazed.  She came upon Carl, who looked down at her strangely of course.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked the woman over.  She was actually quite pretty.  She seemed to be about 30 years old or so, with blond hair down past her shoulders.  She wore a leather top that barely contained a very impressive set of breasts, ones that jiggled wonderfully with her every sporadic step.  Her skirt too was made of leather and left quite little to the imagination.  It stretched tightly over a set of wide and beautiful hips and long, meaty legs.  The garment came just low to provide the bare minimum of coverage.  Farther down, she wore a long pair of leather boots that came up a good chunk of the distance to her knees and gave her no choice but to sway her hips beautifully as she walked.  \u201cThis one\u2019s a hooker,\u201d Carl thought to himself as he spied the scantily clad woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened upon seeing him.  She gasped, seeming amazed at his presence.  \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d she yelled, pointing her finger at him, \u201cYou\u2019re the man they want\u2026the man from my dream!\u201d  Carl was more than a little confused.  \u201cLady did you miss the pill cart or somethin\u2019?\u201d he asked the lady of the night.  Her breasts heaved mightily as she tried to catch her breath and deal with the pain in her head.  Her body glistened as sweat ran down into her beautiful cleavage.  \u201cAaaarrrggghhh, not again!\u201d the woman exclaimed as she placed her hands back on her head, seeming to be still very much in pain.  Suddenly, her hands dropped limply to her sides, and her head went limp so that she looked straight downward.  There she stood, dressed in clothes so skimpy they could make anybody\u2019s mouth water, and yet she seemed totally gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady\u2026\u201d Carl said, snapping his fingers in front of her face, \u201clady you still in there?\u201d He tilted his head at the strangeness of the whole thing.  Suddenly, the woman took a very deep breath, her lungs filling with air and her breasts suddenly heaving forward.  Her head rocketed upward so that she looked directly at Carl.  Somehow, her eyes still seemed empty; her face seemed blank, as if she were asleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must beware human,\u201d came words from the woman\u2019s mouth, but it wasn\u2019t her voice\u2026it was some strange amalgam of her voice and a deep, guttural, alien noise that seemed to imamate from her body.  Carl stood flabbergasted.  \u201cThey come upon you in small numbers only for now, but more come soon.  Go to your great city!  That is where they will strike first!\u201d the woman commanded, her eyes still wide open and yet dead at the same time.  \u201cThey will force their way inside your bodies, and so must you!  Use your powers, or they will destroy you!\u201d the strange woman said.  As she ended her sentence, the strange alien voice seemed to leave her, as her voice reverted to what Carl supposed it must have sounded like normally.  Her message delivered, the woman\u2019s body went limp again, and she fell backward roughly on to the flat of her back.  Her breasts jiggled as she toppled to the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stood there quietly as he tried to figure out what the hell had just happened.  He looked around in the hopes that no one had seen the whole thing, luckily finding no one.  \u201cChic\u2019s a bit off her fucking rocker,\u201d Carl mused to himself as he looked down at the wonderful mounds adorning the crazy woman\u2019s chest.  The heaved slightly with her slow breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a little freaked out, Carl turned and headed the rest of the way to his apartment.  Stuff only marginally less weird than this happened all the time, which served as an indicator of what Carl\u2019s life was like.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tA few dozen miles away\u2026<br>\r\n2)\tIn a warehouse across town,  two cops respond to strange noises\u2026<br>\r\n3)\tAt a farm outside town, a housewife walks outside, having seen a strange craft crash in her husband\u2019s field\u2026<br>\r\n4)\tIn the sewers below the city\u2026<br>\r\n5)\tCarl makes it home quietly.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sun hung low in the sky, and Ellen Rothmore wanted nothing more than to get home after a law enforcement conference in Florida.  Sure, it had been some fun, but a chunk of the time was spent sitting in big rooms, cut off from the sun, while old guys got up and went on and on about the proper way to conduct a search so as to avoid having a case thrown out of court later.  Ellen was a career law enforcement officer, an FBI agent, specifically.  She was an exemplary agent; she\u2019d have to be, given that she devoted much of her life to her work.  She\u2019d never married, much to the chagrin of her mother, who bugged her to find a husband during every phone conversation the two had.  She lived alone except for a cat named Muffins, her sole companion in a nondescript apartment in the city\u2014Washington DC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen did sometimes long for male companionship, but she never thought of herself as the type.  At 45 years old, she was not exactly a spring chicken.  Some lines had begun to appear around her eyes in a couple places, though she retained a quite pleasant smile.  She had packed on some pounds as the years rolled by though.  She certainly was not fat, but she was\u2026full-figured.  She had a long pair of meaty legs and a belly that had seemed to expand just a little bit, with a bit of extra flesh evident if her shirt were thin enough or if she wore no jacket.  Her ass was likewise wonderfully plump, shaking and jiggling delightfully as she stepped.  Jiggles were also evident on her chest, which was adorned with a pair of wonderfully full breasts that had begun to sag just slightly with age.  She was a woman of fair skin, and fiery red hair hung half way down her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ellen\u2019s car rolled through the countryside, her eyes heavy, she spied something strange in a field.  She looked in the direction of smoke that seemed to billow up from the ground\u2026big thick black streams of smoke.  \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ellen asked herself as she pulled over to the side of the road and slowly got out of the car.  This did not appear to be a law enforcement problem, but if there were an emergency, she could certainly call somebody.  She straightened up her suit\u2014a nice black jacket and a dark skirt\u2014and began walking in the direction of the smoke.  Her heels were not made for this sort of walking, which she knew well as she walked through some quite tall grass.  \u201cThis better be important or it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d Ellen said to herself as she walked carefully through the field.  Her breasts shook with every step as her bra cut slightly into her back while she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, Ellen came upon a small metal object from which smoke billowed.  It was nothing more than a metallic thing about the size of a basketball.  \u201cWhat the hell is this thing?\u201d Ellen said as she walked up and bent down next to the device.  She put her hand close to it, only to discover (predictably) that it was quite hot, so she pulled her hand back quickly.  After a few seconds, something began to happen with the device. A small panel toward the bottom of the thing began to open, filling the air with some steam and leaving Ellen half interested and half horrified.  She quickly fell backward on to her wonderful rump, \u201cWhat in god\u2019s name\u2026\u201d she began as the tiny metallic ball cracked open.  She sat upon the ground, some dust smudging her dress, as she watched with wide eyes the scene before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen sat dumfounded as a creature slowly emerged from the contraption.  It was somewhat snake-like, really.  It was about eight inches long and was really quite thick.  A viscous fluid covered the body of the thing, a strange sort of jelly that was probably meant to facilitate its movement as it fumbled around on the dry ground.  Two small antennae protruded from the top of what must have been its head, and they seemed to move about independently of one another as if searching around for something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen sat up on her knees and gazed down in wonder at the creature.  She got down on all fours and marveled at it.  \u201cWhat are you?\u201d she said, reaching her hand out just to test its reaction.  Suddenly, the creature sprung into action.  Sensing a warm body nearby and an opportunity, the thing lunged at Ellen, forcing its slimy, snake-like body into her mouth.  The woman freaked, trying immediately to grab at the thing as it began to slither down her gullet, but its slime impeded her grip.  As the creature forced its way farther into her and down her throat, Ellen began to gag and convulse as if she were about to throw up.  She rolled about in terror on the ground, her clothes now covered with dirt and little bits of grass.  Ellen collapsed limply to the ground as the last of the creature\u2019s tale disappeared inside her mouth.  The thing had begun to move down her throat and into her belly, wrapping itself around her spinal cord.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Ellen\u2019s eyes opened.  She slowly sat up and looked around her, then down at herself, realizing that she was filthy.  \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d she asked herself, wiping a strange jelly-like substance from around her mouth.  Ellen slowly stood, feeling a bit strange\u2014a bit slow and bloated, like she\u2019d eaten too much or something.  Her mind was a bit fuzzy; trying to remember how she\u2019d gotten here was like trying to remember a dream after waking up.  A befuddled Ellen walked slowly back to her car and climbed in, marking how much darker it was.  Confused, she drove the rest of the way back to her house in silence.<br>\r\n1)\t Ellen feels herself compelled to do things\u2026things that seem to her\u2026alien.<br>\r\n2)\tPlans for tomorrow.<br>\r\n3)     Ellen is suddenly very hungry.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having dusted herself off a bit, she walked sluggishly to the elevator, in which she was alone, and rode it up to her floor.  Still feeling a bit bloated and off, she entered her apartment and tossed her keys on her counter.  She held her hand to her aching head and continued to marvel at the oddity of the evening and at the gap in her memory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Springsteen\u2019s \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d began to emanate from her phone.  \u201cCome on baby; the laugh\u2019s on me,\u201d the voice sang.  Recognizing the ring, Ellen snatched up the phone.  \u201cHello?\u201d she said.  \u201cEllen, it\u2019s your mother; you sound terrible.  Are you all right?\u201d  Ellen sighed, as her mother always thought something was wrong with her.  \u201cYeah ma\u2026yeah I\u2019m fine.  I just had a weird day is all, and I\u2019m tired.\u201d  \u201cWere you on a date?  Did you find yourself a man?  You gotta do that before you ovaries dry up, honey,\u201d her mom continued.  \u201cMa\u2026no\u2026.no no date, just a work thing. Listen I feel weird okay, and I want to go to bed.\u201d  Her mother paused, \u201cWell all right, Ellen, just remember that your brother and I are coming tomorrow at 5 pm, okay?\u201d  \u201cI remember mom\u201d Ellen said, and the two hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen walked into her bedroom, eager to climb into bed.  She saw her cat Muffins lying on the comforter and smiled as she walked up to pet the creature.  Muffins, normally a cat who absolutely loved its owner, recoiled at her touch.  The cat back away, its ears back, and began to hiss at Ellen and show its teeth.  The woman got a hurt look on her face.  \u201cWhat is it baby?\u201d she asked the cat, \u201cdoes mamma smell funny or something?\u201d  she said as she turned around and headed briefly into the bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned on the light, which seemed quite bright, and she had to momentarily shield her eyes.  Gazing at herself in the mirror, she could tell she\u2019d had a rough day.  Her fiery red hair was a bit messed up, and her eyes seemed droopy.  She examined herself in the mirror as she went over the day\u2019s strange events in her head.  Suddenly, Ellen\u2019s head began to ache intensely, and she put her hand to it as she winced in pain.  With the pain seeming to die down, Ellen again looked up at the mirror and her reflection.  Something was off, though.  Ellen wasn\u2019t smiling, but her reflection was!  Ellen\u2019s eyes widened, and she staggered back in fear, but her reflection stood still, continuing just to stare at her with a devious smile.  \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Ellen exclaimed at her own reflection.  The Ellen in the mirror was clean and had on nice make-up, and she wore the same clothes that adorned the real Ellen\u2019s body.  A strange jell-like liquid was smeared all around her mouth.  The real Ellen\u2019s mind was racing, and her pulse and breathing quickened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, the reflection turned to the side, still smiling devilishly.  As it turned, Ellen could see something amiss.  The work suit she wore was stretched by a quite large bulge in the belly area, almost like something was slither about inside her, like she was pregnant!  The reflection then began to speak, though with a very low, strange, and guttural growl of a voice.  It placed its hands on its bulging stomach and said, \u201cSoon\u2026your body will be mine!  My children will grow inside you!\u201d  Ellen was terrified!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she blinked, and it was all gone.  She gazed again at her normal reflection in the mirror, normal save for the fact that she was wide-eyed and paranoid now.  \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Ellen said, looking down at her body and seeing that she sure didn\u2019t seem to be pregnant right now, though she did still feel bloated.  After a few minutes of checking herself over, Ellen chalked it all up to too long a day, slowly climbed into bed, and went to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tThe thing completely takes over her body during the night.<br>\r\n2)\tShe awakens in the morning and does not feel fully in control of herself.<br>\r\n3)     A man comes to question Ellen about the crash.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The meteor sat silently on the ground by the warehouse, still smoldering in the darkness of the night, but Carl had missed something about it.  Inside the seemingly dormant rock lay a creature unlike anything Carl had known.  It was small\u2026just a slug really.  It was about 4 or 5 inches long and not much thicker than a small snake.  Its body was covered in a sort of slippery, glowing ooze that made its movement easier and gave off a thin, yellowish-green light.  A small piece of the meteor came off, opening up the small enclave in the rock in which the creature rested.  Slowly, the thing slithered out, its antennae probing about in the night as it sought to understand its new environment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby and through the dark of the night rode a young girl named Molly Whitmore.  She was all of 7 and \u00c2\u00bd years old, and she was assertive enough to always remind those who said she was 7 that she was, in fact and resoundingly, 7 AND \u00c2\u00bd years of age.  It was quite late for Molly to be out of course, but she was coming home from the house of a friend a couple blocks away.  Her mom had told her to come earlier, but little Molly, ever the princess, insisted on staying at her friend\u2019s house long enough to get good and pretty for the trip home\u2026the one in the dark through a seldom-traveled part of the city.  Molly was quite a little diva, with meticulously groomed blonde hair in pig-tails hanging from her head.  She wore jeans to which were glued countless flowers and little bits of glitter, and her shirt bore a picture of Barbie, the impeccable image of beauty to which young Molly aspired.  To this young girl of only 7 and \u00c2\u00bd, life was a beauty pageant, and she hated to lose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly was a chunky little girl who needed to spend more time exercising and socializing with other kids than she spent in front of the mirror, but she had a stressful home life, and she comforted herself with food (a lot of it) and with shiny things and tea parties with her dolls.  Her mother and father did not help matters at all.  Their constant fighting was a source of great stress for their daughter.  Molly\u2019s diva attitude and flamboyant style were a way she could exert some control over a life in which much was beyond her control and understanding; she escaped from the yelling and the tears into a world of her own fantasies.  Her mother Jessica was a woman of 43.  She\u2019d had dreams of beauty pageants herself years before, but she\u2019d gotten locked into an abusive relationship she couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave, and Molly had been its product.  Jessica was about 5 foot 7 with blonde hair, as well as a full and voluptuous figure that bounced and jiggled in all the right places.  At 43, a few lines had appeared on her face, and her figure was full enough to be a bit sloppy in some places, but she still looked great.  She lavished all the attention she could on little Molly, wanting to give her the life she could never have.  Tim Whitmore, her live-in boyfriend and Molly\u2019s father, drank often and could rarely hold a job for long.  He took his rage at the world out on his wife and little daughter.  Tim had peaked the day he graduated high school, and the 25 years since had been a litany of run-ins with the law and drunken brawls.  His beer gut was his most prominent physical feature, and it stretched his beat-up Whitesnake t-shirt to the very limit.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly rode through the quiet streets, her pink bicycle rolling over the gravel as streamers fluttered from her handlebars.  Seeing the place where the meteor had crashed, Molly slowed her bike and came to a stop, putting the kickstand down as she pondered the strange sight.  She walked up slowly to the smoldering meteor.  \u201cWhat\u2019s this icky thing?\u201d she asked no one in particular as she walked around it, \u201cit\u2019s all\u2026.filthy!\u201d she said in disgust as she reveled in her own immaculate appearance.  Molly suddenly spotted the glowing little slug as it slithered about aimlessly on the ground.  \u201cEeeew,\u201d she screeched, recoiling at first.  Then she began to get a little interested, moving in closer.  \u201cWhat are you?\u201d she said as she knelt down carefully to examine the slug-like thing.  It seemed to respond to her, standing up as straight as it could and leaning toward little Molly.  She moved in closer, and so did it.  She moved to the side, and it followed suit.  Molly smiled and giggled a bit at the odd thing.  It was emulating her\u2026she figured it must like her, which seemed to Molly to be a natural enough and logical reaction for the creature to have.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the thing lunged at her!  It forced its head into Molly\u2019s mouth.  The little girl tried to move away, but it was too late.  The thing forced its way into her as Molly jerked and convulsed.  She fell back on to the dirty ground and grunted, gasping for air as the tiny creature forced its way down her throat.  The thing wiggled about and continued in as Molly rolled about in the gravel and tried without success to grab at the slippery thing entering her.  Suddenly, all the movement stopped.  Molly\u2019s body lay there on the ground, motionless.  Suddenly, Molly\u2019s eyes opened, and her plump little form sat up.  The alien thing now inside her examined her pudgy little hands and her glittery clothes, familiarizing itself with its new home.  \u201cThis will do,\u201d Molly\u2019s body said, her voice a strange combination of her own girly tone and a deep, growling sound that must have come from the alien.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly!  Molly my goodness thank god you\u2019re safe!\u201d came a worried voice from behind her.  Up came Molly\u2019s mother Jessica, her breasts and ass bouncing around in a thin nightgown, the only thing she was wearing other than her undergarments.  She scooped her daughter\u2019s pudgy little body up from the ground and held her close to her chest, kissing her repeatedly.  \u201cWhat are you doing on the ground?\u201d she asked rhetorically as she brushed Molly off, \u201coh my gosh it\u2019s too late for you to be out\u2026you should have been home hours ago!  Let\u2019s get you inside sweetie!\u201d Jessica said worriedly as she fawned over her daughter.  The alien was really quite stunned by the experience; it was inside by a foreign body and had to deal with the barrage of attention and kisses being heaped on by said body\u2019s mother.  Jessica hurriedly carried her daughter, and the thing inside her daughter\u2019s body, into her home.  The alien was bound and determined to explore this strange planet and to find the human who had been unlucky enough to find the meteor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tThe thing decides to rest for now\u2026it\u2019s had a tough day.<br>\r\n2)\tThe creature needs to get to know it\u2019s body\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n3)\tTim staggers home drunk again.<br>\r\n4)\tThe creature would like to posses Jessica instead.<br>\r\n5)\tThe creature is weakened and needs sustenance (food).           <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then used the girl's scent of smell to sniff the air...and it walked towards the trash receptacle. \"I need sustenance!\" the creature said, as Molly's possessed body stood over the bin and reached inside. The creature pulled out the remnants of a cake that had gone past its 'use by' date. Studying it for a while...the creature then tipped Molly's head back and shoveled the cake into her mouth..swallowing it all.

It wanted to know more about the races inhabiting this planet and to do that it will need to take over an older specimen of the race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's hand gripped the sides of the sink as hard as it could as the slug willed itself to fully integrate with its host's brain, corrupting every synapse within its consciousness, in order to copy Molly's memory to be used later. It will be able to see its host's deepest memory, even those that the host had forgotten, but it'll need some time to filter out the important from the not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process lasted few minutes and Molly's eyes opened as her grip on the sink eased, although her fingers were quite red from the strain. Suddenly she then gurgled and vomited all over the floor.  Bits of raw eggs, meat and everything splattered on the wooden flooring, and with them, the alien slug. The slug need to be in its alien form to properly read its former host's memories and it slithered away in a crack as fast as it could, as Molly knelt down and fainted on the floor after she had regurgitated everything, or almost everything the slug had made her swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, Jessica came rushing to the bathroom to see her daughter slumped against her own puke. Jessica screamed in shock and quickly lifted her daughter away from the mess and bathed her. As this all happen, the slug was filtering the content of Molly's memories which it had copied leisurely. 7 and 1/2 year of memories was quite a bit for it. Usually, two slugs would do it much faster, but as the scout, it needed to do it by itself. Then again, it had all the time in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica went and dried herself and Molly as they made their way to Molly's room, carefully treading over the puke. Molly seemed to have awaken due to her bath, although she complained about her hurting tummy. In Molly's room, Jessica hugged her daughter,'' You made me worry so much'', she said teary eyed. Molly just mumbled something about her aching tummy, other than that, she said nothing as Jessica tucked her to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning the mess was hard work for her, but Jessica knew her husband would not be happy with that when he got back. So she buckled down and got it done. Little did she knew that her husband was still drunk somewhere and would not get back for the night. Probably getting wasted somewhere in the streets or having trouble with the authorities as usual. Jessica just went to bed as soon as she finished. She was glad to see that her daughter was okay and did not seem to suspect anything weird about her daughter's abnormal behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slug then made its move, it slithered out from the crack, its body glowed yellowish, contrast to the dark surrounding and moved to the door. The door was shut, but it was not a problem for the alien. It flattened its body and slithered through a small gap between the door and the floor.

Slowly, Jessica's stride began to look natural with her hip swaying from side to side, instead of the slightly too rigid movement she did a few minutes ago. The slug felt good. It had began to immerse itself into this new yet primitive civilization. It could not wait to dissect its new host's memories. For now, it decided to return to the meteor site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was already someone waiting by the meteorite site. Detective Roy was already there. After he put a police line sign, he grabbed a long metal rod from his trunk and prodded the meteorite carefully while his other hand waved a flashlight around the meteor, fine combing the location for something. He crouched and as he leaned towards the meteorite. He sighed as he saw the small enclave which confirmed his fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''&lt;The invasion has begun&gt;'' a small stern voice quipped in Roy's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Of all time, why now?'', Roy groaned, obviously unhappy with this awful predicament, meanwhile his eyes never left the ground, as he searched and searched. ''Can you see there bud?'', he seemingly spoke to no one in particular as he pointed at a spot where Molly writhed about before being taken over by the slug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came from inside his head, ''&lt;Yes, as I feared, it had gained a host. Poor unfortunate human.&gt;'', there was a bit of sympathy in the voice.''&lt;But for now, we need to find it and fast!&gt;'' the voice reverted back to a business-like tone as Roy sighed again. He knew it was not going to be an early night for him again, but the prospect of catching an evil alien from outer space seemed to be more fun for him than catching the usual crooks. In his tender age of 26 he had got a reputation as an excellent detective as he was able to solve some complicated cases and gathering the evidences needed to put the thugs behind bars. No one knew how he did his work. All that they know was that he was a star graduate from a local police academy and all cases presented to him were solved very quickly. He lived in his apartment alone, just a couple block away from the police station. His parents both were unknown and he spent most of his childhood in a foster house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy carefully put the meteorite in a sealed plastic bag and checked the surrounding before driving off to his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Jessica's body arrived at the site. She looked around and unable to find the meteorite, she snarled. It was dark around the warehouse, and as the slug found, humans does not see well in darkness. The alien knew it had to make a decision fast. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It then scoured the ground and crouched down...tracking the tire marks leading from the site. Jessica's face contorted into another scowl as her body stood up straight, the alien then began walking in the direction of the tracks, Jessica's ample breasts bouncing on her chest as it walked. After about half a mile, the alien was caught in the headlights of an approaching car...which pulled over, and the window was wound down. \"Hey babe...need a lift?\" the young man behind the wheel asked, unknowing what he was getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien tipped Jessica's head to one side and studied the man for a moment, but it didn't respond verbally. \"Hello...are you alright lady?\" the samaritan asked again. \"Come on get in...I'll take you home\" The alien snarled again...but quietly...before opending the passenger side door and climbing inside. \"I'm Shaun...pleased to meet you\" the man smiled, even as he noticed how disheleved Jessica looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...Jessica's hands grabbed hold of the man's head and turned it towards her. \"What...what the fuck are you doing?\" the man grunted as he tried to release her firm grip. Jessica then moved closer to the man and opened her mouth...and three dark, spindly objects (resembling spider's legs) emerged from her mouth...followed by a forth which shot out and burrowed its way into the man's forehead. The guy yelled out in pain and horror and Jessica's eyes rolled up into her head as the alien sucked brain matter through its 'feeding stem'. After a couple of minutes...the alien appendages retracted back into Jessica's mouth, and the guy was dead, the alien opened the driver's door and dumped his body out...before sliding over behind the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing Jessica's own knowledge of driving, the alien then proceeded to drive the car...albeit...in an eratic manner. Inside its host body, the alien had room to grow...and it had done so exponentially in order to increase its own abilities and lethality.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The creature used the stolen car to roll slowly through the streets on the outskirts of town.  Jessica\u2019s breasts bounced and jiggled as the car rolled through potholes and dangerously close to the occasional curb.  The creature mentally catalogued and processed the knowledge of the car\u2019s previous owner bit by bit.  It learned a bit about human customs and norms, as well as something of the general area in which it now operated.  From inside its host, the thing realized that this new, primitive world it now inhabited was something wholly new\u2026and big.  Tens of thousands of humans scurried about in this one town alone, and this was a small one.  Billions more were elsewhere, all going about their short, pathetic lives with no notion whatsoever about what was coming quickly upon them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked about at the structures surrounding her.  The creature noted them\u2014mere hovels by comparison to those on its home world.  The thing weaved about on the fairly empty road until it came upon a small building.  Lights shined from the inside the structure, and a large sign which read BP rose far above the ground and was well-lit with green and yellow neon lights.  It recognized the building as a gas station, having stolen the little tid-bit of information from the poor young man it had recently killed.  The car rolled into the parking lot as thousands of tiny pieces of gravel churned about under the worn tires.  \u201cPerhaps one of these pathetic little roaches can be of some use to me,\u201d the creature said from inside Jessica as it opened the door and stood its voluptuous vessel up in the cold night air.  Wearing the body of the soccer mom, the creature walked in silence toward the small gas station, her chest bouncing and her perky nipples visible under her thin shirt because of the cold.  Reaching the building, she pulled the door open and stepped inside, peering about at a vast assortment of candy, beer, and other sundry goods.  Jessica stood, just looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wacha lookin\u2019 for honey?\" came a voice from behind the counter.  Jessica looked quickly in the direction it had come from.  There she saw a woman of about 25, an African-American woman with a name tag that read Tania pinned to her shirt.  Jessica studied the woman, who stood about 5 foot 6 and weighed about 250lbs.  She wore a large white shirt with buttons down the front, but her saggy breasts and fat rolls strained against the thin fabric; she smiled at Jessica, who said nothing in return.  \"You all right?\" Tania asked, a bit of concern in her voice.  Suddenly another figure came from behind one of the shelves.  This one was also a woman...but different.  She was older...about 45.  She had curly blonde hair that cascaded down from the top of her head.  A wrinkle appeared here and there on her face (she was 45, after all), but she was quite beautiful.  This woman was, unbeknownst to the creature inhabiting Jessica, Officer Brenda Nelson.  She\u2019d been on the police force for quite some time and was working the late shift yet again, but she loved her work.  Still years of doing this had taken a bit of a toll.  Brenda had packed on a few pounds as the years and countless stakeouts rolled by.  She wasn\u2019t fat, but she was...fluffy.  She had a full and curvy frame, complete with a nice round ass, tits that jiggled with her every step, and a slight pouch in her belly that, while an imperfect but predictable product of age, was actually kind of cute.  All this - - every beautiful, full, jiggle-prone curve - - was contained in a tight-fitting, black police uniform that tightly hugged the wonderfully full body of Brenda Nelson.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all for ya?\" Tania said, her attention quickly turned to Officer Nelson, who came to the counter with a cup of coffee.  \"Yes..so far, but I've got a long shift tonight,\u201d Brenda said as she reached for money.  The alien watched all this from inside Jessica.  It had processed enough to know that the curvy creature before it was of the law in some way, and this would probably be helpful.  Brenda happened to glance back at the disheveled Jessica, who wore no coat but somehow seemed not to be shivering.  \"You all right sweetie?\" she asked in a kind tone.  \"Fine,\" the creature responded, now using Jessica\u2019s normal vocal chords to generate a normal voice.  Brenda seemed a bit uneasy, and she happened to glance outside to see the car, parked haphazardly and not especially close to a parking space.  \"Hey...\u201d Brenda began, her mind seeming to work overtime as she gazed upon the vehicle.  \"I think I heard a description of that car on the scan...\" she said and suddenly tensed up.  Her arm reached quickly for her holstered gun, as she'd heard about the murder and car theft earlier in the evening.  Suddenly, Jessica sprung into action.  The possessed soccer-mom reached up and grabbed Officer Nelson by the shoulder, spinning her around before she could do anything.  Jessica quickly grabbed Nelson by the throat and, using just her left arm, lifted the beefy yet beautiful officer about three feet of the ground.  Nelson chocked and struggled to breathe, kicking her legs about madly as Jessica, now with unnatural strength, dangled her in the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing?!\" screamed Tania, who maneuvered her flabby body quickly to Jessica\u2019s side of the counter and leaped upon her with all her girth.  Tania got her flabby arms around Jessica\u2019s neck from behind, trying to choke her out.  Un-phased, Jessica shook off the overweight cashier with little effort, sending the young woman flying through the air into a wall.  Having hit her head hard, Tania just sort of crumpled to the ground in a daze.  Jessica turned her attention back to Brenda, still dangling before her.  \"What are you?!\" the officer demanded slowly, her windpipe seriously impaired as she hung in the air.  \"You'll know soon,\" Jessica said, her voice again rough and deep, \"you'll be one of us.\"  She pulled Nelson in close as she kicked and struggled.  Then, Jessica tightly and passionately pushed Brenda\u2019s lips to her own, pulling her into a long kiss.  Inside Jessica, a creature squirmed up from her belly through her windpipe and her mouth and into that of the struggling Brenda Nelson.  Nelson struggled and choked as the wormlike alien burrowed into her middle-aged body.  That done, Jessica dropped her roughly to the ground, where Nelson rolled around and grunted while the alien took control of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica watched her offspring as it wrested control of Nelson\u2019s own body from her.  Jessica suddenly turned as a noise came from behind her.  Looking down, she saw that Tania had begun to stir a little.  Without so much as a thought, she grabbed a nearby pair of scissors off a shelf and shoved them into Tania\u2019s throat.  Her eyes shot open as she tried to scream in pain but could not.  Suddenly, her body relaxed as she passed away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica turned to see that the other creature was enjoying its new body.  It poked and prodded its full form, cupping its gorgeous breasts.  \"You know what to do,\" Jessica said in a deep, guttural voice.  He possessed Brenda just nodded.  The latter would used its body\u2019s authority to search for the first person to come to the crash site\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tThe two go off together to search for the first person at the crash site.<br>\r\n2)\tThe two wish to examine their host bodies more closely.               <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The creature continued along the carpet throughout the dwelling of its previous host and the host's mother. It continued until it saw something else impeding its movement, another door it seemed. Once more it flattened its body and slipped under the crack between the door and the floor though this time it took considerably more effort. From there it moved across a surface that was much harder and then another that was somewhere between the most recent surface and the carpet. It eventually made its way out into the familiar scene of the street it had used to arrive at this dwelling in its previous host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then heard a sound, multiple voices talking excitedly. The creature looked and saw three females walking together in the creature's direction. From the tone of their voices, their mannerisms and their facial expressions it seemed to be pleasant conversation leading the creature to believe that these females were on friendly terms with one another. It was at that moment, as the group walked by the creature, that the female closest to the creature looked down and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" said one of the other two females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you two go on ahead a little bit. I... need to talk to Mrs. Whitmore to ask her if I need to babysit Molly this week.\" the closest one stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two agreed and continued walking while the closest female turned completely towards the creature and squated down. \"What is this? It's like some kind of weird slug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point the creature realized that it was beginning to feel weak. Members of its species were specially tuned to their home world. Off of it, however, the species would quickly weaken and if it could not find a host body, both to protect it from and adapt to the environment as well as offer nourishment through the host's own bodily functions--which in turn strengthened the host--it would soon die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature could not afford to be picky at this time and quickly it lunged forward into the female's mouth. The female choked and gasped. She reached her hand to try and pull the creature out but she was too slow and disoriented. The creature made its way into her mouth and body and she convulsed as the creature began assuming control of her. Once this process was finished the girl stopped and sat on the ground, her eyes staring ahead unblinking as the creature absorbed the knowledge the female possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this was complete the creature stood the female's body up and reviewed some basic information. Her name was Christina Yang, 13 years old and a resident of this particular neighborhood. This Christina, like other humans her age, was still considered young but decidedly more mature than the creature's previous host. She had developed, or rather was still developing, the secondary sex characteristics that the females of this species were known for. It seemed that along with these secondary sex characteristics this female had recently come to a period of life where she could begin breeding. In fact, the creature noted while reviewing the female's knowledge, she was seen as a desirable breeding partner among other humans in close age proximity... and some that were a fair bit more mature as well. A big part of it seemed to be that Christina was what people of this planet referred to as Asian, apparently many males found females of this ethnicity desirable for mating purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung, healthy, desirable. The creature turned Christina's mouth into a smile. Yes, Christina would make a more than suitable host in which to acclimate to this planet's culture as well as hunt down the human that had been exposed to the meteorite that the creature had arrived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance the creature saw Christina's comrades. The female's memories told him that the one on the left, with the light-colored hair, was named Lauren Fischer while the one on the right with darker-colored, though not as dark as Christina's, hair was named Madison Greene. These two, it turned out, were the closest comrades of the creature's host, \"best friends\" was the human term. In this healthy host the creature felt energized and had a few extra abilities it wanted to try out. These two \"best friends\" would make perfect test subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature moved at great speed to catch up to them. \"Lauren! Madison! Friends, I have caught up!\" it exclaimed in Christina's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls giggled. \"So do you have to babysit Molly?\" asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not ask.\" the creature replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said that's why you had to stop!\" Lauren exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not important so I did not ask.\" replied the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked at each other. \"Uh, are you feeling alright Christina?\" asked Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am as healthy as any other female my age, why do you ask?\" replied the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're acting really weird.\" Madison stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. Yes I have not fully acclimated.\" said the creature, \"But you two shall help me, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either girl could react Christina had grabbed Lauren by the throat and quickly threw her to the ground knocking her unconscious. She then turned her attention to Madison who was frozen in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile fully healthy and occupying a host the creature could manipulate the body down to the cellular level and to Madison's surprise Christina's arm changed into a blade-like appendage. Christina used the blade to stab Madison in the gut, a good test of it's cellular transformation technique but there was something more, more advanced that it wanted to try. It could puncture the skull of a human and and extract the brain matter gaining knowledge... but could it do more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade that had pierced Madison began morphing into more of a tube-like shape. To Madison's horror she then began to feel and see herself sucked into this tube, her insides, her outsides, her bones, her clothes, everything liquifying as she was converted into genetic material and sucked into and through the tube and into Chrisina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature than began using the genetic material while re-arranging Christina's body. Her face and head shape changed, her height and weight changed, her secondary sex characteristics grew a small amount, her hair changed style and became lighter, her clothes changed. In mere seconds where Christina Yang had stood now stood Madison Greene. \"Astounding!\" Madison stated as she examined her hands, \"I have not had a healthy enough host to allow me to do this in ages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature then changed its host's form back to Christina looked over at Lauren. It changed Christina's left hand into something more malleable with no real form as it covered the girl's mouth. The hand then opened as a creature similar to the one inhabiting Christina, though smaller, exited into Lauren's body who began convulsing. While this was going on the creature decided to try something else: Christina's right arm became tube-shaped again as the absorbed genetic material was deposited onto the ground. It then coalesced and re-formed taking the shape of Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Christina asked, her voice a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison Greene.\" came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And are you independent?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physically yes. But my loyalty is to you. I can live among humans normally but I shall follow your commands as well.\" stated Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Most amazing!\" Christina exclaimed gleefully. She then turned to Lauren who seemed to be recovering, \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your offspring, occupying this female in much the same way you are with her. You should call me Lauren to make things easier though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature decided to try one more thing: it had kept a small bit of Madison's genetic material, equivalent to a bit of human hair, when it had deposited it. Would this be enough to retain the ability to take Madison's form? It concentrated and once more Madison stood where Christina had been, then quickly changed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this will do wonderfully.\" Christina growled with a grin, \"Lauren and Madison! Return to your dwellings. Should I need you I shall contact you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" both nodded in unison before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature inside Christina Yang couldn't be more pleased. It had chosen an exceptional host. The question now was what to do? Should it return to her own dwelling to live among the female's family unit? Perhaps it could convert them as well making it a perfect base with which to operate from. Or should it set out now in search of the human who had found the meteor and stolen the technology of its species?</span></div></div>",

It was spacious and a nice dwelling, from what the former occupants memories told you. You looked through the home and found your hosts mother laying on the couch, she appeared to be sleeping too. Perfect, you thought to yourself grinning. You studied her up, she had a fair complexion for a white woman of the species, and a large bust to boot. Must have been H cups. She had lovely curves and sexy legs from a man's point of view. These traits would help your cause of infiltration and breeding later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour memories told you your host's sister Sarah was home, and seeing as 'your' mother wasn't going anywhere, taking her would be easy since she was sleeping. You traveled upstairs, noticing the sway of your body's ass and breasts. Very wonderful and enticing you thought, you must explore what these humans call \"masturbation\" later. Taking a look into sarah's bedroom, she was nowhere to be seen, until you heard faint noises coming from a room known as a bathroom. You moved toward it, and tried opening the door, but alas, it was locked. Sarah was taking a shower, from what your memory told you once more. You smiled deviously and slowly turned your body into the liquid from earlier, and you slipped under the door crack. You than began remorphing into Christina's form, but you had an idea.

You grinned, having been pleased with the results. You turned and looked in the mirror and saw Sarah now. She had shorter black hair, a nice tan complexion and cup breasts for sure. And she seemed just as healthy as Christina from the looks of it. You smiled and turned your attention to the 'real' Sarah and began your plan. You stripped out of the body's clothing and pulled the curtain away to see Sarah showering. She turned to you an angry tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, who...\" but her words died off immediately as she saw a perfect, naked imitation of herself standing there grinning at her. At a loss for words and trying to find them she stuttered. \"Who.. how.. what..\" she was clearly shocked. This is were you took your chance and started the plan. Your hand moved toward her quickly, morphing into the blade like arm and stabbing her straight in the belly button, your other hand covering her mouth to prevent screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You see.. there only needs to be one Sarah.. or me I should say. Don't worry though, I'll put your body.. and mine\" you stopped and giggled. \"I'll put it to good use!\" you finished. You began sucking Sarah's body into your own like last time with Christina's friend. Sarah's eyes weld with tears from pain, also wide from shock and horror while you just grinned at her, she looked down, and felt a liquid entering her body, only to be replaced by feeling sucked into the arm. She watched helpless as her body was slowly absorbed until the real Sarah no longer existed, just the alien assuming her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm.. yesss. She was very healthy!\" You giggled. You felt your form shift with the added body, your boobs swelled into E's and your hair grew a little longer and you felt more toned. You smiled devilishly and began spewing out the liquid from your arm before morphing it back to normal. The liquid mass then began shifting into the form of Christina, which you willed it to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hello there 'Christina' hope you enjoy that body\" you laughed, enjoying what humans called humor. And for some reason, after absorbing Sarah and her memories you found that she had an interest in alien encounters such as this to be erotic.. too bad for her, you thought giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hello Master.. or should I say 'Sarah'\" she said grinning. \"What's next? Our mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You began to ponder the next plan of action.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, what are you doing here kid?\" asked a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature turned to look at her. She was a woman with long, voluminous red hair. Her large breasts filled a tight strapless crop top. A tight skirt hugged her backside and her legs were accentuated by tall, heeled boots. All of it was covered up with thick, dark coat. She was leaned against the wall of a building with a sign that read \"Teasers\", a cigarette in between her fingers. This was a woman, Christina's mind told him, that was considered \"sexy\"; a prime object of lustful human desire and thus someone who could potentially wield a lot of power. She could be useful to add. Plus the creature was not yet at full strength. Devouring more humans would remedy that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry. It appears that I am lost.\" The creature stated. \"My... father went inside this building. He told me to wait inside the car but I could not wait any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm real sorry to hear that, sweetie, but this isn't a good area. You shouldn't be hanging around here.\" replied the woman as she took a drag of her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an inquiry then.\" said the creature, \"Would you be able to show me a place where I may wait safely, away from the eyes of others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman eyed \"Christina\" oddly but pointed down the street a bit. \"There's an alleyway right down there. Should keep you out of sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Would you be able to accompany me?\" asked the creature, \"I do not wish to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you're an odd girl. You autistic or something? I guess I should, I've got a little bit of a break.\" said the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were out of sight the creature looked at the woman. \"You are very attractive. I would like to be as attractive as you.\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed a bit. \"Well you're certainly as cute as you are odd. You'll be a head turner in a few years, I'm sure. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years? Ah, what you use to measure solar cycles. 365 days.\" The creature eyed the woman coldly, \"I do not have that long. I would like to know the secrets of attracting mates now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, honey, you're really starting to creep me ou--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's eyes went wide as she was cut off by a sharp pain in her abdomen. The girls arm had extended and pierced it, much like a blade, and she could do nothing but gasp in surprise and pain. The girls arm then turned into some kind of tube shape and the woman gasped in horror as her body began to contort, compress and liquify as it was sucked in. The creature looked as the tub turned back into a human hand, then its body began to change once more into an exact copy of the woman that it had just absorbed, clothes and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joanna Wilson, 25 years of age and an employee at that building, Teasers, where she works as an exotic dancer, also called a stripper, under the stage name of Strawberry.\" it replied, the voice was the woman's but cold. It looked down at itself, its now large breasts and shapely figure. \"This female is sexually desired but it seems that it is obvious from her very appearance what her occupation is and she is thus shamed. This form does not wield the power I had assumed. It would seem my default shape is more advantageous, more disarming. Still, this Strawberry's knowledge shall be an immense help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the creature resumed wearing Christina Yang's form though not without some alterations, namely with Strawberry's outfit altered to fit Christina's body. Christina's breasts were increased in size just enough to be noticeable, her ass was made firmer and fuller, red lips replaced Christina's smaller ones. Christina's \"cuteness\", Strawberry's mind told the creature, combined with Strawberry's knowledge of how to be sexually desirable would help immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to prove correct when, not long after the creature had set off, did a car pull up beside it. \"Whoa, what's a girl like you doin' in a place like this dressed like that?\" asked a man, older in appearance and looking quite slovenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature looked at him. \"There is somewhere I need to be. In fact, would you be able to transport me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transport?! Girl are you crazy or somethin'? I can't do that, I'm in trouble enough as is!\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature eyed him but remembered something Strawberry had said as well as what her mind now told it: the creature's actions and manner of speak were seemingly considered out and out of place, unnerving even. It would have to act more natural and perhaps do more to entice the man into offering it transportation. An idea formed and there was a shift in its vocal cords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, mister.\" it said in a perfect replica of Strawberry's sultrier voice, \"I'll make it worth your while. You give me a ride and maybe I'll give you a ride too for no cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at the creature in stunned amazement. \"D'aah, whatever! I'm probably a dead man anyway. Pissed off the wrong people so it ain't like anything worse can happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature hopped into the car and then directed the man. \"The parking lot over there.\" it said, \"I feel like I should give you your ride first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man did as directed but he was shocked to to see the girl's left hand morph into a perfect copy of her head. \"Jesus, what the fuck are you?!\" the man exclaimed. He wanted to scream and run away but his body seemed to not be responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a being who can manipulate my body however I please.\" the fake Christina head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's real head turned into a copy of Strawberry's. \"I can reshape it however I want.\" it stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature's right hand then became a copy of Madison's head. \"I can become whatever I desire.\" the fake Madison head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all three heads said, in unison, \"Or I can be whatever you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Christina head smiled, \"So please, allow me to provide you with an experience you'll never forget.\" it stated as the creature moved its arm toward the man who, reluctantly, grabbed the head and began kissing it... the head's mouth then opened inhumanly wide englufing the man's head. And much like with Strawberry and Madison the man too was liquified and consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fair!\" the Madison head pouted, \"I wanted to eat him. Eugh, but he tastes awful though! Still the more I feed the more powerful I become. I wonder if the person who accessed my technology will taste as good as the three girls or as gross as this guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the man was fully consumed, the creature morphed its hand and head back to normal but did not take his form. It had no desire to become this slovenly male, it just wanted his car but it did search through his mind: Bob Dawson, 45 and a career criminal who had recently ripped off the Russian mob. He's right, he was going to die just not how he assumed. The man was crafty and unscrupulous though. His personality would be useful, much like Strawberry's had just been, so the creature let it influence it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked down at itself and felt its breasts, a smile on its face. \"Guess ya really did get inside her like you were plannin', huh? And now that you are, I totally get the appeal. Sexy little Asian slut and this young? Forbidden fruit. Shame I get to enjoy it instead of you. Maybe when I off this asshole, though, I'll have a bit of fun with her.\" It then changed into Strawberry. \"Or her.\" It stated before turning into Madison, \"Or this littel bitch.\" It said before turning back into Christina. \"Or I'll find some other pieces of ass to enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature laughed as it fired up the car. It'd have to learn how to integrate the personalities, Bob's scumbag nature, Strawberry's sultriness and Christina's innocence would all be useful. But for now switching on the fly would have to suffice. It then drove off in the direction where it sensed what it was looking for.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Carl was awoken in his apartment by drilling outside, workmen who were assigned to the new building across the street always woke him up these past few weeks. He grunted and cussed under his breath as he brought his hand to his face and rubbed his eyes. He had a banging headache, no doubt from his encounter with the weird rock the night before. He idly slid out of bed and crawled over to the table, grabbing a couple of painkillers and the last bit of beer in a can nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully awake, Carly proceeded into his dank bathroom to take a piss. He just stood there relieving himself, thinking of a way he could today's hours.Maybe he would do a little shoplifting or something so he could afford his next fix. He had grown accustomed to a bit of crack now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then his beat-up cell phone chimed and he shook his dick before slipping it back in his pants. Then without washing his hands he walked back in the other room and grabbed his phone. His ex-girlfriend Melissa had finally replied to a message he sent two days ago. But it wasn't the answer he had hoped for when he had asked if they could meet up. Just two words appeared on the text screen - <i>\"Fuck off!\"</i> Carl at once felt an anger welling up inside him, as was common, and he threw his phone against the wall, smashing it to pieces. \"Bitch!\" he growled, pacing his room and running his hand through the hair he hadn't washed for weeks. The anger only increased, and Carl suddenly lunged for the wall and punched it repeatedly. His hand began to hurt after three blows, but he seemed to be making progress in damaging in the wall too. After the fifth blow... something happened, his arm seemed to sink into the wall all the way up to his shoulder. \"Shit!\" he said, instantly regretting his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck you psycho!\" a woman's voice screamed out in the adjoining apartment. Carl waited a moment and then withdrew his arm from the wall, and to his amazement his hand was now unhurt.. Then he heard his neighbor Cassie, 26, again. \"What the fuck are you doing shoving swords through walls?\" she screamed through the perforated wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Swords? What's that crazy bitch talking about?\"</i> Carl thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your panties in a bunch, just call the super and tell him to come fix it\" Carl shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later there was a loud knock on Carl's door, and he sighed, hesitant to answer it. But he did eventually answer the door, and there was stood his angry neighbor Cassie, clad in her baggy grey t-shirt and denim shorts. She was barefoot. \"I've had enough of you,\" she growled at him, \"you're a sack of shit!\" she continued, venting her fury, while Carl just stood there, mildly amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're probably right, but what the <b>fuck</b> are you doing to do about it?\" he said to her, his expression turning more threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed away a little as Carl lurched forward.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The main protagonist, 33-year old Carl Jason Edwards, is a career criminal, responsible for dozens of burglaries and and assaults. He has often thought about committing bigger crimes but is not prepared to spend a long stretch of time in prison. Years of his life already spent in juvenile centers and prison have taken their toll on his mental well being, driving him to smoke and drink a lot. Carl's physical appearance is 5' 11\", short, scruffy, black hair, unshaven face and untidy street clothes (i.e jeans, sneakers etc.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his negative personality, Carl no longer has friends, and the only girlfriend he ever had, Melissa, had dumped him three years ago when he refused to give up his life of crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one day, while heading back to his apartment after a heavy drinking session, Carl witnesses something falling from the sky, landing on deserted ground behind an old warehouse with a thud. After approaching the strange object, he discovers it is some kind of alien artifact that seems to be glowing, but not just from heat due to entry into the Earth's atmosphere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he touches it in his drunken state...he gets more than he bargained for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powers Carl receives are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The ability to turn/morph other people into physical copies of himself (their clothes can either change also, or they can stay the same, your choice). The people he changes have to be nearby, in his line of sight so to speak. (Any mental changes, if any, are up to the individual author).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The power to possess other people's bodies by sending clones of himself into them. He can do this a limitless number of times, though try to keep the number sensible. Again, distance is a factor, the other people have to be somewhere in the vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. He can leave his own body entirely and just possess someone else's body, but he would have to make sure that his own body is somewhere safe, as it will be 'pilotless' so to speak if he does this. Once more, and perhaps inevitably, distance is a factor, though he can travel several miles in his non-corporeal form. Please keep celebrities out of it, that's been done to death, lol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Shapeshifting, Carl will have the ability to morph his body into any other human form, regardless of gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: A few people will be immune to his powers, but not many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nNot many restrictions on this one, if any, but everything has rules.<br>\r\nSwearing/cursing is permitted. <br>\r\nNo killing the main character, at least not straight away, lol.<br>\r\nPlease try to keep spelling and grammar to a high quality (I do realize typos are sometimes unavoidable, I can correct these)<br>\r\nOther than that, no limitations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n500 Gift Points for each good chapter.<br>\r\n100 Gift Points for a lesser one.</td>",
