He awoke at six o'clock, worked out, showered, and joined other prisoners at the lunch hall for breakfast.  After his horrid breakfast, Russell went back to his cell.  While walking back to his room, a strange new prisoner caught his attention.  This new man was small and dinky in comparison to the rest of the prisoners, and he was also wearing a straightjacket.  Russell was puzzled as to why this man was restrained, so of course he went to talk to the man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there ol' man, you must be new here,\" said Russell to the new prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there Russell,\" responded the gypsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" asked Russell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seen young boy, I know everything about you, and I know how badly you want to escape from this hell hole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do, but don't we all?\" said Russell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know what?\" asked the gypsy, \"Something is different about you, something is definitely different about you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Russell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that you should leave her, I mean come on, I know you don't want to be here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right, but how could I escape from here?  Nobody makes it out of here alive\" said Russell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talama Quoe Choo Chaa\" chanted the gypsy, \"Talama Quoe Choo Chaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the gypsy finished his chants and rituals, Russell collapsed on the ground, drawing the attention of fellow prisoners and of course the guards and other workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when Russell wakes up? </span></div></div>",

He blinked a few times, his eyes adjusting to the stark brightness of white neon lamp on the ceiling just above him. He looked around and greeted by the familiar white interior and antiseptic smell, he closed his eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell woke up again, but this time from the repeated calling of his name, by a voice that he barely recognize. ''Russell...'', the enigmatic voice called out again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell jerked up, ''What?!'', he exclaimed angrily. To his surprise, the old gypsy man was standing in front of him, but he was more surprised that the gypsy was somehow semi-transparent and naked. Russell looked at his own self and muttered, ''Oh crap.'', as he saw that he himself was also semi transparent. His physical body beside him, not breathing as with the old gypsy's physical body not far nearby. He could see infirmary nurses busily attending to the immobile bodies, passing through his and the gypsy's body as if they were thin air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What the fuck?!'', Russell muttered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>***</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What happened to me? To us?'', said Russell. He and the gypsy was sitting atop one of the desk, watching the nurses trying to resuscitate their physical body. Moments ago, the gypsy had taught him that this form, or astral projection as commonly known required concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look at them...'', the gypsy smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We can't save them.'', a male nurse stated plainly. Some of the other staffs shook their head and stopped administering defib on the dead bodies. Others looked at the clock and noted the time of the death. ''Very peculiar...'', the male nurse muttered to himself, before he went out the infirmary. A female nurse instructed the other nurses left in the room to clean up and call the morgue, before she soon followed the male nurse. There were murmuring in the room as the two dead bodies wheeled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So... if what you said was true... I can possess other people's body?'', said Russell, clearly concerned about his predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well. Yes, to an extent.'', the gypsy smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, like that girl over there?'', Russell pointed at a female nurse staying behind. She was of an Africa-America lineage and was slightly chubby and short, not to mention rather plain in appearance and frizzed hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I take it that you wanted a demo?'', said the gypsy. He walked over to the nurse and calmly put his hand through her body, which seemed to absorb it. The gypsy then finished by hopping into her body, disappearing completely from sight. The female nurse shuddered, her hand scrambled to reach a desk and leaned on it for balance. A few panting breath later, she looked straight at Russell, a smirk appeared on her face. She took a paper weight and thumped it on another female nurse's head, with a groan, she crumpled to the floor, unconscious. Other nurses immediately restrained the possessed female. She struggled and let out a high pierced shriek but went limp almost immediately and to Russell's astonishment, the old gypsy phased through her body, passed through other nurses and staffs and walked back to Russell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's what you get for putting me inside that jacket.'', the old gypsy sneered at the unconscious female on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell was convinced of his new power...</span></div></div>",

You should be floating around again.  Now you got anymore jibber-jabber, or are you gonna possess somebody?\" said the gypsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it sounds like a plan, but who do I go after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about Lt. Parsons, you know he runs this place.  If you became him, you could do whatever the fuck you want!\" explained the gypsy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that sounds like a good plan, let's just go find him\" said Russell hesitantly.  He didn't know what to expect with his first possession.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the gypsy and Russell floated around the prison, searching for Lt. Parsons.  The searched high and low, but finally, the found him organizing paperwork in his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go behind him, and float into his back, it's that easy!\" said the gypsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so\" Russell said nervously.  Russell floated directly behind Lt. Parsons, and waited for that perfect moment.  He calmed himself down, and flew directly into Lt. Parsons back.  Parsons was hurled forward onto his desk.  A few moments later, Russell felt familiar feelings.  He could feel legs below him, arms to his side, and most importantly, a physical body he now wore.  He stood up, and checked himself and the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there 'Lt. Parsons', how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...\" Russell said before he cut himself off, \"Woah, this is just so fucking weird!

Lieutenant?\" ne guard shouted after him, to no avail. Russell just grinned as he walked free, holding his host's hands out in front of him, marveling at his new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was far enough away from the prison, and near a main road, Russell decided to ditch Lt. Parsons' body. Concentrating, he ejected himself out of his host body, which then collapsed to the floor. Russell sneered at the unconscious officer and then set off floating down the highway until he saw a car approaching in the opposite direction. \"Oh look, a ride!\" he grinned to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car was a silver sports car, and behind the wheel was a petite blonde woman with short hair and sizeable breasts, and she was dressed in a summer hat, a leopard-print camisole top, a pair of blue hoochie shorts and high heeled sandals. She also had some sunglasses on and she was humming a tune that was playing on the car radio as Russell entered her car by passing through the windshield. \"What a babe!\" he said, peering down into her cleavage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Time to see the goods.\" Russell said smiling as he looked in the rear view mirror, only to see the blonde woman smiling back at him with her gorgeous smile. Russell then took off the woman's sun glasses and was met by some of the most mesmerizing blue eyes he'd ever seen. \"She is quite the looker.\" Russell thought before taking a quick peek down at the breast he was now wearing. He could tell now, that he had chosen right. Dropping one hand from the steering wheel, Russell then slid a hand down the hoochie shorts she was wearing, but before he could explore anymore, police lights went off. Russell didn't even notice that he had been doing twenty over the speed limit, since he was to busy exploring this woman's body. \"Great, I escape prison, only to get pulled over by a fucking cop!\" Russell thought to himself as he pulled over to the side of the road and watched as the male police officer slowly walked on over to his side door.</span></div></div>",

Russell enjoyed hearing a sexy female voice exiting his lips. He removed his victim's summer hat and then took another glance down at the tits on his chest, then smirked to himself. Why not use this bitch's body for a little fun. \"I promise to be a good girl if you let me off without a ticket.\" He purred at the officer, who had produced his booklet and pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see your license please ma'am?\" The officer said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure that's all you want to see?\" Russell chuckled, manuevering in his seat and making sure the cop got a look down his leopard-print top. As he though, the officer was unmoved, but Russell persisted, and in the end persuaded the officer to go back to his cruiser and turn the dashcam off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the cop was in the passenger seat of the woman's car, unzipping his pants. \"You know I really shouldn't be doing this. I have a wife and two kids at home.\" He told the possessed woman in the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell found himself in the peculiar situation of getting aroused when he saw the cop's penis emerge from his pants. <i>Was is because he was in a chick's body? Did he have her hormones, her sexuality?</i> Whatever the case, Russell decided to fight it, no way he wanted to give a blowjob to anyone. Seeing the officer's gun belt, which he had tossed in the back seat, Russell grabbed for it, aiming the gun at the surprised cop. \"Nice todger. Now give me your handcuffs and take off the rest of your clothes. \"Russell said from his victim's body. A manicured finger eased on the trigger as the cop did what he had been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the cop was semi-naked by the roadside, handcuffed to a fence, and Russell was standing over him in his host body, which looked so hot in the skimpy top, hoochie shorts and ankle boots. \"You see this is what happens when you let chicks sweet talk you, dumbass.\" Russell laughed, waving his new firearms at the embarrassed officer. He then took another look down at his stolen body and grabbed his tits. \"Mind you... can't blame you one bit for wanting to get into these panties.\" He winked. Russell was quite literally in the woman's panties.... and it felt great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya dude.\" Russell waved to the cop, before getting back into the woman's car and driving off at high speed. He soon made it to civilization, and parking his car up in a random street, he took a look around. He knew he had to leave the blonde's body, since the police would soon be tracking her down. But the question was... who should he possess next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was several possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. A schoolgirl, about 15 years old in a cheerleader's outfit walking home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. A well dressed man in his 30's arguing with someone on his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. And a young Hispanic woman carrying groceries about to enter her apartment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Russell could be anyone he wanted, any time he wanted. Having spent all of his life as a man he couldn't well resist the temptation of trying out the opposite sex. Blondie had been a fun ride and all, but with the cops no doubt coming for her now he really needed to find a new host. Sitting on the hood of his car he scanned the street for new potentials, settling on three; a schoolgirl, a businessman and a Latina woman. Well the businessman was out, while it would be nice to have money being a guy would be boring. He could go with the Latina, but why not try out being a kid again? A kid of the opposite sex no less. With next to no responsibilities and the freedom to do as he pleased it was too much to pass up, so the schoolgirl it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before he willed himself free from his body, floating out without any trouble and leaving the woman laying over the hood of her car. Stealing one last glance back at her he grinned, giving her a cheeky wave before flying after his next host. She was definitely a pretty little thing, with a head full of red hair down to her shoulders, a nice C cup rack, a set of long legs and just a bit of fat on her to make her not look like a twig. Could ghosts get erections? Sure felt like he was, all the more reason to dive right in, no pun intended. Rubbing his hands together he smiled at the girl's back, immediately lunging for her and fading right in. There was a brief moment of blackness until he was able to see again, the girl's green eyes opening and blinking a few times before a lewd smile crossed her face. Ignoring the phone in her hand she grabbed at her chest, giving her breasts a good squeeze before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this could be fun...\" Russell said to himself, grinning as he peered down his uniform's top. Oh yeah, he'd definitely enjoy this ride. Blowing a stray strand of red hair out of his face he glanced at his phone, smirking seeing the number come up as 'Mom'. If this girl's mother was half as smokin' as she was then he'd really love being part of this family, now he couldn't wait to find out. Just where did she live though? Shit, he'd no clue where he was heading, though he figured she was on her way home when he'd jumped her. On a whim he reached into his bag and sifted through it, relieved to find a wallet inside, and with an ID no less. \"Kristen Summers huh...? Well nice to meet you gorgeous,\" he said, smiling as he found the address on the ID to boot. The sooner he got home the quicker he could really inspect his new body, and maybe have some fun with \"his\" parents while he was at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another 15 minutes of walking, mostly due to his getting lost, Russell finally found what would temporarily be his home. Nothing excessive, just a two story house with a covered porch, some flowering plants along the front and a tree, a white picket fence surrounding the back yard. So they weren't really a loaded family, bummer, he'd hoped he might steal some cash to use later. \"Then again... She's still loaded in other ways,\" Russell reflected, smirking as he grabbed at his stolen chest again. Walking up to the door he paused for just a moment, wondering if he should try fitting in or saying to hell with it. Ultimately he opted to go with the latter, figuring why bother when he could just leave whenever he felt like it? Opening the door he stepped on inside, poking his head in to see...</span></div></div>",

He was standing in a small entry hallway with the stairs up to the second floor on his left, the living room right in front of him, and the doorway to the kitchen down to his right. He could hear someone in the kitchen and he was about to take a closer look when his \"mother\" called out from the kitchen. \"Kristen, is that you honey?\" the voice asked. Russell stepped into the doorway so he could see if his host's mother was hot as he imagined she would be...and he was not disappointed! Rebecca Summers was standing at the kitchen counter drying dishes and stacking them in the cupboards above the counter. Russell's eyes scanned up and down her body before Rebecca noticed his presence behind her. She had blonde hair similar to her possessed daughter, a slim hourglass frame, but an toned and athletic ass. Russell watched as his \"mother\" reached up to put a pitcher away on a high shelf and her white tank top lifted up to reveal a black thong just visible above the woman's tight jeans. If Russell would have gone erect right then if his current body had been able to. Just then Rebecca turned around and smiled at her daughter, not knowing a criminal in control of Kristen's beautiful body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was school today?\" the question caught Russell off-guard as he snapped back to reality. He decided right then to impersonate Kristen as best he could to not arouse suspicion. \"Oh just a pretty regular day mom, nothing out of the ordinary\" he lied, picturing Kristen briefly spasm as he possessed her earlier that afternoon. \"Okay, well diner will be ready in a few hours, I just got back from my work out and your father is picking up your sister from cheer leading practice\" Rebecca responded before turning back to the dishes. \"Sounds god, I'm just gonna head up to my room and work on my homework\" Russell said, as he ran his hands down to his chest and groped the fleshy mounds he currently owned, then he stole another glance at his current body's MILF of a mom before turning to leave the kitchen and find Kristen's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raced up the stairs to the second floor, eager to find Kristen's room and explore his stolen flesh. His mind was racing with information and half-cooked plans. Rebecca was an absolute babe! he would definitely need to try out her body sometime soon. Kristen also had a sister who happened to be a cheerleader, and based on his current body and her mom, the sister should be just as attractive if not MORE attractive! Russell knew he was going to have a lot of fun with this family before he moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the first door on the right as he reached the top of the stairs and he felt something click in the back of his mind. He was certain this was Kristen's room so he went inside and shut the door behind him. He was perplexed by what had just happened to him and he was about to investigate when he caught his reflection in the mirror...</span></div></div>",

Leaning back against the door he let out a laugh, before he dropped the groceries on the floor, not caring if anything broke or spilled. He then walked his new body over to the apartment's window, getting to see as the chick who he had been inhabiting only as few moments ago, was taken out of her car by a police officer and put into the back of their car. \"Did I do all that.\" Russell said aloud, laughing as he finally understood the full potential of his new found gift. \"I'm never going back to prison ever again! No one will ever be able to catch me!\" Russell then turned all of his attention too the Latina woman's body, who he was now inhabiting at the moment. \"Mmmm, how long has it been since I've been able to touch breast like these, or even had sex?\" He wondered, fondling his new assets while he pondered the question.</span></div></div>",

Russel begun fondling his new found breast again, squeezing and messaging them fast and slow until he tried to get the woman's bra off. he started having trouble and then came to the realization that he never in his life taken a woman's bra off..........they always had taken it off themselves before then. Russell in the moment resorted to just ripping it off, as Russell begin pulling and tugging on the bra unable to rip it apart due to his host lack of strength, it was less then he was use too, and so he wiggled and tugged the bra off over his head finally exposing the Latina's beautiful mounds. The two lumps of flesh laid perfectly on his chest as Russell then immediately  went ham on them with his new delicate hands, again fondling them feeling the new sensation of his host fingernails digging into his new breast, he loved the feeling of his nails piercing his breast and begun pinching and twisting his breast nipples, the feeling was euphoric and he could feel his pants get moist, Russell then put a hand down his pants using the tip of the Latina's fingernail to softly touch his new clit, the feeling was like a little electrodes shooting into his new body, he was about to go all in when you couldn't help but notice that there was a Bathroom in the Latina's room, Russel had an idea and thought should he go take this new woman's body for a very long, long shower or continue what he's doing now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Russell thought for a moment. Briscle. This was the police officer who had got him locked up for something he hadn't done. She'd set him up for a crime he didn't commit on behalf of a criminal gang. She'd even laughed about it to his face. But Kate Briscle was a petite career officer with an angelic, round face and neat, straight brown locks that made her look sweet and honest - a perfect disguise for a dirty cop who had taken a pay-off from a low level gangster to get Russell out of the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't ratted, though. You never rat. And nobody would believe a supposed criminal that a cop was dirty. So even when she'd told him, to his face, that \"the Lupinos gave their regards\", and laughed about it in front of him, he had kept silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the tables had turned. The only problem was that he had no idea where Briscle lived, or even which precinct she worked in. And the bodies didn't seem to come with any memories that would make it easy to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, floating along the street, before spotting a young man standing looking at his cell. \"Great,\" Russell said, jumping into his new host. In the blink of an eye he shook, and found himself clutching the phone. Quickly he swiped away from the text message his host had been reading, and accessed the internet and the phone directory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriscle... Briscle... Briscle KT. he grinned as he spotted the address. He recognized it, too. With a final shake he exited his temporary host, leaving the young man bewildered as to what he'd been searching for online. Then, taking a deep breath, Russell stepped out into the road, watching a car speed toward him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this works...\" he muttered as he waited for the car to hit him... only for it to fly straight through his ghost-like form. Suddenly he was in the driver seat, sat in the body of a middle-aged man dressed in a business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he muttered with his new voice. \"I guess it did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to turn to Briscle's street, and then he left the driver, lost on a road he didn't recognize. He watched as the man looked puzzled, and began to drive down the street trying to find a turn off back to the main road. Russell sniggered, and turned his attention to the houses. It looked like a quiet neighborhood, with small gardens and neatly trimmed lawns. Exactly the kind of place Briscle would live, he thought, wondering what he was going to do exactly. Fuck with her somehow, but quite how he didn't know. Maybe possess people around her, scare her, drive her paranoid? Maybe possess her and commit some crime - maybe even rob the bank he supposedly robbed. Or he could impersonate Briscle and find out why he'd been framed and put in jail. It would be hard without access to her memories, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, and thought about it for a moment, watching as a delivery driver pulled up with a package for a house down the street. Suddenly he had an idea. Rushing forward, Russell dived in to the driver's stomach, causing the man to twitch slightly as he took control of his frame. Now, with package in hand, he walked up to Briscle's house and rang the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a woman answered. She wasn't Briscle, but had the same round, friendly face and small frame. She was hot, Russell decided, probably in her mid-20s, with her brunette locks cut in long, thick bangs, and her eyes hidden behind thick-framed glasses. He smiled and offered a greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi m'am. I've got a package for a Kate Briscle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" The woman replied. \"I can take that if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are?\" He asked. The woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm her sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell laughed. \"Perfect,\" he said. Within seconds he had flown out of the delivery driver and in to the waiting woman. He felt his new body convulse, and let out a gasp as he felt body parts he'd never had before. The sensations rushed over him, making him blush as he caught his - her - breath and straightened his - her - glasses. The delivery driver stood there, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. That's for number 29. Down the road,\" he said, faking the woman's friendly smile. The driver nodded, apologized, and left. Then Russell closed the door, and strode in to the house. \"Now,\" he muttered. \"Let's find out who I am.\" It didn't take long to find 'her' wallet, and her phone wasn't locked. A quick read of her driver ID and emails revealed everything. Russell was now Emily Briscle, Kate's 24-year-old younger sister. Emily was in town visiting for a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell smiled and stared at Emily's face in her compact, pouting her lips, combing her bangs. He could easily stay as Emily, have a little fun, maybe get the younger sister in trouble until Kate came. Or he could simply wait. He'd been in jail too long, and now he had everything he could want: food, drink, TV, the internet. He could hang around as Emily until officer Briscle came home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he could get payback.</span></div></div>",

Being able to give a real excuse for not being able to work. Russell moved closer to the young lady in question. Russell did consider her lacking in the chest department and she did have a rather plain face but possessed nice long blond hair. And besides the lack of breasts wouldn't say anything about how good her pussy would feel. Russell grinning already moved himself inside the nurse's body and imagined himself inside it. Russell could feel himself being taken inside the body giving him control of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden Russell's vision faded and an immediate headache seriously flared up. Russell tried to open his eyes but his vision was troubling. \"Joyce, are you okay?\" A female voice asked him concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get my hands on the one that did this.\" Russell mumbled as he tried to rub his head. That sensation, the feeling of hair, was something new. When he was taken in, they shaved off his hair and now he had a whole lot of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Russell saw the familiar nurse uniform and the pale skin he had. He did it, he had taken over the nurse's body. Russell didn't notice his fellow nurses put him up as he was still in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joyce, are you alright?\" One of the nurses asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell looked up in the face. \"Yeah, sorry. My head hurts like hell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, in that case I think it's better to send you home. Get some rest. Tiffany will bring you home.\" The nurse that was talking to him nodded her head to another nurse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, fine with me.\" Russell nodded but in his head there were some doubts rising. What if he needed to go back to his old body. Going home to the Joyce her home wouldn't allow him to use any kind of influence. Should he really go home or should he stay here?</span></div></div>",

Blinking heavily you pushed on, you were guided by the feeling that you wanted to get out of here, you wouldn't even remember how long you'd been inside you just knew you needed to see the world again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHobbling out of the entrance you caught a brief glimpse of a tree, a sight that you had not experienced forever the colors contrasted massively to the scheme that the prison had adopted. It would be better experienced had you not just been hit over the head. Maybe a different host may have been more opportunistic but you didn't know where you lived and if you jumped into the other girl, you msy be stuck with the baggage that is your current host, no doubt she would ask a tonne of questions and you couldn't deal with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the information was overloading your brain, who ever said crime didn't pay , had you not done the crime you wouldn't know be riding a blonde nurse, There was a thought that crossed your mind about what happened to the Gypsy there is a chance he hopped into your chauffeur but you found this to be unlikely as the girl leading you wasn't speaking to you or alluding to, in any away, that she had been taken over, either way you didn't want to say anything the current pain you were feeling meant that most thoughts reverted back to a concentration on the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were escorted to her car that appeared to be a Red Ford Fiesta, leading you the nurse opened the door moving you to an appropriate height so that you could enter the vehicle, once in you stared in front, seeing a pretty clean dashboard, with the exception of a couple of crumpled receipts  and an empty bottle of Cola. Rolling the bottle onto the floor, you maneuvered you arms to pull the seat belt from behind your shoulders across you and clicked it into the red seat belt port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seat belt not lay across your chest, making a divide. This was new, this was the first time you began noticing the peculiarities of being a women. Before you could marvel Tiffany sat next to you, proceeding to do a similar group of actions, but instead her hands went to grab the steering wheel. She looked thoughtfully at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back dejected, you realized that you may have to begin playing a character when in a body, it's not that it would be a problem, who would ever believe that you weren't Joyce there was no way to prove otherwise, but you could do without any awkward moments, thinking it's easier not to lie and avoid spoiling the illusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the concussion began to lift, you began to see more clearly being able to properly see the road ahead of you and also Tiffany's face, it was pretty but like the other nurses plain, t was a rule that the nurses couldn't wear make-up. when working with inmates, looking at boring as possible was the best thing to do especially to horny prisoners.  you wondered how long your co-escapee had his powers, surely if he had had it for long he wouldn't have been locked up, yet on the other side of the coin, maybe this was his plan to get thrown in prison to find you, or possess his way into prison just to find you, but why would he, you never thought of yourself as special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving your body behind may have been a mistake, but logically if you had to leave your body, it would mean that every time you fancied a ride in someone your body would collapse and you'd have to repossess it at the hospital or worse the morgue. It's arguable that you could just put your body at your house and go for a spree of possessions but it just means that you are chained to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ride wa fun because in truth you didn't know where you were going. This became very apparent when you entered a drive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only benefit to being hit in the head s that question was not odd at all, you could play it off as genuine confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're at mine, silly\". She seemed so lovely, you could see that she was a good friend which made whatever part of you that still experienced empathy feel slightly bad, but non the less, you had plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about clothes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that other nurse must have hit you hard, you left a couple of bits of clothing last time you were over, and I've got some stuff obviously not bras...\" Tiffany coughed, as if she had just stuck her foot in her mouth, you imagined from the brief time you knew her that she was very pure, yet had moments where the words flew out without them being present in the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of that comment your eyes drifted towards your colleges chest, you noticed that she was better endowed than you, whilst you did this a weak laugh escaped your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than say anything further, she headed towards the brown front door, grabbing her key and thrusting it into the lock, she appeared to be muttering something to herself, as if she was telling herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any longer and I was planning on leaving without you\" The old gypsy said. Russell was surprised to suddenly find the old man floating in the jail cell he had been in after he disappeared. \"Where the hell did you come from?\" Russell said, only to soon realize that he was floating above his jail cell as well. \" Now then. Do you have any questions to ask me.\" The gypsy asked Russell, who was still freaking out over his sudden transparency. Russel looked up to face the gypsy and yelled \"What the hell happened to me!?\" \"Stop yelling.\" The gypsy said, as he went straight through his cell bars and floated into Russell's cell. \"How'd you do that?\" Russell asked amazed. Only to reach his arm out and watch it faze through as well. \"That spell me and you spoke turns the user into a spirit form permanently.\" The man explained. \"Wait, this is permanent!\" Russell began to yell. \"Why would I want to be a ghost for my whole life!?\" Suddenly a guard approach the two's jail cells, but was startled after finding two prisoners cells empty. \"Where are they!?\" He said aloud, while reaching for his walky talky.</span></div></div>",

He instead reached for his cell door keys, unlocking the door and beckoning Russell to walk through. Russell felt his body solidify again before the guard's coarse hands grabbed his own and soon Russell's hands  were cuffed behind his back. \"Hurry up #7285, we're going for a little WALK,\" the guard said, a mischievous gleam in his eye as he pushed Russell forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell could feel the frosty glares coming at him from the other prisoners on his back that made all of his hairs stand warily. <i>'Psst, I know it's you in there, you gypsy bastard,'</i> Russell whispered. <i>'Lemme go, man. All you gotta do is help me outta these walls and, I promise you, there's money stashed on the outside for ya. Whad'ya want, huh? 10G's? 25?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell yelped as the guard hauled him face first into the cell, unsympathetic to Russell's pain. The guard clutched Russell's neck in a vice-grip, squeezing out the air slowly while dragging Russell closer to his deranged looking face. \"First of all,\" the guard spat, \"I'm NOT a freakin' GYPSY, and if you call me that even ONE more time, I'll snap EVERY. BONE. IN YOUR. BODY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, I don't care about your money: the only type of business I'm in is REVENGE. And there's a BIG market for revenge in places like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but what have I g-got to do with any of th-this?\" Russell gasped. He grabbed the guard's arm desperately in a hopeless attempt to pry off the manly paw. A smile stretched across the guard's face as he dropped an asphyxiated Russell onto the floor and left him gasping for air. \"See, I knew you were a smart one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you heard any news about your pending trial date? No, of course not. Well it's been bumped up. To four days time. That's... Thursday? You're gonna go there and get all the charges dropped against you. Don't worry about the details; let's just say I've got friends in high places that are gonna help you out. Afterwards you're gonna meet me outside the 4th courthouse door. From there you'll here the rest of the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I don't wanna meet you outside, crap-for-brains. What the hell happens then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard grinned unnaturally as he leaned in closer to Russell's ear and whispered, \"Then I'll track you down, hunt you and either kill you or drag you back by your underwear, preferably with a couple of missing teeth. Anyways, have fun for the rest of your time here with the little gift I sent you!\" The guard stood up and swivelled around, leaving Russell with not only a sore neck but also a whole heap of unanswered questions.</span></div></div>",
