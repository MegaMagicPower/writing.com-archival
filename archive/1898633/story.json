The two of you were out in the forest in search of things like rare berries, but before you knew it, the sun was going down. \"Shall I assemble the tent?\" she asks tentavely. \"You do it best, so sure.\" You watch as she effortlessly raises the curled up tent in the air with psychic powers, and in an instant, it expands outwards, uncurling as the stakes lodge it into the ground. In a moment, it was all set up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd about time, too, as you begin to hear some houndoom's howl in the distance. \"Alright,\" you say, pulling out your Pokeball, \"now you need to get in...your...\" you stop, as Gardevoir had begun frowning at you. A big frown. \"Come on, you'll be more comfortable in here.\" you say, stepping closer to her with the Pokeball. \"Can't I sleep outside of it for...one night?\" she says, pouting. You roll your eyes. \"This tent's only big enough for one of us, you know, so unless you can somehow make room inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her eyes light up. \"I can do that!\" You look at her, confused. \"You can?\" She nods as she raises her hands up, as they hegin to glow a shade of blue. You stare at the tent, not sure what she's planning. She has that mischievous look in her eye that just tells you something's wrong. And right one cue, you notice one thing wrong...you're beggining to glow! \"Hey, what're you doing?!\" you ask in a mixture of confusion and panic. \"Making room.\" she says noncholantly, and you suddenly feel like you're being squeezed all over. It doesn't hurt, but it's an intense feeling, one that resembles being crushed inside an ever shrinking box from the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as it began, the feeling ended, and you slowly opened your eyes. Your jaw dropped. Gardevoire was...much bigger! As she stepped closer, you made the realization that you're a meager...</span></div></div>",

Your heart sank to the bottom of your chest as she walked closer to you, a grin stretching from ear to ear on her face. You fall backwards out of fear and awe as her giant feet slam down infront of you, each foot a little larger then your whole body! \"G-Gardevoire! I-I didn't know you could...do this!\" She lets out a giggle as you slowly climb to your feet, staring at her gigantic toes in admiration. \"I could always do this, master. The need has never arisen until now.\" You're about to pipe up and say \"That's not true\" when you hear a howling of some kind close to the campsite. Gardevoire lets out a squeal, and suddenly grabs you off the ground with an insane amount of force. As if someone started a rocket and then immedietly stopped it. She climbed into the tent and zipped it up, and collapsed onto the floor, cradingly you in her hands. \"That was close.\" she says, loosening her incredibly tight grip on you. \"No kidding...\" you say, wheezing slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I believe it's time to go to sleep, is it not?\" You frown. You were enjoying talking to Gardevoire, something that you don't actually do very often. She just finished explaining the whole \"size-changing\" thing, and you were still in awe about the whole thing. \"So...are we going to sleep together, or...?\" That question suddenly brought you back to reality. \"T-together?\" \"Well, Master, this tent is small, and I usually sleep on my side. I was merely suggesting that we stay close as we sleep so I don't accidentally...smother you.\" You glup. Gardevoire crushing you was a real possibility. \"But if you want to sleep alone, there's a bit of room behind me. But I can't garuntee your safety, master, because I tend to roll around in my sleep...\"</span></div></div>",

As Gardevoire layed down and closed her eyes, you carefully walked around her massive frame, and found a wide crevice due to the arch in her back seprating part of the floor from the very small tent walls. \"This'll do.\" you say to nobody as you begin to lie down, a bit angry that you completely forgot to pack a blanket.

You would live out here if it wasn't for school. You also happened to own a couple Pokemon, I wouldn't say owned, more like acquainted by Pokemon since they are technically wild.<br>\r\nA small stream flowed nearby giving water to the native fauna, its also the place you met alice, your trustful gardevoir. Her previous owner had abused her in indescribable ways, and she escaped from her living hell on that fateful day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways its the second week into the school holidays and your parents are out of town for the weekend, so nothing better than to have a camping trip with Alice.</span></div></div>",

She backs up a little, before sitting down, legs to her side. This gives you a more clear view of her now enormous-to-you form. You look around, marveling at how each tiny part of your environment has grown. You find yourself unable to tear your eyes away from <i>her</i>, however, and you stare at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, huh? Nice, right?\" Gardevoir says, expectant. You prepare to marvel at how enormous she is, but she continues, having forgotten something. <br>\r\n\"Oh, wait, I almost forgot the most important part!\" She says, before slipping into the tent. For a moment, you worry, having been left outside in the harsh wilderness at a size where the grass towers many times over your height.  However, you're pulled in by Gardevoir's swift fingers from within the tent moments later. She dangles you over her chest, and you look over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's wearing...purple panties and purple striped socks? Other than that, you don't see anything different aside from the fact that she's still HUGE. She giggles at your confused expression, and blows a kiss at you. You finally speak. <br>\r\n\"What? I don't understand anything that just happened! Everything is huge, and you put on...panties and socks? Where did you even get those? What's going on?\" <br>\r\n\"Heehee. Slow down, I'll answer your questions! I shrunk you, real small. You're about a sixteenth of an inch, so I can pinch you between my fingers! This way, we can play and there's still room in the tent! I wanted to shrink you a little less or a little more, but I'm a little imprecise at the moment, so you wound up this size. That's fine, right?\" <br>\r\nYou blubber for a moment, before eventually regaining composure as she gently lowers you over her stomach area. She looks down at you. Eventually you muster out a \"yes\", and she continues.<br>\r\n\"Awesome! As for the socks and undies...I think they make me look sexy! And it'll make playing more fun!\" <br>\r\nYou take another moment to process, before asking what she means by \"play\" and \"sexy\".<br>\r\n\"You get a kick outta this kind of stuff, right? Feeling so tiny, being so tiny in front a big ol' lady pokemon like myself? I just thought I'd indulge you and that we could have some fun tonight while you're so miniature!\" <br>\r\n\"That sounds...great, actually!\" You say, eager. You were a little worried at first, but knowing that she just wants to play makes you feel much safer. Plus, you actually did have a fetish for this sort of stuff. What could be the harm in participating?<br>\r\n\"Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" She cheers, holding you higher, giving you a view of her huge, landscape-like face below. \"So where do you want to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look Gardevoir over again from your position held above her. The purple knee-highs and obviously quite tight panties really complemented Gardevoir's white and green. You quickly answer...</span></div></div>",

The purple socks hugged her legs quite tightly, and she let you down on the ground a good foot from her panties. You looked at them a little, but you were enraptured by the sight of the rising socks, the tightly woven threads rising high above. She teased you with it briefly, stripping one off her left leg and holding it above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor little guy! Will you be able to escape from my big, fluffy sock?\"<br>\r\nThe foot portion of the empty sock was slowly lowered on top of you, and you get held down by the slowly increasing weight of fabric as she lowers the rest on top of you. A gentle pat onto the small pile of sock follows, and you feel yourself get pressed into the ground underneath this soft weight. Gardevoir's fragrance had already stuck onto the casual hosiery, creating a balmy, sweet-tasting world underneath the fabric. Both of you laugh, her at how cute it is, and you at how unexpectedly wonderful being under a lady's sock at such a small size feels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn adventure on such a tiny scale takes place in the sock, as you wiggle forward, crawling through the small pile. After a while, it comes to your attention that you're inside the sock now, as you come to a dead end. \"Oh no -\" You say with merry sarcasm, \"Whatever shall I do?\"<br>\r\nGardevoir pinches the toe portion of the sock closed, holding you up to her face. She studies the sock carefully, trying to see through the tight, small gaps in the perfect fabric. Eventually, she notices your movements from within against the sides, and squeals like a schoolgirl. \"Oh, looks like I've already got you! Hee hee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world shifts around you, and you feel the sock be uncrumpled. Straightened out, she holds it, and moves it slowly in preparation for what she has planned. You try to look through the fabric, and almost succeed, but the view outside is shifting much too quickly for you to make anything out. You feel the sock be tipped upside down, and feel something quite akin to a breeze blow inside for the briefest moment, before the wonderful smell inside the sock becomes much, much more intense. The view outside stops, and you realize what Gardevoir plans to do next with the sock. She also starts to tell you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, are you ready, little one?\" Humming, you feel the same breeze again, and the scent intensifies again. You look towards the sock's entrance, clambering towards it. Gardevoir continues. \"Because...I'm going to play a little naughty!\" This you had confirmed, and were working your way towards the entrance. You were excited. The floor of the sock shook gently, tossing you onto off your feet. You began to slide as Gardevoir tilted the sock. You reserved yourself to what Gardevoir had planned, and sighed happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to...\"</span></div></div>",

It was a very serious term, meant to indicate an outrageously small size...and you were living it. Staring upwards in pure awe, you could see the roof of the tent, seemingly thousands of miles away...and much closer, two gigantic, white orbs that could only be classified as \"planet sized\" blocked most of your view of the tent. The gigantic breasts, parted only by the titanic red crest below you, utterly surrounded you, reminding you just how puny you were. Turning around, you gaze upwards towards your beloved Pokemon, her face grinning down at you as you stare at her in awe. A single eye, alone, seemed large enough to be a country on its own, and that's not taking the rest of her head into equation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Master? Do you want to...play some...or just sleep?\" she said, clearly emphasizing the 'play' part, like she wanted and expected you to pick it. You were a little shaken by this whole thing, however, and couldn't bring yourself to play with her...how could you play with her at this size, anyway? What did she have in mind? \"Ah...n-no thanks, Gardevoir. I'm really tired, I need to get some sleep, you understand...\". Above, she lets out an audible huff of dissapointment, but accepts your decision anyway. \"Alright, master... we'll play tomorrow. Goodnight.\" she said, her colossal head laying back onto the gigantic pillow meant for you as she closes your eyes...and shortly begins snoring! She was a quick sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the landscape you were on, you were, infact, on the chest of your very own Gardevoir. The soft surface that was her skin stretched on for MILES. And you were supposed to sleep in here? At least you were warm, as your Gardevoir seemed to radiate a large amount of body heat. Sighing, you realize you were going to have to accept being microscopically small for now. You'll tell her to fix you in the morning. Laying down on the smooth surface of the embrace Pokemon, you finally doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and are awoken by a titanic yawn that seemed to come from the heavens above, waking you up with a start. Searching around for the source of the noise as you wonder just where the hell you were, you look up, and stifle a scream. You remember what happened last night, now. Your giant Gardevoir goddess has just woken up, and is stretching and yawning, which causes the surface you're standing on to slant. The massive white orbs above you begin to move around and jiggle as she finally stops yawning, and looks around. \"Master?\" she asks, confused, and your heart sank. What if...she forgot about you? She could've forgotten about her little magic trick last night, and then you'd be...well, in a bit of trouble. But if she can read minds, maybe she can sense yours and will realize what has happened! Looking up at her as you gradually begin to lose your footing, you watch as she...</span></div></div>",

It was really nice of Gardevoir to be allowing you to experience your kink, even thought it was a strange one. Most people would probably just laugh you off if you told them \"I love to be shrunken around women\", so the fact that your Gardevoir was not only receptive of your fetish, and not only shrunk you down without you even asking her, but wanted to help you get the most enjoyment possible out of it, even if she didn't get any, brought a tear to your eye. A single, sub-microscopic tear that only you two knew about (thanks to her psychic abilities that you kept forgetting about). She may be the most gracious person you've ever met, and you wanted to repay her for her kindness, someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the world began to turn again and you found yourself looking back at your Gardevoir's face. \"You alright, master?\" she asked, bringing you out of your thoughts and reminding you why you were thinking so hard in the first place: because she wanted to help you fulfill your shrinking fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I was just-\" you stuttered, before being cut off by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I know already,\" Gardevoir began with a smile, \"you're glad that you can finally reenact your fantasies with someone who's willing, as opposed to keeping all those feelings and urges inside yourself and obsessing over things you <i>thought</i> were impossible!\" You were once again reminded of the fact that telepathy comes standard with psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir's smile was replaced with a frown as she continued, \"and I also know that you've been feeling sexually... repressed because you thought that all those fantasies you had were always going to be just that: fantasies.\" She then perked back up before saying \"So that's why I want you to enjoy this as much as you possibly can!\" You were once <i>again</i> reminded of the fact that telepathy comes standard with psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had acknowledged it, you do realize you've been kind of stuck in a rut lately... but now wasn't the time to dwell on that. You'd already been dwelling for, like, an entire paragraph. She was willing and ready, and you were willing and ready.

And don't worry, master, I'm completely fine with this!\" Gardevoir respectively confirmed and reassured you. \"But let's get these off first, shall we?\" she continued, as she moved her hand-paw things to the shoulders of her dress, and pulled it off over her head, before discarding it off to the side of the tent. Now Gardevoir was left in only her underwear, a lacy green bra and also-lacy white panties respectively matching the colors of her dress and skin. She then bent over to remove the latter garment, deliberately positioning her planetary breasts and accompanying red crest-thing directly above your still-floating body, and pulled the panties down her legs seemingly as slowly as possible, while stifling a giggle. At this point, Gardevoir's playful demeanor towards helping you fulfill your fantasies had left you wondering if she had similar fantasies of her own, as she seemed to be very meticulous about her actions, as if she was reenacting something she had thought about in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question was only somewhat answered when Gardevoir finally started standing up straight again, and cast a wink at you. She then gently placed the panties atop her dress, before finally speaking again. \"Alright, let's get a little bit more comfortable,\" she stated, as she shifted from standing up and towering above you, to sitting down, and then to laying face-up, outstretched in the tent and taking up most of the real estate on the floor. \"You ready, master?\" Gardevoir said seductively, to which you enthusiastically nodded, before being lowered down onto her belly, seemingly miles due south from her belly button. Looking towards her upper body, all you could see were the endless plains of Gardevoir's white, slim belly, only interrupted by two lacy green planets and a red tower reaching towards space. In the opposite direction were two legs longer than the distance between your home and the edge of the Milky Way, but that wasn't what you were looking for. You couldn't even <i>see</i> what you were looking for from your current position, so you turned and jogged towards the massive legs, knowing that your goal was directly in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 5 minutes to get from your starting position to a place where you could even see your goal, but your efforts did not go unrewarded. Eventually you were able to see a giant pink orb on the horizon - Gardevoir's clit. You were hoping to give Gardevoir some pleasure here to repay her for letting you do this with her, so you slid down the decline from the end of her belly down to the fleshy knob. It seemed even larger up close than it did before! If her breasts were the size of planets, her clit was probably about the size of a small asteroid! You weren't sure if she'd even be able to <i>feel</i> you, but that wasn't going to stop you from trying anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you tried was getting down on your hands and knees and rubbing the fleshy ground, as if you were trying to massage it. However, with no reactions after 2 minutes of vigorous rubbing, you decided to try something else. Climbing up the incline towards Gardevoir's belly button, you then turned around and jumped towards her clit, hoping that would stimulate something. Upon landing on the ground, it was clear that that also didn't have an effect, so you resort to scratching it with your fingernails. A few minutes of scratching <i>still</i> hadn't managed to provoke a reaction, so you then lay down on the fleshy orb and sink your teeth into it. You had expected this to at least elicit a giggle, as if you had tickled her, but her clit remained unimpressed. From your perch, you decided to ask her for confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you feel any of that, Gardevoir?\" you shouted up from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want an honest answer, master?\" you heard her say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's a no then, huh,\" you sarcastically muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have an idea of what you're doing down there, but I can't actually <i>feel</i> any of it,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, despite the disappointment from not being able to pay her back for being so kind, you were still excited. Normal-sized people would just be able to pinch this fleshy knob in between a finger and thumb to elicit a bunch of pleasure from Gardevoir, but you were so small that despite putting your entire body into trying to please this, her most sensitive area, you weren't even causing any reactions in her. Even though it was disappointing, it was also exhilarating, as it put it into perspective just how insignificant your stature was compared to the monolithic girl whose body was currently your playground. It was at this point that you noticed Gardevoir's right hand was currently resting on her inner thigh. She was probably getting aroused from having her privates exposed to the open air, but if your theory was right, she could also possibly be getting turned on by the thought of you and how small you were. At that moment, you suddenly had a brilliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Gardevoir... are you getting a little... aroused?\" you asked her. It wasn't really a rude question considering where you were, and the context of the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah...\" Gardevoir replied, seemingly embarrassed about being called on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you just masturbate then?\" you proposed. You couldn't see from your vantage point, but her pure white face was starting to turn pink instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-because you're still down there! What if I hurt you, or worse?\" She was concerned, but you knew she could and would keep you safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you, and you deserve it. If I can't pleasure you, the least you can do is do it yourself.\" At this point you were sure she had read your mind and knew where you were heading with this train of thought, but you didn't really care and continued anyway. \"I think it'd be more enjoyable for the both of us if you did this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what's the catch?\" Gardevoir was smart, or psychic, but either way you knew things were about to get exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want you to masturbate...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ooooh... you're full of ideas, aren't you, master?\" Gardevoir quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when your fetish is something you don't think can ever happen, you have time to form all sorts of scenarios,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get 'warmed up',\" she stated. From your position on her clit, you were able to see Gardevoir's right hand move from her inner thigh over towards your fleshy platform, before squeezing the lower half of it between her thumb and finger. This sent pleasured quakes throughout her body, although she continued pinching her clit, holding it in place and keeping you on it (not that it was very easy for you to fall off, considering how large her clit was compared to you). While Gardevoir continued to squeeze the sensitive knob, you were attempting to reach the edge of it and get a view of your new goal; the entrance to the dark, fleshy chasm that she called her vagina. Behind you, Gardevoir was letting out deafening moans of satisfaction from her handiwork. The fingers that were around you then stopped compressing her clit, and moved back towards her upper body, presumably to work on her nipples. You, in the meantime, could finally see the pink lips that formed her outer rim, drops of feminine fluids dripping off of the shiny surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I go in now, or...?\" you began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to get my insides a little wet for you, so it's easier to get to the end quickly, master,\" Gardevoir replied, before letting out a few staggered breaths and moans. \"I-I think now may be a g-g-good time,\" she continued. With arousal running high, you clambered down Gardevoir's clit, before letting go and falling directly towards the narrow slit that was her entrance. Well, narrow to others. With how small you were, it was an easy target. As she continued with her nipple, you vanished into the cavernous vagina of your Gardevoir, landing with a significant bounce off of the squishy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her womanhood, it was hard to see much. There was a thin sliver of light coming through the entrance-slash-exit, allowing you to parse some details of your surroundings, such as the pink walls which expanded and contracted with every breath, and suddenly squeezed whenever Gardevoir felt significantly pleased by her playing. You could also see the moisture she was building up, shown by pools and strands of her love juices dotting all corners of the cavern. Suddenly, Gardevoir began to tilt her lower body up, angling her vagina in such a way that it was no longer horizontal, but now diagonal. Now you understood why she was trying to get wet first: so that you could slide down her fleshy interior instead of having to walk across it. With that in mind, you broke into a jog before throwing yourself onto your belly, riding Gardevoir's wetness into her very depths and only stopping when you rammed into her cervix. Her legs lowered back down to the floor upon learning that you had reached your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir was trying to keep things slow for her master, so that she didn't climax before he reached the end of her vagina, but now that he was there, she was ready to begin the real masturbation. Using her psychic powers, she toyed around with both of her erect nipples while her left hand went down between her legs to resume pinching and squeezing her clit. Gardevoir's right hand also returned to the same area, rubbing along the entrance of her vagina and periodically blocking the little amounts of light that managed to enter her passionate pit. She was ready for the main event, but just wanted to make sure her master was too. She was so aroused that she could barely even speak telepathically, stuttering out a psychic \"r-r-r-ready?\" to you. Turning towards the sole source of light inside her cavernous crotch, you simply thought back \"yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a burst of light came from the entrance of Gardevoir's vagina, before being blotted out by her massive hand, rushing towards her cervix and you. It stopped what appeared to be miles away, before turning tail and dashing back towards the cracks of light that had made it around her hand. You heard a series of desperate moans and whines coming from outside Gardevoir's vagina; it seemed she was overloaded on lust and just wanted to reach her climax and embrace its sweet release. You didn't really mind, as it made things more exciting for you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir was still toying with her clit, but had long since lost the focus required to continue the psychic play with her nipples, having to settle for working with just her hands. Her free left hand was squeezing the fleshy orb like a zit she wanted to get rid of, while also cycling between her nipples periodically. Her right hand was still barreling deep into and out of her vagina, and the moisture inside her cavern was intense, beginning to pool in waist-deep lakes of lady cum. Her entire body was quaking at her touches, with her vaginal walls contracting around her right arm every few seconds. The contractions didn't hurt you, however, as you were so small that at your scale, there was still plenty of room inside Gardevoir's cavern even when it had contracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard an earth-shattering moan from Gardevoir, followed by the sound of liquid rushing behind you. She had finally reached her climax, and now you had been picked up in a tidal wave of her love juices, barreling straight towards her retreating hand and the entrance of her vagina. Light flooded the expanded cavern as her hand was pulled free, and you, along with all of Gardevoir's lady cum, flew through the open hole and out onto the floor of the tent, landing in between her splayed legs. Treading on top of the fluid, you turned to look back at her, and the cave you had just been inside of. Copious amounts of her juices were still flowing from the gaping hole, traveling down her body and forming another pool near her butt. Gardevoir's pleasured quivers rocked the world around you, and with nothing better to do, you swam around a bit in the love juice as you waited for her body and mind to come down from her pleasure high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 5 minutes later, you noticed Gardevoir finally starting to stir from her pleasure-addled state, sitting up and looking at the puddle-slash-lake of lady cum you were treading. Now that you were back in the outside world, she was back to speaking with her mouth, as was confirmed when she asked you, \"well, how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than I ever could've imagined, and I speak from experience\", you quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad I could finally help you live out one of your fantasies, master,\" she replied. You noticed that she had said \"<i>one of</i>\" in that sentence, and wondered how many exactly she was aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a few, master,\" she replied. You were once again reminded of the fact that telepathy comes standard with psychic powers. \"So, do you wanna relive one of your other fantasies, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Gardevoir, how about...\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, you were telekinetically lifted out of the blob of love juice and positioned in front of her face. Her hands rose into view and they, as well as you, began to glow blue once more, the same as last night. Gardevoir appeared to be getting smaller, although it was actually the other way around. Looking for a point of reference as to your current size, you turned towards her planetary breasts. They began to seem more minuscule, shortly being comparable to just mountains, and then hills. Suddenly, you felt your butt impact on the bottom of the tent. Averting your gaze, you noticed you were once more seeing eye-to-eye with your lovely Gardevoir. You looked down and saw between you and her, the lady cum that you were sitting in just a minute ago. It was amazing that what seemed like a lake to you just moments prior was now just a tiny blob on the bottom of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up, and decided that you were taking a shower once you got home. As sexy as living out your kink was, it also left you drenched in the products of Gardevoir's lust. Speaking of, she had re-affixed her panties and dress once more, leaving her back in her usual state. \"Let's get back home, then, shall we?\" she chirped, with you merely nodding in reply. After making sure everything else had been take out, you and Gardevoir left the tent, which she then quickly upended and rolled back into a convenient burrito shape, before levitating it into the backpack, which was also levitated onto your back. With that, you two walked in mostly silence and took in the sounds of nature around you, knowing it was back to civilization in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching your neighborhood, you quickly unlocked your door and let yourself and Gardevoir in. The air was a little warm from nobody being around to open windows or such, so you propped one open. Your neighborhood had always been extremely chill, so you weren't expecting anything to happen, and even if something <i>did</i>, your neighborhood was also extremely tight-knit and would no doubt help you. Gardevoir had gone upstairs to your bedroom, so you guessed she wasn't looking to continue helping you explore your kink at this exact moment. You accepted the peaceful quiet and made yourself a lunch to eat while you contemplated what else you could do today.</span></div></div>",

Holding yourself to what you had promised earlier,  you quickly polished off a sandwich and some chips, rinsing the plate off and leaving it in the sink. Strolling into the laundry room, you pilfered some clean clothes from there, not wanting to disturb... whatever it was Gardevoir was doing right now. Entering the spacious first floor bathroom, you placed the spare clothes on the sink countertop and disrobed, leaving the stained garments off to the side of the room. After climbing into the tub, you closed the curtains and grabbed the handle for the tub's water, easing it into a position where it was spraying slightly cold water. Not freezing to the bone, but not warming your heart either, just cool enough to satisfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than washing up, however, your mind began to drift and you found yourself standing in the running water, thinking of what sexual activities you and Gardevoir could engage in next. Seeing as she knew about \"quite a few\" of the fantasies you had contemplated, was open and willing to try all of them, and could shrink you to any size at any time, that opened the door to endless possibilities. Maybe you could shrink to a size bigger than you were last time, like an inch, and do the manual work of stimulating Gardevoir yourself, or perhaps get a low-to-the-ground view of her privates as she towers above you, or hitch a ride inside of her panties as she went about her day, or perhaps just sleep inside of her panties instead, and that's not even getting into other things that you could do with toys, other objects...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you saw the bathroom door opening. There was only one other person in the house, and her identity was confirmed once you saw her statuesque silhouette through the curtain. A blush crept along your face as she inched closer to the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, master!\" Gardevoir was back to her usual friendly peppiness, although you expected this would change soon. \"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Now that you finally had it in your head that she was telepathic, you fully knew she had been perusing your brain, and was likely looking to help you with your kink once more. \"So then, did <i>you</i> have anything in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm...\" Gardevoir only made this noise as a blue aura appeared on the other side of the curtain. Once more you felt the world growing around you, as you floated in the air above the tub's floor. Stopping at an inch tall, you could only look at the curtain, feeling yourself getting harder as Gardevoir stepped around it and into the tub, leaving you transfixed by her glorious nude body; her nicely-sized waist, her slim, curvaceous belly, her firm, supple, but not too large breasts, and, peering down at you, an amused smirk from her cute face. \"Really eating the eye candy, I see!\" Your blush only deepened at this assessment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you asked if I had anything in mind? Well, I'm willing to enact anything I've seen in your mind, so if you have it in mind, I do! Now then, I've seen you having some thoughts about using this during one of our sexual encounters, so why don't we ease into this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gardevoir said this, you could see her using her telekinetic powers to bring into the shower...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gardevoir had retrieved a fresh bar of soap from across the bathroom, leaving its box on the countertop. She let it rest in her hand and gave the still-floating you a smirk, before using her telekinesis on something else. Before long, a pair of goggles came into the tub as well, followed by a container of... floss? 'Oh, so she wants to do <i>that</i>...' you mused, looking at the goggles floating near you. As expected, her hands and the goggles started radiating blue, and the eyewear was reduced to a size more appropriate for someone of your stature to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may want to put these on, master,\" Gardevoir informed you, her tone shifting from peppiness to playfulness. You listened and donned the protective gear, watching Gardevoir unravel the floss as you did. \"Now then, are you ready?\" she inquired. You nodded in response, figuring she could see you fine at your current size. The soap that was resting in her hand suddenly began to move closer to you, until Gardevoir released her psychic hold on you and you fell onto the curved side of the bar. Anticipating what was up next, you laid down face-up on the soap bar and waited. Just a moment later, you saw the floss come into view, coming into contact with you. The stringy material was pulled straight and down around the soap bar, being tied into a neat knot on the other side from you and locking you in place on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, hmm hmmmm hmmmm...\" Gardevoir hummed, as she brought the soap bar (and its passenger) up to her belly and began to rub the side with you on it along her slim stomach. Gardevoir's skin was slick from the water, allowing the soap to delicately glide across her body. She lathered up her belly profusely before moving the soap to her back and repeating the process, additionally washing the red thing protruding from her back. Having had enough teasing, Gardevoir lowered the soap, and you, down to her slim and shapely, but definitely present and pleasant rear, deliberately moving the soap very slowly along her right buttcheek to allow you to savor the experience. You repaid her by giving her butt a few squeezes; nothing too risque, just teasing her as she did you. You could hear Gardevoir gently moaning as you did so, evidently deriving some pleasure from the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving decided her rear was clean enough, you and the soap were relocated to Gardevoir's breasts. Once more, she drew out the washing process, allowing you to get a good look at her pink nipples as they slowly expanded. Of course, you were active during this too, rubbing along the white walls that were Gardevoir's breasts, and, given the opportunity, her nipples themselves. Your actions occasionally gave the showering giantess pause, but she continued regardless, occasionally letting out a staggered breath. You simply smiled at this, glad that you could at least give her some pleasure to pay her back for helping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her torso cleaned off, Gardevoir moved the soap down to her legs, giving you an excellent vantage point of her lower lips. You simply stayed put and enjoyed the ride, and the view as well, as she cleaned herself up. This persisted for a few minutes, until Gardevoir suddenly pulled you out of your trance by calling \"hey, master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Gardevoir?\" You saw her face was upside down and looking at you between her legs. Evidently, she had bent over to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to... take this further?\" Gardevoir punctuated this with a wink and a smirk.</span></div></div>",

The ball of electricity blasts it right out of the sky, as your Jolteon lands right next to the destroyed stuffing and cloth of the once intact doll. \"Ay, great job.\" You cheer, as you toss another one in the air. The cool noon air blowing past you both as you continue to train in the grassy field near your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew. Hey, why not we take a small lunch break for the time being.\" You call out to Jolteon. You sit down on the ground and grab some water and sandwiches from your backpack, as you hear her run to you. You put down the food next to you when you feel Jolteon pounce onto your chest, pinning you to the ground, as she cries out happily. \"Haha, not too rough there, girl.\" You laugh, lifting her off onto your lap. You hand her a sandwich, as she takes a sizeable bite into it. You take your own sandwich and bite into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it kind of funny how you two met. Your father was given her by a breeder when she was just an Eevee. The reason why they gave her away was because she didn't really get along with any of the trainers or Pokemon there. No surprise, the Eevee never listened to your father once, even when he thought evolving her with a thunder stone would help. What was a surprise was how well you and her bonded when you were gifted her. It was almost like you two were soul mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying in the field, you finish up your sandwich. Looking down at your lap, you see Jolteon curled up, taking a nap. You lightly pet her, running your hand across her back. You feel tiny static sparks on your fingers as you stroke her. Your mind begins to wander, thinking on how great it would be to lay in that forest of yellow fur, that you don't notice the pink colored static that washed over your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get a sudden wave of tiredness, as you lay your head down on the grass. \"Maybe I sh- *yawn* -ould get inside first.\" You groggily say, before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you sit straight up, hoping that not too much time has passed. You look up to see that the sun is directly in the centre of the sky, so it was probably still noon. That's when you notice that the grass seemed bigger, and where was Jolteon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question is solved immediately when the sun is blocked out by a familiar yellow face leaning over you, smiling. You stand up to see that she is much bigger than you are. If you had to guess, you are about 6 inches high. You would be afraid right now, but seeing your own Pokemon tower over you, you feel quite flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Aww, you're so cute. Looks like the rumor I heard is true.</span>\" Wait, did Jolteon just talk!? This is getting crazier by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk?\" You shout in surprise, \"What rumor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">You heard what I said!?</span>\" She looks as shocked (heh) as you do. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Well, I'm guessing that's a side effect. The rumor I'm talking about is that if a Pokemon and a human have a connection and wish for the same thing, it'll come true.</span>\" She explains. So wait, that must mean that she wished for you to be small as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm guessing you know about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Yup.</span>\" She leans her head down to your level, with a playful look on her face. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">So, what'cha wanna do with your new size?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It started off a normal day, like most other days in your life. You were currently making your breakfast, a simple bowl of cereal that you were pouring into a bowl to have for yourself. As you were pouring the milk you heard some footsteps coming into the kitchen. Well...Pawsteps would be more accurate, since it was your Umbreon, named Moon, that strolled right into the Kitchen, smiling at you brightly. <br>\r\n\"Morning~!\" She beamed to you happily, seeming to have a lot of energy this morning. Which was strange, normally she slept in since she was more of a night Pokemon. However, today she was up earlier than you expected!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Eeveelution made her way towards the table you were eating your cereal. With one gracefully motion she bent down and jumped right up onto the table, landing in front of you, with another joyful grin. You outstretched your hand, giving her a few pets on her head and a few pets on her ears, feeling her soft, jet black fur as your rubbed your hand on her. She responded with a purr, nuzzling into your hand that you petted with. \"Morning to you as well Moon. You seem quite eager today. Is something happening?\" You commented to your Umbreon, trying to figure out what was making her so happy today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeeeeelllllllll...\" Your Umbreon began, sounding quite eager and excited to tell you whatever she had going on. She took a few steps closer to you, being sure to be mindful of your bowl of  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's this new trick I've been working on lately! I think I am finally ready to try it out on you!\" Moon told you, her tail wagging as she told what was making her so happy this morning. The whole 'trick' thing she mentioned did make you intrigued, yet a little nervous. Moon was known for being really playfully with you, as well as doing lots of pranks on you. Of course, they were all harmless pranks of her own creation. Most ranged from her hiding in spots to pounce on you, hiding one of your shirts or socks in silly places, or splashing some water in your face while you washed your hands or brushed your teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trick? What is this 'trick' exactly? And why is this planned for me?\" You questioned Moon, trying to uncover what exactly your playful Umbreon had planned for you. Who knows what it could even be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've been working on it for a few weeks now, late at night while you were asleep.\" She spoke with an innocent smile on her face. Well that explains why she has been sleeping in lately, waking up later in the day. Still you had no clue what it even was whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is it exactly that you're going to show off?\" You ask again, but with a reworded question, trying at least get out some more information from Moon herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how I can use Psychic?\" She asked you, looking at your face, a smirk started to creep onto her face. That smirk looked like one of her 'about to pull of a prank' smirks. It did make you slightly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? What about it?\" You ask with slight hesitation, you're basically going in to this situation blind. You hoped whatever she had in mind was just something simple, and not crazy or outlandish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I managed to improve and enhance it, I think I am able to do much more with it now! Or at least with those berries and apples I tested on last light and a few days.<br>\r\n But now I am confident it will work on you!!\" She eager got up against you, nuzzling you neck. You were not sure whether to be relived or scared. Sure,  she did seem to take precautions in making sure she was confident, but also you still had very little idea what was going to happen. However, you trusted Moon a lot, and you know she wouldn't intentionally put you through any harm. You finished up your bowl of cereal and took a deep breath before looking at Moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Whatever it is, I'm sure it will be great!\" You say to encourage her as you place your empty bowl and spoon in your sink before walking over to your living room couch. The Eeveelution was right behind you every step of the way. You sat down in the middle of it, and a few seconds later Moon joined you, jumping up beside you, looking pretty pumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! All you need to do is just relax and I'll do the rest! Here goes nothing! \" Your Umbreon tells you and gives you a wink before her eyes began glowing. Of course, she was using her move, Psychic, and supposed an enhanced version of it. You gave off a small shudder as the Psychic gently surrounded you in a red-ish aura glow. You take a few breaths to relax yourself, like she had suggested. For a few seconds, nothing seems to happen. You were about to ask Moon something when you noticed something. Your clothing felt...Baggy. And the couch you were sitting on seemed...Larger. Moon also seemed bigger to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Moon. What..What is happening?\" You ask out of bewilderment, trying to process what was happening to you as you began shrinking. You never expected Moon to have learnt this sort of ability,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on silly.\" She teased you sticking a tongue at you as she managed to keep her focus and keep making you smaller. \"You're shrinking of course, what else would it be? I've heard you talk in your sleep a few times mentioning it how much you like the idea of being shrunken down~\" She responded to you, playfully swatting at your loose clothing now. You couldn't help but blush at her words, since she totally had a point. Being shrunken down totally was something you enjoyed the idea of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...H-How small are you planning to make me then Moon?\" You asked her, still blushing from your current situation you had somehow managed to find yourself in. You did wonder what size Moon had in mind to make you, and what she did have in mind with you after all this shrinking was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eager, and growing Umbreon was happily able to assist you with giving you an answer for your question though. \"Oh, don't worry~! I think I have the perfect size in mind for you! You're going to be sooooo cute and adorably tiny when you are done shrinking! I'm going to be making you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is a lovely summer day outside, and you are spending it with you Leafeon, just laying in your backyard on top of the grass. You feel your Leafeon, Clover, come up to you, giving you a loving nuzzle. In return you laugh softly, sitting up so you can pet her returning the affection. You and Clover have been together for many years now, having found her as an Eevee. Quickly you two bonded and became the best of friends. One day while you were on a small little adventure in a forest, you came upon a large mossy rock, which you believe was the reason that caused her to evolve into a Leafeon. Fast forward to now, she's still the same Clover you always knew. You two are living together in your own home and have been for about a year now. Clover the most of time spends time in the backyard or going on her own walks. Other times you two are together, whether it be just walking through the forest, or walking through the town. As for now, you're just relaxing, watching the day slowly pass by. Clover was fairly normal for a Leafeon, in both size and looks. However she had a lotus flower on her head, tied by the stem to remain snug up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what you basically do all day? Just lay around all day in the sun all day like a silly plant? Seems like a boring thing to do.\" You ask your eeveelution with a small chuckle, while petting her a few more times. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well yea of course~! Why wouldn't I? I am a grass type after all, I am more or less a plant! I need that photosynthesis you know. It gives me all that energy to do things with you!</span>\"  Clover replies to you with a returning chuckle before suddenly getting up with a rather eager and excited look in her eye. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Oh that reminds me! I found something earlier today! I thought you would like it! Let me go and get it!</span>\" She responds excitedly, and before you could even ask her anything about what it was or...Anything really, she had ran off to get whatever she had. \"Hey Clover! What are you-\" You call to her trying to get her attention, but she had already had went inside and was too far away to hear you call out to her. You just decided to wait for her to come back, sitting on a chair you had in the backyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover usually brought you back little gifts whenever she went out for walks. Most of the times they were simple things like berries, fruits, and simple flowers. One time she had even brought back a four leaf clover for you. It was always nice to receive them, and you found it almost cute that she brought them back to you. About a minute later, you heard your back door open, followed by Clover's pawsteps. As she approached you, you could see she was holding some kind of flower in her mouth. <br>\r\n\"Clover? What is it you have there?\" You ask her as she sits down, right in front of you, setting down the flower between you and her. Her leafy tail was swishing from side to side as she looked up at you with a big smile plastered on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Oh I think you'll really, really like it! Master!</span> \" She says to you as you picked up the flower she had supposedly found. It looked really strange, having many petals, and had a bunch of bright, colourful petals. You had never seen a flower like it before, nor did it even look real. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">I just need you to do one little thing though with it though...</span>\" Clover spoke again to you. Looking up from the flower, you look at her. \"What...do I need to do?\" You ask, trying to still make sense of all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Eat one of the petals.</span>\" A smirk was on her face as she said that. Clover was usually a calm, and sweet Pokemon. It was rare to see her be more mischievous like this <br>\r\n\"What?\" You respond to her, still confused while processing her odd request. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Come onnnnnnn Master. Just do it. Pleeeeeeeeeease?</span>\" She looked up you with a cute face while extending those words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing the flower up to look at once again, you wondered what it would even do. Would it do something bad you? No. Of course not, Clover was too kind to do something like that. You were partners, she would never do something to purposely hurt you at all. You trusted her. There was few seconds of hesitation, but you plucked one of the petals off the flower. You open up your mouth and plop the petal into it, swallowing a few seconds later. The taste, was hard to describe, since you've never eaten a flower before. Best way to describe it would be like a lettuce taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Excellent! Im surprised you actually did it! We're gonna have so much fun Master! Teehee~!</span>\" She giggled as you stood up while she nuzzled against your legs. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Just give it a few moments~</span>\" With that comment, you were to ask her what was going on, but suddenly the world answered that question for you. A tingling sensation quivers throughout your body for a second. After that you could swear that your clothes were starting to become more loose..? And Clover was getting bigger too..As well as the whole world around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait...\" You say as your gaze turns to look down at your 'growing' partner. \"Am I..\" You start to ask but Clover finishes your sentence for you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Shrinking you? Yup! You got it! You left your phone on last week while you were showering. I looked at it and saw that you were into been shrunken down! Being tiny with Pokemon towering over you!</span>\" She giggled at you as you continued getting smaller and smaller. By now you were having trouble trying to escape your growing clothing. <br>\r\n\"C-Clover! Th-That's sensitive stuff! Y-You can't just be s-snooping around on other people's stuff!\" You tell her, with a blush on your face, a small huff escaping your mouth. That was definitely the last time you were leaving your phone out and turned on while showering. This whole time Clover was just watching you with an amused smirk on her face, her tail flicking whimsically behind her. \"H-How small is that flower going to make me~?\" You ask her, as your shrinking continued, you had managed to climb out of your clothing, leaving you butt naked. You hold up your loose pair of underwear to cover yourself and your private area, while you blushed from being both naked and tiny in front of your Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hehe~ Look at how cute you are at that size Master. As for how small you are going to be...I think I'll leave that as surprise. Don't you like surprises~? I know you'll love it though! At least according to those images on your phone!</span>\" Your Leafeon tells you as you pass the 1 foot mark, by now you were smaller than an Eevee, and it seemed that you were still shrinking more and more. Clover was totally right too. You were enjoying this, a lot, and you couldn't deny that at all. Watching her and the entire world around you get more and more massive. Who knows when you would stop shrinking? Only Clover knew that answer, and now she was bigger one out of you two, and she was only going to get bigger. You drop your underwear that you were holding up and slowly made your way closer to your eager Leafeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking effect kept on going as you got tinier and tinier. The magical flower Clover gave you continued shrinking you down until you were...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The shrinking still seemed to continue on, with no signs of it stopping anytime soon. The world around you now was absolutely massive. Your once small backyard, was now stretching out quite a ways in all directions. Who knows how long it would take you to even walk back to your house at this size. By now it was basically impossible to hold up any sort of clothing to cover. Even your underwear was getting too big and bulky to hold. You carefully began making your way forward, as you begun descending your 'mountain' of clothes. Luckily, the task wasn't that hard and soon you had found yourself standing on the ground Most of the blades of grass around were about your size, with some being even taller than you, and others a bit smaller. With having no way to effective conceal yourself, you just opted to using your hands to cover yourself. At least it was a warm day, you could feel the summer warmth against your body. Sure it did feel a bit weird being naked and all, but at least it was warm, and felt a little nice. You gaze up at Clover once again to see your massive size difference. She was smirking down at you, but you could tell that she was only doing it to tease you. Seeing her, and the entire world around you be utterly massive was truly something. Clover was simply making your dreams a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Still getting smaller, which just means that you're getting cuter and cuter~! There is so much fun we're going to have~! I'm glad I found that flower, but you're probably more glad right?</span>\" Clover commented with a giggle as she continued smirking down at your dwindling form. The 'fun' part had you a bit curious, and a tad bit nervous too. What would she even do? Whatever it may be, you trusted her though. She wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt or harm you. You wanted to say something but the mix of shrinking, living your fantasy, and Clover's teasing, just made you to flustered to respond. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">I was reading about flowers and heard of this special one that existed deep in the forest by here. One that has petals that cause shrinking. So of course I looked for it! It took me multiple trips of searching of searching, but I found it this morning!</span>\" She told you, while smiling innocently like nothing was wrong. At least now you knew how she managed to get her paws on it. She seemed quite dedicated to finding it. Just a few minutes ago, you were your normal size, just relaxing with your lovable Leafeon. This is the least likely thing that you expected to happening. Once again Clover spoke up to say something to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">My, you're quite small there, and so cute! I never knew shrinking you could be this fun~!</span>\" Clover said you teasing you once more, which just made you blush. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Here let me grab you, little cutie~.</span>\" She replied to you in a caring tone. A green vine suddenly came out from Clover's back and carefully made its way towards you. You watched as it floated closer before gently wrapping your waist. Feeling the vine wrapped around you touching against your, almost like a snake's coil was definitely odd. However, it also felt like a comforting hug at the same time. You rubbed the vine a few times as you were lifted off your feet as Clover brought the vine closer to her face. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">There! I won't lose you now! I wouldn't want to lose you in the grass! Though I am sure you wouldn't mind being very tiny. Don't worry Master you're safe with me~</span>\" She replies with a smile at you, while still managing to tease you while being caring. Clover was definitely being caring, keeping a close eye on you to ensure that you did not get lost while shrinking. Though speaking of your shrinking, you had not stopped shrinking the entire time at all. It was hard to tell how tall you were even were at this point. Clover was easily many times your size. You guessed you were under an inch by this point, judging how tall you were compared to the grass earlier and  how much much you've shrunk since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how small was Clover's 'gift' going to make you? The thought was just a bit scary, yet you were oddly excited and eager at the same.</span></div></div>",

You were left at at a height you estimated to be around a half of an inch, your new stature now comparable to the width of a person's thumbnail. Clover looked very satisfied with the work of the magical flower petal she gave you and she moved you closer to her face to get a better look at you. Her brown eyes alone were much larger than your body and you could only nervously smile at her as she happily took in your new size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the green vine you were hanging onto moved away from her face. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">I think that worked out pretty well, don't you think?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" you blurt out. \"I never knew a flower could do such a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover gave you a little laugh. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">As you can see, they can. There was a whole patch of them and I've even got a few cuttings growing in the backyard right now so we can do this whenever we want. It sounds almost too good to be true, huh, little guy?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nodding in agreement you suddenly feel the large green vine your grabbing onto move again. This time it started to tilt to a point where it was difficult to hold on and much to your shock, you started falling. Thankfully the fall was incredibly short and you soon found yourself in a little field of dark brown fur. After quickly re-orientating yourself, it was quickly apparent that she had dropped you on top of one of her paws. Clover admirably looked down at you, the gentle breath coming from her small brown nose warming your bare skin which reminded you that you were still naked. Crouching down, you sat in her fur which just managed to conceal your lower body. Although, using Clover's own body as cover probably defeated the point of trying to remain decent in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover noticed immediately and teased you. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">You should probably stop fretting about that, I doubt they make clothes in your size.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing it off, you admit she might have a point. Moving on, you ask your Leafeon what the two of you should do with your new shrunken state. Being before your huge lovable Pokemon at such a small size was already making your mind rush with the possibilities. \"So what are you planning to do now, Clover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her head higher and looked down at you in mock superiority. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">But I thought you were the master in this relationship~. Are you really going to let your own Pokemon choose your own fate, especially when your in such a vulnerable state?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious she was only seizing an opportunity to tease you again but it made you let out an embarrassed laugh nonetheless. Playing along with her, you replied. \"Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover delighted the answer. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Very well~,</span>\" she sang. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">In that case I'll be sure to take good care of you!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Leafeon lifted you up towards her face and affectionately pushed you against her cheek, brown and tan fur intermixing with each other while you were stuck in the middle. After a moment of cuddling, you were blessed with fresh air as Clover resumed looking down at you. From her expression it was clear that she was immensely enjoying this new interaction that her magical flower made possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">So what am I planning to do? That's a good question... There's a whole bunch of things we could do. We could play a little game, we could just laze around and enjoy this for a bit. Or....</span>\" Clover trailed off and adopted a sly grin. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">My, what a decision you've given me!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously sat on Clover's fluffy paw as she entertained her thoughts about what to do with you.

Though you were more focused on surviving the onslaught of slick fluids, you could make out your surroundings as they became brighter and brighter. You were helplessly pulled along what seemed like a raging river, when suddenly you feel a sharp dip and realize you're now in free fall. You emerge from below the surface, coughing up her juices, shocked by the twist of fate you've been dealt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glace!!\" You manage to choke out. Though it was hopeless. Your minuscule voice fell deaf on the titanic Pokemon's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked down you could see a large surface come into view. It wasn't the grass that you once tread so highly upon; nor was it the dirt ground that you still navigated when you were a much bigger (albeit still shrunken) plaything of your now gargantuan Pokemon. It was the same fleshy color as the rest of your Glaceon's pussy, though it was too impossibly large to grasp what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ocean of cum that you swam in came crashing into the surface, throwing you back into its torrent. The slick sticky surface tension of Glace's juices were kept into a small bead, with you tumbling inside. You quickly try to stabilize as the little drop subsides from its descent, and you make your way to the edge of the bubble-like drop. With effort, you managed to free yourself and spill out onto the landmass, heaving and choking for breath. You collapse, allowing yourself time to recuperate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes, you finally had the strength to sit up and do so. You take a moment to survey the landscape. Behind you want the drop of cum that carried you to where you are now, which appeared to be outside of Glace's womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where is this place...?\" You wonder out loud. The horizon was filled with blurry shapes and a bright light making it difficult to tell. You stand up and step backwards, trying to see where you came from. Like a distant galaxy, you could make out what appeared to be your Glaceon's vagina. It was enormous beyond imagination, much bigger than you had remembered when you first crawled into its warm, all-encompassing depths. Your surroundings were rounded and smooth, much smoother than Glace's vaginal lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization that you were on her clitoris hit you immediately. You had survived a journey within your adorable pokemon's love tunnel only to be deposited on one of her most sensitive places. To make matters worse, from your perspective her love bead was continental in size. The drop of cum which carried you to your destination must have only been a little speck to Glace. Smaller than a bead of sweat even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you had stability on top of your Pokemon's Celestial Clit, you were clueless as to how you would ever even get her attention at your microscopic level, let alone return to any recognizable size. You knew that any more contact with her vaginal fluid would only make your shrink even more, which was the last thing you wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at the complete mercy of Glace, and even the slightest movement from her could spell trouble. But perhaps she came prepared for this, or was in on this inexplicable extra shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing to do but wait for fate to decide if you are rescued by your Pokemon, you decide to wait it out. Glace wouldn't abandon you, anyway, would she? </span></div></div>",

Too tiny to be noticed, you'd likely starve to death before she ever found you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlace began to stir from a wonderful nap and satisfying wet dream. She had imagined that her little master was enjoying himself in her folds, squirming, swimming, and pleasuring himself to her gigantic form. She loved serving her master's needs, and loved it more when he served her's. Feeling a wet spot between her legs, she yawned and opened her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm...\" She lovingly sighed, \"My itty bitty master must have had all sorts of fun while I slept!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was careful not to sit up and possibly squish her trainer, and instead curled her body until she could see her rear end. But something was wrong. Glace fell asleep with the wonderful feeling of her master's body inside her. Now she no longer felt him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, oh maaaaster~\" She cooed lovingly, wondering where he was. \"Did you go so deep that I can't feel you anymore?\" She rubbed a paw right above her vagina, trying to feel around for the tiny human inside her, though to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? Are you here?\" She pondered. What could have happened. He certainly couldn't have left her, he was so happy being so intimate with his beloved Glaceon. Perhaps something else happened... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She exclaimed. \"I bet you shrunk even more, you little cutie, you! Don't worry! I know the cure! Sit tight, little master!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you had suffered through the literal earthquake caused by every slight motion she made. Bouncing and falling left and right, you had given up trying to fight the continental Ice Pokemon. You were too busy covering your ears from her booming voice to even stabilize yourself. But you could make out what she said. She was going to rescue you after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry Glace!!\" You cried out to gigantic deaf ears. You had no idea how she could possibly grow you back, but you say and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlace had carefully stood up and made her way to a berry bush. She rustled through it until she found a ripe star-shaped berry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will do the trick! Just a little longer, little master.\" She said joyfully. Carrying the berry in her mouth, she returned to where she had slept and lied down on her back. She took the berry into her paws and smushed it into a paste-like jam. Then she carefully began to apply the berry jam to her slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and froze as you saw your pokemon's massive paw descend onto you, carrying with it a purple-looking jelly or slime-like substance. You instinctively started to run away, but before you could make a hairs-width distance you were smothered by the paw and the jam. Everything was dark for a moment while Glace worked it into every part of her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the paw retracted. You were carried along on her sticky paw. From your view her paw was miles above her titanic clit, despite only being a few inches. You began to feel tingly, and noticed that you were starting to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It's working!\" You called out, but you were still too tiny to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlace carefully eyed her paw, waiting patiently to see her master appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You must have been really really <i>reeallly</i> tiny, master!\" She giggled. The thought alone had started to arouse her. After a bit longer, she could make out your tiny form on her paw. \"There you are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glace! I was afraid you'd never find me!\" You exclaim, looking at your pokemon's adorable face. \"I shrunk every time I came into contact with your... ummm... juices\" You admitted, embarrassed by the fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay! I had a feeling that would happen, little cute master!\" She said, setting you down gently. You were now back to an inch tall, leagues bigger than you were but still nothing in comparison to your sexy pokemon. \"So I made sure I knew how to reverse it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank goodness...\" You said, relieved. Your gaze slowly averted back to her nether region, and you could see her sweet-smelling and shimmering vagina from your small angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does my little master want to stay in my love hole again?\" She said, tilting her head cutely. \"I know how to make you not shrink uncontrollably!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You ask, curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm!\" She nods.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wee hours have been going by much slower than you imagined. Your shrinking has left your frosty pokemon's slit decidedly unsatisfied, which you realize while you climb ever higher. Hand over hand, gripping each mound of flesh as you ascend, while Glace's breathing causes the cliff face to expand and sink with every second. Despite the massive, almost scary size difference, it strikes you as downright darling. However, as you climb ever higher, ever closer to the  entrance, still great distances away, you realize that the walls are becoming harder to grasp. They're wetter, stickier, and dribbling with moisture. You're hesitant to look down, but at this point, it's inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon gazing downward, instead of seeing a plummeting fall from which you could never hope to recover, you spot a slick, burbling lake, rising higher. Glace has been having a wet dream, evidently, and the presence of her paws near the entrance of her labia far above is almost assured. However, this roiling, unexpected torrent of liquid gives you an idea. By swimming in it, you could rise much faster than climbing could take you. Plus, at a certain point, you'd have to rest, and the sheer cliff face didn't offer any alternatives. So, you could tread in the pool of slick syrup, and swim until you were squirted out onto Glaceon's vulva. You were so tired already that you thought you might give out at any moment anyway, so you decide to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go, you fall a short distance and splash with a wet \"splip\" into the ocean of soon-to-be-discharged fluids. You take a longer time to surface than you thought, having to fight your way up, and taking in a wet gulp of the sugary fluid. It tastes unexpectedly nice. You shake some of the liquid out of your ears once you surface, and listen as you rise, like a passenger of the flow of an erupting volcano, to Glace's late night whispers. Her dream is about you, of course. In the dream, she's playfully grinding her parts atop you while she sits in your swivel chair back home. It clicks and bounces as she chirrups merrily, a playful series of joking teases marking the beats between her bounces atop your minuscule body under her sex. Your body inside her sex, however, rises at an astonishing rate, as this fantasy and the flood within her vagina offers you a route out. Having given up on yelling, you simply pant \"I'm coming up, Glace!\", preparing to reenter the outside world, at a size nobody, most likely not even Glace, would be able to see you at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hits orgasm, the wave becomes a tumultuous ocean, and its waves cascade over you, pulling and pushing you under in what is, in actuality, just a tiny squirt of cum. It ejects you from the pussy forcefully like a volcano, tossing you relative miles into the air. You look over the vast landscape below you, catching your breath and taking a deep lungful of Glace's minty scent. You descend, and land directly upon the ice type's flat tail. You look up at the planets of Glace's ass cheeks, in between which is the great rising trench of her crack, nestled within it a soft, sensitive anus, and then, after seeming kilometers of perineum, the organ from which you were released, still dripping and pulsing out slick ocean after ocean, wave after wave, of bountiful orgasmic fluids. Wiping yourself off against the flat surface, you gaze upward at Glace's undersides, curious how you could ever hope to climb such things to gain her attention. No, it was impossible. You stood no chance of even getting a quarter of the way up Glace's rear before morning. And yet, you knew that once she woke up, things might just work out for the better. You hoped, but, just in case, you ran the few miles to the edge of the impossibly curvaceous moon, and hugged it for good luck. You hoped your lovely Glaceon would find you right here, on her butt, when she awoke. Somewhat hesitantly, but romantically, you gave the cheek a quick lick. Yup, it tasted like her, all right. You were delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning...</span></div></div>",

At such a tiny size  as 1/60th of an inch, you weren't willing to take as large a risk as climbing around on the outside of Glace's skin where you might fall. You knew that reaching her rear would probably be the surefire bet for getting Glace's attention, but for now, you had to play things safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend several minutes climbing around the outside of the thin slit. It was like an enormous, upwards-facing canyon, and every time you looked down from it, you saw a huge fall toward the bed as Glace leaned out over the side of the bed in a futile attempt to search for you. Her outer rim is still slightly wet, and thanks to that sticky coating, you're able to stick to the surface of her labia without worrying about falling. The thick, sticky fluids clung to you and her in equal measure, holding you fast to your icy cold goddess, even as you hung upside down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached your destination, you think ten minutes had passed. Ten minutes, just to get from the interior of Glaceon to her clitoris. How such a small distance, definitely no more than two inches, had suddenly turned into a massive gaping adventure. The sexy hulking behemoth, Glace. She was so cute when you were normal sized, and you thought that if cuteness was based on size difference, then how did you appear to Glace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have much time to reflect on this. A huge paw padded at the damp cave entrance, pulling off globs of her sticky, sweaty, aromatic juices. It nearly swept you off the huge surface, just barely gliding off and above (below?) your head. Thankfully, you were able to wedge yourself a little bit under the clitoral hood, avoiding the fate of being swept off unawares. Glace looked at her wet paw. <br>\r\n\"Hummm...I still haven't dried yet. I don't usually stay this sticky this long.\" Glace was reflecting on the consequences of the stimulation you were providing without her being conscious of it. <br>\r\n\"It must be the thought of master. I can't believe I lost him. I should've been more careful. I won't let him out of my sight when I finally find him. I'll keep him right exactly where I know he is when he's microscopic. I'll keep him snug, secure, and riiii-iight up against my good stuff! We'll take good care of each other.\" She thinks to herself for a minute, then says \"Oh, but you can probably hear me, right master? I'll be sure to find you in a jiffy, master! Don't worry! I'll find you and let you shrink even smaller, I swear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were comforted slightly by Glace's determination, but her padding at her sex had taken most of the dampness with it, leaving only a drying layer in its wake. You wrested yourself out of the clitoral hood, flinging yourself onto the titanic orb proper. This massive sexy sphere was like a miniature continent to you, and it was such a small part of your partner. You started to fall, but threw your whole body against its surface. You let the cum dry, freezing you in place on top the little nub. Any struggle you could try now would be futile, but at least you weren't going to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently however, moving or not, your presence stuck fast to her clit was still providing some stimulation, as you soon felt shaking as Glace padded at her sex again. \"I'm still wet...huh...well, don't I just feel itchy all over! You're able to affect me even from far away, master~\" You felt the shaking be converted into a huge, pressing, rolling quake. Glace rubbed her vagina from top to bottom, paw settling just barely above her clit. \"Oh, this spot's still a little wet, I think.\" It was true, layers of fluids were caking on top of you, trapping you under layers of her own juices. It couldn't have been very thick at all, but to you it was an irresistible force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Glace's paw push hard into your back, rubbing you up and down her clit, through the fluids. The sheer volume made it slightly difficult to catch your breath without getting a mouthful of the stuff, but you would be lying to yourself if you described the experience as unpleasant. Unfortunately, it was cut short.<br>\r\n\"What am I doing? I shouldn't be playing with myself, I need to find my tiny, teensy, <b>puny</b> li'l <b>sub-specky</b> boy. Somewhere on this floor, my double-shrunken master is helpless, and I must find him! No time to be pleasuring myself. That can come after I find him~\"<br>\r\nShe pulls the paw with a light tug from the sticky clit, pulling you along for the ride, buried underneath the cum-stain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Glace look at her wet paw like before, or simply put it down, right on top of you?</span></div></div>",

You approach a hind paw and attempt to get a grip on it. However, it's simply too massive to grip successfully, and you instead have to pull strands of her fur to climb it. It takes you a minute,  but you reach the top of her paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh master cutey~ Where are you -?\" You hear Glace sing, her voice dominating the tent. Her butt wiggled a bit as she searched for you in the opposite direction of where you were. <br>\r\n\"If you come out, I'll share a little secret with you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wonder what that secret could be before getting back on track. Leg climbing. Must pleasure ass to get continental, adorable ice type pokemon to notice you. Yes. <br>\r\nYou hike your way across her paw, over the hills that are her toes and the gaps between them, until you reach her leg proper. <br>\r\n...Good goddess this is enormous. Glaceon's legs seem to ascend for a mile, and far above you see the cavernous slit you just spent a good twenty minutes of heaven in, and your destination. <br>\r\nClimbing up her leg is an incredible adventure, what with the wiggling and Glaceon adjusting her position to search different parts of the floor, but you reach your goal. <br>\r\nYou climb on top of her enormous (especially now that you've shrunk to almost an eighth of your previous size) ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to work, and are immediately rewarded. Just by tickling her cheek, you hear a reaction out of your ultra giant goddess who couldn't so much as feel you stomping in her pussy earlier. <br>\r\n\"Heeheeheeha-aaAaHh-! Master, is that you?! Are you the one tickling my butt? One tickle for no, twice for yes! \" <br>\r\nYou tickle her with even more determination, and she responds by almost keeling over completely. <br>\r\n\"OOOH!! I knew that was my super shrunken sex cherub! Pleasure me more, master, I love it! \"<br>\r\nYou hop over to her anus, massaging it. You are amazed at the fact that even this is so much larger than your fragile body. You dive onto it, and she can take no more. She orgasms, right then and there on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here you were, worried she wouldn't feel you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's even later into the night and you are once again sitting on Glaceon as she is lying on her back looking down at you once again. <br>\r\n\"So, master, I'll give you the choice, since you gave me MORE than what I asked for. <br>\r\nWould you rather get the near - microscopic size play done with now, or would you rather skip it and hear about my... <i>secret</i>? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth options tantalize you, and particularly the way she whispers the word secret tells you it might be sexier than a thousand sex games at near - microscopic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do you choose? </span></div></div>",

I would always wonder what it would be like to be huge, to be bigger and taller than people, taller than houses, to tower at the height of skyscrapers, to stand above them, having buildings only go up to my knees, or lower! I would lie awake, fantasizing about little people below my paws, or looking down at a tiny city I could eat up in a single bite. I wanted to be a giant, to make craters with just my fluffy little paws. I had found my fetish. <br>\r\n Some nights, when I felt really repressed, like I couldn't take the urges any more, I would take a marble and pretend it was the world. I would do <i>everything</i> to that marble. I licked it, I sat on it, I whispered dominating giantess things to it, I would even use it as a little masturbation aid when I just couldn't do it on my own...but I also abused it. I had to get new marbles sometimes because I had eaten \"the world\", or I lost it in the heat of the moment,  or I had broken it under my ass, or stomped on it until it broke, or it had become too sticky or smelly from being shoved in my ladyhood or my...butthole. I would shove a marble I pretended was the planet into <i>my ass</i>! I had a problem. I was obsessed with this fantasy of being big, and I sometimes thought that if I ever did become a giant I would misuse my newfound power and do messed up things. I dreamt that I would crush cars, use buildings as sex toys, and leave destroyed, cum- coated disaster areas in my wake. If I ever grew big enough, I would put the whole world in between my legs, push it in between my goddess lips, and close my legs, clenching as hard as I could until I felt the entirety of the world, all its people, all its pokemon, cities, forests, counties, continents, the whole thing; pop from the pressure put on it from my vagina, bigger than the sun. <br>\r\nWhen I discovered you had the opposite fetish, that you wanted to shrink down and be the positively microscopic plaything of a lady so much bigger than you, it all just clicked. I got the berries for you, and you ate them completely trusting. I had so many dirty thoughts running through my head, but I just wanted to make you happy.\"<br>\r\nShe took a brief pause, then continued. <br>\r\n\"I made you a special ring. It'll grow and shrink to always fit you, and it'll make you a little more fragile, but because it's made with my ice magic, you can use it to always talk to me, whenever you want. And on top of that...\" <br>\r\nGlaceon put you on the bed, standing up and looming over you for dramatic effect. <br>\r\n\"It'll let you control my size at will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I worry about doing the right thing sometimes, but if you're calling the shots, master, I think it'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react to this? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A problem presents itself soon enough however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in the middle of a bluish silver loop, 60th of an inch body hopeless to summit the smooth surface. It's as if this ring that was intended to fit on your finger were a twenty foot high railing preventing you from leaving. You look up, as that is the only way to look, at the sky - filling face of Glace. You have the same disappointed expression between the two of you. You just aren't sure how well this plan was thought through. <br>\r\n\"I guess I planned on giving it to you at full size, master.\" Glace excuses herself. Wind from her breath fills the loop, giving you minor chills. \"Hang on, let's grow you back first.\" <br>\r\nThe ring is picked up in her mouth and moved a few inches away. Her face completely blocks out all light, breath dominating your airspace. There is an earthquake, and you see that an enormous globe has been presented before you. You could make a summer home of this berry. You dig in, thinking about growing back to normal size. <br>\r\nThe second problem of your one night stand manifests itself. The berries are designed for wish fulfillment. You have already had your wish fulfilled. Eating more of it won't cause you to grow. It was never your life's dream to grow. You have achieved the size where you are most satisfied, a packet of fruit sugar in a round orb isn't going to take that away from you. <br>\r\nYou can't grow back to normal size. <br>\r\nYou look up at Glaceon disappointedly. \"Oh. Can you not grow back?\" She asks, enormous tongue sticking out as she chastises herself for not thinking this far ahead. <br>\r\n\"I could make a band for me to control your size, master. That way I could grow you back to normal and we could get at my ring. I can't really think of anything else...\"<br>\r\nYou struggle to think of ideas.

Glaceon starts by showing off the \"upper\" choice.That is to say,  She starts with her mouth. She puts her monolithtic head on the mattress in front of you and opening wide, giving you a good look at just one of your potential sleeping areas. Her cheeks flush with color. The enormous tongue licks hungrily at each of the white teeth, each one like a calcium tent, a dominating and consuming surface. Her lips twitch, eager to suck at the cute, nearly invisible body, so small an insect could step on you. They long to taste of the infinitesimal, tiny skin of the double - speck she calls \"master\". The slick, salivating warmth beckons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only gives you one other option.  She lies down on her back, front paws parting her other pair of lips. You can see... all the way deep. No teeth, no tongue.  Just dripping, sensitive flesh. You gaze deep into her engorged temptation, spotting the tight entrance to her womb. You struggle to even quantify or qualify the caliber of wet dreams that coat the bluish walls as thickly as her cum promises to cover you within the cave being exhibited so shamelessly before you. Her paws let go, and the parted gate pushes itself scandalously back together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... The decision is made yours. You deeply ponder each choice,  briefly saying a farewell to the prospect of dry sleep before announcing your decision. </span></div></div>",

Also a real possibility is falling down her throat, which you might not even make contact with the sides of her esophagus while descending through, leaving Glace totally oblivious to your fate in her chilly insides. Besides, if you slept in her mouth, she wouldn't be able to talk to you! Which was important when waking up inside a saliva drenched possible death trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you pick her vagina.

Lying on your huge, spongy mass of sexual flesh, you decide to listen to her, and try to get a handle on what it is she's saying. Eventually, you pick up on what it is. She's only half-awake, and is talking to herself and walking herself through a nighttime fantasy of hers. Thrilled, you decide to listen and enjoy the show. Above and all around you, Glace's voice pushes through her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Glaceon sits quietly by the door. She is at home, and you are out on a big adventure to go save some friend or other from an island full of fire or somesuch. She wasn't really paying attention, but the point was she couldn't come along. This is one of very few times that you have left Glaceon by herself in your house, which you only share with your Pokemon companions. This time, though, she's alone at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a knock on the door. Glace knows you're not home, so this must be the mailman. That's so strange. Why would there be mail when you're not home? Well, whatever. She pops through a side door and walks around to the front.<br>\r\nIt's a small brown package. Weird. She brings it inside, setting in front of where she was sitting. She stares at it a while, then decides that whatever it was, nobody would mind if she opened it. So she splits open the top of the cardboard box. Inside, there is a small animal treat. </i><br>\r\nHow strange, <i>She wonders.</i> Well, whatever.<i> It must be for her. She's the only one here, after all, and this treat won't go forever without spoiling. She eats it immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn extreme tingle passes through her. Glace gasps, feeling the invasive feeling pass across each leg, chilling her spine. It's not... <b>bad</b>, really. She actually finds it quite... </i>sensual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When the feeling passes, Glaceon opens her eyes. At first, she is confused. The box appears smaller than before, much smaller, as she's crushing it under a paw. She can barely fit in the space, actually, as Glace realizes that she's bigger! Much bigger, taller than you would be, in fact, and still growing.<br>\r\nShe stumbles over the small tables in the house, breaking some smaller things as she exits the back door, barely fitting as she crawls outside. She stands up, looking inside. She would never fit inside there now. She was much too big. Glaceon turned around, now stuck outside, as her height began to rival the house. Her normal two foot seven height had been turned into two stories in no time at all, and showed no signs of slowing. Glaceon looked down, pacing around the ever - shrinking house. She looked down as she gained each, a foot, several feet, and she looked at the roof.</i><br>\r\nThis is <b>so cool</b>,  everything is so tiny! <i>She thought, thinking about how amazing it was to be growing with each passing second. Soon, the house was barely tall enough for Glaceon's paw. She rested it on top, barely putting any weight in it before the roof collapsed. </i> Hee hee, oops. I'm pretty big and powerful, aren't I? <i>Glace began to think about how she could use this newfound hugeness to her pleasure. She could already feel it in her nethers. She picked herself up, and walked down the road. There were bigger things to try now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy steps flattening the earth below each colossal, crushing, and carefully placed step, Glace walks toward the city. Her huge paws kick down trees, each step gradually making it easier until finally she's so enormous she merely steps on the forest. She was growing faster than she thought, flattening the forest at a tremendous thousand feet. Gazing idly from her huge paws, she noticed she had arrived. A few more steps, and she was upon the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hugeness could not be understated. People fled from beneath her enormity, as she looked, like a kid in a candy store, all about the city, excitedly trying to figure out what to do first. She was getting wet rapidly, and needed the power trip now. She stepped into a busy road, giggling all the while. Her rear rose, wiggling in the air. </i> <b>I'm spoiling these little itty bitty people,</b> <i> She thought. </i> They should have to work for my huge rump before I just up and drop it on their busy roads like this. Oh well. <i> She fell backwards, paws crashing through the towers on either side of her as her titanic ass crashed down on the road. Glaceon was rapidly expanding, thighs sweeping out the bottom halves of the buildings she was crushing. Her forepaws withdrew from them, taking along passengers of tinies. Smiling, Glace dipped her paws below her, bouncing on her butt, pushing her paws under her and smushing them wholesale. She laughed gently, her size swelling further and further. Feeling herself ready to focus now on her sex, she stretched. Rolling over, she propped herself up, and slowly drew to her full height. She looked over her handiwork, a huge clearing in between the buildings had been made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlace looked down at the buildings now. She was now half a mile tall, and when she looked down, all she could see were insufficient fillings. Her robust frame and huge size meant none of these paltry buildings would service her properly. She lazily looked about, finally finding a proper tower. The huge business tower beckoned. Glaceon looked it over, gazing inside its windows at the tiny people inside. They all had the same face of confused fear on, and Glace giggled at how silly they all looked. She turned around, flipping her tail to the other side of the tower, giving them a perfect view of their new destination. Glace carefully tried to minimize damage as she lowered her engorged vagina upon the structure, but as soon as it entered her, she could not control herself. She clenched nearly instantly, crushing the top of the building in an enormous implosion of roof and window. Glaceon sat down, crushing the rest of the titanic building underneath her butt, feeling it tickle her anus as she flattened it underneath her. She pouted, upset she had let such a huge building like this go to waste, rather than fitting it the whole way inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive size by now was close to three fourths of a mile now, and there were very few buildings that would satisfy her now. She supposed she could use the next tallest structure as her dildo next, but her throb desired more than a insignificant offering like that. She was huge, and needed more. Then, as she sat, grinding down upon her wasted toy, feeling metal give completely underneath her titanic and ever expanding ass, she saw the perfect solution. People. She quickly got up, rubble falling off her enormous cheeks, and gathered tiny offerings from around the city. Holding so many people and pokemon on her paw, a pile of living creatures, Glaceon lay down and dumped them. The other paw was holding the unsatisfied sex open to the descending ants, and when they met sexual flesh, Glace quickly patted them inside with the paw she dumped them off of. So many of the town's population was nice, but it wasn't enough. Glaceon's  enormous pussy went unsatisfied once again, but then she had a clever idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooped huge amounts of buildings up, arranging them into a stack. Alone, they were insufficient, and the tiny inhabitants caught inside might escape before she could use them, but Glaceon knew just what to do. Focusing, the sides of the stack began to freeze, layers and sheets of ice piling up further and further until several blocks of city buildings were frozen into an enormous rod of ice. Glaceon gripped the sides of it, forcing it inside, stuffing it as deep as possible. As soon as the massive ice dildo was inside, it began to melt, leaving only the numerous buildings and Glaceon's vaginal muscles to duke it out inside. She contracted on them, feeling a ton of weight resist her. She smiled. She masturbated, crumpling into a measly pile of girly ecstasy. Her womanhood fought to crush the invading force, and involuntarily Glace clenched again, the glass cracking but the buildings resisting still. Her cum flooded the buildings, sweeping their interiors in a slurry of orgasmic joy. She tossed her head back and came in an eruption upon the city, ascending even faster now, meeting higher and higher sizes each second. She surpassed a second mile before she even got up, and as she surveyed the imprints her enormous rear, her massive velvet purse, and her sticky and soft paws had left upon the city. She looked over it, barely interested. She could maybe rub against it, or she could wait until she was bigger...   </i></span></div></div>",

It fills the room, bouncing, as light is prone to, off of and through practically everything in the room. It makes a general nuisance of itself before eventually settling gently on an object it can't quite find itself capable of piercing. It rebounds off the half-smooth, half-furry object, casting it in the lightish blue which distinguishes it from its sister species. It's a rather important detail of the object, which is female, that it is impregnable by light, as the object, a Glaceon, currently has an occupant. This Glaceon's occupant approximates roughly 1/60th of an inch in height, and in mass is insignificant. That occupant is you. Inside of Glaceon's vagina, light doesn't reach, and as such, you are caught totally unawares when, after several slow moving minutes of her feeling the heat of the light, and her eyes fluttering open, she shifts from a sleeping position to a more natural sitting one, a small motion, to be sure, but one which did happen to rock your world, and you, awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flung haphazardly off of Glace's G-spot across the comparatively gaping and massive chamber. When at last Glace settles, which is only about two seconds following her beginning to move, you are hanging by one leg out of her cervical opening, facing down and out of the huge organ towards the outside world. Some of her moisture runs down from even further above onto your other leg, pouring down and soaking you. It drips off from your neck and face. A shaking which you identify as the echo of Glace's voice through her body starts up, and not far behind it trails her lilting purr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh...Good morning, world. And a<i> special </i>good morning to you, back there, little master~\" And now, a conscious and deliberate shake throws you downward, just barely inside the titanic gape. You know from last night that contacting Glace from inside her is nigh-impossible, and you aren't quite awake yet to crawl up to her rear simply to greet her good morning. Of course, it's the thought that counts, so you get down a little on your knees and lick this little bit of her pussy, here. \"Morning, Glace!\" You shout, not content to surrender. Of course, she neither feels the lick nor hears the call, but you choose to look on the bright side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner's huge paw shoves its way over and on top of you moments later, and it feels its way to the back of the warm orifice, where she put you last night, and where she thinks you still are. After rubbing against the spongy G-spot for a while, she thinks she feels you, and withdraws her paw, taking you with it, though you were on her wrist. <br>\r\nShe examines the paw thoroughly to find you, however, so it doesn't take a resolution to get the thing done. You are sat on a pillow.<br>\r\n\"Good news, my itty bitty lovely! I finished something that will let me control your size at will. Here, let me back off a little and show it to you.\" She turns around, kinking her rear up a little to tease you, the svelte, curvy posterior rising like a blimp far above your reach, becoming your sky. It luringly sways as she paces back a few steps, before turning around and striking a fancy little fashion pose, with her ears tossed to a single side, and her head tilted. Her paw is raised, and you see the gold bracelet around the wrist you didn't get stuck to. <br>\r\n\"Now, I can grow or shrink you to whatever size I, and well, you, want! And we can get at the ring which changes my size! Sounds nice, right?\" <br>\r\nYou nod. Of course, you were a meager speck, so she didn't catch the nod, so you end up having to shout anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there's no real rush. If you want me to test it out for some fun little experiments first, that's all<i> our business</i>, and I personally am still a little nervous about changing size for myself. But it's your call, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt <i>does</i> just so happen to be your call. It also just so happens to be a beautiful day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fun little experiments\" sounds like exactly how you want to spend the morning. The sun hadn't yet risen high enough in the sky that it turned from red to white in the sky yet, so it was still fairly cool outside, so you had a rather unique idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you had to shout it, but this is the effect to which you shout, partially: <br>\r\n\"Glace, what if we went outside? I mean, we're a distance from our next destination, and we're traveling, but what if we explored the woods a little distance? What if we...you know, rolled around, tested out some unique size scenarios, and -\"<br>\r\nAt which point, realizing that she probably should have done so earlier, your icy mistress grew you, until you barely came up just above her paws a couple heads, like a doll. You thanked her, and she flirted with you non-verbally. On a related note, her paw was quite heavy. You went on. <br>\r\n\" - and what if we did the whole \"frolicking outside\" thing? I mean, we've been traveling together quite a while, but this is the first time we can talk to each other. And...well, I guess we're in a rather unique position, sexually, I mean.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me if...you want to...have sex outside?\" She asks, her paw casually pushing, forming around your body like a snow angel. The pad covers your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well count me in!\" And like that, the pressing force gently rubbing off your whole body lifts, and you watch the impression your body left fade on the dark gray leathery tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt scoops you up, and you are dangled, clinging tightly to the underside of her neck like a thick sequoia tree. She paces bouncily over to the tent entrance, and you depart for some soft woods.<br>\r\n* * * * * * *<br>\r\nComing to a partial clearing, your grip finally gives, and you tumble a small bit before hanging by your legs towards the bottom of Glace's neck. Quickly, though, that slips as well. Soft fur slips out of your grasp, light blue strands releasing you into the air.  You get caught before you fall far, but the surface upon which you land is the underside of Glace's paw, which you bounce off of uselessly. \"Woops!\" Glace gasps, before you land roughly against a small pile of leaves. You get your bearings and look up at your icy match. She's frosted over the ground around where she was standing, and the few inches away you were turned suddenly to smooth ice underneath her. You look up at her. She may not be as big compared to you as she was, but she remained the size of a huge building, at least. Her nose lowers closer to you, and you feel cold breath against you, which blows away a stray leaf. <br>\r\n\"This spot seems like a good resting point, right?\" She asks, sitting on her pad of frost. She looks at you for a while like she's thinking and something is slowly forming as a whole idea. She takes a gulp, and the sound it makes, louder down near you, lets you know she's been doing some salivation. <br>\r\n\"What size should I be for this?\" You ask innocently enough. \"Bigger than I was last night, right? If I got lost, and fell off you or something, it'd be a lot harder to find me out here than in the tent...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah the bed's a lot softer than the dirt and leaves and stuff out here.\" Glace picks up your thought. She lays her paw on you and presses gently but intently, like in the tent. \"If I were to push too hard, get too wild, you might just be accidentally squished against the hard ground.\" The huge puffy toes curl, briefly pushing down hard on you, before lifting into the cozy pressing hug again. \"That'd be super sad, though.\" She lifts her paw off you again and puts her other paw against it, feeling your imprint while leaving you to catch your breath on your back in the flattened pile of leaves. \"So we shouldn't do anything without making sure you're big enough to not get hurt by it and make sure you have a soft surface to <i>sink</i> into.\" <br>\r\nThe idea Glace was having appeared, from her expression, to be solidifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could stay <i>this</i> size, for now,\" You posit. \"It seems to be working just fine for now. But we still need something to do that's safe.\" <br>\r\nWell, we have some<i>one</i> that's safe for you to be around~\" Glace winks, and sticks her tongue out a little. Because her face is so close to your body, though, it makes contact, and she follows through with a full-body lick. \"Oooh, feeling your shape with my tongue getting me hot...\" This appeared to be true, as the ice was melting out from under her. Soon enough, she was sitting in her own little puddle. It ran downhill, around your pile. <br>\r\n\"I don't want to get in your mouth at this size, Glace. It's a lot to deal with, you know? Plus, if you accidentally swallow me, I'd get stuck in your throat and that'd be bad for both of us.\" <br>\r\n\"That's true, I suppose...\" Glace pouts, and the last of the puddle runs past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlace's face finally relaxes, and she lets you know immediately her finished idea. <br>\r\n\"What about my butt? It's big, soft, perfect for a puny doll like you to fit under. You won't get crushed by my bouncy little posterior, and I'll get a whole lot of pleasure out of squeezing you silly. Sounds like a good start to me.\" And you just laugh and nod. You're already lying on your back, so you don't even have to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps her front low, but turns around, leaving her rear dangling temptingly over you. She evened out her back, pressing her left cheek onto you. <br>\r\n\"Down I go...\u2661\"<br>\r\nThe weight pushes down, slowly at first, then it get heavier, and heavier. Glace lifts up her top half, pressing the rounded blue firmly over, smothering you underneath her, hiding you underneath her. She wiggles her lower half into the wet ground, shredding leaves and getting some dirt on the clean, almost polished and perfect ass. She lifts a back leg, leaving her balance even more dependent on the cheek. Your face is pushed further into the pale rump. It forms tightly and firmly around every part of your body. Unlike before when you were only a sixteenth of an inch, you were pressed under her whole cheek.<br>\r\n\"Can you feel it, itsy bitsy? My soft, huuuge tush, covering your whole body? Can you move?\"<br>\r\n Her front paws both lift off the ground, and she wiggles some more, only one paw and her butt keeping her upright.<br>\r\n\"How about now?\"<br>\r\nShe straightens out, and you feel more and more of her outright crushing weight on top of you. If you were under a less soft and forgiving surface, you would have easily been splattered ages ago, but Glace was far too gentle and careful to let you even be hurt underneath her now. Her last paw lifts up, and she shifts her weight entirely onto the cheek you were under. You couldn't move in the least, and you could only breathe in Glace's scent from down here.<br>\r\n\"Aahhh...This is so awesome! Can you squirm around at all? Is my quaint li'l fanny too massive for you to handle, even at so much bigger of a size than you were? O-oooooh~\"<br>\r\n The leaf at your back was in cracked pieces all on her cheek, and you couldn't so much as turn your head. The rich light sky color of Glace, especially here on her derriere, was slightly dirtied by the ground, which struck you as an injustice. You didn't have much time to think about it, though, because Glace was bouncing up and down on top of you, slowly, deliberately. With each downward push, you felt more and more of Glace on top of you, forcing you into the ground, like a hug from someone intended for someone much stronger. And each time, when you felt like you couldn't take any more, like you would give out under the weight, it lifted, letting you breathe, letting you shift, letting you take in her glorious behind. And of course, she teased you all the while. <br>\r\n\"And here's the fun part!\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt your whole body shrink quickly underneath her. You were concerned at first, but as you shrunk, you experienced the incredible sensation Glace had been setting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dwindled fast, and as you gazed around you, you saw the imprint of your own body grow larger and larger. You were shrinking so fast that the space you couldn't so much as twitch in before was now so much larger than an aircraft hangar. And it continued to grow, even as the huge, soft skin pushed out, fading the imprint away, until the entire huge rounded cheek was entirely back to its normal shape. You looked up, curious, wondering why it was that even now you had so much room to move, when by all rights you should be flattened underneath your icy goddess. <br>\r\nBut as you gaze at the pushing, growing moon, you realize that you've shrunken so far, so quickly, that the debris itself was holding up her ass. Glace's booming giggle echoes overhead, and it shifts, and the rump presses onto you once again. You feel for the briefest second like you're about to burst like a tiny gummy underneath her, but just as quickly as you shrunk, you shoot back up to doll height again, and you feel the intense tingle as your growing body pushes huge amounts of her butt out of the way. Upon returning to this height, Glace stands up, and before you can react, she grows you to a whole six inches, and pushes you underneath her again as her ass comes crashing down all over again. And back up she goes, and comes crashing down, and you shrink to barely a single inch. And again she drops her titanic tail end on you at a 60th of an inch. Again at half an inch. You're smothered at three inches, crushed at ten, dominated at a quarter of an inch, shoved under at a sixteenth, compressed at half your full height, and right back down to near nanoscopic size. And finally, one final push right back at the doll size. She cums, and you find yourself caught up and finishing, too. And the bouncing massages and tends to both of your orgasms as you ride down...<br>\r\n* * * * * * * <br>\r\n\"Was that enough?\" Glace pants, flopped over, gazing hungry still at your tiny body. You sit up and look at her huge resting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You literally crash on it from the tiredness. Sylveon jumps on your lap and stares at you with her baby blue eyes. You smile at her \"We really trained hard today, didn't we?\" you ask \"We sure did master\" Sylveon replies smiling as she lets out a yawn. After a few minutes, you notice that the sun has completely settled down, replace by the white light of the moon. You yawn \"Well\" you say \"I think it's bedtime\" you say starting to walk towards your bedroom \"Yeah\" Sylveon replies following you in the bedroom. You open the door and lay down on the bed. Sylveon gets on the bed as well as you yawn again \"Good night Sylveon\" you say closing your eyes. You fall asleep almost immediately. Too bad you don't notice your pokemon smiling and getting on your chest \"Good night master\" she says wrapping her ribbons around your torso \"Sleep tight\". As she says this, a pink fog comes out of her ribbons; it encircles you, but you don't notice due to your heavy sleep. <br>\r\n~<br>\r\nYou open your eyes slowly as daylight filters through the window. You feel strangely comfy for some reason, you almost don't want to get up. You remain still for a few more moments, before you finally sit down.

Curiously, you extend your hand out to gently rub against the strange white wall. For some reason, it carried a comforting warmth to it, along with a very soft texture to boot. \"What is this thing?\" Now that you thought about it, you really didn't seem to have any sort of soft pillows or blankets lying about in your house that were white in color. In fact, the only white thing within your home seemed to be your very own pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait a minute.\" you stammer with wide eyes upon further inspecting the white surface. To your ultimate shock and utter disbelief, you found that the walls carried a sort of fur like texture to them, almost like your Sylveon. It didn't take long to put two and two together as you let out a startled gasp. \"No way.\" You mutter as you look to the right to notice Your Sylveon's now ginormous head looming down the horizon. \"T-This can't be happening.\" Upon gazing closer at her face, it appeared as though she was still fast asleep in a ball like position. Judging from the distance of her head, you seemed to be somewhere between her large furry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're mind was busy trying to wrap around just what on earth happened to you last night, you suddenly begin to notice the walls of fur besides you shaking lightly.

She smiles brightly as soon she sees you \"Oh, there you are master, I was beginning to worry\" she says as four feelers reach for you. You barely have the time to get up that the ribbons shaped feelers wrap around your waist and lift you to Sylveon's face \"Good morning master!\" she says pressing your body in her pillowy white cheek, nuzzling you. She then brings you to her face \"Sylveon, what happened to me?\" you say, trying to act obvious. In fact, you don't want to admit, but you have a shrinking fetish from a long time. Unluckily, hour pokemon knew more that she had to \"Isn't it oblivious? I made your dreams come true!\" she beams with a massive smile on her face \"Wha- what makes you think that this is my dream?\" you ask, still not wanting to admit it.

And I'm a fairy type, so I have a few tricks in my fur. And here we are\" she says. You stay with your jaw wide open, as you realize that your pokemon is slightly smart \"Wow...\" is all you manage to say \"Yup!

Her body heat and heartbeat are soothing, and you smile as your Sylveon carries you into the kitchen. She uses her free ribbons to open the door of the pantry, and then goes inside. Using two of her ribbons, she grabs one of the small bags of kibble you have, and carries it out to her food bowl. She dumps some kibble in, then starts to carry the bag back. You're surprised at the strength and dexterity she shows with her ribbons, and also surprised at the fact that she knows how to feed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask her about it, and she simply nods. \"Yeah. I have for a while, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I always do it for you,\" you say. \"I always thought you couldn't do it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just prefer to have you do it for me,\" Sylveon says with a smirk. \"Why do something yourself if you can get someone else to do it for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and shake your head. \"I never knew you were that lazy, Sylveon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't slack when it comes to our training. I'm still the best fighter on your team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no denying that,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Sylveon has returned to the pantry, and once she replaces the kibble bag, she then reaches up to a box of berries and takes it off its shelf. She places it on the ground and opens it, withdraws a single berry, and replaces the box to its shelf. She holds the berry in one ribbon and carries it over to her food bowl. Once there, she slowly lowers you to the ground and unwraps her ribbons from around you, and places the berry beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should count as a good breakfast at your size,\" she says.  \"Eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon then proceeds to dig in to her own food, burying her face in the kibble and eating quite messily. You stare at her for a few moments before turning to your berry and taking tiny bites from it. By the time you've taken just a few bites, Sylveon is done eating, and she sits back on her haunches and watches you as you keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finally finish the berry, you look up at Sylveon and thank her for getting the food for you.

You wonder what she has in store, as she lowers her head to mere inches from your body. Each time she breaths, her breath blasts your face \"As I was saying, what do you say of having some 'fun'?\" she asks, in a somewhat mischievous tone, her two sharp teeth shining as she speaks. You gulp down hard, before you find the guts to ask \"What kind of fun?\". Sylveon grins: right where she wanted you. She removes her paws from you arms, before continuing \"You already know what I mean master. In those stories you read, pokemon 'play' with their trainers with their mouth, paw, or other body parts\" she says slowly. She just stops to grin once again \"Anyway, I'm offering you to do the same things. But this'll be for REAL\" she finishes. You are in utter shock: your sweet and caring pokemon is completely gone, leaving a lustful beast at her place. But this doesn't take long to turn you on \"Go on\" you say, smirking as well. Sylveon giggles, before speaking \"Oh, we have so much to do. The first thing is up to you, but then I'll decide what we do. Oh, and don't worry, I won't hurt you in any way. I would NEVER even think about it. I still love you after all\" she says. You sigh, glad that she isn't completely controlled by her lust \"Anyway~\" she chirps \"With what do we start ~?\"</span></div></div>",

Sylveon just giggles, before moving one of her feelers to your back and pushes you closer to her paw \"Get rubbing master\" she says playfully. You smile as you put both your hands on one of her furry, pink colored toes and start rubbing. Sylveon begins to giggle \"That tickles master!\" she says between giggles. You smile as you keep rubbing the white and pink paw, Sylveon now moaning with you touch. You notice her while body is shaking in pleasure, her ribbons went completely nuts, her back leg is moving wildly. She is clearly enjoying this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon is in ecstasy. The feeling that her little master is giving her  is a feeling like no other. Not just the rubbing, but the feeling of power. The power she has over you right now. She could end your life with a single movement of her paw if she wanted. But she doesn't. You simply can't kill someone you lived with for almost your whole life. You two have an indestructible bond, a bond made of steel. But even if it wasn't, Sylveon could never bring herself to kill. She's just too kind for that. But the feeling of power she's having right now is threatening to make her lose her control. Back at you, your arms begin to feel tired. Without stopping your rubbing, you look up to Sylveon. She looks back at you with a look that screams 'Go further!'. With a grin, you stop rubbing and put your tongue on one of her toes. You expect it to taste not exactly good, but you're wrong. Sylveon's paw tastes like sugar. She always liked to keep herself clean (she practically shined whenever she came out of her pokeball, like shiny pokemon do), but this is unbelievable. Sylveon is moaning even louder now, as you continue licking her paw, having no intention to stop. What you don't notice, is that a ribbon quietly reaches your back and pushes you in between her toes, which she then closes. You are smushed between her soft yet firm toes, your mouth is pressed against one of them. You are practically kissing her paw. You blush fiercely noticing what are you doing, but you soon start to wriggle, knowing this would pleasure Sylveon even more. And you're right. Your Pokemon's moans are now audible in the whole house, and she's practically half giggling and moaning, due the fact you are tickling her. Your member is now at its full length, and it is pushed against Sylveon's toe, with the only effect of hardening it even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon keeps you in there for about ten minutes, before opening her toes and letting you out of them. You rub your back, a little sore from that. But it's really nothing more, as Sylveon's soft fur cushioned you the whole time. You remove some strands of pink fur from your mouth and look up at her, she gives you a lustful look, her mouth is practically watering.

There, you notice from her wet fur, you spot her dripping sex. Without giving you time to ask what she has in store, she pushes once again, shoving your whole body in her sex. You are enclosed by the fleshy tunnel that is her egg maker. You are literally trapped in a dark dungeon, as three of Sylveon's feelers block the exit, while the fourth slowly penetrates her sex. Sylveon is moaning really loud now, her moans almost breaking your eardrums \"Master *moan* please *pant* wiggle\" she says,  unable to talk correctly due to the pleasure she is feeling right now. You obey her command and you start wiggle as much as you can inside of her, with the result of getting pulled deeper into the 'love tunnel' \"Sylveon! Sylve! Thanks! lveon... master! You're... Sylveon... the best!\" your pokemon exclaims, reverting to some of her wild instincts. You smile, happy that you are making your pokemon aroused. Also, you're making also YOURSELF aroused. In fact, your cock quickly reaches its full length. Suddenly, you get an idea. So you stop wiggling and start licking the flesh of her pussy. Outside, Sylveon is literally sticking her tongue out of her mouth. Whatever her master is doing in there, it feels great. So  great that she is about to... Back at you, you hear a noise from behind you. You look up and see a huge wave of love juice coming your way. You don't have the time to move that Sylveon's cum washes you right on her ribbons. Some of it ends up in your mouth; it tastes salty yet sweet at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon you fall on Sylveon's ribbon, it instantly wraps around your waist and pulls you out of her sex. You are welcomed to the outside world by sunlight, and the beaming face of your pokemon \"Sylveon?\" \"That was absolutely awesome master\" she says lifting you to her face and nuzzling you \"Eww, you're all sticky!\" she exclaims \"Guess why\" you reply.

Sitting down on the furry landscape of her head, you start rubbing and scratching her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself, aren't you?\" a sickeningly sweet voice suddenly asks.

Your Sylveon patiently waits for you to finish as well, her tail wagging in anticipation of the imminent playtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as soon you give a satisfied sigh, Sylveon's ribbons wrap around your whole body.

As you took a few moments to collect yourself after a busy day of work, a familiar sound begins to resonate from down the hallway. \"Sylveon!\" your eeveelution cries out with shear giddiness at your sudden arrival home. In no time at all, she immediately leaps upon your stomach before lovingly nuzzling the side of your face. With a chuckle, you soon begin to pet her soft furred head as her ribbon like feelers begin to gently curl about your wrist and arm sending a soothing aura coursing down your body. You and Sylveon have been together for years now, though to tell the truth she wasn't always a Sylveon for that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust around a month ago you were busy working overtime with assisting the professor in his research over pokemon. This was quite a new for you, especially considering that you left around sunset to head home to your beloved eevee. Then again, if it wasn't for the professor then you wouldn't have been able to get an eevee to begin with. Being one of the last few kids to receive their pokemon years ago, to your utter shock you found that all the desirable types were completely taken. Distraught, the professor offered you one of his very own pokemon which you immediately accepted. Since then, Eevee and you have been nearly inseparable, sticking together from the good times and the bad. After finally moving a box full of pokemon data and completing your task at the lab, you immediately began to storm your way home, nervous about eevee. Upon entering the doorway however, she immediately leapt upon you whining and appearing near the verge of tears. Guiltily, you begin to apologize profusely to your pokemon before the unexpected happen. After moments of embracing her in hugs and nuzzles, she soon began to evolve. Whether she was extremely happy to see you, or some other unknown reason, she finally managed to transform into a sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reminisce over the past for a brief moment, you soon begin to feel something upon your cheek. Quickly, your eyes scan downwards as Sylveon's face was mere inches away from yours. \"Sylveon?\" you stammer as you move your head back slightly. \"what is it girl?\" A small giggle like sound escapes her as she soon begins to gently move her feeler over your forehead in an assuring manner. The soothing sensation emanating from her ribbons slowly begin to put you at ease as you lie back blissfully. As you happily gaze upon her blue eyes, you couldn't help but notice her smile growing that much bigger in size. Suddenly a pink powder begins to resonate upon her feelers as your eyes widen in shock. \"Fairy wind?\" you stammer in complete confusion. \"Sylveon what are you-\" before even having a chance of finishing your sentence, she begins to sing an almost lullaby melody to you. \"Sylveon~ Sylveon~\" she sung calmly as she slowly places her feelers upon your head. Your shocked state immediately takes a 180 as an odd comfort and bliss fills your body. Despite the relaxing sensation, your mind was still utterly confused over her strange actions. \"Syl...veon.\" you mutter before your heavy eyes soon close, leaving you deep into slumber.</span></div></div>",

With further inspection, you soon discover the white wall was a huge furred surface. 'w-white fur?' you stammer in your head before slowly raising your eyes upwards. As you did however, the sight was enough to leave your mouth clattering and eyes on the verge of rolling out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, or more precisely, sitting right before you was Sylveon! or at least it looked like her. Unlike her regular four legged form however, she instead appeared almost like that of a humanoid. While her body did carry traits of a human, like two arms and two legs, many of her Pok\u00e9mon traits like her head and feelers were still intact as well. As your eyes descend once more on her huge body, you soon realize that she was completely nude. Despite having no clothes however, her white fur did do a god job in covering her private of areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Master!\" she says in a cheery if not giddy voice followed by a small giggle.

So\u2026\u201d she giggles. \u201cI decided to return a favor.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026favor?\u201d you repeat still confused as to why she was humanoid and massive compared to you. \u201cw-what do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon\u2019s smile slowly starts to fade away by your uncertainty. \u201cw-well\u2026since you always took care of me, letting me do things I want to do. I thought maybe it was your turn to do what you want to do.\u201d She explains as a nervous expression emerges on her face. \u201cdid\u2026did I do something wrong?\u201d she stammers. \u201cI thought\u2026maybe me being human like and big would make things more funner\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on her face was enough to tug at your heart strings as you just couldn\u2019t help see her so upset. \u201cH-Hey! It\u2019s no problem!\u201d you stammer while waving your hands dismissively. \u201cI-I mean, I\u2019m really grateful for you doing this for me.\u201d You admit. \u201cBut\u2026just how is this possible?\u201d you mutter still dumbfounded by how this was all even possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI AM a fairy type.\u201d She says with a giggle as her unsure nature quickly dissipates. \u201cSo, I do know a few tricks in my fur.\u201d The comment does cause a small chuckle to escape as you were now standing before her massive knee cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\u201d She says with a large smile growing once more. \u201cwhat would you like to do master?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curiosity seemed to get the best of the situation as you finally turn t gaze up at her blue eyes. \"well....mind if I explored on your new body Sylveon?\" You ask curiously wondering just how she'd reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Sylveon lets out a loud giggle as she uses one of her ribbons to cover her mouth. \"of course master!\" she says in a cheery tone. \"but, I think I should lie down in order to make it much easier for you.\" She says before using one of her feelers to wrap around your waist and raise you upwards. As you were airborne, to your ultimate disbelief it seems as if you were still within the safe confines of your home, with the exception of everything being much more massive in scale. Once you turn your head to the right, you quickly notice Sylveon taking your place on the couch as she slowly lies her back down upon the comfy fabric. \"Wow! this is way more comfier when I'm like this Master!\" Sylveon beams as she wiggles her body slightly to get into a much more comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finally managed to get into a comfy pose, the ribbon like feeler holding you up slowly begins to descend downwards straight towards her white furred belly. In no time at all, your feet soon makes contact with the soft, if not slightly squishy surface of Sylveon's abdomen before the supporting feeler quickly unwraps around you. The whole feeling of being upon Sylveon's body was odd to say the least. While you did manage to feel the warmth radiating from her soft white fur, trying to maintain a good footing was quite the challenge due to her slow breathing. Luckily for you though, Sylveon made sure not to make so much movements to throw you completely off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel Master?\" Sylveon asks curiously as her head cocks slightly towards the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it certainly does feel different.\" you admit as you tap your foot slightly upon the soft field of fur. After three experimental taps, Sylveon suddenly makes a small giggle causing you to nearly lose balance and land upon your rump. Quickly, you spread your arms out slightly, luckily helping with your balance issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry Master.\" she stammers as the motions quickly begin to die down. \"that tickled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Sylveon.\" you reply while giving a long somewhat unnerved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where do you want to explore?\" she asks in a curious yet excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn your head to the right, you notice the two great mountains of fur that were Sylveon's breasts. Further along was her massive adorable face eying you happily. On the opposite end towards the left were her towering long legs resting peacefully upon the couch cushion. Not too far down, you could spot the area where both her huge legs met. Now, the only question in mind was just which direction should you head?</span></div></div>",

With each step you take, your feet sink ever so slightly upon the soft cushiony floor as you spread out your arms for balance. Straight ahead, you couldn't tell whether or not Sylveon was gazing down at you due to her mountain sized breast blockading her face. Regardless, you continue your way slowly before her voice halts your progress. \"how are you doing master?\" Sylveon asks, as if curious about your current expedition. \"I'm doing fine Sylveon.\" you reply back before slowly returning to your walk. \"oh, alright then.\" she says almost in a state of relief. \"I thought I was making it harder for you to move because of all the breathing I was doing.\" she adds. \"It's no problem at all.\" you assure her while continuing onwards. \"to tell the truth, it kind of tickles.\" Sylveon giggles lightly, though not enough to throw you off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, you finally manage to make it to the base of her huge breasts. As your eyes gaze upon the skyscraper tall mounds resting before you, your heart begins to race at the very notion of your location. The only question that stuck in your head now was just how to proceed onwards? At first you were contemplating on whether or not you should scale one of Sylveon's massive breast as if it was some sort of mountain. But as you were approaching the two great hills, a different idea soon popped into your head. Instead of trying to scale up Sylveon's chest, there was always the opportunity to make your way through it. As the two different ideas end up conflicting your thought process,<br>\r\nSylveon's voice soon rings past her chest. \"Are you okay Master? I can't fell you moving.\" she says in an almost worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Sylveon.\" you assure her by kneeling down and giving her white fur a small rub. \"just...busy trying to think how I should continue onwards is all.\" \"Oh!\" Sylveon says acknowledging your current predicament. \"well...I'll leave it up to you master.\" She says in an understanding tone. After much thought and debate you finally decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling adventurous, you walked up to her right boob. Being four inches tall, her D-cups were quite the mound, though that was nothing to you, as you did rock climb back in high school. So, you began the ascent of her breast, carefully grasping tufts of Sylveon's fur for leverage and not hurt her. However, your climbing did seem to tickle her if her cute giggles were any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you reached the peak of her boob where her erect pink nipple stood out, and Sylveon beamed at you as you appeared from behind her orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't seem too bad of a climb, Master,\" she commented. \"Although, that did tickle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sylveon, that was the only thing that came to my mind,\" you apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, it's quite alright, Master. It was still fun feeling you climb my boob. Now, why don'T you claim your reward?\" she asked, flicking her nipple once with her index finger and giving you a sexy wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't mind if I do, then,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, you latched onto the tit and started licking it. It was too big to fit in your mouth at your current size, so this would have to do. Still, your actions did have an effect on your mate, as your heard Sylveon moan at your ministrations, and knowing you were successful in pleasing her, redoubled your efforts. Meanwhile, she used her left had to fondle her neglected breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both kept a rhythm for a couple minutes, with you licking her nipple and her playing with her other boob. However, at one point, you didn't notice the shadow looming over you until it was too late when Sylveon brought her right hand to grasp the boob you were on, trapping you there. That didn't deter you from your current task, but you did feel yourself pleasantly moving along with her nipple as she massaged it. Meanwhile, she had let go of her right breast and snaked her other hand down to her crotch, where she began rubbing her lips with two fingers, filling your eardrums with her moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for nearly five minutes before the pressure of Sylveon's hand on your body suddenly increased. You couldn't see it in your current position, but the reason for it was that your Pok\u00e9mon decided to insert her fingers inside her pussy, sending a jolt of pleasure up her entire body that made her cry in bliss. Still, you did guess she had upped the ante on her hand, so did you when you brought your hands in to massage the nipple as you licked it with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, Ma-master, hmmm... ah!\" you heard her moan, and this kept going for a little while longer before she yelled your name as she came, drenching her digits in her love juices. She withdrew them from her pussy and licked them clean, moaning as she tasted herself. After that, she looked at your current location with half lidded eyes and grabbed you with her hand, interrupting your work. This startled you, and you were wondering what she was doing. Light returned to you when she opened her hand and held you with only her thumb and index, and you could see that you were hanging just above Sylveon's beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to you that you never took the time to evaluate her features as a humanoid. While most of her body was self explanatory, with pawed feet, fur, tail and feelers still present, the real changes had happened on her visage. Her eyes, instead of looking like a canine's, were human like, with sapphire blue irises, and it was only from your current vantage point that you could see she had long, pink hair that seemed to reach her hips. You had always loved your Sylveon, but you never thought she could be this gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, Master?\" she asked, interrupting your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're beautiful, Sylvy,\" you said honestly, and she blushed at the nickname you just gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, Master,\" she cooed, lowering you to kiss your face. \"Now, let's play a game, one I'm sure you'll enjoy,\" she then added, sultrily licking her lips as she gazed hungrily at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you were pretty sure she had found out everything about your secret fetish, and while watching that aspect of it did arouse you, actually partaking in it was another thing. \"We can't do that, Sylvy. I'll die in the process,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you forgotten? I'm a fairy Pok\u00e9mon. I can enchant my body so the gastric fluids remain inactive and can just warp you out afterwards. There is nothing to fear, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a minute to think it over. While you yourself being eaten alive was a bit frightening, but taking into account what Sylveon said, there was no actual danger of being digested. And she even had the decency to warp you out instead of waiting for the more... traditional way to free you afterwards. However, watching you silently ponder this made her frown worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to do it if you don't want to,\" she said morosely, making you realize that she assumed your lack of a response to be a decline to her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I don't want to, but that I was worried. But, if you promise it won't be dangerous, then I suppose I'm game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought back the smile on her face, and she lowered you again for a quick nuzzle. \"Thank you, Master! I swear, you're gonna love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she opened her mouth and released her hold on you, and you couldn't help but scream as you fell. You landed safely on her soft tongue, which she crammed back in her muzzle before sealing her lips behind you, trapping you in total darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were not going anywhere, Sylveon began tasting you, sloshing you around in her mouth. She moaned blissfully as she did that, apparently loving your taste, and while that thought was weird, it did turn you on. Outside, she had decided to put her hands to good use and cupped her breasts, then began slowly fondling them, adding to her pleasure. Her moans filling you eardrums and her tongue caressing your body made you smile, as you were happy she was having fun, and luckily for you, the inside of her mouth smelled of fresh berries, a pleasant odor to your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue rose you and pressed you against the top palette of her mouth, and she kept you there for a bit, licking you like a hard candy. You didn't know if this was voluntary or not, but you felt it slightly brush against your erect manhood, though the giggle you heard soon after told you that Sylvy did in fact intentionally lick you there. While you were taken by surprise by it, the feeling was not unwelcome, and you found yourself moaning when she licked it again a few more times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of pleasuring you, she then lowered you to her lower palette, with you laying on your back, and curled her tongue against itself to then sneak its tip towards your rod, where she decided to focus solely on it. You both moaned as she flicked your tip, and even more so when she hungrily licked it with only one goal in mind. Said goal she achieved a few minutes later, and she hummed in delight as your cum dripped on her muscle. Once you were empty, you just laid there, exhausted, though your mate had other plans for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching you off guard, she swallowed both your essence and you altogether, and reflexively screamed in terror as you traveled down her esophagus. Only when you landed in her stomach and not seeing any acids or digestive fluids did you remember Sylveon's words. Also, why you could somehow see the inside of her walls puzzle you, but you just blamed it on fairy magic. You thought that seeing the insides of her digestive organ would gross you out, but it surprisingly didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her end, Sylvy licked her lips after swallowing you, and lovingly tapped her belly with her left hand once you had reached her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were delicious, Master,\" she said out loud, though you could not hear her from your confinement. However, you did feel the tremors of her belly taps, which caused you to lose your balance and fall on your butt, and she giggled, as your fall, slightly tickled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, you decided to make most of your time here and walked up to one of the walls around you and began carefully rubbing your hands against it. Outside, Sylveon purred happily as she felt you massage her insides, and she snaked the hand on her stomach back to her nethers a second time, proceeding to rub her clit clockwise while her other hand focused on fondling her boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh, Master~,\" she cooed with a happy smile on her face, shutting her eyes as she pleasured herself and enjoyed your massage. She never thought you'd be this bold, and she felt her love for you grow further as your treatment went on. She called out your name a few times, and even cried out your real name once amid the pleasure she was receiving on both ends. When she felt herself coming close, she ceased rubbing her clitoris and shoved her index and middle fingers in her sex and pumped them in and out rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Ma-MASTER!!\" she shouted to the heavens when she came not too long afterwards, arching her body upwards as her love juices drenched her digits once again and worsened the stain on your couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Sylveon took a few minutes to rest, letting out pants as she let the afterglow run its course. As for you, after you noticed the lack of movement, you decided to give her stomach walls a few taps to get her attention. Luckily for you, she got the message, and through some foreign magic that left you dizzy for a couple seconds, reappeared on your Pok\u00e9mon's belly, unscathed and completely dry of any fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Master~,\" she purred, and you turned around to see her look at you with half lidded eyes and a content smile on her smile. She then withdrew her fingers from her pussy and brought them to her face. She shoved them in her mouth and sensually slurped on them to clean them of her juices, and this sight, as well as the exaggerated sounds she made around her digits, were enough for your dick to re-harden, which didn't go unnoticed by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sylvy,\" you meekly said as you tried to cover your rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, are you in for another round, Master?\"</span></div></div>",

I do have an idea that would make you and your lovely little friend happy,\" Sylveon said, bringing her left hand towards you to poke at your hard cock with her index, causing your body to shudder in pleasure. Heavens were her fingers soft!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, what is it?\" you asked, thrilled to get it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer, instead giving you her widest smile. Suddenly, her eyes glowed with a strange light and you felt a weird tingling sensation coursing through your entire body. It only lasted for a few seconds, and when it faded, you realized she had grown you to about eight inches tall, which was twice the size you previously were at. She then grabbed you with her hand before sitting up on the couch, her slender, soft fingers wrapped around you, and lifted you towards her face. On the way, you noticed her right hand still had her boob in its grasp, and a smile crept on your face as you looked up at your Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you taking a liking to this new body of yours, Sylvy?\" you asked teasingly, and it seemed you poking fun at her made her realize she unconsciously still was fondling her right breast, which she now released to bring her hand to cover her mouth as her cheeks turned bright red. You chuckled heartily at that, which seemed to make her blush even harder, and you found her reaction quite cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you,\" you continued. \"If it makes you feel better, I would totally play with those non-stop, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to have caused some of her shyness to fade away, as she removed her hand from her face with a cute giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you would, Master,\" she said, lowering her eyelids and fluttering her eyelashes at you as she rose you to a couple inches from her face. \"However, do you know what I would love to play with right now?\" she then asked you sultrily. Her sensually licking her lips pretty much gave you the answer, though you decided to play dumb and play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know? What could it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you didn't get an answer with words but with actions. Sylveon rearranged her grip on you, allowing your dick to stick through her middle and ring fingers. She eyed it hungrily with half lidded eyes, licking her lips once more as she stared at your inch or so long dick. She then lowered her head to drop a soft kiss on your tip, you shuddering at the contact, before her tongue poked from between her lips to lap at your head, drenching it in her saliva. You couldn't help but moan at her actions, her giggling as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever losing eye contact with you, she rose her right hand and stuck her index it her mouth, proceeding to suck on it. Once lubricated to her liking, she plucked it out with a light 'pop' and lowered it towards your crotch. She slowly caressed your dick with it, from base to tip and even circling it around the shaft. She even teasingly flicked it upwards with the underside of her digits a few times, eliciting moans and shivers of pleasure from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought her teases were dragging on, she took hold of your penis with her index and thumb and started rubbing it. She watched with a wide smile as you shut your eyes and arched your head back as you moaned at her touch, happy that she was successful at pleasuring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oohh, Sylvy...\" you found yourself mutter softly between breaths, causing your mate to smile even more at your verbal confirmation that she was doing a wonderful job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this wasn't the first time you received this kind of treatment, the first having been with a normal sized ex-girlfriend, that did not compare to a fingerjob from a giant Pok\u00e9mon. The soft digits delicately stroking your member felt heavenly, as proven by your incessant moans. Above you, Sylveon was still giving you her sweetest smile as she hummed an unknown tune to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're loving this, Master,\" she commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea. I don't think it would have felt that good with normal paws, or anything else for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am kind of getting a liking to this new body,\" she admitted. \"I didn't think I had the ability to shapeshift into an anthropomorphic version of myself until I tried, and I feel like I could just live like this now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it'd be a good idea in public,\" you interjected. \"A Pok\u00e9mon with human features walking down the streets would attract more attention than I am comfortable with and could cause a lot of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" she acknowledged with a pout, her ears drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't mind if it's in the house between the both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asked, perking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, though we may need to get you some clothes, least I have a raging boner all the time,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, that sounds fun. I wonder how I'd look like in human clothing,\" she said excitedly, said excitement increasing the speed of her strokes against your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I-I think we'll be able to find something that looks good on you. Nothing too extravagant, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't intending to ask for much, Master. All that matters to me is to be with you and make you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta ask. This is the first time that I see a Pok\u00e9mon growing romantic feelings for their Master. When did yours for me actually start to manifest themselves?\" you asked her, curious to know what motivated her to indulge you in your deepest fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released your cock and opened her palm to allow you to sit on it, which you happily did. \"Remember Marissa and how she ditched you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I....\" you said darkly, memories you'd rather have kept buried resurfacing. \"After everything I had done for her and the things we did together, I thought she was the one. Then one day, she just throws it all away like a bitch. I was just a tool to impress her friends, and nothing more to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon's ears drooped to their lowest as your mood turned sour. She obviously didn't want to bring back those bad memories, but she needed to mention that for what she wanted to tell you. You didn't doubt she would have kept the subject buried if she could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember that day as vividly as you do, Master. I was still an Eevee at the time, but it's still fresh in my mind.\" she used her right index to pet your head, ruffling your hair a bit. \"I remember your tears, the pain on your face, it was painful to see. You locked yourself away in your room. You didn't want to see anyone. Even your mother didn't know what to do, as you turned everyone away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brought you to her chest and pressed you there with both hands for a loving hug, which you returned as best you could, matting her fur with your tears in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" she continued, \"that day, when you locked yourself up, I was abruptly awoken from my nap when you slammed and locked the door shut. As I saw you curl into a ball on your bed, I didn't know what to do at first. It hurt to see you like this, and I knew I had to do something. When I cautiously approached you and called out for you, when you turned to me, it tore my heart in half to see you in such anguish. Deep inside, I thought you were going to shoo me away like everyone else, but instead you picked me up and held me close to you. At that moment, as I nuzzled you to comfort you, I vowed myself to remain at your side always and do anything I could to make you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Sylvy, I never thought your devotion rooted from there,\" you said after a short silence. \"Honestly, I am flattered. I... I really am lucky to have you as my Pok\u00e9mon,\" you added, tightening your hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept you against her bust for a little while longer, but eventually pulled you away. With a sultry smile adorning her features, she rose you to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's stop talking about bad things and finish what we started,\" Sylvy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, she extended her tongue out to prod at your member. All previous dark thoughts were thrown out the window as she licked your dick, working on re-hardening it. Once it was fully erect, she wasted no time in engulfing it with her lips. You let out a moan as she did, then held your breath as she held your dick in her mouth. You looked briefly at each other and, giving you a sexy wink, she began sucking on it, and you gasped as your body shook with pleasure. You felt even better when she started humming around your shaft, sending vibrations through your entire self, and you found yourself squirting your load on her tongue shortly thereafter, as you couldn't take it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were empty, she retreated her head and sloshed your seed in her mouth, taking in its taste a second time. She then swallowed it, trailing its descent down her throat with a finger all the way to her stomach, giving it a few light taps with her hand. She hummed in delight as she licked her lips, then leaned towards you, puckering her lips for a kiss, which you accepted as you shoved your face into her lips. You could practically taste yourself a bit, but weren't too phased by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the kiss ended, she pulled you back, and you looked at each other with happy smiles on your face. While you never looked at your Pok\u00e9mon this way before, and never imagined you would, this felt right to you. She had always been the one at your side whatever the situation might have been, had always been the one to cheer you up, and, to top it all up, was the most honest girl you've ever met. As you lost yourself in her beautiful sapphire eyes, a simple sentence crossed your mind, and you quickly acted on your feelings and spoke them out to Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Sylvy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Andrew,\" she said, using your real name this time. She returned you to your normal size, and you both headed to your bedroom, where you decided to simply cuddle in each other's loving embrace until you both fell asleep. Just before the veil of darkness overtook you, the same thought crossed both of your minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There is nowhere else I'd rather be right now.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning after, you received a visit from your cousin, who was accompanied by his female Espeon. He had a respectable position in a big, well renowned company and had to be out of the country for business for a week or so. Thus, he felt he sadly wouldn\u2019t have the time to properly take care of his Pok\u00e9mon, and thought that you could help him out while he was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering your cousin rarely asked for any favors, and that both your Pok\u00e9mon were sisters, both born from the same Eevee breed and haven\u2019t seen each other in a while, you could hardly refuse his request. After some brief talking and wishing him goodbye as he left, you called Espy, as your cousin called her, along to greet Sylvy, who had taken back her feral form while there were visitors in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon beamed when she saw her sister walk into the living room, and jumped down the couch to greet her. They exchanged nuzzles and communicated in their primal Pok\u00e9mon language that you could not understand. However, you couldn\u2019t stay and play with them yet, as your cousin had caught you right as you were about to leave for your grocery shopping. Telling the Pok\u00e9mon where you were going, you told them to have fun and no mischief until you came back and, bags in hand, left and locked the door behind you, leaving the two Eeveelutions to their own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you feel sad whenever your master leaves for so long?\u201d Sylvy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, I\u2019m used to it by now,\u201d her younger sister answered. \u201cIt sucks and I do miss him whenever he does go away, but luckily it\u2019s only once or twice a year. Besides, it gives me a reason to spend time with my loving, older sister,\u201d she said, affectionately pressing her cheek against Sylvy\u2019s, who wrapped her feelers around her torso and pulled her into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, I\u2019ve missed you too, Espy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her younger sister for a bit longer before letting go with a quick nuzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you wanna do until your Master comes back?\u201d Espy asked. \u201cWanna run outside in the backyard for a bit, or we could stay inside and either watch whatever cartoon is on TV or read whatever books your Master has.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all those suggestions were appealing, something else came to Sylvy\u2019s mind. While he probably would not approve, she was certain that Andrew would not be able to resist when he comes back from the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I have another\u2026 idea,\u201d she responded sultrily, the change in her demeanor causing the psychic Pok\u00e9mon to recoil slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Espy queried, uncertain and unaware of the thoughts in her older sister\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever wondered what it would be like to be human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question caught the Espeon off guard completely. \u201cWhat do you mean, Sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean THIS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sylvy\u2019s eyes glowed a bright light, her body following suit. Espy shut her eyes and turned away, the light too intense to look at. When it died down after a minute or so, she opened them and her jaw hit the floor at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of her was Sylvy, but in a totally different form. She was five foot six tall, and adorned the full anatomy of a human being, with hands and breasts. When she looked at her eyes, she noticed the irises were human like as well. Basically, in front of her stood a Sylveon with human limbs\u2026 and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d was all Espy could mutter as she stared at the naked, now humanoid body of her sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty neat, don\u2019t you think?\u201d the Fairy type stated matter-of-factly, slowly turning on herself to show off her new features to her sister, caressing her hips and thighs with both hands as she did so. Her actions caused a faint blush to appear on her sister\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere in the world did you learn to do this?\u201d retorted a shaken and baffled Espeon, pointing a paw accusingly at her. \u201cAnd more importantly: why? Just why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sylvy said, walking to the couch to sit on it, facing her sister with her arms crossed under her bosom. \u201cI just tried it and I just did it. I can\u2019t really explain how I did, other than I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for why I wanted to be anthropomorphic, that\u2019s an interesting story that regards my Master\u2019s most secret fetish,\u201d the Sylveon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa whoa whoa! Hold on! you\u2019re telling me that you decided to turn human like just so you could sleep with Andrew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about it? As I recall, Sis, you too did have a crush on your Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, \u2018did\u2019. I got over it,\u201d Espy countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because he got married,\u201d Sylvy pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point!\u201d the Psychic type huffed, stomping the ground with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt totally is!\u201d Sylvy exclaimed, pointing an accusatory finger at her sister. \u201cYou\u2019re an Espeon, and I\u2019m a Sylveon, and though it happens differently, we still both evolve based on the relationship we have with our trainer. So you can\u2019t tell me that, after all those years, with the friendship and bond you\u2019ve built with him, that there is not a part of you that still wishes you could make him yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspy took a step back, ears dropped as her brain registered her sister\u2019s words. She had nothing to say to that, as she was right. Her sister understood her feelings better than she did. Having them shoved right back into her own face made her realize how selfish, hypocritical, and if she was being honest with herself, jealous of her sibling she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer internal conflict was interrupted when she felt something coil around her and lift her off the floor, which she soon found out to be Sylvy\u2019s feelers. The Fairy brought her close for a loving hug, which she gladly returned with her smaller arms. Though she was not quite sobbing, a few tears trailed down her face, which her older sister wiped away with her left ear\u2019s feelers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Sis,\u201d Espy apologized after a few minutes in her loving embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Espy. I forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think about any of this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was being rough and crude, so that didn\u2019t help much,\u201d Sylvy said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI deserved it for being an ass,\u201d the Psychic remarked with a light chuckle. \u201cTo be fair, I\u2019ll take your honesty any day if it keeps me straight on my feet, so in a way, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Sis,\u201d Sylvy said with a smile, hugging the little Espeon tighter.</span></div></div>",

She pet the top of her head, ruffling the purple fur a bit in the process much to her sister\u2019s annoyance. After a short moment of silence, it was Espy who broke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you were proposing me earlier if I wanted to know what it felt like to have a body like this?\u201d she asked, motioning up and down Sylvy\u2019s body with her paw for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Are you interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I am curious, yes. Though I wonder, what\u2019s the fetish you mentioned earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ah~, one thing at a time, Sis. If you commit to it, then I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Sylvy said with a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re really gonna play this game? Fine! Hit me with it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, if you\u2019re sure,\u201d Sylvy said, standing off the couch. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need you to stay put while I do this. Should you change your mind in the process, just shout \u2018stop\u2019 and I\u2019ll cancel the magic, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspy nodded in response, and that was her cue to proceed. Facing her sister, her eyes glowed with the same light from before as she readied her fairy magic. Meanwhile, the Espeon shut her eyes as her elder did her work, calmly awaiting the end result. Once the magic was ready, the Sylveon wrapped it around her target, and once she was completely surrounded by it, poured it inside of her in one go. She then directed it in her sister\u2019s body to alter her body like she did hers, and after a few minutes of strainless effort, sat an anthropomorphic version of the Psychic Eeveelution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she felt the tingling sensation of her sister\u2019s spell fade away, Espy opened her eyes. She looked up briefly at Sylvy, then down at her arms, and upon seeing hands at the end of them, confirmed that the transformation was a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it worked,\u201d she commented before attempting to stand up. Strangely enough, the movements of this new body felt natural, and she had no trouble standing and walking on two legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels so weird not having any struggles walking like this,\u201d she added before stopping in front of Sylvy, both of them noticing they stood at the same height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought the same, but didn\u2019t question it,\u201d Sylvy admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, how do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just let you see for yourself. Come on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she beckoned her younger sibling to follow her up the stairs to the master bedroom. Against a wall stood a dresser adorning a large mirror, which Sylvy dragged her to so she could admire her new sexy body through the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was pretty much the same as before, with large tufts of fur on her cheeks and her psychic gem on her forehead. However, long violet hair cascaded down her back to her waist, much like her sister\u2019s, though her toupet was more pronounced than her, falling down to eye level. Speaking of which, the amethyst irises were now like a human\u2019s, with a black pupil in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she traveled her gaze downward and almost did a double take when she saw the melons protruding from her chest, which were just as large as Sylvy\u2019s. Tentatively, she cupped them with her hands and jiggled them a bit, sending small jolts of pleasure through her body as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, or you\u2019ll just leak on the floor,\u201d Sylvy commented jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, this is new to me,\u201d Espy reprimanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, she slightly twisted her hips, confirming that her tail was indeed still there, before finishing her venture all the way down at her pawed feet which, upon lifting one up and touching the pads underneath with her fingers, felt just as soft as they ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, it\u2019s not so bad,\u201d commented the Psychic type. She then turned her gaze to a stray object on the dresser and concentrated on it, effortlessly lifting it into the air through telekinesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still have the features and abilities of an Espeon, but with the anatomy of a human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sylvy asker her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s different, I\u2019ll give you that. \u2018Great\u2019 still remains to be seen. You haven\u2019t told me what that fetish was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEager, aren\u2019t we~?\u201d Sylvy teased, sensually biting her index finger, and causing her sister to blush harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut with it already! What did you two do together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 if you really wanna know\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It took you to trips from your car to bring all your bags inside, and once that was done, you hurried to store everything that needed to be kept frozen in the freezer right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Pok\u00e9mon were nowhere to be found in the living room or kitchen, and a look into your empty backyard hinted they were probably upstairs, more likely in your room. It was surprising that they didn\u2019t take advantage of the good weather to play outside, but whatever they felt like doing, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything was stored where it belonged, you called out their names, but got no response. You figured they might be napping, so you began making your way up the stairs to see for yourself. As you approached your room though, you heard sounds coming from it, followed by a feminine, unfamiliar voice. Confused and worried, you nearly ran to the door, only to be frozen at the spectacle you stumbled upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere on the bed were both Espy and Sylvy in anthropomorphic forms. The Espeon was sitting at the head of the bed, her hands firmly grasping the sheets as she moaned and panted at the ministrations your Pok\u00e9mon was giving to her pussy with her tongue and mouth. While a part of you wondered what in the world was going on, another was enjoying the show, which was apparent with the growing tent in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know how long you stood there watching Sylvy eat out her sister\u2019s vagina, but eventually the Espeon noticed you there and froze as she stared at you. Her silence alerted Sylvy too, who turned to you and beamed when she saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back, Master~,\u201d she greeted happily, lust evident in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey Andrew\u2026\u201d said a shy Espy, quickly growing uncomfortable by your silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of this, Sylvy?\u201d you managed to ask after regaining your bearings to some degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, just showing my little Sis to a good time,\u201d she answered, separating herself from her pussy and taking a seat at the edge of the bed, completely facing you with that sultry yet adorable smile you loved so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Espy didn\u2019t dare say anything, opting to just look your way, shyly turning her gaze away when you looked back at her. It was then that you took the time to briefly evaluate her new form. Overall, you found she was pretty similar to your Sylveon, having the same height and length and style of hair, though hers was a deep violet. Her amethyst eyes were quite charming, and a quick look at her bust revealed it to be just as big as Sylvy\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Sylvy asked suddenly, catching you eat her sister with your gaze. While you wanted to be mad at her for revealing her secret to someone else, all your brain could think about were the two beauties sitting on your bed as you watched with a growing erection in your pants that threatened to pierce the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pok\u00e9mon apparently noticed, standing up to walk towards you. Once she was face to face with you, she brought her right hand to your bulge and softly caressed it, eliciting light shudders from you and a horny giggle from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes my Master wish to join us~?\u201d she purred, knowing the answer already but wanting to hear it from you.</span></div></div>",

Once your dick was free from its prison, you took a step forward to meet them on the bed, only to be stopped by Sylvy\u2019s hand on your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, dear. We have something special in mind for you~,\u201d she said, and before you could ponder what she meant, your body was enveloped by a mystical light, signature of your Pok\u00e9mon, and when it faded away, you stood no more than four inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you regained your bearings, you saw a huge pink hand reach down for you and wrap its fingers around you. Only your head poked out as you were lifted up and dragged to Sylvy\u2019s smiling face. With her other hand, she pressed two fingers against her puckered lips and blew you a kiss with a wink, then climbed on the bed to join her sister with you in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood on her knees in front of Espy and held you over her. You looked down at her and met her gaze, her shyness suddenly gone now that you were tiny, replaced with lust. Without warnings, Sylvy opened her hand and let you drop down, and you screamed as you fell until you landed perfectly and snuggly between the Espeon\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspy looked down at her new charge in her cleavage and, with a smile, raised her hands to cup her boobs, ensnaring you even more in them. She began fondling them slowly, and you moaned quietly as you felt her furred orbs rub against your body, enjoying the massage. She giggled as she played with you and her boobs, really getting into it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, up above, Sylvy gleefully watched her sister play with her new toy. Grasping a breast with her right hand, she brought the other to her crotch, briefly caressing her lips with two fingers before inserting them in and slowly pump them in and out of her womb. Seeing her do that caused Espy to fondle her melons a bit faster and press them tighter against each other, pleasantly squishing you when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got initiative all of a sudden, Espy,\u201d Sylvy commented. \u201cWhat happened to that shyness of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, he consented to this,\u201d the younger sibling rebuked. \u201cMight as well give him what he wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both continued their respective ministrations for a while longer. Watching Sylvy masturbate from the crack of Espy\u2019s cleavage made you rock hard, something she noticed and felt whenever she mashed her boobs together to engulf your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re loving this that much, huh?\u201d she asked you with a giggle, though she couldn\u2019t hear your response, as it got muffled by her orbs, but she did discern by your tone of voice that you were enjoying what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Sylvy guessed, looking up at her sister for a split second before returning her gaze to you in Espy\u2019s canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm. It is practically stabbing my breasts whenever I press them together.\u201d Her statement was emphasized when she did just that some more, letting out horny giggles each time your rod rubbed and poked against her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go for a taste if you want,\u201d Sylvy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRe-really?\u201d the Espeon stammered nervously, a blush forming on her cheeks at the prospect of tasting human semen, something she never thought could happen without it being weird due to species differences and the fact her Master was already married. However, in this new body, having sexual intercourse with a human didn\u2019t seem that awkward anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd quite frankly, the more your dick speared her breasts, the more she thought about its contents, until she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. With her left hand, she fished you out of her bosom, holding you by the waist with her thumb and index, and moved you closer to her face, taking a moment to examine your tiny form. You remained limp in her hold, awaiting her next move, while keeping your eyes glued to your Sylveon, who was still pumping her digits slowly in and out of her pussy and playing with a boob with her other hand, all the while giving you the sultriest smile and look, lower lip bit included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly thereafter, you found yourself moaning when Espy ran her tongue underneath you, spending extra time on your penis, before opening her mouth and sealing her lips around your torso, trapping your lower half in her maw, where it rested on her tongue. She immediately started sucking on your body and moving her muscle to flick and lick your member at a slow pace. You couldn\u2019t help the blissful moans that escaped you as she played with you like this, her lips forming a happy smile knowing she was successfully pleasuring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your current perch, you still had a front row seat to the show in front of you. You internally wondered how long Sulvy could keep this up before she came, but it seemed she knew the right speed to still make it pleasurable for herself while keeping her orgasm at bay. You didn\u2019t mind her taking her time, as anything she did, especially in this new body, was sexy as fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, she did move on and finally withdrew her digits from her sex, which were now soaked with her juices. For your entertainment, she slowly raised them up to her face and closed her eyes, humming in delight as she smelled herself. She then reopened them and fixed her half lidded gaze on you before inserting her fingers in her mouth, taking her sweet time to clean them off, slurping unnecessarily yet sensually around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Espy\u2019s end, now that her left hand was free, it was her time to feel the pleasures of masturbation. Lowering it towards her crotch, she slowly rubbed her labia vertically with her middle finger, the stimulus causing her to moan around you, and soon inserted it along with the ring finger inside her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrations her moans created around your dick, Sylvy\u2019s sensually slurping on her digits even though they were probably clean now, and Espy\u2019s hand playing with her vagina down below were too much for you to handle. With a final cry of bliss, you erupted in the Espeon\u2019s mouth, her eyes shooting wide open as your semen fell on her tongue, moaning louder when she tasted its sweetness. She kept lapping at your rod, effectively milking you of every drop after a good minute, and she then swallowed it all, humming in delight as your seed fell down her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like you loved it, Sis,\u201d Sylvy pointed out with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm!\u201d was all the Psychic could manage to say around the treat in her mouth, looking up at her kneeled sister, a mischievous smile forming on her lips as an idea just popped into her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLet\u2019s switch places,\u201d Espy told Sylvy through telepathy as she stood up from the bed to cede her spot to her. Slightly confused yet curious at the same time, the Sylveon obliged, taking a seat at the head of the bed, leaning her back against the frame. Once she was seated, Espy smiled wider around you and slowly lowered her head, and it then clicked in Sylvy\u2019s head what her younger sister\u2019s plan was, hornily giggling when she realized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were completely oblivious to it all, as you were still recovering from your orgasm, and only found out about your upcoming fate once you were face to face with your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s pussy, which was still wet from her earlier ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey girls, can we talk about this before going hardcore like this?\u201d you nervously stammered, unsure if you were ready to be unbirthed, though your plea fell on deaf ears as Espy leaned towards her sibling\u2019s sex, the Fairy letting out a sharp, loud gasp when your tiny head and torso penetrated past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had lodged you into place, Espy released you from her lips, and watched your legs wiggle with a grin as you tried to free yourself from your predicament. Before you could manage to do so, she quickly rose back up and aligned her own pussy with her sister\u2019s before lowering herself down, engulfing your legs in her cunt as both their pussies pressed together, the Eeveelutions gasping and moaning as they made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Espeon intertwined her right hand\u2019s fingers in her sibling\u2019s left hand and, with a silent agreement, both slowly began grinding their crotches against each other, their free hand grasping the bed sheets as they moaned in pure ecstasy as they felt your tiny body struggle in vain to get out of their sexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went at it slowly at first, but soon quickened the pace, their moans and pants filling the bedroom. Even though you weren\u2019t deep in any means within any of them, simply feeling you in their womb was the best thing in the world right now. Espy held her sister\u2019s hand and bed sheets tighter when she felt her climax getting closer, which Sylvy mimicked a few seconds after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir pussies having already been worked up by their previous minutes of masturbation, it only took a few more for them to reach the breaking point. They cried your name as they came, their juices flowing all around you and spilling out from between their conjoined lips, leaving a dark, large stain on the sheets right underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pok\u00e9mon then remained in their current position for a little bit longer, panting as they recovered from their high. Once they had calmed down, Espy pulled away from her sister, revealing your legs still hanging out of Sylvy\u2019s pussy, which your Sylveon pinched to pull you out of her sex and raise you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely drenched in sex fluids from the whole ordeal, something your Pok\u00e9mon found quite appealing, as she was looking at you with half lidded eyes, hungrily licking her lips. Without waiting any longer, she raised you over her head and opened her mouth wide before lowering you in, sealing her lips around your body. She moaned as she lapped your head, moaning as she tasted herself along with you, then slurped the rest of your body. She slowly sloshed you around in her mouth, humming in delight as she took her time to enjoy your taste mixed with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Espy had leaned down in front of her sister, bringing her face towards the Sylveon\u2019s pussy. She went to work and began licking the remaining juices, causing Sylvy to moan around her treat, which she soon swallowed with a gulp, letting out a satisfied sigh as you traveled down her esophagus and landed in her gas free stomach. More moans followed suit as she enjoyed her little sister eating her out, and she brought her left hand down to hold her head there, not wanting to let her back off until she was clean down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her end, Espy hummed as she slurped the leftover juices, sending vibrations through the Sylveon\u2019s pussy that caused small jolts of pleasure to shake her body. Once she had lapped up the last drops, the Fairy got an idea and her eyes lit up with her signature bright light for a second, enveloping your body in it, and when it subsided, you found yourself stuck in her vaginal lips again, with your upper half sticking out this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you suddenly appear right in front of her face caught Espy off-guard, though she quickly shook it off and looked at you with half lidded eyes before clamping her mouth around you and pluck you out of there. She then rose back up to a kneeling position, suckling on you as she did, then slurped you all the way in her mouth. Just like her sister, she took a moment to slosh you around and taste you, without the extra juices, however, and swallowed you down, tracing your descent through her throat with her right index and middle fingers. Meanwhile, she was holding her left boob with her other hand, slowly caressing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout it all, you remained silent, too tired to object to their shenanigans, and opted to let them have their fun. It was still enjoyable, and you knew for a fact that they wouldn\u2019t do anything to harm you in any way whatsoever. Whenever you were in their bellies, you could faintly hear and feel their heartbeat, their tempo soothing to your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Espy teleported you out of her stomach and onto her right hand, both girls looking sultrily at you. Before you could say anything, the Espeon clamped her mouth once again around you, but not with the intention of eating you this time. Looking at her sister, she leaned towards her and locked lips with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs tired as you were, you still moaned when you began feeling two tongues wrap around you and play with you as the girls made out, moans and giggles filling their cavernous maws. They held each other by the shoulders while they kissed. Since your lower half was in Sylvy\u2019s mouth, she took the opportunity to flick her tongue against your dick every now and then, causing you to moan as you slowly got hard once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept kissing for about three minutes, drenching your body in their saliva. When she felt you were hard enough, Sylvy pulled out from the kiss, dragging you along with her, her lips tightly sealed around your torso. Just like her sister did before, she started lapping at your rod and sucking on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to grab her breasts to stimulate herself more, but Espy beat her to it and did it for her instead, firmly grasping her white orbs. The Sylveon moaned around you as her sibling fondled them and squeezed her erect pink nipples between her digits, the Espeon seductively looking you in the eyes while she did it, effectively moving more of your blood down south. It became even more effective when she replaced her right hand with her mouth to suckle on the tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fairy\u2019s moan that ensued would have been much louder was she not holding you in her lips. Still, it sent pleasurable vibrations through your dick and body like you\u2019ve never felt before, and you joined her in her moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wanted to fight off your upcoming climax, your tired state made it harder to delay it. As it got closer, you just gave up and let it happen, letting your seed squirt on your Sylveon\u2019s tongue. She hummed sweetly as she tasted your cum and returned to moaning, as her sister was still fondling and sucking her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvy pressed her left hand behind Espy\u2019s head, silently telling her to keep going for a little while longer, which she gladly did. By now, your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s soft moans were slowly lulling you to sleep, which she noticed when she felt you get more and more limp in her mouth. Moving her hand to her sister\u2019s shoulder, she lightly pushed it, the Espeon getting the message and pulling away, a string of saliva connecting her mouth to Sylvy\u2019s nipple for a brief moment, breaking when she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Pok\u00e9mon stared at you with caring smiles on their face. Pinching your chest with her left hand, Sylvy plucked you out from between her lips and put you down in her cleavage. Once you were nestled snugly, Espy sat to her sister\u2019s left and leaned her head against her shoulder, and both watched as you let out a loud yawn. You then felt a finger lovingly caress the top of your head and, upon looking up, were graced with the smiles of the two most beautiful creatures you\u2019ve ever encountered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRest well, Master,\u201d Sylvy said quietly, her index ruffling your hair. You felt yourself getting drowsier under her touch, and eventually fell asleep in her warm canyon, with two angels watching over you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, did you have fun, Sis?\u201d the Fairy asked once you were fully asleep, turning her head to her sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm, I sure did. He was delicious!\u201d Espy admitted, earning a light chuckle from the older Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeehee, that he is. And I\u2019d also say that you got quite a liking to this new body, hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than I thought, yeah,\u201d Espy acquiesced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re free to keep this form in the house. After today, I don\u2019t think Master will mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, I will. It\u2019s so much more pleasurable to rub yourself with fingers than with a paw, so I\u2019m gonna take advantage of this body as long as I can while I\u2019m sejourning here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvy\u2019s eyes shot wide open at that declaration. She clearly wasn\u2019t expecting her sister to say something along those lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Espy, I never imagined that such thoughts could cross your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, when you live with and have fantasms about a man you\u2019ll never be able to get, then you can criticize,\u201d the Espeon rebuked. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m gonna use this body to relieve myself of my frustrations as much as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to be so aggressive about it, Sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Andrew would mind doing this again while I\u2019m here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t? He may not be your Master, but he sure likes you. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d understand your frustrations and offer you to relieve yourself whenever you need to. I know I\u2019m in,\u201d Sylvy offered, dropping a quick kiss on her sister\u2019s snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re both willing to go to that length, then I may find myself coming here more often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how would you do that? Slip away from your home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Espy stammered, a frown forming on her face as she just now realized the flaw in her train of thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think that through, did ya?\u201d Sylvy said, counting her following points on her fingers. \u201cFor one, you live all the way across town, and secondly, even though you can\u2019t get him in the way you want, he\u2019s still your Master, and he still cares about you, and I doubt he\u2019d very much enjoy the idea of you suddenly vanishing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d The Psychic lowered her head, ears drooped, only for them to perk back up when Sylvy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, the goal here today was to relieve yourself, not to make my Master your own, and I think you may have forgotten that somewhere along the way. I said we didn\u2019t mind \u2018helping\u2019 you out during your sejour here, not to permanently move in,\u201d the Fairy lectured, letting out a slight giggle at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sorry Sis,\u201d Espy said, slightly ashamed of herself now. \u201cI got carried away. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She then felt a hand gently hold her shoulder, and turned her head to see her sister still smiling at her warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m the older one, so I can set your silly head back straight,\u201d Sylvy said, a hint of playfulness in her voice, which the Espeon caught on, returning a faint smile back at her before wrapping an arm around the Sylveon\u2019s neck for a hug, which was returned in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad to have you as my sister, Sylvy,\u201d Espy admitted, a stray tear dropping onto the Sylveon\u2019s fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo am I, Espy. No need to be sad, now, come on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not, I am actually happy. Though I do wish we could see each other more often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we talk about that with Master when he wakes up? He may be able to arrange something with his cousin. I sure do miss my lovely little sister every now and then as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Espy sighed, contenting herself with gazing at your sleeping body as you napped the afternoon away, leaving the conversation at that and feeling torn inside.</span></div></div>",

A small groan escapes your mouth as you slowly roll to the side of your bed, trying to let exhaustion once again reclaim your form. \u201cCome on!\u201d The voice beckons once more. \u201cWake up wake up!\u201d it urges as you suddenly feel an outside force begin to shake your arm back and forth. \u201cughhh\u2026.\u201d You moan as your eyes slowly start to flutter open from a well night rest. \u201cwha\u2026what is it?\u201d you mutter as you slowly rise up into a sitting position to let out a long tired yawn. \u201cGood morning Master!\u201d the voice from your subconscious state beams in a cheery tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn your head to the right, you immediately notice your Braixen, kindle sitting upon your bed on her knees. \u201cDid you have a good sleep?\u201d she asks with a smile. \u201cIt was okay.\u201d You reply while covering your mouth from another yawn. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d you ask as you gently rub your sleepy eyes with the side of your hand. \u201cit\u2019s nine o clock.\u201d She replies as you let out a small groan. \u201cI thought it was the weekend Kindle.\u201d You mutter in an almost disappointed tone. \u201ccome on Master! The early bird gets the worm.\u201d Kindle, replies with a chuckle. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re better at making breakfast than I am.\u201d She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryday it seemed like the same routine with you and Kindle. You go to sleep slightly late and she acts as your alarm clock. By now, you were beginning to have second thoughts as to just why you purchased an actual one from the shop. With a long grunt, you slowly rise up from bed before giving your body a long stretch. \u201cSo, what\u2019s for breakfast today?\u201d Kindle asks as she scoots her way off the bed and walks towards you with a large smile on her face. \u201cHmmm\u2026how does fruit salad sound?\u201d you ask while returning the smile, only to receive a gasp and excited tail wag from Kindle. \u201cOn second thought\u2026\u201d you ponder. \u201c\u2026how about some cereal instead?\u201d Kindles happiness immediately dissipates as she quickly clenches her eyes close and sticks her tongue out in disgust. \u201cJust kidding around.\u201d You chuckle giving her head a small pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Kindle being the first pokemon you ever cared for, apart from her preevolved fennekin form, she quickly ended up becoming your best friend from the start. Despite her rather quick thinking and gentle nature, her somewhat childish attitude did cause her to end up in some rather ridiculous instances. A small sigh and chuckle escapes your form as she accidentally managed to catch a neighbor\u2019s tree on fire due to attempting to fly about her stick like a witch. As you walk down the hall of your apartment, Kindle quickly makes her way past you heading straight towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the food\u2019s not going to be there right off the bat!\u201d you call out with a light laugh. \u201cI know, I just can\u2019t wait though!\u201d she replies with a giggle to follow. Upon entering, you immediately spot her sitting at her normal spot on the table as her legs below kicked the air eagerly. \u201cYou and breakfast.\u201d You chuckle as you make your way to the fridge to pull out an assortment of fruits. \u201cWhat?

Nononono!\u201d Kindle stammers shaking her head and both her hand like paws in unison. \u201cIt\u2019s something entirely different!\u201d she beams. \u201cSomething\u2026different?\u201d you ask still concerned over what she had in mind. \u201cYeah! I promise that nothing will end up getting broken.\u201d She states while raising her right hand up slightly and closing her eyes with a smile. You continue to stare at her quietly with a raised brow as she opens her eyes and lets out an awkward chuckle. \u201c\u2026or burnt.\u201d She quickly adds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A giddy squeal soon erupts from Kindle as she was clenching her upper paw hands in shear eagerness. \u201cThank you master!\u201d she shouts before quickly getting up and making her way down the small hallway of your apartment. \u201cH-hey! Your breakfast!\u201d you exclaim with a scowl, as she hurriedly return and stuffs the contents of her bowl straight into her mouth. \u201cDun!\u201d She says with cheeks stuffed like a content pachirisu before running off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple headshake and chuckle, you resume with your meal before finally getting up to place the empty dishes in the sink.

She soon stops before your couch before signaling with her snout for you to take a seat. With a small smile, you plant yourself down as she quickly moves the furniture about to form a small makeshift stage. \u201cAlright then!\u201d Kindle beams as she stands within the middle of the room, giving a rather proud pose with her trusty stick raised high in the air. \u201cNow presenting, the great KINDLE!\u201d she beams triumphantly as you couldn\u2019t help but give a small laugh and applaud to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then. I\u2019ll need a volunteer!\u201d she smiles while playfully gazing about the empty recesses of your apartment, taking several instances to gaze specifically at you. With a small roll of your eyes, you raise up your right hand as she gasps in sheer excitement. \u201cPerfect!\u201d She shouts as she rushes to you and quickly helps you on your feet. \u201cNow then my dear volunteer, all I\u2019ll need you to do is stand down there.\u201d She instructs while pointing at a rather empty space not too far from the walls. Heeding her words, you make your way towards the designated area before planting your feet firmly down upon the carpeted floor. \u201cExcellent!\u201d she beams while playfully twirling her wooden stick around. \u201cNow watch as the great Kindle works her powers!\u201d she exclaims with a huge grin as she positions the tip of her stick directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small nervous gulp runs down your throat as you were concerned if another accident might occur within your apartment. To your ultimate surprise however, nothing around seemed to be burning or falling off straight to the floor. As you gaze down at Kindle, it appeared like she was trying her best to concentrate as her hand holding the stick begins to shake lightly. \u201cErrr\u2026Kindle?\u201d You say with a raised confused brow. \u201cJ-Just\u2026a..second.\u201d she stammers as she begins to grunt and squint her eyes ever so slightly. It was obvious she was trying to do some sort of trick, though just what she was trying to perform was completely debatable. \u201cummm\u2026are you alright?\u201d you ask curiously as you were just about to move towards her. \u201cS-Stay Still!\u201d she shouts in a pleading tone as she continues to strain before you. Immediately, you cease any movement as she continues her odd actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to stand, your mind slowly begins to count down the passing seconds as Kindle continued to keep her ground. After around a minute and a half, the Braixen soon lets out a long grunt mixed with a gasp as she kneels down on her knees. \u201cKindle, are you alright?\u201d you ask as you finally manage to move your body towards her. \u201cI\u2026I thought it would work\u2026\u201d Kindle mutters in a disappointed tone as both of her hands rested upon her black furred knees. Her face soon contorts a bit as if she was almost on the verge of tears. \u201ch-hey now.\u201d you stammer before kneeling down to pat her on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure whatever you were trying to do would\u2019ve turned out great.\u201d You remark with a warm smile on your face. \u201cbut\u2026it was suppose to be just for you.\u201d She says with a deep saddened sigh. \u201cHey, don\u2019t beat yourself up.\u201d You retort while patting her shoulder once more. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to do it next-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to complete your sentence, a sudden odd force seemed to encompass your entire body. \u201cMaster?\u201d Kindle asks in a confused voice as she raises her head to gaze at you. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d As hard as you attempted to muster out a word from your mouth, your body suddenly begins to tense up. Your eyes quickly begin to scan about your surroundings feverishly as they soon focus solely upon Kindle\u2019s furred face. Once contact was made with her, a great sense of confusion and dread soon begins to course down your body as it almost appeared as if she was starting to grow right before you. A startled gasp quickly escapes her as a sudden grin forms on her face. \u201ci-it worked!\u201d she exclaims happily. \u2018Worked!?\u2019 you stammer in your head, unsure as to just what Kindle could\u2019ve done to you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After what seemed like a minute or so of constant shrinking, the effects slowly begin to wear off as you soon stood around half the size of one of her toes. \u201cIt worked!\u201d Kindle\u2019s voice echoes in a deep and thunderous tone as what sounded like a squeal of excitement echoes high above. The very volume of her now booming voice was enough to cause you to quickly cover your ears and clench your eyes shut in slight pain. And here you were thinking going to that one concert in the front row was the loudest thing in existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, how are you down there?\u201d Kindle asks as her loud voice was close to causing deafness in your ears. <br>\r\n\u201cK-KINDLE! NOT SO LOUD!\u201d You shout to the top of your lungs as you quickly clasp close your ears once again. Luckily, those massive ears on Kindle\u2019s ears manage to do their job as she quickly gives a gasp of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d She mutters in a whisper like tone while cupping the sides of her mouth with her furry hands. \u201cI got a little excited is all.\u201d She giggles as you begin to lower your hands down from your head. \u201cAwwww! Just look at how cute you are Master.\u201d She coos before placing both hands upon her cheeks in a flustered position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKindle\u2026j-just what did you do to me!?\u201d You shout completely shocked and utterly confused by her actions. \u201cWhy did you make me so small!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly toothy smirk soon draws upon Kindle\u2019s massive face as she lets out a louder giggle. \u201cIsn\u2019t it neat?\u201d she asks, as if completely disregarding your fazed attitude before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeat? You\u2019re the size of a gigantic monster compared to me!\u201d you retort as an irritated scowl quickly draws upon your face. Kindle was quickly taken aback by the response as she appeared to back up a couple inches in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2026you..you don\u2019t like it?\u201d She stutters completely dumbfounded. \u201cI\u2026I thought you would like being small for a bit master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike being small?\u201d you repeat growing confused by her supposed motives. \u201cW-What do you mean Kindle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026you always did like giant pokemon. Right Master?\u201d Kindle asks while gently cocking her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well\u2026sorta.\u201d You reluctantly admit while averting your eyes elsewhere. When it came to your deepest secret regarding size fascination, the only other being alive, besides you, with such knowledge just happened to be Kindle herself. Being a devoted Braixen, she crossed her heart that she would keep this whole fascination a secret from everyone you knew. To this day, she still manages to keep that dark fantasy hidden away from the ears of the public. \u201cIs\u2026that why you decided to shrink me?\u201d you ask piecing together the mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDing Ding Ding.\u201d Kindle replies giddily while giving a light applause to follow. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to improve my psychic powers for the past couple of weeks in order to help create my own personal shrinking spell!\u201d she beams with a finger pointed in a matter-of-fact manner. \u201cLuckily Those socks managed to be the best practice item.\u201d She chuckles softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026you used my socks!?\u201d You stammer in complete surprise. Here you were wondering just what happened to every pair of sock you owned in the house. You would never have guessed they were being used as test subjects for Kindle\u2019s little experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErrr\u2026\u201d Kindle\u2019s eyes widen as a stupefied expression takes up her face. \u201c\u2026So, how do you like it?\u201d she quickly asks, hoping you didn\u2019t manage to catch her last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026different.\u201d You admit knowing full well that Kindle was going to get a talking to later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a good or bad?\u201d She asks with a head tilt to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomewhere inbetween.\u201d You reply still unsure what to make of being so tiny. While you were always fascinated in the idea of ginormous pokemon, truth be told, you would never have guessed that your very own Braixen would be the one to shrink you. As you take a moment to look upon your new vantage point, a great shadow suddenly begins to cast over you as Kindle slowly kneels downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026since you\u2019re so small now, how about we have some fun master?\u201d Kindle asks beaming a large excited smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fun?\u201d you ask bewildered and a bit awkwardly. \u201cJ-Just what is considered fun Kindle?\u201d you stammer, unsure just what your now ginormous Braixen had in mind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Knowing too well that Kindle had the upper hand in this debate in both size and tactics, you ultimately decide to play along with her so-called game. \u201cAlright Kindle. Just what game do you have in mind?\u201d you reluctantly ask, dreading just what could possibly be brewing in that huge head of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell~\u201d Kindle states in a playful, lighthearted tone as she uses her fingers to twirl her stick in a slow speed. \u201cI was thinking\u2026since you\u2019re so small now, how about we try playing-\u201c<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A loud suction noise resonates from within her mouth as her jaws begin to part even more further, giving you a good view of the fleshy tunnel within. \"You know...Braixen's can't use flamethrower with their maw.\" you jest lightly thinking it was just some act of hers. \"So I wouldn't try and-\" As if to retort your statement, kindle unleashes a mighty exhale from her mouth, as her lips begin to purse. The impact felt almost like you were being hit by a gust attack from a stray pidgey as your tiny body begins to tumble down the carpeted floor towards the back end of the living room furniture piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree or four tumbles after the blast, the dark confines of the shadowed couch bottom disappears as you were soon out in the open. Dizzied, you carefully attempt to stand up on your feet as your brain wracked about in your skull. Upon giving a quick head shake, you once again find yourself cast under another shadow, one you weren't hoping to encounter. \"What were you saying Master?\" Kindle asks as he hands were besides her hips in an almost spunky like position. \"Errr...\" you murmur, seeing as how the massive Braixen was now but a few yards away from your position. \"Oh come on! T-That's not fair!\" you shout seeing as how escape was a complete impossibility now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKindle simply giggles at your cry as she soon kneels down to a crouch. \"Looks like I win~\" she boasts as her white furred hand immediately stretches out towards you. Her huge fingers quickly coil around you like an ekans to a ratata as your body was soon suspended upwards towards her beaming face. A giggle emerges from the giddy fox as she closes her eyes blissfully. \"Now...\" she begins as if attempting to imitate some sort of television narrator. \"The tiny human is now at the mercy of Kindle-Zilla!\" \"unfortunately...\" you groan under your breath, not sharing the same exuberance as her. \"Just what will Kindle-zilla do now?\" she asks, as one of her fangs protruded out from her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ermmm...let the human go and assist mankind and pokemon alike?\" you reply meekly as Kindle simply chortles at your suggestion. \"Silly master.\" She says returning back to her normal voice. \"Monster's don't do that.\" she giggles. \"You remember what they do in the movies don't you?\" \"that...depends on what movie's you're talking about.\" you answer as a feeling of dread begins to befall you. \"Well~\" Kindle's smile starts to grow, as if anticipating this part of her game. \"Monsters usually crush people.\" she says while gazing down and looking down at her black furred feet. As if to put emphasis on her words, her right leg begins to raise upwards as her three toes wiggle playfully below. \"That-\"<br>\r\nshe adds before placing her foot back down on the floor and pulling you closer to her snout. \"and they eat them too.\" She finishes as her mouth soon begins to open wide, releasing a blast of her warm fruity breath before your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're joking!\" you stutter in horror as your back was as far away from the Braixen's huge pink maw. \"Am I?\" Kindle asks with the mischievous grin on her face. \"This isn't funny anymore Kindle!\" you shout, nervous that the whole power, size idea has gotten straight into her head. \"I could get seriously hurt you know!?\" Kindle gives off another light laugh as she pulls you even closer towards her snout, to the point that you were almost touching the tip of her nose. \"Oh come on Master. trust me on this.\" she insists with the same giddiness as when you first shrunk. \"Besides, I already thought of what to do.\" she boasts. \"That doesn't help make me anymore calmer!\" you retort with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKindle couldn't help but snicker at your alarmed state as she soon begins-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As her lips began to part, a great gust of her warm fruit scented breath blasts head on at you. Below you was the pink confines of her mouth, consisting of her slightly sharp fangs and her wriggling tongue behind the lower stalagmites. \"Kindle! cut it out!\" you shout in utter annoyance now struggling about in her furred hands. \"This isn't funny anymore! put me down!\" you order as Kindle simply gives a light giggle in response to your futile escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Master, we're still playing~\" she speaks in a sing song voice, before pulling you even closer to her mouth. \"Besides, Kindlezilla won this round, so kindlezilla gets to do as she wants.\" she adds in a matter of fact tone before soon opening her mouth once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kindle! I swear if you don't-\" Your words were soon cut short as your Braixen simply shoves you straight into her maw with a chortle. Inside the depths of the slimy cavern, you immediately shudder at the odd slimy texture of her tongue as it quickly lifts your lower half upwards towards the center of the muscle. \"Kindle!\" you shout in utter annoyance as your whole world soon begins to turn about from the motions of her tongue below. Helpless, you find yourself tossed all about the squishy surface of her mouth, from the inner sides of her cheeks to the roof of her mouth. all the while listening to your pokemon letting out satisfied murrs and giggles of giddiness. \"k-Kindle!\" you try to call out once more as the motions of her tongue ride made it nearly impossible to string a coherent sentence together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a minute, or so you believed, of nonstop bouncing about, the motions soon begin to die off as you lie limply upon the saliva coated muscle completely disoriented. \"Just wait until I get out...\" you mumble under your breath before suddenly feeling the tongue make one good gesture upwards.

You barely had time to recognize it was the ceiling by the time you started sliding backwards down the slimy tongue to the back of her throat. \"K-Kindle!\" Was all you managed to yell before a massive gulp rippled all around you and pulled you to the entrance of her esophagus. You slowed down for a brief second before another gulp resonated around you, starting your descent down her throat. Flesh pulsated around you as peristalsis slowly transported you down to her stomach, the sound of Kindle's heartbeat getting gradually louder and intermixing with the sounds of wet muscle rubbing against your body. You feel your feet press against something before it opens up, dropping you with a splash into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to comprehend what just happened, you just sit there in her belly dumbfounded. Kindle just ate you. The smell of her stomach was extremely sharp and bitter, but had the faint scent of the berries she likes to eat. You even think there's still some down here as your foot presses against something squishy in the hot, humid chamber. The cacophony of sound all around you drove home that you were deep inside the body of your Pokemon. Strange, wet squelching noises surrounded you as the fleshy walls of her stomach shifted and her digestive system did its thing, her heartbeat drumming away up above. You jump as you hear a muffled voice. \"Oh, Master, you're so tasty!\" The stomach walls shift and compress slightly as she rubs her belly. \"A worthy snack for Kindlezilla!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"K-Kindle?\" You meekly call out. You never thought for a second that Kindle would do anything to harm you, but sitting there coated in her digestive juices you were actually having second thoughts. When you get no reply you call out again while pushing against the slimy stomach wall. \"Kindle!\" After several seconds with no reply you realized she probably couldn't hear you down here. You lay back onto the soft walls of her stomach. You had actually fantasized about being in the belly of a giant Pokemon from time to time but you never expected it to actually happen. It filled you mixture of conflicting emotions. You kind of liked the sensations and sounds as her stomach caressed you in a careful dance of ultimate dominance, but the sense of impending doom from the thought of being digested was overpowering.  In an attempt to get her attention you push yourself hard against her stomach, eliciting a moan from Kindle that reverberated all around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun in there, Master?\" She cooed as you felt her rub her belly again. \"Don't worry, I'll get you out of there before you turn to Kindle food!\" You start to slide about her stomach as she shifts about, her giggling echoing up above you. With the combination of heat, humidity and physical effort to not fall face first into a pool of digestive acid you were becoming extremely tired. You only hoped she would get you out of here soon.</span></div></div>",

The whole ordeal of getting eaten was... Interesting to say the least. The complete dominance Kindle had over you, the adrenaline rush from literally being eaten alive, the strange fleshy environment. You could feel fear as your instincts scream at you but for the most part it was overshadowed by the overpowering sense of awe from being inside your beloved Pokemon's body. Saying that, though, you couldn't stay here forever. As if to support that point the fleshy walls around you contracted and let out a long, drawn out groan. \"Yeah, I think that's for the best!\" You yell out to Kindle. You could swear the puddle of acids at the bottom of her stomach was rising a little bit as another gurgle sounded out. It was as if her stomach finally realized that there was 'food' in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it!\" Kindle cheerfully sung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how, exactly, are you planning on getting me out of here?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psychic!\" She exclaims as a dim flickering light illuminates the slimy cavern. For the first time you could actually see your surroundings as the psychic energy reflected off the slick interior. The walls were constantly shifting and the pool of acids and digesting food at the bottom of her stomach looked exactly like it felt. Gross. The flickering light dissipated and appeared in a different area of the stomach directly above a juicy piece of fruit. It rose in the air for a little bit before it splashed back down, splattering you with bits of berry mush. Brushing it off, you continued to sit in the sweltering heat as she levitates random bits of food and acids around you. The sharp air was getting more and more difficult to breath in so you spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay up there, Kindle?\" You speak out as you push against her gut. \"Kinda getting digested here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" She bellowed triumphantly as the flickering light suddenly enveloped your body. A massive rush of vertigo overtakes you as you slowly float upwards until you hit the top of her stomach. As your body got pushed against the fleshy ceiling it felt like it just suddenly opened up and you found yourself getting pushed through it. As you drifted up her esophagus you feared that you were going to just drop back down as Kindle fought with her gag reflex. Thankfully, you kept going up and eventually you could see light again as you exited her throat and arrived back in her mouth. As she breathed in you jumped as the cool air hit your skin, the room temperature air feeling like an arctic breeze after being trapped in her boiling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long a pair of white paws plucked you out of the giant Braixen's mouth. You tried to adjust your eyes to the light as Kindle coughed and spluttered. \"That was so gross!\" She whined. \"I think I'm gonna get heartburn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor you.\" Was all you could manage to say as you leaned back against her fingers trying to recuperate. As she used her free hand to wipe her face clean her eyes rested down at you before she broke into a huge grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pink!\" Kindle exclaimed. She was right, looking down your skin was completely pink, obviously irritated by the corrosive stomach acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I'm not just a skeleton right now.\" You playfully jab back at her. Looking around, Kindle had thankfully thought to bring you to kitchen sink so you could get washed off. You could hear the tap stir to life as she turned one of the handles, drops of water falling down into the plugged sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what was it like getting eaten by Kindlezilla?\" She said as she grinned down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was pretty cool.\" You say without thinking. A blush makes your face in pinker as you realized you just confessed that you enjoyed being eaten by your Pokemon as Kindle looks down at you in obvious amusement. \"W-well, it was kind of scary at first but since it was <i>you</i> that ate me I knew you wouldn't just leave me in there, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKindle giggles as she turns the tap and stops the flow of water. You could swear you see her also blushing underneath her fur. \"Thank you!\" She said as she lowered you down into the sink. \"I think we better clean those juices off you before you melt, though.\" Slowly she eased you down into the cool water as the cool water washed over you. Kindle had left the tap on long enough so that the water came up to your waist allowing you to fully submerge your body as you sat down, letting you purify yourself of the clinging residue from her stomach. You continued bathing for a while as Kindle lovingly stared at you from above as she leaned over the sink. \"Feeling refreshed, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Much</i> better. The cool water's a nice change compared to your belly\" You say as you continue relaxing. \"It was like a sauna cranked up to a hundred!\" Your body was slowly returning to it's naturally colored state and you surprisingly found that your skin was very smooth. \"And I think the stomach acids actually burned away all the dead skin or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could open up my very own spa!\" She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you took out the risk of the customers being added to your waist-line I'm sure you would be very popular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself relax into the cool water for a little bit longer before you signal to your Braixen to pick you up. \"So, what do you wanna do now, Master?\" Kindle asked as she raised you up to her face. The whole 'being eaten' ordeal had left you feeling a bit tired. Since she is asking you could probably think of some other shrunken shenanigans to do, but having a nice sleep in her soft fur also sounds really appealing right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

I'm just walking is all.\" Kindle replies quickly to your relief as her booming voice practically echoes from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you heading to the sink?\" You ask, as your hopes begin to rise by the sudden thought of being freed. \"Atta girl! Just head right to the kitchen and-\" \"And get me a quick Snack!\" She interjects in an almost sing-song like voice. \"A...quick snack?\" You repeat, stupefied by her sudden cut in your words. \"K-Kindle! This is no time to be thinking of food! Let alone with me being inside of your stomach right now!\" You add, spewing out the words in a flustered tone as the surrounding soon begins to calm down slightly, no doubt due to her ceasing with her strides. \"Oh come on Master! It's been hours since we ate breakfast and I'm hungry.\" She states in a voice where you could only imagine a pout emerge on her lips. As if to prove her hunger was true, an almost defeaning roar sounds off around you causing the slimy walls to quickly wiggle and writhe. \"See!? Even my belly agrees with me. Besides, you still sound fine in there.\" She murmurs in a nonchalant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kindle! I'm serious! You better let me out right this minute!\" You shout, as your rage was starting to get the best of you. \"If you don't, I swear you'll never!-\" Once again your words were cut short as an almost melodic tune was soon being hummed above, as Kindle was no doubt perusing about the fridge for a meal. \"Let's see....canned meat? Yek! Whipped cream?...hmmm...maybe~ AH! Here we are!\" She beams, causing you to gaze up at the high sphincter leading to her throat. \"Kindle?...what do you have with you?\" You grumble both nervous and enraged that she deliberately ignored your words. Past the opening, an echoing *GULP* Resonates as you slowly start to back up, unsure just what your Braixen was sending down. Your curiosity was soon answered as a small Berry, to her at least, slides its way down and plops right into the digestive juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh! Kindle!\" You growl as you swipe some of the excess droplets caused by the splash. \"Mmhhh Mmhhh Mhmm!~\" Kindle beams. \"I think I might have a few more.\" She says aloud. \"Wha? Kindle don't! If you do, I might be buried underneath all these berries!\" You quickly intervene. The only question was whether she would listen to reason, or her own hunger?</span></div></div>",

While there really were no records of crimes occurring at night within your town, with all the stray Pok\u00e9mon wandering about, you definitely didn\u2019t want to take any chances staying out too long. After several minutes of jogging down the lamp lit sidewalks of your neighborhood, you finally manage to enter within your humble home. \u201cFinally.\u201d You mutter under your breath while giving out a long sigh. \u201cI really got to stop going out so late.\u201d You murmur to yourself before gazing down the dark recesses of your hallway. Amidst the darkness, two bright red eyes orbs soon emerge at the far end of the dark abyss, slowly inching their way closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the sight of the gleaming orbs was enough to make the strongest of men faint in shear terror, you were all too familiar with this sight. With a small chuckle, you reach your right hand out towards the nearest wall to flip a switch. With the sound of a click, the whole entryway illuminated revealing your ever so loyal Ninetales walking straight towards you. \u201cNine!\u201d she cries out in a happy tone, no doubt glad you were back home. \u201cHey there Zoey.\u201d You chortle before kneeling down to receive a loving nuzzle from the nine tailed vulpine. As you begin to scratch behind Zoey\u2019s furry ears, an audible murr emerges from her throat as she lays her head against your wrist. \u201cSorry it took a while to get here.\u201d You say in an apologetic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine master.\u201d The voice of a young woman, about 18 or so emanates nearby. If there was one thing that made Zoey stand out from the other Pok\u00e9mon you knew, it was her unique psychic abilities. While Zoey couldn\u2019t speak like a normal human, she was more than capable of talking telepathically to humans. When you first discovered her unique ability years ago, to say you were startled was a complete understatement. Over time though, you managed to get used to it and even chat with her as if she was a human friend. \u201cSo why did you take so long to get back here?\u201d Zoey asks as she retracts her head and tilts it in a curious fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026you know.\u201d You reply while awkwardly shrugging your shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve just been busy and all.\u201d You admit trying to hide the truth of your uncertainty outside. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it was the work that was long\u2026and not the trip home?\u201d Zoey asks as a small smile creeps on her face. \u201cwha?\u201d you stammer with surprised eyes. \u201cYou came running on home again\u2026right?\u201d she asks with a rather smug look on her face. \u201cI wasn\u2019t running.\u201d You retort with an irritated scowl growing on your face. \u201cThen how do you explain coming home and breathing so heavily?\u201d Zoey counters as she extends her neck towards you. \u201cHey, it can be dangerous out alone, okay?\u201d you reply with a long annoyed sigh. \u201cOh come on now! You\u2019re just being paranoid is all.\u201d Zoey says with a giggle to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, or maybe not. I\u2019m just glad to be home.\u201d You sigh while rising up to give a small stretch. \u201cSo, what will you be doing tonight?\u201d she asks while following you into the kitchen. \u201cGood question.\u201d You reply while rummaging through the cabinets for a bag of chips to snack on. \u201cMaybe eat a bit and get some sleep.\u201d You shrug while digging into the bag to pull out a handful of chips. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to go on that\u2026Computer tonight?\u201d Zoey asks curiously, as she watches you munch away. \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2026why?\u201d you ask while gulping down the contents in your mouth. \u201cWell\u2026you usually look at those pictures of giant people and Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d Zoey states, nearly causing you to choke on your small meal. \u201cW-what are you talking about!?\u201d you stammer, shocked that Zoey would be able to know about such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know? The pictures of the huge humans and Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s.\u201d She repeats again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d You immediately retort as you place the bag back in the cabinet. \u201cOh come on now Master! You can\u2019t lie to me.\u201d Zoey states as she approaches you. Your blood nearly freezes as the secret fascination you\u2019ve been hiding for years was now uncovered thanks to you\u2019re very own Pok\u00e9mon companion. \u201cI knew it!\u201d she shouts with a smile, managing to make you jump up a bit. \u201cJust by that look on your face I can tell you\u2019re lying.\u201d Zoey says in a confident tone. \u201cListen. Don\u2019t tell anybody, alright?\u201d you mutter, hoping that Zoey wouldn\u2019t blurt out this secret to the whole town. \u201cYour secret\u2019s safe with me Master.\u201d She says before proudly raising her head up and nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough\u2026why are you so nervous about it?\u201d she asks before lowering her head and cocking it to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026not a normal thing.\u201d You vaguely answer, unsure just how you would be able to fully explain it to her. \u201cWell\u2026Giant Pok\u00e9mon and Humans aren\u2019t normal things.\u201d She admits with a giggle, promptly causing you to let out a small chuckle. \u201cThough\u2026 I do think it\u2019s pretty neat.\u201d She admits to your utter surprise. \u201cWait\u2026what?\u201d you stammer, taken aback by her sudden comment. \u201cI said the whole giant thing is pretty neat.\u201d She repeats while gazing up at you. \u201cI mean, it almost reminds me of those monster movies we watch now and then.\u201d She adds with a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey\u2019s words came as a complete surprise to you. Never before did you think you\u2019re own Ninetales would find interest in size changing. \u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re not weirded out by it?\u201d you ask growing more surprised by the second. \u201cNuh-uh.\u201d Zoey shakes her head. \u201cI mean, it does sound really fun.\u201d She giggles. \u201cFun?\u201d You repeat dumbfounded. \u201cYeah! Like, me wandering about as some ginormous Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d She chuckles before walking about with long strides, as if roleplaying a scenario. \u201cI would look down at all the small humans and Pok\u00e9mon, and\u2026Heh! I don\u2019t even know what next.\u201d She laughs as her head was lowered to the ground, as if she was actually gazing down at a tiny town. A small laugh escapes your mouth as well as a blush from the reenactment. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would be an interesting giant Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d You reply as she raises her head to prance towards you. \u201cWell\u2026Maybe I can be.\u201d She says with a grin on her face. \"Can...be?\" You stammer gazing down at her with bewilderment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To your surprise however, Zoey begins to join in on the bout of laughter. \u201cWho said I would grow?\u201d she asks as her crimson eyes seemingly pierce through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Come again?\u201d you ask as your small laugh gets cuts off by the retort. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about me growing.\u201d She says with a light giggle as her four legs slowly prance their way towards you. \u201cI\u2019m talking about you being small!\u201d She states as her giggle soon turns into a small laugh. Upon hearing that statement, a deep shade of red begins to draw upon your cheeks as your heart rate quickly begins to race. Could Zoey really have a means of making you tiny sized? A dream you\u2019ve been fantasizing before your computer screen for years now? \u201cA-and just how would you be able to do that?\u201d you ask as a normal neighborhood dweller would to some random telemarketer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud burst of laughter soon escapes Zoey as she watches your nervous and suspicious state before her. \u201cMy, you seem to really like the idea Master.\u201d She says between bouts of breath. \u201cI mean, why else would you be asking so much?\u201d she asks to your upmost embarrassment. \u201cW-well\u2026\u201d you begin while gently averting your eyes to the kitchen tiles. \u201cIt does sound interesting.\u201d You reply clumsily. Zoey\u2019s laugh continues for a brief few moments before she finally raises her head to gaze at you. \u201cWell, since you\u2019re so curious.\u201d She smirks as a sudden odd sensation begins to freeze your body in place. \u201cWha?\u201d you mutter as you felt your entire form incapable of moving any joints or muscles about. With wide eyes, you immediately begin to notice that you were slowly rising from the floor ever so slightly. \u201cI am a psychic Pok\u00e9mon you know?\u201d Zoey asks as you gaze upon her now glowing, illuminous orbs. In a mere second or so, you soon regain control of your body as your two feet cause a small \u2018Thud\u2019 to erupt from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint taken.\u201d You reply as you try to regain a calm composure from the event. \u201cbut\u2026just how will you\u2019re psychic powers make me small?\u201d you ask, growing more weary of her so called idea. Immediately, Zoey makes her way right up to your open hand to and lowers her head to nuzzle against it. \u201cTrust me master.\u201d She says in a tone both cheery yet warm. The blush on your face only manages to grow a shade deeper seeing as how Zoey really did seem willing to carry out your fantasy. \u201cF-fine, alright then.\u201d You say with a small nervous sigh, trying your best to hide your inner giddiness from her. \u201cBut might I ask why you\u2019re doing this?\u201d you ask curiously. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Zoey giggles as she retracts her head from your hand. \u201cI\u2019m doing it for you master.\u201d She answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great waft of appreciation and sheer joy rushes through your body as you kneel down to ruffle the top of her head. \u201cThanks Zoey.\u201d You reply sincerely as a huge warm smile forms on your face. \u201cThat\u2026and I thought it would be fun.\u201d Zoey adds with a small laugh immediately causing you to join in. \u201cRight Master.\u201d Zoey says as the small light moment ended. \u201cI\u2019ll need you to remain standing in place while I do my work.\u201d She instructs as you eagerly nod back in reply. \u201cRoger.\u201d You call out as you watch her walk a few yards further down the kitchen\u2019s interior. \u201cAlright then\u2026\u201d Zoey smiles as her red eyes slowly begin to glow, emitting a bright, dazzling aura. \u201cHere we go!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her crimson orbs glittered violently as if hypnotizing your mind briefly. As you stand in a dumbfounded state, what seemed like a small gale soon starts to form around you. The strength of the wind only seemed to increase with each passing moment. Soon enough, the sudden power of her psychic force ends up being so great that you had to stagger back a bit from a sudden release of her energy. As you quickly manage to recollect yourself from the sudden pushback, the red tint within Zoey\u2019s eyes quickly shifts the entire room a scarlet almost foreboding tone. A low growl emanates within her throat before she soon releases out her common pokemon cry in a determined if not fierce tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden red flash soon overtakes your vision before everything soon shifts into a pure white. One nanosecond later and the bright hue immediately vanishes and is replaced by a pitch-black tone. Time somehow freezes, as you can\u2019t seem to feel your limbs within this strange void. While consciousness was still enabled within this strange state, you can\u2019t seem to comprehend just where you were let alone what just occurred. After what seemed like minutes of pure silence, a faint voice begins to resonate around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster?\u201d a faint voice calls out in an almost whisper like volume. \u201cMaster.\u201d The voice repeats once more, with a bit more clarity. The tone and manner of speech was unmistakable. The voice calling out was none other than Zoey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoey?\u201d you mutter in a drowsy tone as the darkness surrounding you slowly begins to fade into light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster. Can you hear me?\u201d Zoey asks once more in an obviously concerned tone. The great light manages to cause a groan to escape your form as the white hue blinds your vision momentarily. After a second or two, your eyes slowly begin to adjust as blurry colors soon begin to form before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNghhh...uhh\u2026wha?\u201d you murmur, confused by what just occurred. A couple of experimental blinks soon return your sight, as you found yourself gazing up at what appeared to be the ceiling of your kitchen. \u201cZoey?\u201d you mutter as you slowly try to move your arms about. Your whole body seemed to be rather numb from the odd experience. A slight tingle resonates within some muscles of your limbs, though not too much to cause pain to radiate about. With a few experimental movements, you soon manage to rise up in a sitting position before placing your right hand upon your forehead. \u201cughhh\u2026what happened?\u201d you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, are you alright?\u201d Zoey\u2019s voice asks within the recesses of your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, I\u2019m good Zoey.\u201d You reply as you give a small groan.<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness! I thought something terrible happened.\u201d She says following it up with a relieved sigh. \u201cI was afraid I might\u2019ve used too much of my power on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo much of your power?\u201d you stammer before raising your head up to look about. \u201cWhat do you-\u201c A loud gasp quickly escapes your mouth as your vision shifts towards the left of your position. Before you was what seemed like a building size paw connected to a massive cream furred leg the size of a skyscraper. As your head ascends upwards, your mouth begins to drop in shock as you find yourself before Zoey\u2019s now ginormous form. \u201cH-Holy!-\u201c you stammer scrambling back in sheer shock from her new size. \u201cZ-Zoey\u2026\u201d you stutter. \u201cy-you\u2019re!-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuge?\u201d her voice asks in a somewhat cheery attitude. \u201cYes. Seems like my psychic powers did manage to shrink you down quite a bit.\u201d She states with a small giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-So it seems.\u201d You reply back, still taken aback by what was occurring before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo master...\u201d Zoey says as her huge vulpine head slowly begins to descend until her snout was yards above your form. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I think?\u201d you mutter. \u201cI\u2026I think this is amazing!\u201d you admit promptly causing a small laugh to escape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d She states in a wholehearted voice. \u201cNow\u2026since your tiny sized, is there anything you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything I have in mind?\u201d you ask taken aback by her question. \u201cw-what do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you HAVE been fantasizing about being small before a pok\u00e9mon.\u201d She replies with a smile on her face. \u201cSo now\u2019s your opportunity to try whatever you want on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last comment causes a deep blush to form on your face as you take a brief moment to avert your eyes to the tiled floors. \u201cA-Are you sure about this Zoey?\u201d you stammer. \u201cI-I mean, I don\u2019t want you to do something you don\u2019t want to.\u201d While the idea of getting to do what you always wanted to do at such a tiny size did sound amazing, you couldn\u2019t help but feel a twinge of guilt seeing as how you were about to try it on your good nine tailed companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with it Master.\u201d Zoey replies as her head gives a small nod in response. \u201cBesides\u2026I\u2019m curious to see just what you have planned.\u201d She giggles causing the blush on your face to grow deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well\u2026.if you say so.\u201d You reply before turning your eyes back up to her and nodding. \u201cOkay then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, so what does my little master have in plan?\u201d she asks as the massive tails behind her slowly begin to wag happily..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nobody would be able to resist to this chilly atmosphere, but this just gives you the perfect excuse to cuddle up with your nice, warm pokemon, Victini, a blanket wrapped around your bodies as you sit on the couch, petting her ears, making her purr in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou met her many years ago, in a lonely forest you were casually getting through. She literally crashed into you trying to get away from a Zangoose that was chasing her. She hid behind you, shaking just like you. You had to run all the way out of the forest, Victini hanging to your shoulder while you ran for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of that forest, she refused to let go of the 'human who saved me' and you simply decided to bring her home with you. You've been living together since then. A quiet murr brings you back on the couch.<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying this, aren't you?\" you ask playfully. She nods with energy, smiling happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle.<br>\r\n\"I can tell you're enjoying yourself as well, master.\" she retorts with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Can't deny it.\" you reply, sending her into giggling, high pitched sounds threatening your ears. Just like always after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pokemon returns to relax after a bit, snuggling closer to you.<br>\r\nYou yawn.<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to take a nap, Victini.\" you say, while stopping your petting.<br>\r\n\"Awwww.\" she whines for the lack of fingers stroking her furry ears. You give a small chuckle before relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only noise you can hear is the storm outside. Instinctively, you hug your pokemon. The last thing you hear before blacking out is an excited whisper.<br>\r\n\"Sleep tight master. When you wake up, you'll feel completely different.\"a giggle follows the sentence, before you drift off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up many hours later. Rubbing your eyes, you yawn.<br>\r\n\"That was a good rest.\" you whisper, stirring. Your couch seems softer than before, but you don't think much about it. At least, not until you find out Victini is no longer on your lap. You can still feel her comforting warmth emanating from somewhere near your body. Inspecting around, you notice, to your great surprise, that you've been laying all the time...</span></div></div>",

The path to your house is a bit wet but nothing that isn't manageable. With a bag holding two bowls of ramen in tow, you grab your house keys out of your pocket and unlock the doors to your house. It clicks and opens as you step inside the already lit up house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cborange\">You're home!</span>\" A cheerful voice can be heard across the house, who you can only assume is Cinderace. You see Cinderace run towards you, as she hug tackles you. She doesn't knock you down though the force of the hug does knock you back a bit. Funny, she's about eye level to your chest but she is pretty good at making up for that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great to be back, though I wish I was back sooner. Got held out at work today.\" You laugh, \"I got some ramen for an easy dinner tonight if that's alright with you.\" Cinderace lets go of her hug on you and nods her head. \"Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes no time at all to get the ramen ready. All it really needs to do is set while the boiled water does its work. \"I'm going to freshen up a bit,\" You tell Cinderace, as you head to the bathroom. A simple wash of the face and hands, plus a change of clothing into some pajamas, and you're all set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, looks like the bowls are already done and Cinderace is eating hers at the table. You grab yours and join Cinderace at the table. Huh, the ramen tastes a bit... funny. Maybe they changed the flavor of it or added a new ingredient? Either way, both you and Cinderace finish off the food, and sit on a couch by the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cborange\">So comfy...</span>\" Cinderace leans on you, resting her head on your arm like a pillow. It's honestly quite cute. Eyes going heavy, you feel like going to sleep as well, but then you feel something. You don't now how to describe it other than... something. Maybe it was the ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's probably nothing,</i> you think as you begin to try and clock out again, but that feeling wont go away. Wait, does Cinderace feel a bit heavier? It feels like Cinderace is leaning on you more and more. You look at your shoulder to see that Cinderace is now equal to your size, if not bigger. What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinderace.\" Shaking the bunny awake, you notice that you <b>are</b> getting smaller. She groggily lifts her head up off of you. She looks at you, and jumps in surprise at your new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cborange\">Oh wow, that stuff works fast!</span>\" Cinderace says in surprise. Wait, stuff? \"<span class=\"cborange\">You probably have questions... Here.</span>\" She lifts you up onto her lap, just like how you did when she was a Scorbunny. In fact, you are probably the size of one right now. \"<span class=\"cborange\">So while you were gone to work, I decided to go snooping a bit in your room.

Like always, I had been dreaming about being shrunk to an inch tall and at the mercy of a female Pokemon. This time, my mistress was a Gardevior who was especially playful with her mouth. My entire dream was centered around her torturing me with her tongue and ended with her swallowing my small form. But this dream wasn't a bad one for me, in fact I loved it. I've always had a shrinking fetish and loved the idea of being kept by a giant female Pokemon of any kind. The only thing I didn't like about my dreams was that the Pokemon never seemed to care about me and only kept me as a personal toy, and the fact that they never used their feet on me, I really love feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't realize that Dewott had special plans for me when I had fallen asleep. I was totally confused in my groggy state, it felt like I was drunk. When I looked around and saw that everything was huge, I thought I was hallucinating. It wasn't until the groggy feeling left me when I realized I had been shrunk. I didn't have time to marvel at the giant world around me, because a large black hand gripped me instantly. I was lifted into the air in a sickening rush and I felt like I was gonna throw up. Eventually, my vision was filled with the sight of Dewott, except she was like a hundred times bigger. \"How are you feeling?\" She asked concerned. I completely missed the fact that she was speaking english and answered, \"Uh fine.\" She sighed, relieved because she thought I had been harmed in some way. She was always so protective of me. \"Um... what happened to me?\" I asked stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewott smiled, \"I made your dreams come true.\" She said happily. \"What makes you think this is my dream?\" I asked, trying to act oblivious. \"Oh don't try to act dumb, I know you have a shrinking fetish. I've you seen you looking at your Xtransiever scrolling through stories about giant female Pokemon who torture their shrunken trainers with their feet, butt, mouth, for some: boobs, and even um... \"making love\".\" She finished awkwardly, she was always shy about that topic. \"Well because you were so interested in the stories, I thought I would help you make your own.\" She says in a mock flirty tone. I smiled the biggest smile I have ever smiled in my life. I couldn't believe Dewott could somehow shrink me and did it just to make me happy. She was way too good to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewott's face took on a serious look for a moment. \"While I'm doing this, I refuse to be cruel to you. I will be playing with you plenty, but I would never dream of hurting you. If I ever do start hurting you, please tell me.\" She finished. Her playful look from earlier returned to her face. \"Now, since I'm doing this for you I'll let you decide what I do to you first. But after that, I do what I want. So what do you wanna do?\" She asks playfully. \"Do you want me to grind you between my feet? Shove you up my butt and make you lick? Do you wanna play around in my mouth with my tongue? I'll even do... that thing if you really want me to.\" She added shyly. What do you want Dewott to do to you first?</span></div></div>",

I'll try my best to not swallow you, but if I start to go overboard with all this... Try to tell me, and I'll spit you out. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping a tight grip on my body, my Dewott moves me towards her mouth, slowly parting her jaws. I gaze into the fleshy interior of her mouth, plenty big enough to fit me inside. I also glance at the white fangs lining it... And suddenly start to feel worried. What if she does go overboard? What if she swallows me? If I'm dead, I can't enjoy this experience at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly shout for my Dewott to stop, and she pauses. Her mouth closes, and she raises me up to her eyes again as she stares at me in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uh... I'm not so sure about this anymore,\" I stammer. \"You're sure you won't eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dewott smiles gently, and quickly moves me towards her mouth. Her tongue slips from between her lips and gives my face a long, slimy lick. I cough and splutter, looking into her huge eyes in fear that this action means she will indeed eat me. However, on the contrary, she states the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm not gonna eat you. Trust me, you don't even taste good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it means you won't die from this,\" my Dewott says, smiling widely. I can't help but feel nervous from the fangs that show when she smiles. \"So, ready to go inside my mouth now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be risky, but it would also be a very interesting and unique experience.

Unlike your family before you, who mainly stuck to land and fished Magikarp and the occasional Feebas, you like to go into the far sea to get your catch with you ever trustful partner Lapras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your Lapras go back when you were just a child, learning the ropes of fishing. Your dad had won it at a fishing competition, and wanted you to have her. At first, you were scared of her, since of how big and intimidating she was, but over the years, you learned that she was kind and protective like a mother. Soon, you two were inseparable, going out and catching fish on the wild blue yonder, bonding with each new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was just like any other day, you woke up, had some breakfast, said good morning to Lapras and fed her, and went to grab some fishing supplies. After grabbing your supplies, you go to Lapras, who already finished her food, as you give her a rub on the head and smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell yah, with how much we've been catching lately, we could be on the right track to catching a Kyogre.\" You chuckle, boarding your supplies onto Lapras' back. You do some last second checks, making sure Lapras isn't injured anywhere, when you notice something weird poking out of Lapras' mouth. \"Hm? What'cha got there Lapras?\" You ask, as she places the object onto your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the object quizzically. It's some sort of thin needle with a purple hue on it. As you go to pocket it, you accidentally prick yourself with it. <i>Ouch!</i> You thought, <i>Hopefully this thing is isn't poisonous.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug it off and proceed to hop onto Lapras's back, but all you jump on is the wooded dock, which seems to be extended. In fact, you notice that you're not even close to the edge of the dock anymore. You look up to see Lapras looking down at you, but she is huge, almost the size of a cruise ship, or maybe it's that you have shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Huh, so that's what it does.</span>\" Lapras says in a soft, mellow, female voice. It's like if buttercream became an accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lapras? What happened to me, and how are you able to talk?\" You stammer, a bit flustered. You don't want to admit it, but ever since you've gotten used to being around Lapras, you always liked the feeling of being around something bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I shrunk you, but don't worry about it. I know a way to undo it.</span> She says in a reassuring way, leveling her head down to your body. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I thought you'd maybe like it, being small for a day. Are you okay with that, or do you want me to change you back?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think on it for a second. While being small may be dangerous, what with the possibility of a Magikarp of snatching you up, you know that Lapras would keep you safe. Besides, you kinda like being small. \"I'm okay with it, as long as your able to change me back, like you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles \"<span class=\"cblue\">Okay, I'd better put you on board</span>\" She says, as she leans behind you and grabs the back of your shirt with her mouth.

You open your eyes to see Chikorita, one of your best friends in the world. You remember the first time you two met, it was a cold, rainy night, and you saw something outside your window. Low and behold, a lone Chikorita, cold and practically starving was at your doorstep. You took her in, and you've been best buddies ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good morning Chikorita\" You say with a smile, getting out of your bed, picking up Chikorita with. \"I bet your hungry, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Chika\" Chikorita replied enthusiastically. You decide to make pancakes while Chikorita goes outside to play. After about 20 minutes, you go outside to call for your little buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chikorita, breakfast is ready!\" You exclaimed. You hear rustling from a bush nearby, as Chikorita pops out of it, sporting some weird necklace around her neck. You bend down towards Chikorita to take a closer look .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's this?\" You ask, holding up the purple gem on the necklace. You see Chikorita light up when you ask that question, and began to hold it as well, but this time, the stone started to glow, and the world around you started to get a bit hazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon feel a jolt of energy hit you, as you snap out of your dazed set of mind. \"Woah, that was pretty weird. How did you do that Chikorita?\" You ask her. She seems to look at you like she's expecting something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uhh, is there something wrong?\" You ask, but soon, you start to notice that she is getting bigger, or maybe... you are getting smaller. You start to look around, seeing everything slowly get bigger and bigger, even Chikorita, to where you are almost her height by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-what is happening!?\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're shrinking. Isn't this what you always wanted?\" You hear a reply to your question from non other than Chikorita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Chikorita!? How are you able to talk?\" You ask, as you are almost a foot tall and still shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The stone allows us to communicate to each other. Isn't it great!\" She replied, being the bubbly self she has always been, even when you are shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But why am I shrinking!?\" You are about 6 inches now, and about a quarter of how tall Chikorita is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know what you are into, trainer. You always wanted to be smaller than me, so I found this necklace that allows you to fulfill that deep desire of yours.\" She said with a smile. You start to blush and look away, feeling a bit flustered knowing that your Pokemon knows about your secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-how much am I going to shrink?\" You ask, noticing that your shrinkage is slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'd say about at one inch. So, what do you want to do, short stuff.\" She says teasingly, poking your little form with her leaf.

By now, your shrinking had fully stopped, and the bristles on your carpet to up to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I have an idea of what we could do together.\" She says, as she picks you up with the leaf of hers. You hear her shuffle around a bit before her leaf moves again, putting you on a squishy, smooth, green surface. You have a tough time trying to keep your balance on the uneven ground and end up falling to your hand and knees. You hear Chikorita giggle, and the area around you began to jiggle a lot. You soon come to realize that you are on Chikorita's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, you feel so good on there.\" You hear her say, as some Chikorita stretches, sending vibrations all over her body. You decide to start to try and stand up, which is a very difficult task, since of how wobbly the \"floor\" is, and the fact that every time to put a lot of pressure somewhere, Chikorita starts to giggle again, making the task even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, uh, trainer?\" After a few minutes of trying to get up, you hear Chikorita ask you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes Chikorita?\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If it isn't too bothersome for you, can you.... rub my belly for me?\" She asks, being very shy about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now who is the flustered one?</i> You think to yourself. \"I GUESS I'll do it.\" You say in a very fake sarcastic tone. You start to use your arms and legs to shuffle across the large landscape, occasionally stopping to rub intensely at certain places, as you hear Chikorita hum in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good few minutes, you lay down from exhaustion, as you feel Chikorita start to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You did a good job there, trainer.\" She says, picking you back up with her leaf, and putting you back on the ground. \"Now it's your turn to choose what we should do.\" She says, flipping herself to where she's laying down on her belly, full playful grin on her face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happened to all that shyness before?</i> \"Well, I do have an idea, but I'm not sure you would like it.\" You imply, also having a grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What is it, that you'd like to do?\" She says, a little inkling of worriedness in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'd like to be smothered by...\"</span></div></div>",

Oh.\" Chikorita replied, a bit tongue tied, \"You want me to..... sit on you?\" She starts to blush a lot, maybe from embarrassment, maybe from the thought of her sitting on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, it you really want too.\" It seems that you were both in a very submissive stalemate. Her, knowing you are her trainer, and you, being much smaller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-alright, I'll do it.\" She says very quickly, turning around at almost the same speed as she did speak, showing you her gigantic butt. \"Just tell me if I press to hard, or something, okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, I guess I'm ready.\" You confirm, laying your body on the ground, looking right at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, I-I'm sitting down.\" She tells you, having a little crack in her voice as her booty starts to descend onto your position, if not slowly. The butt fills your line of vision, and presses right onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had to describe it, it would feel very plush, and soft, almost like a pillow. You start to press your arms on the butt, messaging it in a way. You hear an audible gasp coming from Chikorita, and then soft humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, why does this feel so.... good?\" You hear Chikorita exclaim, as the humming gets a bit louder, almost like a moan or something. You begin to feel a lot more pressure than you did at the beginning, as Chikorita seemed to grind her butt a little on your figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the pressure come off you, as you lie on the ground, a bit out of breath. You look up to see the other cheek of Chikorita's butt coming right at you, faster than the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thoooooom.</i> You don't feel crushed, since the butt is very soft, but it feels really uncomfortable, as Chikorita started to rub more intensely on you, her moans getting louder and louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon start to lift her butt a little and bring it right back down, and rub a little where you might be. <i>She might have gotten a bit overboard.</i> You think, as your body gets berated by her sitting down on you over and over again, lifting your arms up a bit to elevate the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you see her giant tailhole come over to you, and your hand goes in it for a bit, which creates a powerful gasp from Chikorita, and she instantly lifts her butt all the way up. It seems that broke her from her concentration, and made her remember that you were under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm so sorry, really. I didn't mean to go off like that.\" She rambled, turning around to face you, as you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's okay.\" You assure her, \"I'm just a bit bruised. Besides, it was my fault for you to sit on me, I did choose it after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh....\" She blushed, lying down in front of you and hiding her face in her arms. The atmosphere was so thick between you two, that it could be cut with a butter knife. \"Do you want to.... call it a day?\" She asks, a bit muffled from her still hiding her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You replied with...</span></div></div>",

Another long day of work you thought, you had grocery bags in hand as you opened the door carefully and nudged it shut with your foot, making for the kitchen with your bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pichu? Yo, i'm home!\" You called out, and soon enough she approached, the familiar small yellow mouse, with her slight frazzled tuff on the top of her head that set her apart from other Pichu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd had her for years, since you were in middle school honestly, and all these years later she still hadn't evolved. At first you thought it was because she wasn't happy with you, a sure sign of abuse with her type is if they haven't evolved after this long, but she assured you it was because she wanted to stay a Pichu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything the two of you were thick as thieves. Neither of you particularly had the ambition for battles or pageantry you'd found, and more or less settled down as casual friends or partners. Though she still called you master, and still had the spark in her to shock you once or twice when you got into arguments...which usually ended up with both of you hurt and you consoling her or trying to make it up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe for her part always tried to make you feel better after a long day...like today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">How was work master?</span>\" She asked as she looked up at you, sorting the bags of groceries and pulling out an oran berry, her favorite and giving it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as usual...\" You mumbled in your tired voice, and you got ready to settle in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well...it's a long weekend for you now, right?</span>\" She asked as she chewed on her berry and you nodded, the bags under your eyes notable to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't worry master, it's gonna be great, just you and me! And...I have a surprise for you.</span>\" She said in a giddy tone, one that belied some sort of mischief, though still carrying the warmth you knew from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant imminent disaster to you. Pichu tried stuff like this from time to time and it usually ended in disaster you thought...there was the time she tried to hire a performing Mr. Mime and that didn't end well at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...sure it'll totally catch me off guard.\" You said, opening the fridge and putting the perishables inside. When you shut it you found that Pichu was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your head perplexed until you heard her call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Master! Come here~ I've got your surprise~</span>\" She said and you rounded the corner into your living room to find...Pichu holding a drink out for you. It didn't have any label or markings on it and you looked at it confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...a drink?\" You said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Try it! I promise it'll make you REEAAAAL happy!</span>\" She said and you just looked at her for a few seconds before shrugging and walking towards her, kneeling down to grab the drink from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at it in your hand, it was a can, so you couldn't see the contents. Was it a soda? Juice? Water...?...some kind of prank?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Come on...drink it.</span>\" Pichu urged and you looked in her eyes. They held a spark of excitement and you cracked a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Pichu...i'll try whatever this is, okay.\" You said before you raised the drink to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it didn't taste bad actually. Kinda sweet, but a different kind of sweet than you'd ever tried. You gulped the whole thing down and let out a sigh as you finished. Pichu had a wide smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Good job master! Now the surprise part!</span>\" She said and you gave her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I thought the drink was the surprise?\" It was then that you felt a little odd...and were your clothes baggy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and went to take a step but you stepped right out of your shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...huh?\" You said as you looked at them...then your shirt felt really baggy and your pants fell down, your belt unable to hold them up anymore...the room...Pichu...they seemed to be getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Pichu...that drink...\" You said nervously and she nodded up to you...now as large as a Raichu to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I know about what you like master...I saw it on your computer...and I looked up this drink...</span>\" She said smiling. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">And it shrinks whoever drinks it! Surprise!</span>\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part your clothes no longer fit you at all as you were child sized, you threw the tarp that was your shirt off and noticed you were completely nude now. With a blush you covered your privates with your hand and noticed that Pichu was as tall as your waist now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pichu! T-this is a little extreme, isn't it!?\" You said and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Relax master, this isn't permanent...just a way for you to enjoy your weekend with me...don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you, so try and have fun!</span>\" She said as the shrinking was picking up and soon you were eye level with her...but it didn't stop there, she was getting taller than you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown and down you went, you shut your eyes tight, trying to comprehend the experience...soon enough, when you opened your eyes you were...</span></div></div>",

It was frightening to see things from the point of view of a bug, though you couldn't deny it was... vaguely exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of dreams coming true so suddenly left you surprised, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Aw, my little master is being pouty,</span>\" Pichu cooed as she reached down, her short, stubby paw extending as she bent to grab a hold of you; you suddenly found yourself in the grip of the goddess as she brought you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, forward went your world as you were shoved forcefully against a fuzzy wall - the chest of your formerly small companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">There's no need to worry, master,</span>\" she spoke lovingly, not breaking her embrace, which soon grew to be soothing for you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">As I already mentioned, this isn't permanent, though I don't doubt you'd love that... and me too~</span>\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes for a moment and inhaled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't permanent?

I'm in.\" you said, leaning your head against the wall of yellow fur that was in front of you, letting the feeble electricity it produced tickle the hairs on your limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Glad to hear that, master,</span>\" she said, delighted by the news; just as if you were a doll, she began throwing you back and forth in her grip, causing you to feel nauseous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last big jump on the couch and Pichu settled back down onto the leather before laying still and freeing you from her grip, leaving you laying on her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big eared giantess raised her cute face to see you, her insect-sized trained lost in a sea of ankle-deep yellow fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You look sooo cute, master! I wonder why I haven't done this a long ago!</span>\" she exclaimed cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because you knew nothing about-\" you trailed off and your cheeks flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no need for you to mention <i>that</i>. Okay, Pichu knew about it, but it was still kind of embarrassing for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow smart of a mouse was she to discover your secret without you not even knowing? A true sneaky devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your blush only made the yellow behemoth giggle harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her paws soon found its way back to you and it snuck up behind your back; five tiny fingers pushed against your back and shoved you belly-down onto your pokemon's own stomach as she pulled you in another embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't fight it and, for several minutes, nothing was said or done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still trying to convince yourself this wasn't some kind of very lucid dream; Pichu, on the other hand, was coming up with ways to start the fun for you... and for her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause this was undoubtedly, undeniably going to be the greatest experience ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the mouse shot you a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hey master,</span>\" she called in a sugary voice,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't ya think it's time to do something?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" you agreed,<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mi-\" you trailed off; upon rising your head from the land of yellow and looking up at Pichu, you got a chance to glance at her face.</span></div></div>",

You worked, payed for the mortgage, brought home food and got utilities payed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky made things. The tv you both watched, the oven, dishwasher, fridge. She loved to make electronics. Atop that, she was able to power the entire house herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat might be why while your living arrangement seemed weird to others, it really worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis weirdness was more so over the fact that while you were human, she was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood 5\"8' with dark brown, shorter hair. Lightly tanned skin, and a decent build. Well toned and healthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky, however, was a Pok\u00e9mon. An anthro Raichu, to be precise. She stood a few inches shorter than you, just 5\"0' even, with dark chocolate hair pulled back in a thin ponytail. She didn't normally wear clothing, though her fur kept herself decent enough. She was a bit chubby, with a decent belly, thick thighs and an ass to match. Her breasts were fairly sized, at mid-C cups, but she was more bottom heavy than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you enjoyed a fair bit of things, ranging from light sports such as tennis and basketball, to simple gaming and fantasy shows, Vicky was into more geeky things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from her love for tinkering and electronics, she had a love for all fantasy kinda events. D&amp;D, gaming, LARP fighting, you name it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her major hit, was miniature landscaping. She loved to create tiny, fully functional, realistic landscapes. A countryside farm with a house and barn. A huge city with working cars, busses and trains. Even a huge amusement park section, all scaled down to size, and all functional, thanks to her own ability generate electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had a good life, and while you both had some different interests, you loved to watch tv or a movie together, play a game or two, or just chat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut! This month, you got... Lucky? Kind of. You were laid off for a month, a whole month without work! But a whole month without that extra money. It would be tight, sure you could pay off all bills, and have money for food and gas, but nothing fun this month. No new games, or going out to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in a bit of a daze that Monday, and got out of bed tiredly, heading to the kitchen to make breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky was nowhere to be seen, either still asleep or in her shed. It didn't matter, you were too tired. Making a simple breakfast of cereal and coffee, you leaned against the counter and watched the morning news from the kitchen doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute after the coffee finished, sure enough, Vicky came in through the back door in the kitchen, immediately washing dirty, oily paws in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to her as you ate, a small smirk rising. \"Another toy?\" You ask, figuring she had been tinkering again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mouse turned around, you saw a huge grin on her face, eyes wide and bright. \"Soon enough it will make me another!\" She said, giggling. \"I've been working on this thing for months now!\" She took a second cup of coffee from the pot and downed it black, shivering afterward. \"Ahh~ But! I am gonna need you to test it for me later, if that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, a little apprehensive. \"Am I really going to want to? I don't even know what it is, and something tells me you won't tell me what it is, unless it works.\" You said, shifting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened a bit more, her smile was a bit unnerving. \"Well, what if I...\"</span></div></div>",

And she's currently standing onto it as she floats away from you while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't catch me master!\" she cheerily shouts.<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that!\" you snap back as you accelerate your run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you manage to catch up, but Raichu doesn't give up. And that's when you leap forward, get a hold of her body and fall down on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going anywhere?\" you say, smirking to the playfully struggling pokemon, who tries to wiggle out of your grasp. Eventually, the struggling ceases as she relaxes.<br>\r\n\"Nope. You got me, master...\" she giggles as you drop on the ground next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you feel her body moving as she adjusts her position to give you a hug. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu was always like this, since she was just a little Pichu. She always was very playful. And yet, you never stayed mad at her for more than a few minutes. Her usual good mood was contagious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you return the hug. All you needed to evolve her was a lot of affection, a trip to Alola and a thunder stone you luckily found while walking around the region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu pushes her head against yours as she lovingly nuzzles you. And, noticing your closed eyes, she smiles brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes her yellow, left cheek against yours, releasing a small, magenta colored spark that causes you to feel a tingling, but nice sensation.<br>\r\n\"Hehe, stop that. It tickles.\" you laugh a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could never guess what's really going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Raichu seems to be getting softer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low giggle coming from your pokemon gets you to open your eyes. You know what that giggle means: she's up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment your eyes open, they widen. Laying there, still hugging you, is Raichu alright... but she's huge! Your pokemon became a giantess, who is looking down at you smiling while she hugs you against her soft, white belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, look at you master! You're adorable!\" she chimes while giggling again.<br>\r\n\"R-Raichu! What happened to me?!\" you shout, naturally startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, my little master,\" she says as she stands up, her tail sliding beneath her feet as she starts hovering in midair. She then sits down on her own tail, setting you down in front of you.<br>\r\n\"I've shrunk you! Isn't this nice? Oh, you look so cu-\" <br>\r\n\"Why did you do this?\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu smirks down at you.<br>\r\n\"Nice thing sleeping in your bed, next to the computer, master~\" she chirps, sending you into a state of pure, wild embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she see you skipping through <i><b>those</b></i> websites while you believed she was asleep? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... oh... I can explain...\" you mutter as you go red as a cherry.<br>\r\n\"No need to, master,\" Raichu replies.<br>\r\n\"You see, I found the whole thing... amusing to say the least. That's your thing, I respect it,\" she says, while winking.<br>\r\n\"And we both can have some fun this way~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her, sincerely grateful that she isn't weirded out or mad at you because of it. Raichu might be playful, but she's always been comprehensive too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you shrink me?\" you question, curious.<br>\r\n\"Well, a bit of a psychic shock. It worked quite well~\" she cheerfully responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pinkish-purple aura surrounds you and lifts you off Raichu's tail, bringing you into her open paws as she hugs you against her face, pressing you into one of her yellow cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel a bit startled by this. If she lets out a spark of electricity right now, you'd be fried alive.<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't worry, you're perfectly safe!\" she says, almost as if reading your mind, relaxing you a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief, and hug her cheek.<br>\r\n\"So... you mentioned that \u2018we can have some fun\u2019,\" you say. Raichu nods.<br>\r\n\"Well, what kind of fun are we talking about?\" you ask, now letting your dread go, replacing it with eagerness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis WAS your dream, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu opens her eyes to look down at you as she lets a smile spread on her face.<br>\r\n\"Oh, master, we can have some fun together in any way you wish! After all, those things you watch are full of... things, aren't they...?\" she asks teasingly, making you flush red again.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just think. I could put you in my mouth, stomp on you, put you in... places~\" she merrily says, your face growing redder each word that comes out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...\" she adds.<br>\r\n\"... Or...?\" you parrot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu smiles.<br>\r\n\"We could simply play normal games together.\" she says, before letting out a few more giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?

Raichu, you're a goddess from my point of view.\" you say, noting that you couldn't be taller than one of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled.<br>\r\n\"Well then... why don't we get started~\" she said cheerfully - mischievously - as she gently picked you up with her psychic powers and lifting you off the bed, psychically holding you at chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins down at you one last time before she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, I'm back!\" You said, knocking the door closed. You'd just returned from a doctor's check up, and set your papers on the table near the door. They were long and complicated, and you didn't want to read today. <br>\r\n\"Oh, welcome back!\" Your Luxio, the cute Lexi, chimes, turning a corner and entering the room. She hops onto a chair, then up onto the table, and starts reading through your chart, whatever it is. She just likes reading. You aren't paying attention, and sit on a lower sofa near a window with a small cup of juice, and watch your electric cat. <br>\r\nHer claws had recently trimmed down to not be sharp, not that you don't trust her alone in the house. She's not a battler, and neither are you, so you never saw the real purpose in having them. The excess electricity has found itself leaving her body in other ways, like through her actual paws themselves, or through static discharge. <br>\r\nShe's reading rather intently, you notice. After turning over one section, she blinks twice, and finishes reading through it. Maybe she got bored? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi comes over and starts acting a bit odd. She leaps up beside you and sets a paw above your head, almost like she's measuring, and then hops down and rubs against your leg. \"How was it?\" the medium-sized kitty asks. <br>\r\n\"Oh, it was fine, I guess.\" A small electric tingle passes your leg, surprising you a bit. \"Ah.\" The static surprised you. <br>\r\n\"That's good. Any weird tests? Anything interesting?\" She continues making small talk. Her experiment seems to be continuing, though you couldn't quite figure out what she was intending. <br>\r\n\"Well, there was some weird test for nerve reactions, I guess. I'm perfectly healthy, though.\" Your eyes watch as Lexi does what she did a few seconds, hopping up beside you and holding her paw above your head. She seems to notice something, but doesn't continue, merely relaxing beside you a minute. <br>\r\n\"That's great~\" Purring beside you, the Luxio seems to be having a playful episode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finish drinking, you get up and stretch, heading into your bedroom to relax and watch a bit of TV. The small paws follow you, and before you can turn on the TV, she leaps up on your chest. You're larger than her, though, so you gently nudge her off to the side with more bed. She's to your left, sitting on the bed. With a bit of a mischievous look on her face, she sticks out her tongue for a few seconds. This behavior seems weird enough that you pause. Thinking it bizarre, you decide to ask her. \"What're you thinking, Lex?\" <br>\r\n\"Indulging you a bit, is all  \u266b\" She hums, nudging herself a bit closer. You turn to face her, at which point she gives a few long, wet licks on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes out of surprise, gently pushing her off you. \"Bleeeh! Gross!\" You wipe your face. Her spit is oddly tingly, which probably means that it's a touch electric. Once you think you've got it all off, you blink and open your eyes. At first, you're quite a bit confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything looks much, much bigger. The quilt underneath you seems to stretch for large distances, and the sides of your room seem very far away. Then, there's the towering obelisk of Luxio, which looks quite precisely like a colored statue of Lexi, but...moving. She rests in front of you and puts her paws to her cheeks. <br>\r\n\"Awww! You're even more adorable than I thought you'd be!\" <br>\r\n\"What's going on, Lexi?!\" You shout, voice a bit squeakier than you anticipated, and you put your hand over your mouth, embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"Didn't read your chart, huh?\" She purrs. \"The doctor said you've got an allergic reaction to bio-electric stimulation. Stuff like being licked by an electric pokemon, for instance. You lose a bit of height from different stimuli. The static discharge from earlier took a barely noticeable half-centimeter off your height. My saliva's quite a bit of a stronger of a shock, so to speak. Just those few licks have left you at this size.\" She chuckles. \"Just like in your fetishes, eh?\" <br>\r\nYou flush red. She knew your kink for being tiny, didn't she. You guess by \"different stimuli\", she means that there's a limit as to how much each stimulus can shrink you, and that different types will stack. You also guess that you probably still don't have the full dosage of her saliva yet. Regardless, staring up at your cute lynx, a question surfaces in your mind. <br>\r\n\"W-wait. Just how small am I?\"<br>\r\n\"Well,\" She starts, putting a massive paw next to you in order to measure, \"I'd guess that you're...\"</span></div></div>",

But...um...didn't you wanna be smaller than this?\"  She mewed, scooching a bit closer to you.<br>\r\nYou'd told her about your kinks late one night while she was snooping around the house looking for something to do. She'd then spent the next few minutes attempting to menace you, which was little more than teasing. In the end, you hadn't reacted because you thought it awkward, though Lexi had sworn that she'd help you indulge yourself one day. She'd been quite forward with you since, which you'd gotten used to. Now, however, that you were facing the reality of a sudden drop in size, with your playfully flirty Luxio teasing you with the prospect of further shrinkage, you had to take a moment to level with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait, wait. Lexi, one second.\" You put your foot down, raising your voice to let her know. <br>\r\n\"Oh. Am I in trouble?\" She paused for a little bit, forgetting her train of thought. <br>\r\n\"No. Lexi, you know this is a fetish for me. So...I don't want to pretend that this isn't what I want or like. I really just want to go right along with this right now. But I need to make sure you know to be gentle, not to go too far, and to promise to return me to normal when we're done with this...uhm. session.\"<br>\r\n\"Normal...oh, right! It wears off after a couple hours without any electric stuff. That should be easy to achieve, you just go to sleep and when you wake up you'll be normal. And...gentle...yeah! I wasn't planning to hurt you anyway! I just wanna explore this. It's so neat, you know~?\" Her round face was purring. <br>\r\n\"Okay. I-in that case, can I finally start nerding out about this? Because it's...been really hard not to, up until now.\" Your voice was shaking, and your feet shifted about, showcasing your excitement. <br>\r\n\"Heck yeah! Be all cute for me!\" She meowed, and set her paws to either side of you, hovering her gently smiling maw. \"Now then...do you wanna be smaller than that, my little boy?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" You allow your voice to be more squeaky. \"T-that'd be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eager little buggie, aren'tcha? Well, how should I do it? I could rub my paws on you, I suppose. That might be a bit slower. But I think my spit can still shrink you a whole bunch more. What sounds better?\"<br>\r\nGiven the choice between these two options, you decide that the one which sounds better is...</span></div></div>",

Or I can put you in my mouth and play with you a bit that way.\"<br>\r\n\"What!\" You exclaim, \"But what if you swallow me?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry.\" Lexi said. \"Part of the shrinking, is that I cannot hurt you. Meaning while if some other pokemon was to swallow you, you would be digested, but since I'm the one who shrunk you, if I swallow you, you would be perfrctly fine.  You could even stay in my stomach eating the food and water I do, or go through my small intestines, which unless you get really small, won't absorb you into my bloodstream, and instead would be like a full body massage as you make your way through my body, and out my butt.

That way, it'll be stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as commanded, the attack was focused into a single, big flow, before it was shot right in direction of a huge oak tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact the impressive bolt made with the trunk caused quite a noise to echo around and, when the electricity died down, you noted an as well impressive mark left in the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a miracle if the tree didn't catch fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of this, you witnessed to the attack with a satisfied smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" you praised, keeping your gaze low, looking at the cause of that large display of electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would barely believe such thing was caused by such little, adorable creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid little fluff ball had a slim figure, a white and blue body with short, stubby limbs and petite paws; it had coal black eyes, yellow round cheeks and a large, fluffy tail which currently swung back and forth in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPachirisu liked being praised, and she deserved all of it: over the past week, thanks to a lot of effort and her optimistic attitude, she had improved massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Did I do good?</span>\" she asked, turning around, eager to receive more compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing. Really amazing.\" you replied, approaching your pokemon. It was curious how a creature that didn't even reach your knee could unleash such power  but you had learned long ago that Pachirisu was normal pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou met her a long time ago in this same forest near your house; back then, she had been wounded, maybe by some larger pokemon, and her cries managed to get your attention as well as inspire your pity, which led you to bring her home and nurse her back to health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been very close since then, but it soon became clear that Pachirisu was no ordinary one; whatever pokemon hurt her had a huge luck on their side, because Pachirisu had a huge potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little bit of training, she had managed to master her electric abilities, though she still had a lot to learn. Something that would change soon, given the rate she was improving at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" you said again, petting your pokemon on the head - she loved when you did,<br>\r\n\"But you can still do better. One more time, show me what you got!\" you encouraged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPachirisu smiled in determination. She wouldn't let you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough. Let's take a break.\" you said half an hour later, when several other trees suffered the same fate of the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPachirisu obeyed and her cheeks stopped sending blue sparks everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily, the cute squirrel turned and fell on all fours, chasing you while you went to sit at the foot of a tree, shortly after finding yourself with a beaming squirrel on your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great, Pachirisu,\" you praised once more, caressing her on the head eliciting a pleased moan,<br>\r\n\"A little while more, and you could just give legendaries a run for their money.\" you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPachirisu smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Why wait?</span>\" she said, her tail rising,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I bet I could do that now, would you agree?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at the mention - you highly doubted Pachirisu, as strong as she was, could take on a legendary. They were supposed to be the strongest, after all, true myths capable of erasing continents if they just willed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not go that far,\" you said, wanting to get her back to reality,<br>\r\n\"You're undoubtedly getting better, but I doubt you possess <i>that</i> kind of power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white and blue squirrel on your lap smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Maybe not,</span>\" she hinted slowly, her tone adopting a somewhat mischievous tone,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But still, I've got a few aces in my fur...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirk of your pokemon grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Okay, I wanted to surprise you but I guess I can tell you...</span>\" she said, before explaining,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I've learned a really cool trick, something that would no doubt let me win every battle, even if I was battling a legendary!</span>\" she proudly boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you asked, wondering what she was talking about; the only trick she's been capable of doing in the years with you was powering up the occasional device you offered her so that it lasted a couple hours more than it should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if she was just messing with you, but that expression of hers carried something in it that made you want to believe you, almost like a threat hidden behind her elongated tooth and cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you asked again, more curious than you were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPachirisu nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You heard me. I've learned something that made me even stronger than I was before,</span>\" she said, before leaning forward, reaching your torso with her small paws, an expectant look on her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But you'll never understand until I show you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just tell me?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPachirisu shook her head,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You wouldn't believe it.</span>\" she replied,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And neither would I if I were you.</span>\" she admitted, before smirking again,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So... wanna see what I'm talking about?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

This is what you call a perfect way to start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing softly, you lay down on the grass, staring at the sky. You yawn drowsily. This atmosphere is surely relaxing. You almost fall asleep, when you feel a little weight on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you close your eyes, pretending to be asleep. And it seems to work, since you feel yourself being poked on a cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" you playfully yell, suddenly moving your arms to pick up your little gray and white pokemon, Cinccino. She's been your most loyal partner since you got her when she was just a Minccino. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinccino starts to playfully struggle, trying to free herself. You notice that she's holding something red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you sit up and set her on your lap (like the others of her species, she hates getting dirty. You literally pass most of your time brushing and cleaning her) and examine the object in her paw, that reveals to be a red, heart shaped berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this Cinccino?\" you curiously ask.<br>\r\n\"This is a special kind of berry I luckily found. Try it out, you won't be sorry,\" she says, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you the berry. Thinking that your best friend would never do anything to hurt you, you plop the berry into your mouth. She was right, it's delicious. So delicious that you close your eyes to enjoy all of its taste. Too bad that you don't notice your own pokemon growing before your eyes, a smirk on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the berry, you open your eyes.<br>\r\n\"You were right Cinccino, that was... great...\" you say, noticing your now huge pokemon standing before you.<br>\r\n\"Hi there, master~\" she chirps, while picking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can act, Cinccino starts nuzzling you against her cheek.<br>\r\n\"Aww, master, you're so cute like this, I could squeeze you in my hug all day long!\" she exclaims happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing smothered between her paws and her cheeks, you start to struggle from the lack of oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Cinccino feels your struggles and stops, looking at you sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinccino what happened to me?!\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, remember the berry I gave you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"That was a rare Bond Berry.\" Cinccino says <br>\r\n\"Bond Berry? What's that?\" you ask<br>\r\n\"It's an incredibly delicious berry, but that's not all. In fact, like the name says, if a human and a pokemon have a strong bond, it can make your most secret dreams come true. Stronger is the bond, stronger will be the power of the berry.\" she explains with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Then why I'm tiny? What make that berry think I wanted this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Cinccino laughs.<br>\r\n\"Oh please, don't try to fool me, I know from years about your dream to shrink down to size. And I should say that you pretty much love me, since you shrunk down so much!\" Cinccino jokes, making you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo... what do we do now?\" you ask sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"Well, we're alone, a in a beautiful place, what a little Cinccino and her even-more-little master could do in this situation?\" Cinccino says with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n\"Let's....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm pretty tired.\" she says, yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pretty sure she is just pretending to be tired. You perfectly know where she wants to bring you. You don't say anything though, you might be wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not tired.\" you say instead. Cinccino smiles.<br>\r\n\"Not my problem~\" she giggles. Your world shakes as she lies down, still holding you firmly in her paws. Then, she starts lowering you towards her furry chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even speak up, she already buried you in her whitish gray fur, enclosing your small body in a hug, the two soft paws keeping you still.<br>\r\n\"Sleep tight, cutie~\" Cinccino giggles, before closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh loudly and lay your head on the furry and somewhat slick surface. You remember about the special oil covering Cinccino's fur, the same oil that she uses to repel the attacks in battle, and very often sending them right back, much to the opponent's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it. Cinccino wasn't kidding about being tired, you can tell from how quick she got asleep. The soft land beneath you rises and falls along her breath. You have to admit, this is really soothing. But the thought of why she wanted to sleep at 10 AM keeps you from sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you decide to don't t about it too much, you will find out later. For now, you just enjoy your new situation, the one you've dreamed about since you were younger: being tiny, and at the mercy of a giant, female pokemon. Smiling, you make yourself comfortable, sure that Cinccino won't let you go anywhere for some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seems to pass away and, finally, you give up and fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Instead, she places you on the couch and gets on all fours. Then, she suddenly tackles you. Normally, someone of your current size would have met death in an instant after getting tackled by a giant pokemon, but even though Cinccino couldn't be more excited, she's being extremely careful to not hurt you in anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms get pinned to the leathery surface of the couch, your legs disappear beneath the huge furry land of Cinccino's belly. Her now coconut sized eyes stand inches before your face, her warm breath blasting your face; Her mouth is curled up in a somewhat sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask what is going on in her mind, Cinccino giggles.<br>\r\n\"Tickle battle!\" her exclaims, excitement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout letting you reply, she starts running her paws all over your body, tickling you. You already were ticklish when you were normal sized (and Cinccino knows it too well), but now it's much worse! The feeling of the two gigantic paws tickling you makes you laugh uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly run out of air from all the laughs and start to cough. <br>\r\n\"Cinccino... please... stop...\" you beg between laughs. She doesn't seem to have heard you though. A mischievous idea crosses your mind. You grin.<br>\r\n'This ought to teach a lesson.' you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon Cinccino stops tickling, you close your eyes and lie there, pretending to be fainted.<br>\r\n\"That was a nice round master!\" Cinccino says, her tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting no reply, she looks over your tiny form, and notices you passed out.<br>\r\n\"Master?\" she  inquires worriedly. She lowers herself on you.<br>\r\n\"You- You're fainted? I tickled you too much?\" she asks, lowering herself a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes just a little so that Cinccino can't notice you're awake; If she does, the whole plan is ruined. You notice her furry belly standing just where your arms can reach it. You grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms rocket upwards. Cinccino lets out a surprised gasp as you start tickling her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, high pitched laughs assault your ears as you tickle the huge chinchilla pokemon.<br>\r\n\"M-M-Master! S-Stop!\" she says, not able to stop laughing. You ignore her.<br>\r\n\"Payback time Cinccino!\" you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pokemon crashes on her back on the couch. You take the opportunity and leap on her belly, tickling her non stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after a good while she manages to regain control of her body. She quickly removes you from her belly.<br>\r\n\"That was a cheap shot!\" she exclaims, pouting.<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you deserved it.\" you retort smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinccino smiles again.<br>\r\n\"Aw, I could never stay mad at you. You're just too cute~\" she says, nuzzling you. You pet her cheek in response, making her moan softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say master, what do you want to do now?\" Cinccino asks after a bit.<br>\r\n\"No clue. How about you pick?\".<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we play 'pet the Cinccino'?\" she asks with a smile.<br>\r\n\"That's a game we play too often.\" you state.<br>\r\n\"Maybe one of those games where I explore your body?\".<br>\r\n\"That's some idea...\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long passes before she decides what game to do...</span></div></div>",

But in your case, those three leaps feel like a big vertigo ride to the top of a hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the table, she grabs a Nanab Berry and peels off the skin wrapping the three bundles. With each of the soft pink pulp exposed, she picks you up and sets one of the pulps on her right paw with you. Her left paw holds the other pulp and munches on the sweet berry she loved ever since you introduced that kind of berry to her. As you pluck out a piece of the Nanab Pulp, her cute face gives you a view of her calm demeanor and the sight of her salivary glands latching on parts of the pulp. Normally, the size of the pulp would be small for your normal size. But your smaller size ends up only being able to feast on a really small amount to get you really fed. However, it doesn't take long for her to finish as she turns around to the nearby kitchen calendar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her breathing getting constant, you feel the vibrations of her speeding heartbeat getting faster than normal. While she just gazes at the calendar, there are colored circles all over the various days of the calendar. You know two of them are safe. But the third color meant that your lovely pet becomes very moody until it gets satisfied for over a week. Just looking at the day you are at right now, the color red marks that day. You struggle to recall if red is a good calm day, or if it is what you had only partially satisfied a couple hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you would like to be small for her to play with you, having to deal with her heat in your actual size instead of being tiny is more enjoyable for you. But, you could be wrong and that she only asks for anything tame to do.</span></div></div>",

I miss you rubbing my inner ears. Can you massage them, please?\" of the many things that you two get to agree upon besides the recreation sex every other week, playing and maintaining the health and cleanliness of her ears is something both of you always get mindful about. Though you can cross around her scarf, her silky oil tends to make you slip or loose your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a paw my big pet. you are simply too clean and smooth.\" setting her left paw next to you, she carefully lifts her master to her ears. \"You can set it down girl. I'm inside already.\" Looking at the three soft nub balloons dangling on the side of her ears, you rub and squeeze it with your hands and arms to emulate the gentle squeezing massages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her muffled moans, Cinccino pulls out the slightly chewed nanab pulp filled with a lot of salivary glands flavored by the berry as it drips through her scarf which easily washes it away. \"Mmmmhhmmm. That is so nice master. Please do more.\" Slightly tightening your grip on the nub of flesh, you tug it upwards and to the sides as if trying to even stretch it a bit like you often tend to do to your little pet. Murring on your little massaging, she sets her little nanab pulp on her mouth and begins chewing on it as she gets another unpeeled Nanab berry and then uses it as a dildo rubbing the tip on her clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moans begin a cycle of rapid heartbeating and panting as pleasure slowly made her voice seductive through her self pleasure. In your case, it makes you horny amidst not smelling her girly juices yet. Wanting to get along the fun, you see the opportunity to do something kinky impossible on your side: Sex through her ears. Removing your undergarments and freeing your hardening boner, you yank one of the nub muscles to the right, set your penis in the middle, and get it pinned between both ear nubs. Now you get to hump on it in varying amounts of speed and intensity. Due to the size difference, thee two may well have the equivalent of her vagina muscles squeezing your penis as you hang on to her swaying ear nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your giant normal type, rubbing her clit is making her sway slightly in every direction as her orgasm is building up. As her mind begins to get hazy, she's wondering if giving her master another berry to make him go either to his original size or a size of her choice besides small. \"Maybe I can have master be just big enough to be an actual poke dildo like what my friends showed to me. I like him really small. But ... ohhh, Having him lick ad bite my clit while I bathe him in my cum as he cums inside me.. Ohhh... arceus ... so many good feelings ... ideas.. ohhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she murmurs it to herself, you can clearly hear it yourself. Though having you as her sex toy again would be nice, maybe you could consider just getting a break for now and maybe do other activities regarding the house at your original size. <i>\"I'm inside her ear. Maybe I can convince her to bring me back to normal and have my way with her. Yet ... she is doing something which I can enjoy...\"</i></span></div></div>",

Why wouldn't it rain on this shitty day\" you think out loud as you  begun recalling the events of the last few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly your bike chain broke while you were late to work that was an hour away and you skinned your elbow pretty badly. Forcing you to ditch your bike and run the rest of the way to work. But when you got there your boss \"let you go\" do to downsizing, or that's what she told you anyway. You were pretty sure she fired you because you could not do anything right and you were terrible with the customers. Already feeling bad about yourself, you started to make the long walk back home but you were pushed to the ground from the back and this guy grabbed your wallet and ran for it. The only thing you can do about it is stand up and watch him get away. Even if you could somehow catch up to him he would most likely kick your ass. You couldn't fight, and even if you could fight you were to weak to do any damage. So you did all that you could do, you turned around and walk back to your house through town. A half hour into your walk you noticed the restaurant that your girlfriend (and your only human friend) you decided to walk in to see if she can make you feel any better. But to your distraught you saw her making out with some large guy at the front of the restaurant. You could only stand there on the sidewalk with tears starting to form when your girlfriend finally saw you through the window and she didn't even come out and talked to you, she just worded through the glass \"sorry, were done\" with fucking glee in her eyes. After seeing that, you just sprinted as far as you can go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, you were finally at the front door of your home. It was small and beat up. It only had one floor and the paint was peeling off, but at least it was cheap and was right by a forest you walk through to try and get away from your problems. Before opening the front door however you almost break down right there and then in the downpour as you think to yourself \"Whats the point.... today was just another shitty day like all the rest. I got nothing to live for...\" You think with a tear rolling down your face. But you then a thought came to your mind while unlocking the door. \"Well... I do have one reason.\"</span></div></div>",

You look into your home with most of the lights out. \"She always prefers to be in the dark\" you think to yourself. \"Hello?\" you call out. Not even a second goes by as you hear a sound of a body rolling off of the bed in your room. \"Master!\" you heard a feminine voice call out out to you. \"Weren't you late for work, why are you back home so early?\" you heard as the creaked open door to you bedroom opens up all the way and the body of an Absol is standing in the doorway. Your absol to be precise named Ophelia, or Lia for short. She is like most absol's, but there are a couple differences. Firstly, she was slightly bigger then most of her kind. Most absol are 3'11\". Ophelia on the other hand was 4'4\". The other difference was that the tuft of fur on her head grew much longer which covered most of her left eye. Luckily for her you had the idea of buying her some snap hair clips to help her deal with that at a young age. Ever since then she always wears two black snap hair clips over her left eye to help her keep her fur out of her face and because she thinks it looks cute (though she would never admit it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to walk towards you but stops halfway between the bedroom and you noticing your face was red and your eyes were puffy. \"Master, whats wrong? Why are you crying?!\" She asks worriedly. \"Uhm, its nothing Lia, just something in my eye is all..\" you say trying to lie to her while you walked over and sat down on your couch. \"Don't lie to me\" she says jumping up on the couch next to you. \"It's nothing really\" you say. \"Yeah right, you know your a terrible liar\" she tells you matter of factly. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">\"Great, another thing I suck at...\"</span> you mutter under your breath. \"Now please tell me what's wrong!\" she says loudly. You notice the look of worry in her face and you know she is to stubborn to drop anything that involves you. <b>sigh</b> \"Alright, I will tell you Lia, you see it all started..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spend the next 20 minutes telling her the events of the day and by the end of the story and tears were starting to form again. \"<b>THOSE BASTARDS!</b>\" she yells jumping off of the couch and starts pacing around the room huffing and puffing. \"You always did your best at that shitty job you hated! and... and... How dare anybody lay a finger on you! I would just love to <b>RIP HIS FUCKING THROAT OUT!</b> OH, and if I ever see that <b>CHEATING SLUT</b> again I swear that I'm... I...\" she stops yelling when she finally looked over at you again from her rant and noticed you broke down finally with your hands covering your face. \"Oh master...\" she says quietly to herself and jumps back on the couch next to you. She starts to rub her head on your shoulder trying to give you all of the comfort you need. You two stay like this for around ten minutes until you finally calmed down a bit and you looked over at Ophelia with tears in your eyes and noticed there were tears starting to form in her eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophelia...\" you mumble. Her eyes look up at yours now visibly starting cry as well. \"Remember when we first met\" you ask her while you were trying to hold back new tears. \"What?\" she asks confused. \"Do you still remember when we first met?\" you ask more clearly trying to distract both you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of.... course I do\" she says calming down. \"You found me when I was barely 3 months old hiding by a tree from that angry mob of humans. They kept calling me \"The White Demon\" because of alot of recent storms that appeared.\" she tells you while laying her head on her front paws looking at the floor. \"My back paw was injured from a rock that had been thrown at me. I was so scared when they found me, I knew even at that young age that I was surely dead. \"But then...\" she says now picking her head back up and started to look at you again in the eye \"...this little human boy ran out in front of them and kept on yelling at them that I was not evil, I was just like every other Pokemon. I took that moment of opportunity to run out of the area.\" she says. You started to finally calm down as well finally from listening to Lia's story. \"Then what happened?\" you ask trying to distract the two of you. Ophelia say's under her breath \"They... they hurt you..... Master, can I please sto-\" she starts to cry but you put your and on her head scratching her behind her horn which she loves. \"Then what happened?\" you simply ask. \"Well...\" she tries to continue on with the story trying to hold back a murr. \"They kept beating you... Said you let the demon get away.\" she says quietly while you remember the pain of that day, you sure got your ass kicked. She continued \"but they eventually left.\" \"And you never left, did you?\" you say while you stop scratching her behind her horn and begun petting her back. \"No... I did. But I came back and hid in a bush while I watched them beat you on the ground.\" She says with anger. \"They eventually left, guessing that the white demon ran far enough way where it would no longer trouble them. You were on the ground curled up in a ball.\" she says quietly. \"Once I thought the coast was clear I quickly limped over to you feeling so guilty that I let this creature get injured or worse on my account...\" she recalls. \"What was on my face though\" you ask her. \"Hmm? Oh, uhm...\" she thinks out loud. It took her about fifteen seconds before remembering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a.... smile.\" She states. \"Master, why did you have a smile on your face?\" she asks sitting upright again looking at you. \"Hmm? Why wouldn't I smile?\" you ask wiping some of the last tears from your eyes on your black hoodie sleeve. \"I mean, because of you trying to save me you got really hurt. Hell you could of gotten killed!\" she yells. \"The reasons I tried to save you Ophelia was...\" you say with Ophelia's eyes intent on you. \"Firstly, you were the most badass, most beautiful pokemon I had ever seen!\" You said amused. Ophelia was less amused with the joke. \"Oh haha, I was just some awesome looking eye candy for you huh.\" she says looking away from you with some salt in her voice, though she was trying to hide herself from blushing as well. You start to grin at this but you calmed down and went serious. \"I also tried to save you because I knew you were no demon Ophelia\" you say matter of factly. Now Ophelia is looking back at you. \"Master...\" she says quietly. \"I knew that there was evil there that day, but not from you. From those stupid people that still believe in a proven myth. I just felt the need to protect you from them.\" you said sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh master...\" she says with a smile returning to rest her head on your shoulder. You did the same and rested your head on hers. \"Most of my life may be shit. I may not be strong, I may not have a job, I may not be able to keep a girlfriend, hell I may not even be able to make human friends...\" you think to yourself \" But at least I have Ophelia, my <i><b>Best</b></i> friend.</span></div></div>",

Remember?\" Lia retorts back with a giggle. You laugh as well at her teasing for a few seconds. Afterwards you two just stare at each other for about a minute before Ophelia breaks the silence. \"You know I will always be there for you, right?\" \"I know Lia\" you say quietly with a small smile. \"Your the only being on this earth that cares about me.\" you say factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia looks up at you from that statement and just sits there on the couch for a solid few minutes before saying \"Master, it's just..\" she begins before cutting herself off. \"Ophelia, what is it?\" you ask. \"It's just... After today's events, I just want to make you enjoy life, like <b>really</b> enjoy life.\" she says looking up at you. \"Lia, I-\" you were about to begin before Ophelia cuts you off. \"No, please let me finish\" she says with some force while getting off of the couch. So you just sit back and let her continue. \"Master... it's just that your the sweetest, greatest person I have ever known, human or pokemon. You have never deserved the crap that always happens to you. Yet it always happens to you for whatever reason and I am sick of it!\" she says with some venom in her voice. You dared not interrupt Ophelia when she is ranting like this. You knew far to well to know better then to do that. Besides that, you wanted to hear what else she wanted to say. \"I'm tired of always seeing you in pain all the time. So I have decided that from now on, I am never gonna leave your side ever again.\" she says looking down blushing. \"Ophelia...\" is all that you can say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, unlike those bastards out there.\" She says while looking through at the front door. \"I can make all your dreams come true!\" She says proudly. Now your confused. \"Uhh Lia, what do you mean by all my dreams come true?\" you ask while getting up to start turning on the lights in the house. \"Well for one, you will never be lonely ever again\" she says as she follows you around. You smirk at hearing that. \"That is definitely one dream you have already filled Lia\" you say which unbeknownst to you, causes her to stop following you and her face lit up red. \"Ok, how about now you will never ever worry about having assholes hurt you again.\" she says while she catches back up to you now in your bedroom. You laugh at this \"Lia once again you already do this. Besides this isolated incident with that asshole mugger, you have always protected me from danger. Remember back when I was in middle school with those bullies?\" You ask which gives Ophelia a somewhat evil smirk. \"Yeah, those assholes never dared to come near you again after what I did with their dumbass fighting types.\" she says proudly with an evil smirk. \"You are my shining knight aren't you?\" you joke which causes Lia to laugh hard. By this point you were lying on your bed on your laptop trying to find another job with no such luck. You were not in any real danger, luckily you owned your house so you did not have o worry about rent. And the town you lived close by had free water and electricity thanks to the town being in a lucky hot spot of families of Lanturns. But you still needed money for food for you and Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia had finally stopped laughing after a good five minutes of rolling on the floor laughing (You had always had an easy job of making her laugh) and she finally jumped up on the bed next to you. \"Hahaha, ok sorry about that, it was such a funny joke Master!\" she says while trying to hold in the last few chuckles. \"What were we talking about again?\" \"We were talking about how you already made all my dreams come true\" you say while scratching her behind her horn which causes another murr to escape her throat. And all though she loved the scratching, Ophelia was not satisfied with that answer. She knew that was not true and he was putting up a brave face for her and after today, that was no longer gonna cut it. Her master meant the world to her and was determined to <b>actually</b> make her Master's dreams come true. It was then that she saw her Master's laptop and remembered his other dreams. \"But Master, what about your other dreams?!\" she asks. \"What other dreams?\" you ask while closing out of another useless job website with nothing. \"You know the ones, the ones where your super small being taken care of by giant human ladies and Pokemon. Those dreams.\" She says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For several days, Aki had been bringing home increasingly shady charms and berries and the like, making vague and sinister comments, and generally giving you looks that had this look that screamed \"This is gonna be fun\", though none of them ever did anything. She just kind of...did things...without telling anyone, least of all you, like walking off into weird parts of the forest, using your computer for no reason you could discern, and using your money to buy chintzy good luck charms and dreamcatchers with intended effects that were poorly described but just made the house smell like dust. There was also that visit to the Move Tutor she did on her own, after which he would lock his doors and look nervously out the windows when you passed by with Aki. But always, she tried to push you through it ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why even bring them up then?\" You continue, in at this point ritual protest against Aki's campaign of occult impulses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They told me not to take it from one of the old shrine rooms, warning of its immense power and blah blah. I don't even think it belonged there, I think some magician left it there accidentally. Not important.\" She runs through the sentence at a blistering pace, leaving you in the dust as to most of what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you steal it from the shrine, Aki?\" You ask. \"I know nobody uses it for anything, but it's like a monument, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, just try it already!\" Aki moans, headbutting your waist. She's larger than most Zoruas, being 3 whole feet tall. Most people who saw her were surprised by it, but you'd gotten used to it. You turn the weird seashell-shaped object over in your hand. It looked like a brooch, sort of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...how?\" <br>\r\nAki looks up at you for a brief moment and ducks her shoulders in what you guess very quickly is a shrug. She looks back down the next second, though. You decide to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press the object against the top of a fist with a thumb, and uncertain, you say \"Okay, charm, if you do anything, D-do your stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, nothing happens. Then, a booming voice thunders from the charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Pick a number, One through Ten.</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki looks up again, sparkles in her eyes. She is grinning. You shift your head, as if trying to find a better angle to look at the strange charm. <br>\r\n\"Go on, pick a number, dude.\" (Aki was horribly informal with you for no reason you could figure out.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh,\" You squint at the charm for a moment. \"Nine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Okay. 1...2...3...Go!</b>\" The charm bellows, then explodes out of your hand into pieces all over the place, leaving a cloud of dust in the air around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck, Aki?\" You sputter, waving your hands through the air and coughing, trying to get all the dust out of your face. You couldn't see anything. \"Why do you bring these things home!? Is that all it does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Aki's voice pierces your cloud, and you blink twice to get the dust out of your eyes. You find yourself face to face with your Zorua, but she's much bigger, however. She has an innocent smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"It also does...\"</span></div></div>",

At this point, it wasn't too severe, but you sense it would be soon enough. You glance in the direction of your Zorua. She was pacing in a strange way, where each set of legs on a given side of her body were moving in different directions, but were also in the air at the same time. It's almost like she was skipping without the fast jumping part of the skip. The motion strikes you as probably taking a lot of practice.<br>\r\n\"Aki, please explain what you've been doing with my money.\" You have closed your eyes, not yet ready to address the elephant in the room, that being your shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you should sit down. This is a long story. You ready?\" She says, voice difficult to hear because she was continuously walking away and not facing you. <br>\r\n\"Please face me when you're talking. And stop walking. It's getting...<b> loud</b>.\"<br>\r\n\"So you watch a lot of porn, bro. Like, a lot. Like, an absurd -\" <br>\r\n\"Please move on.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay. So I do as well, and -\"<br>\r\n\"Is this a necessary part of the story?\" You ask, opening your eyes to look at the ceiling. It wasn't as far away as you had been taught by fiction to expect it to be. It actually looked the same distance away, plus a few feet. That's what your surroundings looked like, like the point of view one might have if you just had your head pressed against the floor.<br>\r\n\"It. Is completely necessary.\" Aki licks her lips in a very I'm-not-hungry-I'm-just-licking-my-lips-for-body-language sort of way. For a moment, you lose focus and think about how cute she looks from across the room. She continues with the \"story\".<br>\r\n\"I noticed a trend from our histories, the other weekend, you know? And it was -\" You held up a hand, and made a gesture with both your arms. It was \"wrap it up\", because you didn't like hearing the name of your fetish out loud. You were a dignity-first person, and this situation was quickly removing every aspect of yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. Because I'm a microphile and you're a macrophile <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><i>(She said it!)</i></font>, I've been buying every cult-y charm and talisman on the market for fantasy fulfillers. But...\"<br>\r\n\"They're all ripoffs?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Exactly! So I cut out the whooole \"fantasy\" middleman and stole a charm which claims to shrink folks from the mountain. And it worked! <b>Hooray!</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the \"hooray\", Aki hops in the air, quite close to you now, her body now three times your height already. You watched the short leap, putting your hand against your head, which was a mistake. You should've been putting your hands on the ground. The tail hits first, and a wave of dust, like a dry ocean wave, blows you off your feet and back into a sitting position. You were quite skinny and tall without a lot of padding, so it hurt more than it probably should've. Then, the rest of Aki came down. Her front left paw hits first, crashing awkwardly on the ground with a shabby crash. Her face twisted into a frown of awkward surprise. It was at this moment that you and Aki share a thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach leg following the first lands in painful-looking positions, you though you didn't see all of them, because she is on top of you in an instant. You were buried in the huge amounts of fur at her breast as Aki fell whole and whole on top of you. The fluffy press is like losing a wrestling match to a woolly mammoth. You attempt to sass Aki, but get a mouthful of weirdly thick hairs, which you surmise is because you're at this point probably a sixth of your height. Instead, you decide to kick and punch as hard as you can, and yell angrily. This needless to say gets the message across very quickly to Aki, who gets up very quickly. She frantically stands at attention, as is traditional when she feels she's made a terrible mistake, then breaks her militaristic stance in favor of a more informal slouch, head looking down at you lying straight down on your back, sprawled out and tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoldier\u2026\" You start. \u201cCurb your excitement, for ONE moment.\u201d You spoke at a volume like you were speaking to your whole team.<br>\r\n\"I'm super sorry, master! I -! \" She starts to panic, but you stop her.<br>\r\n\"Let me finish.\"<br>\r\n\"Erp-!\" She sucks in her lips, like she just tasted something sour.<br>\r\n\"I...<b>approve</b> of this financial venture.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry...!\" She repeats, then does a double take. \"Uhh, did I hear that wrong?\" She asks, still uncertain and frazzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you decided to do this. For the both of us, I mean. And, as long as you don't use my shrinking as an excuse for mutiny, and promise to return all the other, useless occult garbage you've bought, I will authorize you, and by extension me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>...to have as much fun as possible.\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki's eyes lit up. It was always nice when you showed your heart from underneath your all-business exterior, but this was easily the highlight of her day, and you could tell. She looked like she could cry tears of joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, let me give you a hug.\" You say, getting up back onto your feet. Aki slides in, blushing slightly at how your body now doesn't quite reach her rather...imperial...midsection. You hug just one of her front legs, barely able to wrap your arms around it. She grins like a madwoman, and, when the hug ends after what seems like a beautiful hour, she backs off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you ask, \"I picked a \"nine\". How much shrinking is a nine, anyway?\" You ask. You had just hit the four inch mark, and were beginning to wonder when exactly you would hit your final size, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, ha!\" Aki had fully recovered to her informal and almost rogue-ish self. \"The silly old couple who wanted me not to take it didn't know a lick about it, either. But, while we wait for you to sloooooowly dwindle to whatever size you end up at, do you wanna...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's go hang out on the couch.\" Aki seems to bounce, raring to go and play. You knew her, though, and she would tucker out of this the second she hit furniture. <br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you say. \"We can go sit around for a while and wait out this shrinking if you want. But I'm in no condition to easily get up on such a monument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aforementioned and legendary couch stood in a corner of the room which was deliberately designed to look like it was never used, yet in reality was used all the time, though, it should be stated, not by more than one occupant at a time. It was an area of which to be ashamed among you and your comrades (which is to say, your Pokemon.), and it was, despite being public, an incredibly private spot, and one which nobody was expected to linger on for too long. There was a sitting area out in the open, of course, but the lonely couch in the corner was a cornerstone (no pun intended) which represented some comfortable weakness. Sitting there in that corner alone with your thoughts was like a calming sleep, even if you were only there for a few moments. It was more private than a bed, most likely. Being asked to sit there with someone else was getting away with murder, really. The couch <b>was, undeniably, legendary </b>. It held some mystical sort of power beyond what a normal over-quilted brown leather couch should possess. And here you and Aki were going to share it. The same thought space, the same private, me-time space. It was <b>totally</b> romantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...At least, that's what Aki tells you, gently boosting you up to a cushion with her nose, before hopping up on it herself. She flops sideways, exposing her underbelly in a surrounding of you. It wasn't by much, yet, but you <b>were</b> still shrinking, since the hugeness of the long haired torso definitely seemed larger now than it had when it was haphazardly upon you. Aki's legs pull in around you, nudging you and holding you against the big girl. You slump back against Aki as she stretches lazily. You strike up the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why'd you want to do it in the first place?\" You couldn't see it, but you could tell from the way the torso changed rhythms in rising and falling that the question surprised Aki. <br>\r\n\"What d'ya mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I would never have thought to do this sort of thing, and I wouldn't have ever thought someone else would. Why go through with it?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? Well, I guess I just wanted to actually experience having you as my little buddy for a while. We don't really get a lot of vacation time, you know? So, I thought, why not make work a little more interesting? Spice things up at home base, eh?\" <br>\r\n\"No, I meant, why go through the trouble day after day of bringing home something to make ME happy, and keep trying to find some \"wish fulfillment\" charm for me?\" <br>\r\n\"We're compatible?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant, missy.\" You bumped your head lightly against the expanding downy coat. \"If, in theory, you finally brought home something that would grant any wish you wanted, why give it to me? You could just use it yourself and shrink me all on your own. There was never any need to pass things through me like you did.\" <br>\r\nSome heat seemed to pour behind you. You didn't need any kind of sign to tell that Aki was blushing. Her legs obscured most of your view of the room, and hid her face from you for the time being, but you could tell. <br>\r\n\"Erp! W-well, see... I wanted it to be... special?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would've been special either way, Aki. It's both of our fantasies. What's the real reason?\" Her breathing was getting slightly faster. It struck you as cute. <br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh, could you r-repeat that? I c-couldn't hear you! Your voice is so very small, oh no!\" She faked, unconvincingly. <br>\r\n\"You heard me both times. Why did you want me to shrink myself? I mean, it clearly wasn't your intent to trick me into it until just today, when you skipped the hoopla and just brought home a shrinker. You said it yourself. Why?\"<br>\r\nA sigh breezed over you. Aki's body increased in heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... I didn't just want you. I wanted you to want <b>me.</b> I'm a bully. That's my job, that's the task I'm given on the team, that's what I'm best at, you know? I'm the go-getter.\" A stale but not unpleasant wind wafted past from somewhere you couldn't quite tell. You suspected it was Aki, but you didn't really know for certain. <br>\r\n\"I wanted to be a diva for once, kind of. I didn't want to have to shrink you on my own, I wanted you to want to shrink <b>for</b> me. But I couldn't make that happen, no matter how much I tried. I couldn't make you teach me Minimize, because I couldn't learn it. I couldn't find a charm which would let you wish to shrink, because they're all useless rocks and necklaces with no power at all. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make you take the step towards this. I ended up having to trick you into it. I was pulling all the weight, even to set this up. I - I didn't want to have that happen, but I failed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became conscious of hitting the two inch mark. Aki was twice as big now as she was when she could smush you underneath her by tripping. You couldn't possibly get your arms around one of her enormous legs now. They were pillars of fur now. As these thoughts passed through you, you struggled to think of a reply to comfort her. You couldn't quite find anything to say. But you had learned not to accept unconditional failure. You stood up. The huge, thick fabric covering the couch gave a little as Aki turned over slightly, pushing her face into the couch. She hadn't felt you stand up, it seemed. You took advantage of this fact. Sneaking past her gaze, you snuck behind a front paw. It was large, but that wouldn't stop you. You jump clear over it, not making any contact with the fluffy pad at all. Your cover remained intact. You crept silently under Aki's black chin, and, when her breathing started to slow down again, you make your move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds thereafter, Aki felt a heartfelt and deep kiss, from seemingly nowhere in particular, light, and small, tiny even, but deeper more likely than any kiss that could ever be intended for just a Zorua, or any other battling Pokemon or pet. This was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot up, shaken, not stirred, and stared at you with deep, sharp eyes filled with the bad sort of confusion. The rapidly moving weight dissolved the solid ground, launching you onto a splayed sit, propped up barely on your back by your elbows, as you looked up at the exasperated and monolithic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this isn't like you.\" She spoke, and the words seemed to shake the couch harder than her huge frame and intense body possibly could. You became aware of yourself hitting the inch and a half mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Aki, wait. I was just trying to make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long silence passes. It occurs to you that for the longest time, you had been living in a broken home, and didn't even realize it. You were pressing too hard on Aki's narrative, and now there was some kind of rift here, like the two feet, ten and a half inches of height difference between you two were filled with transgressions and offenses and pain you didn't even know were there. You held your head, and felt bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you stopped doing both of those things. Here was the bright side: it used to be three feet one of all that ugliness. Even though you were still shrinking, you couldn't ever get to that level again. This was an improvement. You look confidently back up at Aki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it too personally, Aki. Please, sit back down.\"<br>\r\nSome life seemed to shoot back into her eyes just then. And you would get rid of the confusion in them momentarily.<br>\r\n\"You didn't fail at all. I still accepted those things from you, day after day, even though none of them did anything. It's like you said. We both wanted this. <b>I</b> wanted this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat we should be doing now isn't this. We should be enjoying each other as we are right now, like a romantic couple. I mean, you're such a big, strong girl, you know?\" You smiled, just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki rolled onto her back, sweeping you once again onto her stomach, on top of her. You both looked each other in the eyes. Aki was like a living landscape to you now. <br>\r\n\"Thanks, master. That's why you're the boss, boss!\" She panted a little, her head seeming to light up once more with the familiar and friendly girlishness you loved. \"I'm sorry for being such a drama queen. I just wanted you to...love me, you know?\" <br>\r\n\"I do love you!\" You reply somewhat eagerly. It was uncanny how her mood could pick back up so quickly. Maybe you mentioning being like a romantic couple had sparked something.<br>\r\n\"So! You said we'd be like a romantic couple, right? Well, we've still got some time, and you still look like you're shrinking to me, so, what would a romantic pair like <b>us</b> be doing at a time like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to think of something to solidify Aki's return to spirits. Two things immediately spring to mind, and you decide between them quickly.</span></div></div>",

That's not what I had in mind...\" she responded, sounding disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither,\" you replied, patting her immense belly, taking notice that the thick, black fur was still expanding around you.<br>\r\n\"But it's a good start, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrug was the only response you managed to get from your now gigantic pokemon looked at your incredibly tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the size of an incredibly tiny bug to her, but the whole thing was turning out to be more exciting each minute that passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she simply said, still using that informal yet disappointed tone. Clearly, her mind was currently filling itself with all the nice, \u2018fun\u2019 things you could be doing together in this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout adding any more words, you knelt down on the soft ground and placed both your hands on Aki's tummy before you started to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubted she could feel your hands sliding onto the warm skin hidden beneath her dark fur, but, to your surprise, she let out a moan shortly after you began rubbing, shaking the ground beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aki!\" you shouted, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-Sorry, master,\" she apologized, looking at you; you could swear you saw the fur of her cheeks going from black to red.<br>\r\n\"That felt really good... could ya continue that?\" she asked, the disappointment faded from her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, satisfied, as you stood back up and began rubbing Aki's stomach once again, backing her into a state of bliss, which she expressed with incomprehensible but definitely pleased mutterings escaping her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" you chimed at some point,<br>\r\n\"This was your... thing, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki perked up, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?

Since when...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki let out another moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A long time... heh, it was fun, y'know! Spying on you while you watched that stuff on your computer at night, believing that you were alone, while in reality I was there all the time...\" she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were on fire; your hands abruptly stopped, and your head sprang up to look at the still expanding Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki snickered.<br>\r\n\"Yep... I can use illusions, remember?\" she said, staring at you, still shrinking while onto her belly. You looked incredibly cute to her, a tiny bug massaging her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those nights together, fantasizing about tinies at my paws like in those websites... and when I finally figured out that you had the opposite fetish, I simply had to do something - but, please, keep those hands moving. It feels wonderful!\" she chimed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you resumed your work, but went silent for a while; Aki went silent too, save for her moans, which kept escaping her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Aki broke the silence again,<br>\r\n\"This is want romantic couples like us do? I can see why - this is wonderful dude!\" she chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe where I am, doing what I'm doing.\" you mused, petting your pokemon softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I know - it's incredible one of those charms finally worked, huh?

I'm so happy... it finally happened...\" she admitted, her voice assuming a more girlish tone, the one you loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though it's hard to believe this isn't a dream... yeah. I'm happy too, Aki.\" you said, laying down and enveloping what you could of your pokemon in a hug, kissing the furry surface of Aki's stomach, getting a mouthful of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous Zorua blushed massively at this, but shot you a look of pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, by doing so, she quickly became aware of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she chimed all of a sudden,<br>\r\n\"You stopped shrinking! You're so small!\" she said, with an expression that made you understand that she wanted to add \u2018And so cute!\u2019, but she kept such comment to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled yourself up, taking notice that you weren't shrinking anymore indeed, and that you couldn't be taller than a few centimeters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, you were the size of one of Aki's pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up into those blue suns that were the eyes of your pokemon and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... it looks like I stopped...\" a doubt found its way inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Aki,\" you started while the giantess gently rolled to the side, letting you fall off her belly and onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there... is there any way I can grow back?\" you asked, expecting the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would you - you! - want to grow back right now? The fun hasn't even begun, bro!\" she chimed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeriness was contagious, you discovered as you as you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll give you that.\" you said, before taking a few steps back to fully admire your goddess, who was staring at you with a smirk glued on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Any ideas about what you and me should do to enjoy this situation more now?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki snickered.</span></div></div>",

From this angulation you had a pretty view of her swinging tail and, of course, her nethers. The sight made your blood travel to your head considerably faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic Zorua snickered again as she looked back at an indefinite spot on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aki!\" you shouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out, dude!\" came her voice, which caused her stomach to vibrate.<br>\r\n\"You've got a soft landing, no?\" she said, referring to the leather couch she was standing onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, will you let go so we can keep this thing movin' already?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words made you close your eyes as you let go of the fur, feeling the leather under your back after a short fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gleeful giantess noticed you falling beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou re-opened your eyes, catching a last glimpse of Aki's gigantic crotch before she shifted position; her hind legs shifted too as the giantess circled you, before she laid belly-down on the couch, right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Don't ever do that again.\" you said with a time between disappointment and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever, now...\" her paws extended and were gently placed in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Would you be so kind to massage my little paws as well? Thought I bet they look like two giant monsters to you, huh?\" she said with a massive grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, her paws were really massive to you, two massive red carpets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lil' master, give 'em some attention.\" Aki continued, pushing both her paws closer to you.<br>\r\n\"Just like in those-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it, Aki!\" you interrupted as you gently placed your hands on the red fur, becoming aware that her paws were incredibly smooth, like two giant red cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liking it already?\" Aki chimed with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... yeah,\" you replied, fighting the urge to dive into the smooth red fur and lay in it, lost in the furry jungle for hours.<br>\r\n\"Looks like I really took great care of you, huh?\" you mused instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, master.\" Aki replied with a blush, again forgetting the \u2018though girl\u2019 character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you began rubbing the giant paw slowly, your fingertips tickling the warm skin hidden beneath tons of black/red fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe endless Zorua in front of you giggled at the sensation.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... go on...\" she muttered, pleased with your massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's softening.\" you chimed, but Aki had an even bigger smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna go on with the \u2018dominant giantess\u2019 thing? I think I'd be pretty good at it...\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind briefly went back to the websites you used to visit at the mention, and you recalled that you were going to lick Aki's paws clean if she decided to start acting mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily decided that you didn't want to go through that... not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... no, thank you. Maybe later.\" you said, and Aki began laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight blush on your face, you began petting between her toes, tickling the giant vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you worked, you noted that there wasn't any hint of bad smell around her paws, which disappointed you a bit: the stories you read mentioned smelly and utterly disgusting paws/feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you minded, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Aki,\" you called as you took a step back,<br>\r\n\"Why don't you lift your paw so I can finish up?\" you said eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki seemed to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe,\" she laughed nervously,<br>\r\n\"I apologize for anything nasty you might find down there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw in front of you rose, revealing a big, circular pad in the middle of Aki's under-paw, coated in a thin layer of dust, mixed with what had to be crushed grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, mountain trip, y'know...\" Aki admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, where did you even steal that charm?\" you asked as you began wiping the grass away with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I reply to that question already?\" she replied with another question, before she quieted down and observed with a joyful spark in her eyes as she watched you, a tiny ant beneath her foot, wiping her paw clean from all the debris it collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt blissful, and allowed herself to giggle - giggle, not snicker - as she felt you tickling her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it came the moment when you began rubbing her paw-pad, pressing your hands into the smooth flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a surprised cry at first, but soon found pleasure in the sudden feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep goin' master,\" she moaned,<br>\r\n\"That feels wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you nearly an hour before Aki was finally satisfied with your massage and asked you to transfer yourself to her other paw, which still lacked attention and, according to Aki, \u2018felt lonely\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour of constant rubbing, you pulled back, your arms sore from all the petting you've been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt satisfied though: this was a dream came true, and felt flattered each time you made Aki moan from your massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you were done, her paws were rid of all the dust and grass they once had collected, and Aki herself had a blissful expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was soon replaced by disappointment when she saw you stepping back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'Aww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could offer a justification for your abrupt halt, Aki's muzzle pinned you to the leather texture of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body began moving up and down along the movements of the giantess' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" she chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed back the massive wall of slate-grey fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't like me, huh?\" you recalled,<br>\r\n\"Why, is this like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki suddenly stopped, and you felt her cheek flaring up before it was lifted from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zorua offered an awkward smile, before she lowered her head again, her paws circling you; they pushed you back into Aki's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. This was...\" she started, but interrupted herself while you felt yourself being surrounded by smoothness and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the word you are seeking for would be, \u2018special\u2019.\" you chimed, placing a hand on her large cheek and beginning to pet that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pokemon remained silent, but nodded as a happy expression appeared on her face, her cheek brushing against you as her head moved up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell between you and the dark-type, a wonderful silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need words, you were communicating your feelings to Aki with your heart alone, and she did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while though, she broke the silence,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... this was pretty fun!\" she chimed, back to her usual self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" you agreed,<br>\r\n\"But we've got still a lot to do,\" it was the first time you mentioned your fetish out loud, and discovered that you didn't particularly care while in presence of Aki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the familiar from you loved and dreaded appeared on the goddess' face.</span></div></div>",

So far, Aki was perfect and you felt eager to continue, though you would have never admitted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she finally spoke, her voice coming down on you like it was an angel talking to you. A rowdy, perverted angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you mention you wanted to take this... further?\" she mused, her grin glued to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I really did.\" you confirmed, eagerly nodding your head for good measure, causing Aki to snicker loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eager, ain't ya master?\" she said, her muzzle inching closer to you. A wave of hot air began blowing past you gently as Aki slowly lowered herself, taking as much time as possible to accomplish the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a whole minute, she was finally able to make eye contact with you, despite you being as tall as one of her pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see your own reflection in her humongous eyes, a teeny little human lost in an endless, quiet light blue sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I certainly have a few ideas. Though I'll need you to trust me fully on this. Do you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never thought you were going to speak these words,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Aki, I blindly trust you.\" you said without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki grinned, before her lips covered her teeth; her tongue poked out of her mouth and it slid across her lips slowly, much like it had been doing earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me rephrase that. Y'know, just makin' sure.\" she continued, each word sending waves of her breath blowing past you,<br>\r\n\"Do you trust that I won't hurt you in any way while I'm doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward, leaning forward and kissing Aki's cheek, which grew a pink shade while you got a mouthful of dark fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to spit out a particular thick strand in order to be able to talk,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aki, I do trust you. You've been incredibly good with this thing so far, so I trust you'd never do anything to put my life in danger,\" you said, blushing as well,<br>\r\n\"Not after all that has happened between us in the past few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention made Aki blush furiously, but her grin remained, a loving spark appeared in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout adding another word, her mouth came forward. You watched as her lips puckered and pressed themselves onto your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe touch of her soft lips on your body felt incredible; the large pair was incredibly soft, it was like being embraced by a cloud while their warmth transferred to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki held the kiss for a whole minute, though to you felt a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess' lips began traveling upwards, until they slid past your chest, neck, face and stopped on top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Aki's mouth gaped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely had time to process what was going on before her lips closed gently closed around your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any other circumstances, you would have probably freaked out from the sheer fear of being decapitated by the razor-sharp fangs that occupied the slippery cave that was the Zorua's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Aki was being extremely careful: slowly, she began sucking the rest of your body inside of her oral cavity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour upper body was slowly being sucked inside as well; you closed your eyes, enjoying the feeling of Aki's warm insides, not even caring about the saliva raining on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chest and arms were pulled inside, and Aki's mouth stopped at your waist. You laid your head on her tongue as it licked and tasted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you sure taste good~\" Aki moaned, a wave of sound falling on you while you were sucked inside, this time up to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs flailed outside for a second, before they too joined you in the inside of Aki's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips closed, sealing you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutomatically, you grabbed a hold of her tongue as you looked around the fleshy cavern; the sight of the razor teeth or the deep abyss behind you would have been enough to scare the hell out of anyone else, but you felt serene, knowing that you were completely safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant red muscle beneath you began speeding up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Aki moaned deeply as she slowly slid a paw to her already dripping nethers. She focused on the motions in her mouth, she imagined your situation; her cheeks flared up, her groin quivered and her hind legs shook as her paw began rubbing her pulsing crotch - Ah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp moan echoed around you while the tongue beneath you began launching you back and forth within the confines of the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were initially pinned against Aki's palate, only to be then thrown against her elastic cheek, smothered under her tongue; at some point, you landed against one of the hard teeth, and the affectionate tongue was far too quick to find you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned as it began licking you once again, lingering particularly in between your legs, causing you to moan louder, your own moans becoming one with Aki's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Zorua kept masturbating feverishly as she imagined all sorts of perverted scenarios with her tiny trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt so-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... ngh...\" she moaned, nearing her orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, she couldn't hold it in anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ear-splitting scream roared around you, nearly deafening you as Aki came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you were soaked to the bone in the thick saliva, but you didn't mind it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aki...\" you murmured softly, feeling your surroundings shaking as the giantess whose mouth you were in panted after such violent orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you felt the glob of saliva you were trapped in sliding forward, past her teeth and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold air assaulted you as the saliva carried you down, breaking your fall as you landed back on your couch, creating a minuscule puddle on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes met with the sight of the Zorua giantess, blushing furiously, her nethers still dripping white liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Aki, on the couch?\" you ironically asked, causing the giantess to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-Sorry bro, you just felt so-\" she moaned, before looking at you again, her smirk wider than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though the fun - ngh! - had just begun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as well as you watched Aki standing up onto shaky legs.</span></div></div>",

And yet, the dark-type seemed perfectly able to remember that you weren't a toy, but her precious little master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun Aki?\" you asked, grinning, while the vixen lowered her head a bit more, pushing her cheek against you and nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet, master!\" she exclaimed loudly, before shooting you a grin,<br>\r\n\"And you, whaddya say if we go on with this lil' game of ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you even asking?\" you replied, causing her to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess shot you a lustful smirk, before she began moving, slowly; not hastily, risking to spoil your fun by doing so, but slowly, teasingly, in a playful and mischievous way you loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki stepped back, her bent legs regained their original position as she stood back to her full height, towering above your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as her body made a 180 degree turn as she turned her face away from you, your view replaced by Aki's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail wagged playfully, in a hypnotic fashion. You followed its entrancing movement until Aki's voice claimed you back to reality,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready dude?\" she chimed in an excited voice, her blue eyes glancing backwards, trying to spot the extremely tiny doll that was her master on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply, but braced yourself as you saw the humongous behind beginning to descend towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in every little detail, the thick strands of black fur, the fluffy tail wagging, the hole in the middle of Aki's behind and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark became your world as the rear halted its descent upon reaching its destination - you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were smothered in between the leather couch and the furry butt as Aki fully sat on you, causing you to disappear underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large strands of fur tickled you as you were pinned under Aki's right butt-cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, muffled through tons of fur and flesh, you heard Aki moaning in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" she moaned,<br>\r\n\"Bro, if only you could feel yourself under my butt... you make such a good pillow on this hard couch~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled to yourself as you laid still, feeling the smooth fur all over you; like you were being a pillow for Aki, Aki was being a pillow for you. A huge, gentle pillow sitting on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo please Aki the best you could, you began squirming beneath the Zorua's butt. Almost immediately, the vixen began moaning in a louder fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Master, keep that up...\" she stuttered, while your surroundings began shaking all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki's butt inched upwards, before instantly falling back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was repeated several times as the giant Zorua gently bounced on top of your small body while you pleasured your dark-type goddess by squirming under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... ngh... ah...\" she moaned incoherently while her butt hovered above you again; this time, Aki rose her gigantic backside up in the air, before bringing it down on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you weren't pinned against her furry butt-cheek, but ended in her butt-crack instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh~\" Aki moaned as you found yourself face-to-face with the giantess' quivering butthole. Her tail kept wagging, tickling your head while you were firmly trapped beneath Aki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling you wedged in between her cheeks only made Aki moan in an even louder fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer left paw shakily made its way towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never reached you though, it stopped just before you as it landed on her still dripping vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' whole body quivered with pleasure as she began rubbing her crotch, causing a wave of pleasure to spread throughout her body like a shockwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brain was overtook by lust as she imagined your situation, you stuck under her butt with no way to escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole world shook as Aki masturbated once more with your doll-sized body stuck right under her anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puckered hole opened and closed, each time it gaped open a rank yet arousing stench assaulting your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, with an ear-splitting moan, Aki came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shook more than ever as Aki screamed in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, everything suddenly became quiet; you breathed free air again as the Zorua released you by collapsing on her side, causing the whole couch to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sore, but satisfied with yourself, proud you were able to pleasure your goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-Wonderful...\" she barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood back on your feet as you walked  onto shaky legs towards Aki's giant muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could speak, the Zorua interrupted you by leaning forward, her lips lightly touching you as she smooched you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~mazing!\" she moaned lovingly, causing you to flush red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked towards your pokemon, lovingly petting her wall-sized cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's next for us Aki?\" you asked. She stifled a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

You were fine with being Aki's toy... as long as you were unharmed, but there weren't any problems about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, your giant pokemon looked pretty tired right now, maybe you could have allowed her (and yourself as well) to rest for a while?</span></div></div>",

Normally you would be cuddling up with your nice, cold Sneasel, but she said that she found something she wanted to check out on her own while you two were returning from your daily walk and training session of battling young, inexperienced trainers. But before you could ask her what it was, she grabbed her handmade, wooden handbag and went out the door. You just hope that she wasn't going to steal something and get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, her pulling that stunt and trying to steal that fresh, diamond ring from a recently engaged lass a week almost got you put in the slammer with ol' Bubba, and ol' Bubba likes younguns like you, sweetie-- you <i>quickly</i> shake off your train of thought. This scorching weather was driving you and your head balls to the wall, and as you lie on your couch, at this point stripped down to nothing but the bare minimum of your whitey tighties, you briefly wonder if it was going to be your death bed before you suddenly hear a knock, then the door opening to your little, grinning Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Hi master, I'm back! ...heh, look at ya, already stripped down for me and everything!\"</span> Your pink Pokemon teases with a smirk, even giving a little wolf whistle at you. At this point, you were unfazed by the way she spoke. She was always the kind to tease and be a mischievous little thing, but at the same time she was by far the sweetest Sneasel you could ever ask for, and not just because she was a shiny Pokemon, either. No, she always cared about you and your well-being with a smile and a jolly spring in her step. In fact, she's how you manage to have a roof over your head, and she knows it. She gets you money and free stuff, and you pamper her like a pretty little princess... though, maybe you've been pampering her a little too much, given how she was just a tad bit chubbier than other Sneasels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and smile at her as she kicks the door behind her, walking towards you with that wooden bag she took along as you sit up on the couch and go to gently ruffle her head, raising an eyebrow at all of the blueberries she picked. The bag was nearly full of 'em! <span class=\"cpink\">\"Surprise! Delicious-looking, aren't they?\"</span> she asks. <span class=\"cpink\">\"I think I deserve extra belly rubs for this, actually! These are very special and rare berries, I planted and raised them myself. These lil' things... well, I'm not gonna say. it's supposed to be a surprise! Go on, try one, tell me what you think!\"</span> She winks at you, with you just tilting your head in confusion. You always felt like you could trust your Sneasel at any given time, but she was a definite prankster. At the same time though, maybe this was supposed to be a genuine gift, and it'd be rude to say no, especially after she made these herself, just for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pop one of the blueberries into your mouth and slowly chew... it has a tart and wild flavor to it. You couldn't lie, though it tasted nice, it was just incredibly plain, and here she was hyping it up like it was the new sliced bread. As you pop another one into your mouth and smile at her, you just have to wonder...<br>\r\nWas she always this tall?<br>\r\nNo... she was growing right before your eyes! And so was your couch and everything else! Or you were just shrinking, that seems like more logical explanation. Your Sneasel just smiles at you as you suddenly realize what's going on, and she suddenly explains by the time your head could only reach up to her slightly pooched tummy, <span class=\"cpink\">\"They're minimize berries! The origin of how our species learned Minimize, master! You like 'em?</span> ...at first, you weren't sure what to think, but before you could reply she suddenly hugs you, pressing your face gently into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all was right with the world. You could feel her cool touch break the summer heat, and as you lie in her embrace you can't help but just barely manage to wrap your arms around her, pressing your face into her soft, fluffy belly. Her paw reaches down to pet your head. <span class=\"cpink\">\"I'll take that as a yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Continue with this storyline?))</span></div></div>",

A crowd had formed around them, watching with bated breath as the mightyena pulls off the marauder\u2019s mask. <i>\u201cMr. Mcmillan?\u201d</i> The crowd all gasps in unison as his grumpy face is revealed. Everyone seems shocked\u2026 except for the mightyena!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhy, of course!\u201d</b></span> She smiles, raising her snout proudly. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI knew it was him all along, ever since I saw that receipt for nose filters! That\u2019s when I realized; he\u2019s allergic to Pok\u00e9mon! That\u2019s why he\u2019s been dressing up as the ghost of Giovanni. He was trying to scare all the Pok\u00e9mon out of town!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I would\u2019ve, if it wasn\u2019t for this meddling Mightyena!\u201d The man grumbles angrily as he\u2019s dragged away by the police, sneezing all the while. Meanwhile, the cheering crowd gathered around the mightyena, giving her belly rubs and poffins as thanks for her amazing detective work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat work, Detective Mightyena! You cracked that case wide open!\u201d The chief of police congratulated the canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, it was no problem at all, really,\u201d</b></span> she shrugged it off. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAfter all, no mystery is too difficult for the greatest Pok\u00e9mon detective in all of Hoenn!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd all cheered, lifting the victorious detective up in their arms. Meanwhile, just offstage, a huge array of expensive cameras filmed the entire spectacle. \u201cAaannnddd\u2026\u201d The director shouted. \u201cCut!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad show. I mean, the kids still love it. But with all the recent competition, it just isn\u2019t getting the ratings it used to,\u201d</b> you say, walking through Mauville City with the mightyena by your side. The latest episode of <i>Detective Mightyena</i> just aired today, and like all the recent episodes, its ratings have been mediocre compared to recent seasons. As the titular mightyena\u2019s agent, you\u2019re having some concerns about her career. <b>\u201cI mean, you have to admit, <i>Detective Pikachu</i> is just the superior show.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHow could you say that? <i>Detective Pikachu</i> is a total rip off!\u201d</b></span> The mightyena groaned. To be specific, her name was Lesia, and she\u2019s always been rather \u2018ambitious\u2019 by Pok\u00e9mon standards. Rather than wanting to become the best fighter, Lesia always wanted to become a movie star, and dreamed of becoming a famous actress for Pok\u00e9star Studios one day. She spent years teaching herself English, then kick started her career by pitching <i>Detective Mightyena</i> to the Pok\u00e9mon Channel. Since that show has taken off, her popularity has slowly been building. However, the explosive premier of <i>Detective Pikachu</i> on Jubilife TV has been chipping away at that fame, and that\u2019s been driving her up the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cBe that as it may, the viewers have obviously made their decision. Its rise in fame has been\u2026 unprecedented. It\u2019s one of the top shows on air right now,\u201d</b> you say, grimly. Lesia was often too haughty and ambitious for her own good, so as her agent, it was your job to ground her. <b>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if our station will want to try to compete with that. Our show may not be renewed for another season, at this rate.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears droop, unable to come up with an argument. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cUgh\u2026 yeah, yeah, I know. You\u2019re right,\u201d</b></span> she sighs, <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cbut that just means we have to try even harder!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a brow, looking down at the grinning canine. <b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYou know! We have to think outside the box. Come up with something new, something people have never seen before!\u201d</b></span> She said, her voice brimming with excitement. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIn fact, I think I have the idea for the perfect pitch\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. This idea of hers could either by something revolutionary, or something terrible. <b>\u201cLay it on me.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOkay, but we\u2019re going to have to take a detour to the prop warehouse first\u2026\u201d</b></span> She said, suddenly making a sharp left turn in the direction of one of the studio warehouses. You pause, before deciding to follow her. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cSo, you know how Pok\u00e9star Studios always makes their movies super bombastic and action-packed? In comparison, most TV shows are mostly just people talking, because they can\u2019t afford to have that same kind of density of action scenes. Battles just take too much rehearsing, and special effects are too expensive,\u201d</b></span> she says as she walks, and you nod hesitantly. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, what if I told you I found a way to make single second of a show action-packed, while still having a super small budget?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re crazy,\u201d</b> you chuckle as you step into the warehouse. Without skipping a beat, the mightyena eagerly slips past you and walks over to a huge tarp, which is draped over something on the floor. Lesia excitedly pulls the tarp aside, to reveal a huge, miniature diorama of an entire city! She smiles up at you as you stare at the diorama, uncomprehending. <b>\u201c... what am I looked at, here?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI present the set of my new show; <i>Attack of the 50-Foot Mightyena</i>!\u201d</b></span> She smiles proudly, trotting around the diorama to demonstrate, careful not to break anything. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI found this old, completely realistic miniature replica of Mauville City, and I think it\u2019d be perfect for the show! Think of it; just your average Mightyena suddenly growing to massive sizes, and terrorizing the entire town! Every single episode, you could have buildings crumbling, bridges collapsing, and battles against entire armies\u2026 and it\u2019d be super cheap, since all the props are only a few centimeters big!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, starting to understand her idea. The diorama was pretty realistic. With a few clever perspective tricks, you could definitely make it look like a humongous Pok\u00e9mon was actually rampaging through a town. <b>\u201cI dunno\u2026\u201d</b> You said, tapping your chin. The Pok\u00e9mon Channel has a pretty young audience, and you\u2019re not sure the premise of this show would go over well. <b>\u201cSounds a little scary for a children\u2019s show.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWe can market this one to older audiences! Branch out a little!\u201d</b></span> She insists. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cThere are too many kids shows already. It\u2019s a saturated market. People want something more mature and dramatic nowadays. Something innovative!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHmm\u2026 okay, I see what you\u2019re getting at, here,\u201d</b> you nod contemplatively. This was actually a rather creative idea for a show. <b>\u201cSo, how is it going to work? We don\u2019t have the special effects budget to make it look like people are really in this diorama. Are all the characters in town just going to be little plastic figurines? That seems like it\u2019d ruin the tension.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAha! No, you see, that\u2019s the real genius part,\u201d</b></span> she grins widely. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cThe characters of the show will just be regular actors\u2026 shrunken down!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her, wondering if she\u2019s joking. Nope, she\u2019s serious. <b>\u201c... okay, you\u2019ve lost me.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sorted through some boxes, until pulling out a plastic container filled with 6 colorful little cubes. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYou know what a Miracle Block is, right?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThey allow humans to use a Pok\u00e9mon move, yes,\u201d</b> you nod, raising a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, these Blocks are infused with the move Minimize. So we just need to have the actors eat them, and they\u2019ll shrink down to just the right size,\u201d</b></span> she says, looking a little nervous as she presented her idea, hoping you\u2019d like it. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019ll look super realistic! Trust me! I mean, there\u2019s no harm in trying, right?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin as you contemplated her idea. Really, it could go either way. Either it\u2019ll result in a pretty cool show, or it\u2019ll result in something terrible. Guess that\u2019s the risk you take in showbiz. <b>\u201cOkay. Interesting concept,\u201d</b> you say. <b>\u201cSo what did you bring me here for?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWeeelll\u2026 I sort of need someone to help me film a pilot episode. Y\u2019know, a proof of concept for my pitch,\u201d</b></span> she smiled, nervously. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ve already got everything set up and planned out. I just need somebody to play the whole of the, uh, \u2018victim\u2019.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. <b>\u201cI\u2019m an agent, not an actor. This isn\u2019t my job.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cPlease? Just as a favor? I mean, you\u2019re the only person I trust with this...\u201d</b></span> She says, and the adorable look on her face as she pleads wore down on your willpower. Still, you were resolute. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI mean, if my career crumbles, you\u2019re out of a job, too\u2026\u201d</b></span> You sigh. Guess you can\u2019t argue with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright,\u201d</b> you relent, and the mightyena wags her tail wildly with excitement. <b>\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d</b></span></div></div>",

Like, if I accidentally stepped on you \u2014 which I won\u2019t \u2014 you\u2019d be completely unharmed.\u201d</b></span> You get chills at the thought as you look down at the block in your hands. Somehow, she wasn\u2019t very reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright. Here goes nothing...\u201d</b> You sigh, eventually working up the courage to pop the block in your mouth and start chewing. It actually tasted surprisingly pleasant, like gum, though when you swallowed it down, you got a slight sickly feeling in your gut as if you\u2019d just taken a pill. <b>\u201cOkay, so\u2026 when\u2019s it supposed to kick in?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIt already has, you just have to use the move,\u201d</b></span> she instructs. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cJust do what a Pok\u00e9mon does. It\u2019s kind of hard to explain, but\u2026 for a beginner, you can try closing your eyes, channelling all your energy, and just focusing your entire mind on the idea of shrinking.\u201d</b></span> Interesting. You always sort of wondered how Pok\u00e9mon used their moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh, alright\u2026\u201d</b> You close your eyes and take a deep breath, focusing every bit of brain energy on visualizing yourself shrinking. You quickly slip into an almost meditative state, and sure enough, you can faintly feel yourself\u2026 changing. Eventually, the curiosity forced you to open your eyes. <b>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</b> You gasped in surprise when you realized everything around you looked so much larger all of a sudden. Looking down at your body, you realized you were only four feet tall now, after only a few minutes of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cLanguage!\u201d</b></span> She frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSorry!

You feel the changes become more and more drastic the longer you concentrate. Eventually, you work your way down to three inches. The next time you open your eyes, you\u2019re almost knocked off your feet by the shock of how unbelievably tiny you now are. The buildings of the diorama now towered over you as if they were real. In fact, the entire \u2018city\u2019 seems incredibly realistic from this perspective. If you didn\u2019t know better, you could fool yourself into believing you weren\u2019t shrunken at all.  <b>\u201cO-okay, I think I\u2019m ready!\u201d</b> You cry out to Lesia. Interestingly, despite your tinier size, your voice was just as loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare in horror as you see Lesia round the corner. From this angle, she looked\u2026 humongous! She was over ten times your current size! It truly did look like a 50 foot tall Mightyena was rampaging through the city streets. When she noticed you standing there, she laid down in front of you, until you were eye-level with her. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh. My. Arceus. You are adorable!\u201d</b></span> She giggles, a smile on her huge face as you stare at her in awe. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHehe!

You know she would never harm you, but you still back away nervously, not wanting to be so close to the huge Pok\u00e9mon. <b>\u201cJ-just\u2026 be careful, alright? Don\u2019t\u2026 step on me or anything.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m super careful. There\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll accidentally crush anything,\u201d</b></span> she smiles, standing up proudly. Just as she says that, her paw gets caught on a street light, and she goes fumbling backwards. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAaahhh!\u201d</b></span> You winced as she loses her balance, coming crashing down on some buildings behind her, which let out a chilling cracking sound. She sits there for a moment, her eyes wide, realizing what she had just done. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cUh oh.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018uh oh\u2019?\u201d</b> You grit your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI think I might\u2019ve just crushed the the gym building,\u201d</b></span> she frowned. She carefully stood up again, brushing the debris off her butt with her tail as she turned around to survey the damage. Sure enough, the small, paper building had crumbled completely beneath her weight. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYep, it\u2019s totaled.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, great,\u201d</b> you groan, thinking that this was all for naught. <b>\u201cHow are we going to shoot a show about Mauville without the Mauville gym?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I know the guy who makes these. I can get it replaced super cheap. Like I said, this is a low budget production,\u201d</b></span> she chuckles. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIn fact, crushing it was actually sort of fun\u2026\u201d</b></span> With a mischievous smile on her face, she turns around, lifts her tail, and smashes her butt down on another small building, which is instantly crushed beneath her weight. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhoo!\u201d</b></span> She giggled, amused by how easily the tiny buildings are squished beneath her. When she tries to stand, she accidentally destroys another building beneath her paw. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOops! There goes the Pokecenter.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s take this seriously,\u201d</b> you frown. <b>\u201cNo need to go sitting on all our props.\u201d</b> You were uncomfortable with what she was doing, not just because it was a waste of money, but also because the way those buildings collapsed seemed eerily realistic to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHehe! Oh, c\u2019mon, I\u2019m just getting into character!\u201d</b></span> She giggled, wagging her tail as she turned to you. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cMaybe we can work this into the pilot. You know, start it off en media res. Oo, here\u2019s an idea! Maybe the pilot can be, like, a found footage sort of thing. You can be a journalist reporting on the destruction from a helicopter, and I just smack you out of the sky! Then you run around for a bit, until the giant Mightyena swallows ya.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c<i>Swallows</i> me?\u201d</b> You do a double-take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, not for real, obviously.

The audience won\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were uncomfortable just looking at the seemingly giant mightyena. The thought of going in her huge mouth made you feel nauseous. <b>\u201cI-I\u2019m not too sure about this anymore,\u201d</b> you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, come on. I get that you\u2019re uncomfortable, but I swear this is, like, one hundred thousand percent safe,\u201d</b></span> she leans down to try and reassure you. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cReally, this could be my breakthrough role!

You guess you\u2019re just\u2026 overreacting. There\u2019s really no reason to believe Lesia would do anything that might harm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... alright,\u201d</b> you relent, again unable to resist the mightyena\u2019s adorable pouting. <b>\u201cLet's get ready for filming, then.\u201d</b></span></div></div>",

Most chillingly, a huge pawprint is embedded in the side of one of the largest skyscrapers, the only evidence of the chaos happening below. Above the city, a helicopter flies bravely through the starry sky\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re standing by the open door of a remote controlled toy helicopter which was soaring through the \u2018sky\u2019, overlooking the fake city below. The foggy effect of the city below was accomplished by a smoke machine, and the buildings, which were actually hollow, are stuffed with lights in order to give off the illusion that the city below is bustling with activity. It actually looked surprisingly realistic, especially in the darkness. Dressed in a tiny newscaster costume, you turn to the micro-camera you\u2019re carrying, holding a tiny microphone in your hand. <i><b>\u201cI am reporting live over the devastation of Mauville City. Early reports are claiming that a large Pokemon is responsible for the damage here\u2026\u201d</b></i> You say into the microphone, trying to mimic a news reporter. You weren\u2019t a very good actor, but the fact that you were genuinely nervous right now made your performance much more believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u2018pilot\u2019 of the helicopter was just a tiny cardboard cutout of somebody\u2019s silhouette. In reality, it was being piloted via remote control by Lesia, who was hiding somewhere in the fog below. You try to improvise as the RC helicopter soars all around. <i><b>\u201cA-as you can see here, there seems to be, uh, cataclysmic damage done to this tower here. As you can see, there appears to be some sort of paw print embedded in the\u2026\u201d</b></i> You say, before suddenly pausing when you see something moving in the smoke below. <i><b>\u201cOh! It appears there\u2019s something large moving in the fog! For the sake of our viewers, we will risk flying down and getting a closer look\u2026\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aimed the camera into the \u2018smoke\u2019 below as the helicopter slowly lowered, getting closer and closer. All of a sudden, a giant, furry tail came flying out of the fog, batting the helicopter out of the sky! The RC helicopter started spinning wildly out of control, and although you knew you were at no risk of harm, the sensation of falling was still terrifying. You screamed in genuine terror as the helicopter fell from the \u2018sky\u2019, before it finally crashed into the diorama below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough as you lay there, your heart still pumping out of your chest. Eventually, you get your bearings, and keep trying to follow the script. <i><b>\u201cJ-Jerry! Are you okay?\u201d</b></i> You call out, standing up on shaky legs. <i><b>\u201cJerry?\u201d</b></i> You climb into the cockpit, only to find that the cardboard cutout there had been snapped in half during the fall. <i><b>\u201cOh\u2026 Arceus. Ladies and gentlemen, it appears that my pilot\u2026 didn\u2019t survive the crash.\u201d</b></i> You say, doing your best to sound sad. You crawl back, grabbing the camera before jumping out of the helicopter. You notice you happened to crash into the Game Corner. <i><b>\u201cI will be trying to escape the city on foot. If anybody\u2019s watching this\u2026 the situation in Mauville is catastrophic. The military must be dispatched as soon as possible. This destruction cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder around the tiny, fake \u2018city\u2019, filming the fires and devastation that\u2019s been left in the Mightyena\u2019s wake. <i><b>\u201cThe city is eerily quiet. I fear\u2026 there may not be anyone else left alive,\u201d</b></i> you say, trying to improvise a line to explain why there wasn\u2019t any other actors in this pilot. After a few moments of wandering, you hear a loud noise in the distance, like huge, lumbering footsteps quickly approaching. <i><b>\u201cI-it\u2019s coming!\u201d</b></i> You said as you breathlessly rushed to an alleyway, hiding amid some debris. You weren\u2019t a very good actor, but the genuine nervousness you were feeling showed through in your shaky voice, making you sound genuinely terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you hide, eventually a huge figure emerges through the fog. The mightyena is so huge compared to you, your camera only shows her giant paws as she stomps by, her every footstep cracking the \u2018pavement\u2019. Eventually, the huge Pokemon passes you by, and you stumble out of the alleyway. <i><b>\u201cL-ladies and gentlemen, I can\u2026 confirm the reports that a Pokemon is involved in this disaster,\u201d</b></i> you whisper into the microphone as you flee in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush through the tiny streets of the diorama with more urgency, now, having a few more brief brushes with the mightyena, narrowly escaping each time. Eventually, nearing the end of the pilot, you braced yourself for the moment you\u2019ve been dreading the most. It was time to film the death scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u2014 or, perhaps you should say, your character \u2014 spots a giant paw pass by on one side of the alleyway, and thus rushes to the other side\u2026 only to find the giant mightyena standing there already, towering over you. You slowly lift the camera, giving the audience the first clear look of the seemingly huge mightyena\u2019s face. She was giving the scariest smile she could, her fangs shining in the city lights. A bit of drool drips down onto the street in front of you. <i><b>\u201cUh\u2026 good dog?\u201d</b></i> You whimper. In a single instant, those jaws descended around you, your camera falling to the floor as she lifts you up in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera films every moment as you\u2019re sealed entirely inside her huge, moist maw. It was absolutely sweltering in here, and the smell of her meaty breath was unbearable. You were forcibly pressed up against her wet tongue, and horrified by the view down her huge, gaping throat. With a cruel grin, she leans her head back, pretending to swallow you for the camera. You can only hope everything goes as planned, and you don\u2019t accidentally end up as dog food...</span></div></div>",

Eventually, she decides to let you go before it go too weird. <b><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cAnd\u2026 cut!\u201d</span></b> She announced, before leaning forward and gently spitting you out onto the ground. You land in a puddle of saliva on the \u2018concrete\u2019, coughing as you\u2019re soaked to the bone in the mightyena\u2019s juices. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cThat was a great take, man! I can work with this footage, if you don\u2019t want to have to do all this again.\u201d</b></span> She smiles over you as you shakily climb to your feet, still covered from head to toe in smelly canine drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUgh\u2026 was that really necessary?\u201d</b> You groaned, trying to brush the thickest of the saliva off of yourself. <b>\u201cThis is disgusting\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHehe!

In the first minute, you only grew a few inches; in the next minute, a full foot; and a couple minutes later, you were back to being six feet tall. Sure enough, as you grew, you completely dried off, until you were good as new. You looked down at the diorama that had seemed so realistic when you were tiny, and at the canine who had seemed so massive. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cSo\u2026 that was pretty fun, right?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cFun\u2019s not the word I would use,\u201d</b> you said, reaching down and carefully picking up the micro camera you had been holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon!

Nevermind, it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</b></span> You give her a weird look. Was the mightyena\u2026 getting off on pretending to be a giantess? That was a little weird, but it\u2019s not like that\u2019s your problem. Once this pilot was finished, you were never going to use those blasted Minimize blocks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... whatever you say.\u201d</b> You try to forget she said anything. <b>\u201cSo, are we done here?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh! Yeah,\u201d</b></span> she said, grabbing her things and following you out of the warehouse. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m thinking of pitching this one to Hoenn TV first. I think they have the right audience for it.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAnd if it\u2019s rejected?\u201d</b> You ask, handing her the footage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, I could make it a web series,\u201d</b></span> she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cA web series?

She seemed a little too passionate about Attack of the 50-Foot Mightyena, and now, you couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she had ulterior motives. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not planning on quitting my day job or anything.

You did your best to shake the day\u2019s events out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next week or so, Lesia got to work finalizing her pitch. She sent the footage you two filmed to some freelance editor she knew, and he managed to turn the footage into something that genuinely looked like a movie-quality production. Meanwhile, Lesia finished sketching out the first hundred possible episodes, trying to come up with all the ways a massive mightyena might get up to mischief during a simple half hour time slot. Eventually, she sent you a text revealing she\u2019s already shown the pitch to some studio execs at Hoenn TV. To your surprise...</span></div></div>",

For some reason, they think you\u2019d perfectly fit the role of Clancy, the former owner of the rogue mightyena who\u2019s trying desperately to right his wrongs and get the massive Pok\u00e9mon under control. It\u2019s a pretty major role, all things considered. Reading over the scripts, you were moderately intrigued. It was probably the kind of show you\u2019d watch, if you had the time for tv. Still, acting always seemed stressful to you\u2026 especially if you\u2019re three inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you\u2019ve never been too adverse to taking risks. You trust Lesia when she says things will be perfectly safe\u2026 so what\u2019s the harm in saying yes? It seems like a very lucrative opportunity, one your dear old pop would be rolling in his grave to see you pass up. Maybe it was time to take a chance...</span></div></div>",

Tremble in fear, puny humans, before your new queen \u2014 Lesia!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery since that fateful day she shrunk you down, Lesia just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. The prospect of being so incredibly large and powerful was invigorating to her, in a weird way, and the longing to experience it again has been distracting her from her work. One day, she noticed something in a store window that she couldn\u2019t ignore; realistic plastic figurines, all exactly three inches tall, which reminded her of you. With that fateful sight, she couldn\u2019t hold back any longer, and Lesia discretely purchased as many of the figurines as she could. It couldn\u2019t hurt to sneak back into the warehouse one night just to have a little fun, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, here she was, standing in the center of the tiny replica city, the plastic figurines assembled all around her. As she stomped her way through the tiny streets, she could almost pretend she was really 50 feet tall, lording over the tiny humans below. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cFor too long, you humans have looked down on me! Now, I\u2019m looking down on <i>you</i>!\u201d</b></span> She said, stifling a giggle as she put on a fake, dramatic, \u2018intimidating\u2019 tone. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not too impressed by what I see! Have no fear, though \u2014 I\u2019m a kind and loving queen, so long as I\u2019m giving the respect I deserve!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arranged a few figurines in rows in front of her, before tipping them over so it looks like they\u2019re all bowing before her. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b><i>\u201cYes, your majesty! We\u2019ve all secretly loved and adored you all this time! We\u2019d be honored to have you as our queen!\u201d</i></b></span> She ventriloquized in a squeaky, high-pitched voice, giggling to herself as she pulled back to look down on them. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHehe! Yes, bow before the new queen of Hoenn!\u201d</b></span> It was fun to let loose and pretend like this sometimes. Yes, it was silly, of course, but that was part of the fun. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cFor my first act as queen, I shall make all Pok\u00e9blocks completely free, for all to enjoy! No longer will the berry farmers be able to hoard those delicious, sugary treats all to themselves!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b><i>\u201cHip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!\u201d</i></b></span> She ventriloquized, bouncing the figurines up and down so it looked like they were cheering. Chuckling to herself, she pondered what else she would do if she was the queen. Eventually, an idea struck her. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAh! For my second act as queen, I shall have every gym\u2026 demolished! No longer will Pokemon be forced to fight in strenuous battles just so humans can gain useless little \u2018badges\u2019!\u201d</b></span> She smirked as she turned to the recently-replaced gym, walking over to it, turning around and swaying her rear back and forth. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cEvacuate the gym, my beloved subjects! I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to have to go!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her head, she imagined a crowd of people fleeing from the gymnasium, intimidated by the sight of her rear hovering overhead. Once all the (imaginary) civilians were out of harm\u2019s way, she gently pressed her butt down on the paper building\u2019s \u2018roof\u2019, slowly putting more and more weight on the structure, to see just how much it could withstand. She yelped a bit, startled, when the \u2018gym\u2019 finally gave way beneath her. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHehe! Oh, Arceus, this is sooo dumb\u2026\u201d</b></span> She giggled to herself, breaking character for a moment, before turning to see what more mischief she could get up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmid all the nondescript office buildings, she eventually laid eyes on familiar structure. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh! Yes, the battle institute. That must go, too, of course!\u201d</b></span> She said, trotting cheerfully over and lifting a paw. Without any fanfare, she easily destroyed the tiny structure with only a single, playful bat of her paw, bits of debris being strewn onto the roads in front of her. Leveling that blasted institute was certainly cathartic, even if it was only for pretend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she intentionally trotted downrange of a few toy soldiers she\u2019d set up holding adorable little plastic machine guns. The moment she entered their \u2018crosshairs\u2019, she immediately feigned pain, before gasping. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh no! Rebels! You dare attack your queen?\u201d</b></span> She pretended to be outraged, and stomped her paw so hard that the tiny guns bounced out of the figurine\u2019s hands. Once the \u2018army\u2019 was defeated, she stalked over to the figurines, licking her lips mischievously. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cHow rude! That\u2019s no way to treat a lady\u2026 especially a lady like me! Looks like you\u2019re all going to need some time out\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the moment she\u2019d been so excited about. She was almost shaking with anticipations as she licked up a couple of the toy soldiers with her tongue, before swishing them around her maw and pressing them up against her cheeks, as if savoring their flavor. Eventually, she swallowed both of them almost by instinct, and was immediately surprised by how easily the figurines slid down her throat, and just how strangely pleasant it felt. She let out a small gasp as she felt their weight in her belly. The figurines were so small compared to her, they didn\u2019t even leave a bulge. Nobody would have any idea of where they were except for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist, she leaned forward and gulped down more of the figurines, feeling them so easily slip down into her body and come to rest in her warm tummy. Soon, they were making a few notable bulges in her gut, and she could feel them clearly all pressed together inside of her stomach. Her cheeks ran red as she closed her eyes and imagined that those figurines were real, tiny people, all curled up inside her body. Once all the toy soldiers had been devoured, she sat there, panting, trying to control her feelings. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cNow, y-you all just sit in there and think about what you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll l-let you out when you\u2019re ready to be good little subjects,\u201d</b></span> she said to the figurines, patting her gut. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cY-you should be thanking me, really! It is an honor to be curled away inside your queen\u2026 all safe and warm\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tensed up, letting out a quiet, desperate whine as a jolt of\u2026 something ran up her spine. What was happening to her? She was enjoying this a little too much. As she imagined little, tiny humans snuggled safe and sound inside her, her whole body felt warm and tingly, and she started feeling a little light-headed. Just at that moment, she noticed another toy soldier lying in a nearby alleyway. Apparently, one of them had evaded her notice. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh? What\u2019s this?\u201d</b></span> She gave a curt little smile, her face sweaty and red. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDid I miss you? My apologies! I\u2019m a little s-stuffed right now, but I know another place you can serve out your p-punishment...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she turned, lifted her tail, and sat gently on the figurine. The toy was pressed into the squishy flesh of her rump as she lowered herself onto it, its entire \u2018body\u2019 being completely covered from sight beneath her butt. She playfully grinded down on the toy, careful not to damage the figurine, as she felt the pile of figurines inside her shift and stir with her every movement. As she sat there, she was reminded of that eventful night, when she took you up into her mouth and pretended to swallow you down for the camera. As much as she hated to admit it to herself, she desperately wished you would\u2019ve let her gulp you down for real, so she could keep her beloved agent \u2014 no, her <i>friend</i> \u2014 safe and comfy inside her belly, if only for a little while\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she decided to wrap this up. She had only come here to have a little fun, but things were getting a little more racy than she was expecting, and she didn\u2019t want someone to stumble into the warehouse and think she was a total weirdo pervert. She stood up, ready for the moment of truth; would she be able to push these figurines out of her stomach herself, or would she have to get her stomach pumped? She\u2019d been practicing at home, but never with this many. Sure enough, though, after only a few seconds of hacking and coughing, she spat the entire pile of figurines out into a puddle of saliva on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did it! Now she knew for sure she could swallow someone at this size, keep them safe, and then spit them out unharmed. Of course, she\u2019d be hard-pressed to convince anybody to let her do that\u2026 but just the knowledge that it was physically possible was exciting enough. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cThere! That wasn\u2019t so bad, now was it? I hope you learned something from your time in-\u201d</b></span> She was saying triumphantly, only for her heart to sink when she was interrupted by the sound of the door being unlocked. Someone was entering the warehouse! She didn\u2019t have any time to hide; she could only freeze up as the man walked in, to see her standing over a pile of saliva-drenched toy soldiers, surrounded by destroyed paper buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of the producers for Hoenn TV! Javier, his name was; the one with the five o'clock shadow and the strange, southern drawl. He gave her a weird look as he walked in. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cOh? Lesia? What are you doing here at this hour?\u201d</span> He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately hopped up to her feet. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cW-what? Me? Oh, I was just\u2026 going over the choreography again! Gotta get everything just perfect, right? Heh!\u201d</b></span> She nervously faked a laugh, trying to act natural even though she was obviously panicked and embarrassed. She wasn\u2019t very convincing, but somehow, Javier didn\u2019t seem to notice anything wrong. Or, at least, he pretended he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cOh, Lesia. I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re a perfectionist, and you certainly don\u2019t disappoint,\u201d</span> he said, nonchalantly. He was about to return to his business, but he stopped in his tracks when he remembered something. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cAh! Yes, while you\u2019re here; about the new production. Your agent friend contacted me earlier this evening. I think I have some very good news\u2026\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

You had just finished your dinner, put the dishes in the dishwasher and you made your way to your room to settle down for the night. You were at your desk on your computer, looking at whatever you like to do on a lazy late Friday afternoon when there's nothing better to do than just surf the internet. As for your Pokemon, you had your very own Midnight Lycanroc, who you called Luna. You had found Luna a few years ago, as a Rockruff, who had appeared to be abandoned in an alleyway. It didn't take long your bond and friendship to grow, her to evolve into a Midnight Lycanroc, and before you knew it you were partners. Luna did a good job at keeping you company, she could be quite hyper and full of energy at times, but that just meant you two could have more fun together. Luna was also slightly bigger than most Lycanroc. She was about 4 feet more or less, from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you last saw her resting on the couch in the living room, probably full from her dinner, so you two weren't together. You didn't decide to bother her and just let her sleep. She would come to you if she needed anything anyways. As you continued to do your thing on your computer, you suddenly heard the squeaking of your door opening. You stopped what your doing and swiveled around in your desk chair to see what was up. Immediately you were greeted with Luna pouncing on you! \"Hiya Master!\" She said excitedly as she pounced, landing just a few inches from you. Out of surprise, you jerk back, your back hitting the seat your were sitting in. \"L-Luna! Don't scare me like that!\" You reply, shouting just slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Luna, she was just giggling away. \"Aw come on, you are so scared easily. We need to work on you not be such a scaredy Meowth!\" She replied in a joking manner. \"A-Anyway, why are you here? I thought you were asleep in the living room?\" You asked her, trying to change the subject at hand. \"Well I was but I got kinda bored, sleeping is boring you know.\" She said to you with another giggle. Typical hyperactive Luna. \"Also I came to you ask you something!\" She said, looking excited, her stubby, little tail wagging with anticipation. \"Sure, ask away.\" You say, now calmed down from getting spooked by her, and slightly curious for what she had in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She began. \"Do you...</span></div></div>",

It's pretty close, too.\" You ponder it for a moment as Luna intently stares at you with a hopeful smile. It was a tad late in the afternoon but admittedly it has been a while since you took her on an outing in the great outdoors and the fruit bowl in the kitchen was also starting to look a bit empty. Not only that, but Luna can get a bit mischievous around the house if she's left bored for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bend down and give her a quick pat on the head, saying \"Sounds good! I'll go grab a basket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" She yelled, practically doing a little jig as you dug through the closet to find the basket. You went out berry picking with her in the past but you've never seen her get this pumped up about it. Either she was really craving berries right now or she has a lot of pent up energy she needs to get rid of. As you blindly feel around the dark closet your hand pokes into something that makes the distinctive high-pitched creaking of a wicker basket so you grab it and take it out. With the basket in hand, you put on some shoes, grab the keys to the house and make for the exit as Luna closely follows you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the house locked up you set off with Luna to her proclaimed perfect berry picking spot. \"Come on, Slowpoke!\" She yelled over her shoulder. You were essentially power-walking as you tried to keep up with the impatient Lycanroc, her small tail whipping side-to-side at incredible speeds. When you finally caught up to her you quickly grabbed her hand and almost instantly she slowed down. Luna beamed up at you with happy red eyes before she turned back to the path, her clawed fingers wrapping tighter around yours. You breathed a sigh of relief at the fact you prevented your leisurely outing from becoming a strenuous workout. Luna was always a sucker for physical affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShafts of orange afternoon light beamed through the canopy as the pair of you casually walked along the forest path. For a while you thought that Luna forgot about the whole berry picking objective as she leaned against your side but rather suddenly she pulled away off the track and into the woods. Luna was being uncharacteristically quiet while she guided you through the forest, her determined eyes pinned forward. After ten or so minutes of hiking past trees and bushes you could see a clearing ahead, the bright and colorful berries already visible through the underbrush. \"We're here!\" She happily yipped, her pace increasing until she was essentially dragging you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the clearing, you were impressed. There were dozens of berry bushes that were all covered in a strange berry you never saw before. They were all a light blue and had a pear shape to them. Luna tore away from your hand and dashed toward one of the berry bushes. She grasped a berry from the bush and planted it into her mouth before she grabbed another and pointed it at you, beckoning you over. \"Here, here!\" She said, her voice muffled by the blue berry lodged in her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, calm down,\" you say as you chuckle at her enthusiasm. \"You'll choke.\" Luna takes a bite from the berry in her mouth and pulls the remaining mass out of her mouth before she speaks up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, you've got to try these!\" She barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the basket next to the tree you take the berry she offered you. You were apprehensive about eating a berry you've never seen before but they were obviously edible since Luna apparently enjoyed them enough to take you all the way out here for them. Biting down into the soft flesh of the berry revealed an explosion of juicy sweetness. Gulping it down you give Luna the thumbs up, \"It's pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn right.\" She said. After the both of you finished your berries the two of you started picking berries and put them into the wicker basket and before long it was filled to the brim with the blue berries. With a full basket you plant yourself down onto the grass with a berry in your hand, enjoying the peace and quiet with your Lycanroc. Although you started noticing something off about Luna; she seemed to be constantly glancing over to you as you both enjoyed your meal, looking incredibly curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something on my face?\" You say, breaking the silence. Luna almost jumped at the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um... No...\" She said as she turned her full attention to the berry she was nibbling on. Now you were getting suspicious. Her face had the same look as the time she accidentally broke your alarm clock and tried to hide it from you that one time. \"Hey, are you feeling alright?\" She asked, leaning in closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrowed your brow at her as you tried to figure out what she was planning. \"Yes? Should I not be?\" Luna just shook her head and focused her attention to the berry in her paws while you tried to ignore her strange behavior. Although, now that she mentioned it you were beginning to feel a little strange. All over your body there was a slight tingling sensation that was getting harder to ignore and it felt like you were slowly sinking into the grass. Your clothes were beginning to feel baggy and your shoes felt extremely loose but the part that definitely tipped off that something was wrong was when you looked over to Luna; you both were sitting at eye level with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's eyes lit up when she looked over at you. Your perspective was slowly but surely lowering and from her own perspective what was happening was quite clear; you were shrinking. She let out a surprised yip, \"It's working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know this would happen?\" You said, trying not to panic. By now you were small enough you had to look up at the Lycanroc and the fact she was leaning over you made you feel even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA toothy mischievous grin plastered her face. \"I met someone that said these berries do something really interesting to humans. Honestly, I thought it would turn you into a Pokemon or at the very least make your skin blue but this is cool, too!\" She said, her smile widening even further. \"I'm already thinking of some of the fun things we could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right.\" You gulped. She looked <i>way</i> too excited about what was happening to you. By now you were probably half the size of Luna and your clothes were beginning to become too large to be of use. As you continued to diminish and get tangled in the sea of fabrics you could only wonder how small you were going to get.</span></div></div>",

It's just you, and your best friend Joltik laying on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Jol...</span>\" She agrees, almost half asleep. After a minute of you two doing nothing, Joltik then jumps up with an idea. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Tik!</span>\" She exclaims, crawling up your body to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't pay any attention to what she's doing, almost falling asleep yourself, until you feel a weird jolt on the back of your neck. It didn't hurt by chance, but it did wake you back up. You sit up, as Joltik crawls to the center of your shirt. \"I'm awake, I'm awake.\" You say, rubbing the place where Joltik shocked you, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeirdly, Joltik says nothing, instead she just starts to nuzzle you. You crack a smile, giving her a little pet, as you lay back down. You space out for a second, thinking about whatever, when you feel something weird. You look down to see Joltik still laying on you, very much happy, but she seems... bigger. You think it's nothing, as you decide to space out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to again, you feel an increased weight on your body. You look down to see Joltik again, now laying still, eyes closed, but she does seem different. You don't remember her weighing this much, do you? Instead of blanking out again, you decide to observe your fluffy friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of watching, you notice a gradual changing of size, as Joltik is now covering your belly. \"Uh, Joltik, is everything alright?\" You calmly ask, siting up again. Looking around you, however, shows that what's wrong is you, as you seem to be shrinking. You are now pretty small compared to the surrounding couch, and you don't seem to show signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Joltik is now half your size,covering your legs as well now, so you are now 8 inches. \"Joltik, what's happening to me?\" You ask, as you urgently shake her awake. She opens her eyes, gets off your body, and looks at you, noticing the changing size difference. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">It actually worked! It had a slim chance of working, but it worked!</span>\" Joltik yells out with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can talk!?\" You ask surprised, as you now reach her size, and still shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">You can understand me!?</span>\" Joltik says surprised as well. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">This must be a side effect of the shrinking.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you shrink me?\" You question, as you stop shrinking at the one inch mark, where Joltik is now looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">C'mon, I've seen your browser history.</span>\" She retorts, making you blush in embarrassment,\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">And besides, we have something to do today, so that's a plus. Before we do anything, can I do something real quick?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" You say, which Joltik excitedly lays on you, smothering you in her fluff. You then feel her legs wrap around your back, as she rolls over, giving you a full body hug. To be honest, she feels pretty warm and soft, like you can just lay on her all day. She then lets go of you, as you lay on her soft underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">I always wanted to hug you like that</span>\" She sighs \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">So, what do you want to do?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a bit, before saying...</span></div></div>",

She allows you to slide off of her belly before getting rolling over. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">This is going to be way harder to do due to your smaller nature, but it's doable. Sitting down would make it easier, probably.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down to Joltik's saying, as her shadow looms over you. You feel her warm breath wash over your backside, and her fluff brush on you from time to time, until you feel a sharp zap onto your neck. \"Oww..\" You moan, rubbing where you were zapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Sorry, it probably hurts a bit more when your smaller, but I think I got the right spot.</span>\" Right as she finishes her sentence, you feel a weird sensation come over your body like last time, as your yellow friend begins to grow again.

Master!</i>\" You feel groggy, yesterday was a long day of traveling. \"<i>Master...</i>\" The mountains just seemed to span on for miles, you felt accomplished that you were able to make it over them before sunset. \"<i>Master, come on, wake up!</i>\" Making it to the Pokemon Center you just wanted to sleep and sleep and sleep. Sleep the day away. Just keep sleeping. Sleep. Forever. \"<i>Wake up! Kai!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" You wake up in a jolt at the sound of your name. Standing next to your bedside you see your trusty traveling companion, Grace the gardevoir. Standing at an average 5'3\", Grace is a beautiful being. With a cute face, short curly hair, a thin body, sizable breasts, and a faint green glow it is easy to see how she is often the center of everyone's attention. Today she is clothed in a cute yellow sun dress that goes down to her knees and hugs her body shapely which is accompanied by a wide brimmed sunhat. You have been raising Grace ever since you were a kid, back when she was still a ralts. She has always been a sweet and caring individual to everyone around her, but especially to you. Though she can be really timid. After beginning your pokemon journey some month and a half ago, Grace has become more and more adept in her psychic abilities, learning new moves and techniques on a regular basis. Just the other day she was experimenting with a new move, though she hasn't told you what it is all about yet. \"Oh, good morning Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You overslept again Master,\" starts Grace worriedly, \"If you don't keep a better sleeping schedule you are bound to get sick.\" Looking at the clock, you notice that it is almost noon. Grace starts again, \"I went down and ordered breakfast from the nice ladies downstairs half an hour ago, it's probably cold now.\" Slowly you begin to raise yourself up from your bed and rise to your feet. You stand about 5 inches taller than Grace at about 5'8\". Currently your 18 years old but you feel like you have the appearance of someone a couple years younger. You're thin and not too muscular, you have shaggy brown hair and brown eyes, right now you still have the red t-shirt and shorts you wore yesterday and fell asleep with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right, I have felt like I've been over working myself lately,\" you reply,  \"I think we both could use a lazy day, don't you?\" Sitting down to eat your cold eggs and bacon, you wait for Grace's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that sounds great Master, besides it would give me time to play around with that new ability I was messing with. I think I almost have it perfected.\" Grace appears to be getting excited, you begin to really wonder what she has been up to lately. \"Do you think you could help me test it Master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Grace, I love helping you,\" you say smiley, \"I mean you help me with tons of things already so it's nice to return the favor often.\" You notice Grace's face as it begins to grow a light shade of red as she bursts into a smile. Standing up to stretch and throw away your finished plate you begin to finish your thoughts. \" So what's this new move all about? Is it dangerous?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been trying to learn how to condense objects using my psychics. So far I've had good success with stuff I've tested it on during our journeys, but I haven't tested it on any living being.\" You begin to stare at her with wide eyes. \"And... well, I was wondering if I could test it on... you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you saying you want to try and shrink me?\" After a short pause, Grace slowly nods. You stand there shocked, secretly you've always had a fetish for shrinking down and looking up at the world from a tiny perspective. You begin to worry that Grace might have figured out about your fetish and developed this move just to please you, but your not sure how she would have figured such a thing out, you good at hiding your tracks. \"Well... I'm fine about it as long as it's not dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Master! And don't you worry, this won't hurt a bit, I wouldn't ever do something that would cause you pain.\" Grace moves up her arms and points them towards your chest. Slowly her eyes begin to glow as a psychic aura begins to illuminate around her hands. Soon, you notice the same aura circling around your body. Your body begins to tingle all over and you begin to grow increasingly dizzy. In a matter of moments your surroundings begin to look bigger. Grace begins to look bigger. Oh my god, you're really shrinking! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much will Kai shrink?</span></div></div>",

Tumbling backwards due to his dizziness, all Kai could make out of the world was a blur of different shapes and colors. Overall, Kai felt extremely nauseous and felt tempted to empty out his breakfast onto the floor. Soon, Kai's muscles began to feel sore and he felt sharp jolts of pain developing in his joints and stomach. Leaning against the wall for support, Kai could hear the faint voice of Grace seemingly yelling for his well-being. \"<i>Master! Oh, Master, please be okay!</i>\" His vision was soon blocked by Grace's green color as she attempted to support her Master. Eventually, after about 10 minutes of what seemed like torture, Kai's nauseousness started to subside, his vision began to return, and he could properly rise to his feet. And the first thing he noticed was how he was looking eye-to-eye at Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank God you're alright,\" Grace was quick to jump towards you and capture you in a tight, loving hug. \"I'm so sorry, I didn't think anything like that would happen. I can be so stupid sometimes. Please forgive me!\" Grace was on the breaking point of crying, even though the whole ordeal left you nauseous, sore, and temporarily blind, you couldn't stay mad at Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't beat yourself up Grace, you couldn't of possibly known something like that would happen,\" you reply to Grace reassuringly, \"Besides, I'm okay now. And look, your move was a success, I'm the same height as you now!\" Releasing you from her tight grasp and wiping away her tears, Grace's lovely smile returned as she looked you down, appreciating her handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, thank you for being so understand and sweet Master. I'll be sure to be more careful next time though.\" It is hard for you not to smile as you see Grace's glowing disposition. \"Well now that we know I can properly shrink living things, I'm guessing that you want to return to your normal height?\" Although she was trying to hide it, you could sense that Grace felt a little disappointed at that idea, though your mind was already set on what you wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? There is no way I'm going to go through what I just went through again so soon. Besides, who knows, it might be fun being your size for a little while.\" You could tell Grace liked that idea as she began to perk up and her smile started to widen once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, I was hoping you'd say something like that. You see, shrinking something or someone like that takes a lot of energy, I don't know I have it in me right now to grow you back even if you wanted to.\" Coming in for another hug, the two of you begin to sway back and forth, cradling each other in your arms, you're both just glad each other are alright. This goes on for over a minute before being interrupted by the sound of Grace's growling stomach. \"Oh, excuse me! I guess I'm a little hungry after everything that has just happened. I suppose we should get on with the rest of today anyway. So what do you think we should do Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" you pause to contemplate at your options. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That sounds like a wonderful idea Master, but I think you should do a bit of freshening up first though.\" She was right. Looking down at yourself you remember you're still wearing your clothes (which conveniently shrunk with you) from the previous day. Plus your nose can't help but notice the putrid smell emanating from your body. All that adventuring and shrinking has left you a sweaty mess. Usually you try to take good care of your appearance, your filth makes you feel sorta embarrassed, though that embarrassment might also stem from the fact you wouldn't have noticed the filth if Grace didn't point it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think I'm going to take a shower,\" you say, stuttering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like another wonderful idea Master. You're on a roll today,\" replied Grace, sarcastically. You can't help but blush as Grace smiles at you humorously. You don't find it often where Grace is bold enough to fool around like that. She must of gotten a confidence boost from seeing you at her own height. You feel happy for her, you do quite enjoy seeing the sillier side of her every once and a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shower goes by quicker than normal due to there being less of you to wash now. The shower head feels significantly higher than it used to be, which you expected, but that doesn't stop it from feeling weird nonetheless. As you emerge from the shower Grace is quick to hand you a pair of clean clothes that she shrunk while you were washing up, a pair of cargo shorts and a blue button up shirt. They fit your body nicely if not an ever bit loose. Putting on your only pair of shoes, which Grace also kindly shrunk for you, you feel ready now to start the day. \"Are you ready to hit the town Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready when you are cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? I didn't catch that last part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh, I said I'm ready when... ready when you are <i>Master</i>.\" You can't help but notice how red her face has become and you start to chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he he. Then what are we waiting for, I'm starving, let's go!\" As the two of you are leaving your room and the pokemon center you begin to notice just how much bigger the world has become. Sure five inches may not be a huge drop in height but it is definitely enough to give yourself a new, shorter perspective. As you walk to downtown you start to take note of the height of the people walking around you. Of course most kids and young teenagers you notice are still shorter than you, but, you have trouble finding anyone close to your age at a similar height or shorter. It sorta feels awkward to walk by a guy the same age as you but a full six or seven inches taller. If it wasn't for Grace by your side you would definitely not be as confident about being shrunk as you are right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a short ten minute walk into the heart of the city, you and Grace decide to sit down and eat at an outdoor sandwich shop near the town's square. The two of you order a plate of sandwiches, chips, and fruit to split while you enjoy the morning air and sunshine. \"It sure is beautiful today,\" you say, trying to kick start a conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is, maybe later we can get some battling in Master, I've been itching for some more practice. It is the perfect day.\" Grace bites into her second sandwich, she seems hungry as she is quickly devouring her side of the platter. You suppose shrinking stuff leads to quite the appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to convince me Grace, we can do some battling after we eat if you're up for it.\" Your eyes slowly begin to focus in on a group of trainers and their pokemon walking towards what looks like a park in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thank you Master cutie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Grace cutie.\" Grace blushes again at your remark. Soon the two of you finish up with your meal and begin to head towards the park you saw with the other trainers. Right of the bat you notice two people specifically who grab your attention. A tall, buff looking man with his Machamp and a girl around your age with her Slurpuff. Both look like admirable opponents and good experience for Grace. The question is though: who do you ask for a battle?</span></div></div>",

Carefully, you rub the rag upon Your Umbreon's injured ears making a small grunt escape her mouth. Despite the treatment, She remained perfectly seated upon her knees while gazing down at the floor with a bitter yet ashamed expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did it again.\" she mumbles with a huff. By now you were used to your Umbreon, Darcell getting into fights outside of your home. But now however, it seemed like she was constantly returning home with scraps or bruises upon her body. Ever since she managed to encounter some pokemon belonging to rich families not too far off, that short temper of hers has lead her to constant skirmishes with the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter Darcell.\" you scold while continuing to tend her injuries. \"You should know they'd try and pick fights with you over there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this time was different...\" She growls while turning her head slightly to gaze at you. \"They called you a weak, useless commoner!\" She huffs. \"what else was I suppose to do? Just stand there and accept that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are just words Darcell.\" You state in a stern voice. \"nothing but a way of trying to lead you into trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they sure got the trouble they wanted...\" Darcell mutters still in a snit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final rub on her other pointy ear, you place the rag down on your knee. \"Listen...you shouldn't try and fall into their plans.\" you begin with a sigh. \"If trouble comes knocking, the best thing to do is try and avoid it completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even when they said all those lies about you?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even then.\" you state with a nod. \"Violence is something that should be considered as a last resort.\" you explain. \"And despite that, you should always try and step away from it as best as you can. It's best to think before actually rushing head on into a mess.\" Darcell remains seated after your lecture as her eyes were focused entirely on the floor. Just by the silence and gaze she was giving, it was clear guilt overcame her. With a sigh, you rise up from your seat before gently patting her head. \"Though, I'm thankful you stood up for me.\" You admit while mustering a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcell, taken by surprise from the comments gazes up at you before mustering a smile. \"R-right.\" she says before slowly standing up herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how about we get some ice cream from the fridge? That should help try and cool you off.\" you say in a rather light hearted manner as Darcell simply chuckles in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me.\" She replies as both you and her make your way into the kitchen. After filling the bowls with a few scoops of strawberry and vanilla ice cream, you both soon return to the living room before sitting upon the couch. With a flick of a switch, the television set soon beams showing a local pokemon fight occurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Master?\" Darcell. \"Says with a spoon of ice cream still in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" You ask, freezing your motions from placing the spoon in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did say fighting is wrong earlier...but what about pokemon fights like this?\" She asks turning her head so her red eyes were gazing upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this is different.\" You state before placing the spoon in your mouth. \"Here, it's mainly about sportsmanship and rules to follow. It isn't ALL about needless violence against others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcell gives a sigh as she places her spoon back inside her bowl. \"Do...you think I might be able to make it there one day?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you mutter confused by her words before gazing back at the screen. \"You mean a pokemon tournament?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcell Nods upon your question. \"Yeah...do you think I might be able to join there one of these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief second of silence you simply give a light shrug of your shoulders. \"Sure.\" you answer while setting your empty bowl upon the nearest table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" Darcell stammers, as if taken aback by your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not.\" You shrug. \"I mean, you certainly have the skills to fight back that's for sure. Plus, it will give you a good reason to stop pummeling other pokemon.\" You add with a light chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcell simply chuckles in response while giving a small eye roll. \"Funny Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around half an hour or so of watching the matches, you soon begin to rise up and give a drowsy stretch. \"Man,, I'm beat.\" you grunt while finishing up your stretch. \"I think I'll hit the hay now.\" Curiously, you gaze down at Darcell as she continues to sit and watch the match. \"You gonna finish this up?\" you ask curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcell, quickly shifts her attention up at you before nodding. \"uh huh...yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Don't stay up too late alright?\" you insists before making your way down the dark hallway towards your room. As you continue to walk down however, to your confusion it seemed almost as if you were continuing your way down the dark area. \"W-What's going on here?\" you think aloud with a raised brow before stopping in place. Within a matter of seconds, the whole area soon begins to fade into a complete darkness, leaving you alone within the strange depths. \"Is this some sort of trick?\" you mutter, unsure if this was reality or some sort of dream. Dumbfounded, you slowly continue onwards while spreading your arms out in front of you to touch any approaching obstacle. After a couples steps forward, your hand soon ends up coming into contact with a rather odd object. \"w-what the?\" you murmur feeling about the strange surface. Oddly enough, it felt almost like-</span></div></div>",

Days like this were truly hard to come by nowadays. The sun graced the blue plains above as only a small amount of clouds were adorned besides it's magnificence. A light breeze casually blows past you on occasion as the sounds of Fletchling's chirping melodically sounded off nearly all about. \"Wouldn't you say so Brande?\" you ask while turning your head to the side to gaze upon your pokemon companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you certainly we're enjoying this fine weathered day, your Charizard ally unfortunately didn't share the same enthusiasm as you. \"I-I guess...\" She stutters in a meek soft voice as her head repeatedly turns about to gaze upon her surroundings. Just by the look on her eyes and the lowered position of her neck, it was obvious to tell she was nervous about this peaceful walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile from earlier soon begins to fade seeing just how terrified your dragon pokemon appeared to be. With all rights however, after what she went through as a Charmander there was no wonder why she was so timid and anxious of being out. A couple years ago when walking about in a nearby forest, you managed to come across a lone Charmander being attacked by a group of fierce spearows. She was clearly outnumbered and curled up in a ball shaking like crazy as they unleashed their attacks upon her. Glimpsing at the unfair fight, you immediately grabbed the nearest stick before charging up against the gang of flying pokemon. After a bit of scratches and pecks, you soon managed to stand victorious as they immediately fled from the area. Despite the spearow's fleeing, the Charmander still remained balled up shaking and quivering uncontrollably. While it did take some time to calm her down completely, it seemed that right then and there you two were entwined in a partnership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Brande.\" You state in an assuring tone as you approach her and gently pat her shoulders. While her anxious and wary attitude as a Charmander did manage to soften up a bit, a huge portion of it remained even in her final evolution. \"There's hardly any wild pokemon down this route. Heck! the only thing here wild are those fletchling's up there.\" You say while pointing your finger up at one of the small pokemon perched upon a high branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...what if someone wants to battle?\" She retorts, fearing having to go against another pokemon in combat. Despite being in some skirmishes in the past, Brande absolutely loathed the idea of fighting, mainly due to her 'Scaredy' like manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that happens I'll simply say no.\" You reply back with a small shrug. \"I'm sure it wouldn't matter so much to them. Besides, this route is commonly used by starting trainers. I doubt they'd want to battle against a fully evolved Charmander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I suppose so.\" Brande slowly nods her head in agreement, though her tense attitude persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small sigh escapes as you gaze up at her face. \"Come on. We'll take the short route to head back home okay?\" \"R-right.\" she responds giving a quick sigh of her own. After taking a quick scenic route down a tree filled path, you both manage to make your way back to the familiar area that was your home. \"Ah. here we are.\" you state in a proud manner. \"Home sweet home. Huh Brande?\" you ask as only silence seemed to answer your question. \"Hmmm?\" Confused, you turn your head back to notice Brande gazing down at the grassy ground with her hands clasped together. \"Brande?...is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA disappointed expression takes up her face as her eyes appeared to be on the verge of tears. \"Brande. What's wrong?\" you repeat the question while approaching the orange dragon. \"I'm sorry Master...\" She stammers in a weak voice. \"If...If only I wasn't so scared of other pokemon...we wouldn't have such short walks.\" She explains, clearly having guilt over the sudden change of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey hey!\" you stammer taken aback by her words. \"It's alright.\" you reassure her while reaching up to pat her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not.\" she retorts giving a sniffle. \"It's been years now...and I'm still just as scared as I was a Charmander.\" She states using one of her claw like hands to wipe her eyes. \"I'm...I'm not even sure I can conquer this fear.\" she adds with a small hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...then, we'll just have to keep on trying.\" you respond as she gazes at you in surprise and confusion. \"Everyone has their own fears Brande, including myself. But I honestly think you could brave your way through that fearfulness of yours.\" You state with a smile. \"I mean you're strong. Stronger than me that's for sure.\" you add, knowing full well how she has the strength to embrace you in a bear hug with complete ease. \"Besides, I'll be there to help you out as well, so no need to fret alright?\" You add with a smile to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne small sniffle emerges from Brande as she nods her head in response. With a good wipe of her claw, she smiles down at you with gratitude replacing the fear. \"Thank you Master.\" she states before gently embracing you in a light hug. \"No prob Brande.\" you reply back giving her back an assuring set of pats. \"Now, Let's get inside okay?\" you suggest while turning your head towards the doorway of your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were expecting to be let free by now, Brande oddly kept you close in the embrace. \"Huh?\" you mumble gazing up at her utterly confused. \"Something else in your mind Brande? or are you just in a really hugging mood?\" you ask humorously as a small giggle manages to escape the Charizard's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ermmm...Master?\" \"Yes?\" you reply back. \"Ummm...I...I was wondering if I could thank you for all you've done for me.\" she asks in a bashful tone. \"Wha?\" you stammer taken aback by her words once more. \"errmm,, really Brande, you don't have to repay me.\" you explain with a somewhat awkward chuckle. \"b-but...\" she stammers. \"but I want to...after everything you've done for me.\" she quickly adds. \"But-\" \"Please Master?\" Brande asks, as her eyes gave an almost puppy dog like appearance down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart nearly popped from the adorable sight as you couldn't help but give a quick sigh. \"Alright Brande.\" you answer, only to receive another quick embrace, this time with the strength equivalent of a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Master!\" she purrs while holding you tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now...what is it?\" you stammer while wiggling about in her rather tight grip.</span></div></div>",

With great haste, you dash out of your quaint room following the location of the rising haze. \"What's happening!?\" you shout gazing about in confusion as the sounds of coughing emerge from within your kitchen. \"S-Sorry Master.\" A feminine voice calls out as your smoke alarm beams out it's annoying obnoxious sounds. \"I was just trying to cook lunch and-\" \"You tried to use flamethrower again,,,\" you finish the sentence as you shake your head in slight irritation. \"Hold on a sec.\" you mutter approaching the kitchen window before prying it open and wafting out the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke slowly begins to make it's way out into the open as the voice from earlier gives off a small scoff. \"I'm sorry, I thought it would work this time.\" As the fumes begin to clear out of the kitchen, you turn your head to gaze upon your vulpix, Vix, who was trying her best to wipe off some soot from her body. With her being a pokemorph, her body was that of a human, with the exception of her head and furry form. Six large tails wiggled behind as she shakes her rather short orange hair to get cleaned off from the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we talked about this before.\" you scold. \"Try to use the oven's normal heat, don't use your fire abilities to warm up food.\" \"But.\" Vix retorts. \"I wanted to try and make you something for lunch. Quickly, she places to checkered patterned mittens on her hands before presenting the burnt pot. \"See.\" She states while lowering it to show the contents inside, or what looked like contents. \"I was trying to make stew...but, it didn't seem to work out.\" \"I can tell.\" you reply, still a bit irked by her actions. \"I-I'm sorry master.\" she repeats once more looking down ashamed. \"I didn't mean for this to happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long sigh makes its way out of your mouth as you try to calm yourself. \"It's alright...just...don't try and do that again. This is the third time this has happened you know?\" \"I know...\" she mutters as her pointy ears perk downwards. \"And, I appreciate you trying to make something for lunch.\" you add, trying to at least make her feel not too down by her actions. \"Right.\" she smiles slightly before placing down the pot. \"While we get this smoke out, how about we order something instead for now?\" you insist, seeing as how the kitchen might be smelling like charred wood for a while now. \"Sounds good.\" Vix nods as she slowly begins to regain some of her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long until an order of Chinese cuisine was setting before the living room table as both you and Vix begin to chow down. \"So.\" you begin before gulping down a bit of noodles. \"Where'd you find this recipe?\" you ask. \"Oh, I found it in this month's pokemon magazine. Chef Slowbro is one of the best out there.\" Vix exclaims as she begins to slurp up some noodles. \"Well that's interesting.\" you admit taking the moment to stuff your face once more. \"Oh!\" she exclaims. \"I almost forgot. \" Quickly, she places her right hand into her shorts to fish out an odd looking vial. \"I also got this as well.\" she states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you ask, growing at the odd container while trying to make out it's contents. \"Well...it's from the magazine as well.\" she says with a smile. \"Do you follow everything that's in the magazine?\" you ask, stupefied by how almost everything she tries comes from that piece of published paper. \"No, this was from an advertisement actually.\" she replies back. \"An advertisement?...just who is it from?\" You ask growing more curious about what that odd vial was. \"Well, it was from a group of clefairy's. I think it's called Minimize me.\" Vix explains while taking a moment to gaze at the containter with her amber eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minimize...me?\" you mutter, lowering your plate in confusion. \"Just what does it do?\" you ask as Vix's face only manages to grow even more excited by your question. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Well, I've been going through your computer for a while now, I was trying to figure out more things you might like or enjoy so I could suprise you and stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skipped a beat, realizing she was talking about going through your computer history. The history you NEVER clear. All the porn, weird things you've looked up, were there. Including...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one of the things that came up quite often were stories and pictures. Of little tiny people!\" She said, a wide, happy grin forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh arceus no...\" You murmured, swallowing a bit, though in her excitement, Vix didn't hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I didn't know what kinda stuff to get you, I mean, you already have stuff you use and all, so I figured a fun experince would do great! So... This little vial here, is supposed to reduce height! The more you drink, the smaller you get! Oh! It's supposed to be temporary though, so don't worry about that.\" She said laughing. \"So! Minimize me, is to minimize you!\" He said, giggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe everything you'd heard. She not only went through your computer history, but your deeper fetishes, and then bought a mixture that should make them come true, and was... Extreamly excited about it. Why weren't you? It struck you suddenly. It was all a joke, that mixture was fake! She was playing a prank on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Well, if that's the case, I'll humor you and take a sip.\" You said, confidence hitting you like a truck as you stood up, walking up to your pokemon and taking the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wide eyed and watching you closely. She was putting up such a good act. But you knew it wouldn't work. After all, with how clumsy she was, it might end up being a disaster if the stuff ended up working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou popped the cork off, and tipped the vial up, draining a few sips, leaving about five sixths of the bottle left. You cringed at the taste, and suddenly felt really warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... That tastes real bad.\" You said, taking a step back to the couch. You half expected Vix to ask what was wrong, or laugh after her joke, but she just kept staring at you with an intense look, eyes wide and smile growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Vix? You okay there?\" You asked, when you felt hot again, suddenly you fell back and shuddered, your clothes becoming very loose on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own eyes widened, and you realized now, that this was not a joke. You were actually shrinking! Down from six whole feet, to just four, to three, then two. You kept going, just how small would one tiny sip make you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were shrinking down rapidly as your clothes got very loose and the light above start to shade dark around your body. Everything has become dark due to the shrinking vital that you just drink from your pokemorph Vix gave you. You couldn't believe one sip that you were losing feet in heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were trying to moved around in your huge clothes, your pokemon was just smiling after seeing you just shrunk in front of her. \"Master are you okay?\" she asked in a worried tone but at the same time she was kind of smiling still. She couldn't believe it actually work and now she can make her master happy by giving him what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trying to answer her question, but the clothes was getting in the way of your voice and that you try to find a hole to able to see your pokemon. You notice her voice sounds a bit loud and little bit of deep too as well. You were still trying to figure it out what just happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vulpix can see you were struggling in your clothes, she decided to pick up your clothes around you and threw it on the side to see her tiny master. After picking up his jeans and shirt, she could clearly see him naked on the floor. She started to giggle as she can see your penis hanging down between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world turns to light as you can see your clothes being lifted by your huge Vix and that she moved your clothes aside to see your tiny self. She seems to be giggling as you stand their dumbfound naked in front of her. You couldn't believe that how huge she were as the room itself seems to be hundreds of feet in air. You were now as small as a bug and that you are shocked that this is actually happening. You begin to speak to your huge pokemorph Vix as she is towering you like a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..uhh..didn't realize that this would actually....-\" \"Work!\" Your Vix cut you off by your sentence and with that, you are kind of scared being 1 inch tall compare to her. You known her kind of clumsy with things and that it can be dangerous around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it actually worked and I can't believe that I made your dreams come true. I hope you are happy with this master. I know you thought it was a prank but I was being serious that this vial contains to shrink anything that drinks it. Speaking of which.\" The Vix looks down at you and sees the vial that is next to your body and picks it up and put it in her pocket so it won't get lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now since that is taken care of, I think we can have fun with your dreams and fantasy of yours.Master!\" Vix said as she now decided to bend down and reach her hand paws for you. You didn't know what to do as you just stare at her and not moved at all. Your body tells you to run but at the same time, you knew that running would be a waste of energy and also, you know Vix intends to not hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs carefully as she can be, she wraps her handpaw around your tiny body and that you kind of struggle in between her fingers as she lifts you up to her eye level to get a close looked at you. You were amazed to see her body from bottom to top as you were being lifted up like an elevator. You begin to blush as you can see her bra being as big as a hot balloon and that it made your  penis to start to erect though. You had to admitted to yourself that seeing your huge Vulpix is a beautiful sight and you wouldn't mind exploring her body. You love your Vix and that you can't denied it at all. Speaking of which, as you were thinking in your thoughts, you Vix was sniffing you and breathing on you as she can smell your lust coming off from you. You can see she is licking her lips of what things she can do with you. You had to wonder what is on her mind and also, you wonder how long does this vial you drink will last before you grow back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Vix, I am not sure if we can fun yet. I mean I am still trying to get use to this tiny size. Also, how long does this thing last? You said it was temporary but how long?\" You started to wonder if she knows the answer but telling from the expression from her face, it looks like she doesn't know as her eyes were moving from side to side and her expression started to change to frown as well,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I...uhh...I actually...don't know. It could minutes, hours days or maybe a month or so, but I do know it won't last forever. I think that is what Clarify group said to in the magazine.\" Your face started to turn pale hearing from your massive pokemon not knowing how long does it will last. You realized you had things to do and that you had to take care of her, the apartment, and your job too. You know your Vix can't really helped if she keeps burning stuff in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't actually know how long this thing will last and that I could be stuck like this...for few months to a year? Vix, I do hope you have an antidote just in case I might be stuck like this. I mean I do want to have fun but I have things to do from the outside world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't have the antidote for it and the magazine didn't came with it but hopefully it will just last an hour or so until then, I am going to take care of you. Don't you worry, you have a loving pokemon like me to take care of you. We will work this out, I am sure.\" She said in cute smile but still you are worried that things will get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I am calming down and that I trust you can take care of me. \" You said in a worried tone but hopefully the effect isn't going to last long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also I wanted to say that I am still-\" Your sentence as been cut off as a huge hiccup had occur in your voice and you realized that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You fell asleep at the poke center last night with Melody asleep on your chest. You always thought Melody was kind a corny name, considering she was a Meloetta, but she insisted (More like demanded!) that it be her name. You'd known her since you were 10, and she has travelled with you ever since. You had checked in the night before your birthday, and Melody said she'd have a surprise for you in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wake up sleepy head! It's time for your surprise!\" You heard Melody say in a singsong tone as you woke up groggily. You swore you fell asleep with the sheets over you... As you sit up, you look around to see everything was massive! You got a bit dizzy for a moment as you reached to your side to grab something, you notice the object you grabbed was fleshy. It reminded you of Melody, as she was a little chubby. Although, she wasn't overweight by any means, she just wasn't stick skinny like other Meloetta's were. She had nice juicy legs (Which made up for her lack of feet!), and a nice plump bottom. She also had a bigger chest then other Meloetta's, although not by much. Her personality matched her body, nice and bubbly. You two had always been close, to the point where talking to other girls felt like cheating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you break out of your trance, you look over to your side and see that you grabbed a massive leg! As you spun around, you bumped straight into your friend, who had been sitting in front of you, her legs sprawled out to your sides, revealing her crotch that was barely covered by her black minidress. You blushed as you noticed she hadn't put on her panties yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Do you like your surprise?\" Melody asked with a warm smile. \"What did you do to me, Melody?!\" you shout in confusion. \"I made your dreams come true, silly! You thought you could hide your shrink fetish from me, but I've spied on you when you go to those websites! So I shrunk you down with a special song! Look, you just barely clear my belly button!\" Melody then pulled you into a hug and true to her word, your head was just over her belly button. \"So what am I supposed to do?! I can't go anywhere like this!\" you shout as Melody put on a fake pouty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to go anywhere when you're shrunk around a gorgeous girl that you love!\" You thought about how dumb your previous comment was, and apologized. \"Hehe! It's okay, I could never stay mad at you. But before we start with YOUR birthday fun, I wanna have some fun of my own. Please?\" Melody looked at you with pleading eyes as you sighed. \"Alright, fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thank you!\" Melody squealed as she hugged you again.  \"So what did you want?\"  You asked as Melody blushed and put her hands together. She began whispering in your ear and your eyes widened in shock. \"YOU WANT ME TO WHAT?!\" \"Please! There was a reason I hadn't put panties on this morning! And everything is nice and clean, freshly shaven too! Please please please!\" Melody begged as you sighed and stepped forward. Melody let out another squeal as she nervously lifted her mini dress for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got down on your hands and knees and lowered your head in front of Melody's vagina. Nervously, you stuck out your tongue and began to slowly and softly lick at her lips. You had never done this sort of thing, especially when you were almost the same size as her vagina! You weren't sure you were making an impact until Melody began moaning and pushing your face into her pussy. \"P-please get the inside a bit too!\" Melody pleaded as you followed her orders and licked inside to. It was rather tasteless, but nevertheless you were enjoying this almost as much as she was! You continued to lick, picking up frequency for a little bit until Melody finally pulled you away. \"Whew... That was... amazing... thank you so much...\" Melody said, her face very red and sweaty a bit. \"I enjoyed that a lot too, we should do that again later.\" you said, licking your lips a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody brought you back into another hug \"Hehe, woah there tiger, the day's only just begun! How about we...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not wishing to fight, you soon give in... finding yourself sitting spread eagle in front of the smiling face of your now giant pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinging a lovely little tune, Melody began to slowly (delicately) remove your pants. Her voice was always intoxicating to you at normal size, now it's borderline euphoric at your current miniscule size. Your Meloetta gasped in surprise at the sight of your rock hard member as it seemed to spring out of nowhere. Smiling like the cat that ate the canary she ran her tongue over it. \"Someone's in the mood.\" she joked, playing her tongue along your tip. You simply moaned in response, animal urges taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wink, the massive Melody's mouth overtook your throbbing rod. A rhythmic, yet gentle, suction feeling began to course through your nethers as the Meloetta went about pleasuring you, humming a lovely song all the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the combined effort of her mouth's stimulation and the beautiful songs, but you soon came... hard in her mouth. Melody giggled happily as she removed her lips from your private area, licking the 'juice' from her lips. \"Amazing.\" she said, smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that you realized...</span></div></div>",

The heat, and the musk, was almost overwhelming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready little Master? Because Melody sure is!\" giggled your (relatively) gigantic pokemon as she gently slid you inside her moist pussy. If it was hot and heavy feeling on the outside, inside your pokemon's sex was even more so. You could hear her... and feel her moaning as her hand blocked the exit. Soon two fingers were inserted, probing inside herself to find you... and clearly masturbate while she was at it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melo! Meloetta!!!\" squealed Melody, reverting back to some primal habits while losing herself in the throws of ecstasy, her vaginal muscles contracting more and more, The force and strength of her fingers plunging inside her moistness got faster and faster. You were clearly soaked already, from head to toe as you were rocked about inside the soft and slimy prison of your Meloetta's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled squeals and moans escaped her lips as Melody penetrated herself more and more with her fingers, adding more and more digits to the endeavor as she went. \"Meloetta!!

You ached, your whole body felt like one giant bruised muscle. Coughing up some of her cum, you tried to give a witty and sarcastic rebuttal, but all that came out was shocked moaning and mumbling. Like your brain was still trying to process what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee...

This she was waiting for, and as soon as your piece was at 'full mast', the meloetta began to lower herself gently down onto your throbbing rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer singing turned to moaning, low humming as she felt you go deep inside her. Melody's cute little (though large to you currently) legs began to rhythmically pump up and down upon your stiff member. The further she went, the stronger her hip thrusts got, the now gigantic Meloetta bearing down harder and harder. Melody was no longer singing, but gasping and moaning. Even those sound you found beautiful and enchanting, driving you to push further... to want to please her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giant pokemon reaches her climax a few second before you do, all your pent-up stimulation held back by her singing bursts forth as Melody finally gasps... cooing to the warmth inside her. The meloetta felt weak in her legs, too much exertion on her stubby little limbs. In her afterglow she almost lands on top of you from exhaustion. It DOES though plant your face right in between her normally small breasts... which now look like Double-D's at your miniscule size. You simply kiss her neck in appreciation of this gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh master.... I love you.\" she whimpers with joy, taking your tiny body into her arms and hugging you.

She thought about it for a single second, but that was enough to make her crotch quiver in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd staying another day would probably mean that she would get to do some more...

Too bad I can't really fold a shirt that's what, ten times me?\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody rolled her blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" she conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, your bag was done filling itself with all your belongings and it closed on Melody's command before she hovered it closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe, the giantess offered a fingerless hand for you to climb on, which you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, then.\" she said happily, hovering towards the door and leaving the room; shortly after, you embraced to her chest, she left the Pokemon Center behind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey resumed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are we headed anyway?\" Melody questioned once you were far enough not be seen or heard by anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next city, I guess,\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"I've checked the map yesterday, there's a forest we must go through. The town is on the other side of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh... why do we always end up in a forest, someway?\" Melody complained. It wasn't like she minded, but she disliked sleeping in the open, something that had happened often since your journey started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sure there'll be tons of Pokemon. I mean, how will those look now?\" you questioned,<br>\r\n\"If I see some Pokemon from up close, I might just have a heart attack,\" you chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry cutie. I'll be right there to drive them all away from your cute little behind,\" she reassured, causing you to smile a little,<br>\r\n\"And that's why you're the best, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment made the giant Meloetta blissful. She rose the paw you were on up to her lips and lovingly smooched the side of your head, giving you a quick nuzzle as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the journey continued in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile humming cheerfully, Melody finally approached the forest you were supposed to go through and fluttered past a few trees, venturing into the deep vegetation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you were left some time to think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever in your wildest dreams you would have imagined that waking up this morning would mean embracing a brand new situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now the size of a bug, at the complete mercy of your now goddess-sized Pokemon. It was a dream came true! Shrinking and face this new perspective you were facing right now had always been an appealing thought, both for the adventurous side of it and for the more... 'exciting' one Melody helped you to explore closely before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gained a light blush, which Melody luckily didn't see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you agreed to be this size. Forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat surely sounded odd now that the initial excitement calmed down, but it was still an interesting perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knew, being this small could prove itself great. You just had to get used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you couldn't tell the same about this forest, since you and Melody had been stuck for the whole day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were lots of Pokemon, but none of them paid you both any mind, and the hours had slipped away very fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the sun was setting, and Melody was still fluttering in this forest, your bag in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe halted, once more taking a break, and groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we ever going to get out of here?\" she asked you, lazily floating back to a nearby tree, sitting at its foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we're close,\" you reassured,<br>\r\n\"Unless we're going in circles, in which case I don't know how close we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made Melody adopt a dejected expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for never teaching me Teleport.\" she said,<br>\r\n\"Thank you for being unable to learn it.\" you retorted, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody rolled her eyes, realizing she wasn't going to win a verbal conflict with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do, master?\" she asked instead,<br>\r\n\"Sun's about to set. It might be dangerous to wander around here nighttime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be right,\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"But... there's still some time left. Who knows, maybe we can find a way out of here by then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began pondering your choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side, you could keep going, with the risk of the sun going down completely and you and Melody getting further lost in these seemingly endless woods; on the other, you could always set up camp and wait until tomorrow morning to resume traveling to the next city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long hesitation, you made a decision. </span></div></div>",

This one song makes you aroused again as your Meloetta lifts her skirt, exposing her sez \"Get ready for the main event ~!\"she beams lowering her waiting vagina on your erected cock. She starts humping you wildly. The pleasure is too much and you are heavily panting while Melody seems to be enjoying herself, moaning and giggling in the same time. After a few minutes of her humping, you can't hold it in anymore. You orgasm and cum along with Melody. A white waterfall of cum pours down her pussy, completely soaking you in her juices. Melody pants heavily as she lifts herself from you \"That *huff* was *pant* awesome...\" she says between her gasps. After five minutes Melody finally stands up and picks you up. She gives you a big, wet kiss on the face covering it in saliva. She then pushed your small body to her face and nuzzles you \"Thanks... that was really awesome... I love you\" she says. You smile at her last sentence and kiss her face in response. Melody giggles, then she kisses you once more before sitting down and setting you on her lap.

You feel extremely relaxed as the combination of the softness, the humming and Melody's heartbeat makes you fall asleep almost immediately. You were wrong about not being tired. Melody notices you're dead asleep and stops humming. She then kisses your head one last time before closing her greenish blue eyes. After a full five minutes she finally falls asleep too. Back at you, you are now in the land of dreams, dreaming about Melody. But in the dream she was actually in her Pirouette Form; the now redhaired giantess was holding you in a hug while dancing at the rhythm of her own singing. Melody, on the other hand, was dreaming about her tiny master. She is dreaming that you are normal sized; she's sitting in your lap singing while you pet her green hair. Meanwhile in the real world, you both smile at your own dreams, and Melody tightens her grasp on you in her sleep.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\nYou two have been asleep for about two hours now. It's now 13.00.

Melody then proceeds to carefully pick you up, so you don't wake up, and lay you in the bed \"You're so cute\" she whispers lifting the blankets and covering your body with them. Melody then sits down on the bed and stares at you sleeping. She stays like this for a few minutes when her stomach grumbles loudly. The sound threatens to wake you up and Melody quickly grabs her belly, blushing. You start to move in your sleep, about to wake up from the sudden noise, but Melody rushes down to you and starts humming sweetly, making you feel relaxed once again. So you return to your snoring while Melody leans and kisses tour face softly \"Sleep tight master. I'll go get some food\" she whispers before quietly floating to the door and opening it. She exits the room and closes the door behind. She sighs in relief \"That was close\" she says as her stomach grumbles again \"Boy, am I hungry!\" she exclaims giggling \"But I can fix that\" she says flying down in Pokemon Center's main room. The pink haired Nurse Joy is as usually behind her desk.Melody flies to her \"Good morning, Nurse Joy!\" Melody says \"Oh, good morning to you Melody\" Nurse Joy greets her \"What can I do for you\" she then asks \"I'd like to get some lunch for me and my master\" Melody replies \"Sure, but why isn't he with you?\" Nurse Joy asks. Melody sweat drops at the question \"He is taking a nap\" she quickly answers. Nurse Joy shrudders \"OK, just wait five minutes, I'll deliver lunch to your room\" she says \"I'll wait here, I don't want to disturb my master\" Melody says, not wanting someone to discover her 'little' secret \"As you wish\" the nurse says. After five minutes, Joy gives Melody a tray with some sandwiches and some fruit \"Hope it'll be enough to fill you two up\" the nurse says \"Don't worry, it's sure enough\" Melody replies with a smile before flying back to your and her room. She opens the door and flies in, closing the door behind herself. She then flies on the bed and puts the tray down, before turning her attention to you. She notices you're still asleep. Melody giggles. She then leans down \"Master cutie~, wake up. It's lunch time\" she says in a singsong voice. You groan in your sleep as Melody picks you \"You asked for it\" she says pressing her white lips on your whole face. This is more than enough to wake you up and make you blush like crazy \"Good morning master~\" Melody says between giggles \"Slept well?\" \"Yeah\" you reply \"Good, because I bet that now you're hungry\" she says. Just after this your stomach grumbles \"Here's my answer\" she says, her giggling turning into laughing. You blush once again as Melody points to the huge tray on the bed \"Dig in\" she says. She doesn't have to tell it twice as you immediately bite a huge (to you) sandwich. Melody follows you. After finishing lunch, you lag on your back, full, while Melody gently massages your belly \"Someone ate to much\" she says giggling once again.

You spat in disgust, trying several other times to call for Melody; sadly, each time your mouth opened, you got a mouthful of saliva, which you had to spit out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue soon found the space between your legs and it mischievously lingered there, licking non-stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn involuntary moan escaped your own mouth, causing you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Meloetta giggled again - for some reason, she loved having you in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was probably scaring you, but it didn't matter: you were safe. The green-headed pokemon loved her master, she could never swallow him. But, she figured, he didn't have to know that part...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body was shaking with pleasure, her mind was coming up with lewd desires, her heart galloped within her chest, her eyes were close shut; her hips bucked without any control, her legs kicked the air, her free paw gripped the bedsheets, the other rubbed her crotch incessantly as she kept masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, the Meloetta couldn't contain herself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth opened as a scream of pleasure echoed inside the room, her sex dripping with white, sticky liquid that spread on the bed, creating a small puddle between Melody's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your Meloetta stopped rubbing her crotch and dropped onto the bed, carelessly throwing you to the edge of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled; your arms darted forward as you pushed against the giant tongue to get back on your feet, but your hands slid down on the red muscle and you ended up slipping even closer to the throat, a dark abyss that led to a certain death inside of a certain fleshy muscle full of gastric acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, you opted to stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Meloetta crawled to one of your pillows as she rested, exhausted but satiated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was wonderful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new thought entered her mind: why let it end? You were still in her mouth, just - gulp - and you'd be trapped in her for a while, until she decided to let you out. Because, again, she couldn't even dream of letting her precious master be digested, she'd let him out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden, faint voice interrupted her train of thought,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Melody? Let me out... p-please?\" you said from within her mouth, your voice echoing inside the slimy cavern and into her tight throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody noted that you were dangerously - or opportunely - close to her throat; she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little cutie that was her master was scared, she could tell by his shaky voice. He wanted to get out huh? Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got no response, but something definitely happened: the tongue beneath you started moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't do anything but watch as...</span></div></div>",

And then.. ohhhhh, my little master cutie is gonna get a reward~!\" Melody beams looking at you sweetly. You blush at her compliment as you start walking to get through Melody's breasts. As you pass through them, you stop for a moment and start rubbing Melody's left breast. Feeling you rubbing the soft surface, the giant Meloetta lets out a slight moan, just to blush and cover her mouth right after; but her moan catched your attention \"Oh so you like this, Uh?\" you say grinning. You instantly start to stroke harder Melody's squishy breast. The green headed pokemon can't fight the pleasure and starts moaning like crazy. After five minutes you stop rubbing and resume your walkin, while Melody speaks \"Ohh, my master cutie is gonna have an extra reward now~\" she says giggling. After a few minutes of walking you reach her the beginning of Melody's dress \"Just another bit, master~\" Melody says as you reach her neck. Finally, after the last ten steps, you step and the giant Meloetta's face. Melody immediately brings her hands to your sides and lifts you in the air, while lifting herself in the meantime \"Now my master cutie gets his rewards~\" Melody says in a singsong voice. You can't even reply that she brings your body to her white lips and starts pecking it again and again until you almost run out of air \"That's for winning. And now, for your second reward ~\" she says, turning you to your side and bringing her mouth near your ear. You wonder what she's doing when Melody starts singing a beautiful song, although she sings it lowly, so she doesn't break your eardrums. You feel fully relaxed as Melody keeps singing; you're completely under her spell. After a whole ten minutes of singing, Melody stops, much to your disappoint \"So? Did you enjoy that?\" she asks \"Yeah, that was truly wonderful!\" you say. Melody giggles and kisses your face softly \"Thanks!\" she says. You look at the clock in the room and see that is now 3:00 PM \"Uhh, what now Melody?\" you ask your  pokemon \"Let me think\" she says \"I know! How about...</span></div></div>",

But your giant Meloetta doesn't answer as she uses Relic Song. You relax at the beautiful sound and lay against Melody's chest. After a minute she stops singing and she glows of a bright white light. You see her skirt opening, showing her legs fully, and her hair to lift in a vortex- like form. When she stops glowing, Melody has now fiery red hair and eyes of the same colour. Also her 'belt' is now coloured orange. You look up to her to see her smiling brightly down at you \"As I was saying, I know what to do. We're going to dance!\" Melody beams landing on the floor \"Get ready cutie~\" she says. You can't even reply that she starts to sing, but in the meantime she starts to dance, twirling all over the room at the rhythm of her own music. Just like you dreamed earlier. Melody dances faster and faster, twirling and whirling as she sings. The redheaded giantess dances for a good half of an hour before finally stopping. You feel like you're going to throw up after all the twirls and whirls. Melody sits down on the bed and sits you on her uncovered lap before sighing \"That was sure fun!\" she says \"But it also tire me out..\" \"Don't you tell me\" you say holding your head, still a bit dizzy.

You sigh loudly \"Fine\" you say \"Thank you, I love you!\" Melody says picking you and hugging you to her face. This makes you smile and you hug her back.

You smirk to yourself as you continue massaging Melody's feet. The red haired giantess is no longer giggling, but moaning now \"Oh yeah... that's the spot... please harder...\" she says between moans. You rub as fast as you can, making Melody moan loudly.

But Melody doesn't seem worried as she continues to fly, occasionally twirling, making you hang on for dear life, as her hair float along the breeze. Eventually the sun sets completely as Melody flies back to the pokemon center. She enters your and her room passing through the window she left open and sit down on it \"That was really awesome\" Melody says with a sweet look \"You said that\" you reply, receiving a peck on the cheek in response. You two stay silent for a while when a really loud noise breaks the silence.  It's both your and Melody's stomachs, rumbling like two hungry manectric's \"Someone's hungry\" you both say simultaneously. Instantly you chuckle and Melody giggles \"Wanna get dinner?\" she then asks. You nod as she picks you and stuffs you in her dress. She then exits the room; she returns after ten minutes, holding a tray. She sets it on the bed before pulling you out of her dress. You see that dinner is just two sandwiches, some salad and some Lava Cookies. You immediately reach for the cookies, but Melody stops you \"No dessert until you've eat real food\" she says \"Awwww\" you say. After eating your part of one of the sandwiches, while Melody eats hers and finishes the rest, she points to the cookies \"What are you waiting for? Dig in\" she says while grabbing a cookie and start eating it. You bite in one of the cookies too and after a few minutes finish it. Only a biscuit remains in the bowl. You both reach for it and look at each other; Melody the smiles and picks the cookie, the she breaks it in half and hands you one of the half's \"Here you go\" she says. After five minutes you're lying flat on your back, filled up, because what you are was for you a full three meals at once. Melody pats your belly \"Pretty good, uh?\" she asks giggling, receiving a nod from you as response. Melody then checks the clock: it's now 10 PM \"Oh, it's late.

You wake up sweating for the third time, but this time Melody wakes up as well and gets up; then she looks at you with an annoyed and worried look \"What's up master? It's like the third time you wake up so suddenly. Is there something wrong?\" she asks. You tell her about your nightmares; Melody listens carefully then she giggles \"Don't worry master\" she says sweetly, laying back down and covering your head with her hair, then with her hands, closing you in a hug \"I'll be always there for you\". With this she leans and kisses your face softly \" In the meantime, here's something for your troubles \" she says starting to sing. She sings a sweet song, making you feel drowsy again. You yawn as Melody keeps singing sweetly. Before long, you are dead asleep on her chest. Melody notices this and stops singing, then she closes her eyes yet again, and after a few moments she resumes her sleeping.</span></div></div>",

In this one nightmare you are actually in the water, with a group of Sharpedo's heading to you. Between you drowning and the Sharpedo's coming really fast, you wake up, once again covered in sweat. Your heart is racing like a Rapidash and you are panting. You try to calm down, keeping saying that it was all a dream and that you're safe, but this time you don't manage to get back to sleep. And unluckily Melody didn't wake up this time; she's asleep, maybe doing really sweet dreams judging by the smile on her face. Too bad she can't comfort you again. So you lie your head on her chest, try to get back to sleep, but it's useless. So you stay there with your eyes wide open. Hours pass as you keep just rising and falling on your 'bed', along Melody's chest. Eventually dawn comes. After a few more hours, Melody finally begins to move and she begins to stir. She then opens her eyes and looks at you. Seeing you're awake, she greets you \"Good morning my little master cutie~\" she says smiling \"Slept well?\" she then asks picking you. Seeing your face she gasps \"You look like you didn't slept all night long!\" she exclaims. You don't say anything, but you nod \"What? You didn't got any sleep at all? But why?\" she asks worried \"Nightmares kept tormenting me, to the point I didn't manage to sleep anymore\" you say. Melody's expression drops at this \"Oh my poor little sweet master\" she says plucking you in a hug \"You're gonna sleep now. I don't care it's morning, you're doing it\" she says \"I'm gonna lie next to you and sing all the time necessary\" she says firmly, picking you up from her chest and getting up. You don't try to fight her as she lies you under the blankets and covers your body with them. True to her word, she then lies down next to you and starts singing, stroking your head with her hand in the meantime. You immediately feel slightly relaxed and within minutes you fall asleep. You begin snoring as Melody keeps singing sweetly. She then stops and looks at you \"Sweet dreams my master\" she says leaning and kissing your face. She then lies down next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the land of dreams, you are having another nightmare, with two Manetric's that are after you to eat you. They are howling loudly. You start to struggle in your sleep. Luckily, Melody notices and quickly starts to sing, stroking your head. In your dreams, Melody appears between you and the two Manetric's \"Don't you touch my master!\" she yells using Relic Song. She shifts in her Pirouette Form and uses Close Combat. In a few hits, the Manetric's are flat on the ground. Melody then gets near you and hugs you. In the real world, a smile appears on your face. Melody stops singing as she lies back down. You keep sleeping for hours. After a few hours of sweet dreaming, you have another nightmare. In this one, a huge Purugly chases you. It doesn't want to eat you, it wants you as a toy. And when it manages to catch you in its mouth, it starts to throw you back and fourth, not softening the grip of its mouth... In the real world,you start to struggle once again. Melody, who is napping, feels your struggling and wake up. She notices you struggling and quickly gets near you, then she starts singing once again. In your dream, the Purugly suddenly stops moving; in fact it can't as Melody suddenly appears and uses Psychic to stop it. She then picks you out of the cat pokemon's mouth before lifting it and throwing it far. Melody then kisses your face. You relax once again as Melody stops singing and lies back down. After a few hours of sweet dreaming, a sweet voice snaps you out of your sleep. You recognize it as Melody's voice, as she speaks \"Wake up sleepyhead, it's...</span></div></div>",

You rub your head still drowsy, when something catches your attention \"Wait, 'evening'? What time is it?\" you ask \"It's 9 PM master. You slept for like twelve hours, and you skipped breakfast and lunch. You must be really hungry now\" Melody explains. Your stomach growls loudly in confirm, asking to be filled with its daily meals \"There's my answer, huh~\" Melody says giggling \"Come on, let's get dinner\" she says picking you up and stuffing you in her dress. She flies to the door and exits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns after a few minutes holding the usual tray of food. She enters and closes the door behind herself; Melody then sets everything on the bed before pulling you out of her dress. You see the tray with three sandwiches, some berries and a bowl of cookies. Melody grabs the first sandwich and is about to bite it, when she stops with a grin on her face. You notice this \"What is that grin?\" you ask \"Ohh I just got and idea~\" Melody replies \"What?\" \"I'll feed you!\" the giant Meloetta beams. She then breaks a sandwich in half and eats the first \"Ehy, I thought...\" you say but Melody cuts you off \"Ladies first\" she says giggling.Then she starts feeding you the other half of the sandwich. You don't really mind, so you let her. Being so small as you were, you were already getting pretty filled so you did not mind that Melody ate the other two sandwiches and most of the berries as well. The giant Meloetta then picks up one of the last remaining berries, and she feeds you it. \"And now for the dessert\" Melody says pushing the bowl of cookies in front of you \"You don't need me feeding you for these, uh master?\" Melody says sarcastically. You chuckle as you dig in the cookies. You can only eat one (which is five meals to you) and after it you're laying flat on your back. Melody, who is still eating, pushes the bowl aside \"We'll eat the rest tomorrow\" she says. Then she gets near you and picks you up \"You know...</span></div></div>",

Have I to go on?\" she asks \"No, that's enough\" you say as you fail to manage to follow her completely.

Rules are simple, I count to one hundred while you hide somewhere. If I find you before ten minutes, I win. And kitty gets her mousy~\" she says seductively \"If you can hide from me for ten minutes, you win and the kitty has to do anything you want for the rest of the evening\" she explains. You decide to play her game; you know.Melody would never hurt you, and plus if you win she'll have to do anything you want! You really can't let it go \"Fine\" you say determined \"Okay then, game on! Go hide mousy ~\" she says \"One, two, three...\" she then stars to count. You quickly look around the room, searching for a place to hide. You have short time, so you decide to hide where Melody will never find you: under the mattress. You quickly climb down the bed as melody counts thirty nine. You try for a few times to lift the huge sift land, but you finally manage to do it and get under the mattress. Just as melody counts one hundred \"Ready or not, master cutie~, here I come!\" she beams starting to search the room. Luckily for you, time is passing really quickly as Melody can't find you anywhere \"Mousy master~,come out wherever you are.\" she says in a cute voice. As the eighth minute  passes, Melody looks at the bed. She grins as she quietly flies near it and pulls the covers apart. When she doesn't find you there, she groans, sitting down on the bed.

You gasp at this \"This is gonna be so fun~\" Melody says \"But wouldn't I be crushed?\" you ask scared \"Nah, I'll be gentle\" she replied starting to literally dance on your back. True to her word, she is just gently trampling your back, occasionally twirling, and singing in the meantime. She is most likely using her psychic powers to keep most of her weight off you, which you are eternally thankful for because the foot massage she was giving you felt great for your back.  After a few minutes she finally managed to get a moan out of you. You blush as Melody giggles \"Another thing we'll do more often\" she says putting a hand on her mouth as she giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody continues to trample you and twirls on your back singing for a few more minutes before stopping and jumping off your back \"Did you like that?\" she then asks \"Mhhh\" you reply still relaxed.

Melody then looks at you before laying you under the blankets and kissing your face softly \"Good night my little master\" she says sweetly. She then reaches for your bag and starts digging into it \"Stupid Honchkrow\" Melody mutters \"I got burned by his heat wave\". She's sure that you have a burn heal somewhere in the bag. She finally pulls the spray out and tries to spray her back, but she can't reach it \" Urgh! It would be easier if I had fingers! \" she silently exclaims, careful to not wake you up. While she tries to heal her burn, a thought crosses her mind 'I put my master in danger\" she thinks, almost crying. What she doesn't know is that the spraying noise woke you up. You open your eyes and look at Melody \"Melody?\" you call out, getting her attention. Melody looks over you \"Master? Are you awake?\" she asks \"Yeah\" you answer. Your eyes adjust to the darkness and you notice the bottle in Melody's hand \"Melody, what are you doing with that burn heal?\" you ask. The giant Meloetta seems to freeze at this \"Oh nothing..\" she says \"Melody\" you insist \"What happened? How did you got burned?\" \"What makes you think I got burned? Silly master\" Melody asks pretending to giggle \"The heal burn\" you answer \"Melody, come on, tell me!\" you finally explode. Melody sighs and puts the bottle down \"OK\" she says.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n\"You're saying that after I went to sleep, a Honchkrow attacked you and you got burned?\" you ask shocked. Melody can just nod; you notice she's almost about to cry. You two remain silent for a few moments, before you speak up \"I have and idea\" you says \"What?\" Melody asks \"Go get that burn heal, I'll heal you. I'm still a trainer after all\" you say laughing \"Yeah, a tiny, sweet trainer\" Melody says giggling before getting up and getting the bottle before laying down in front of you. She then hands you the spray; you get on her back \"Owwww!\" Melody exclaims in pain \"Sorry\" you say before starting to spray her burn. It's not easy as the bottle is really heavy, but eventually you manage to heal he burn \"Much better!\" the green headed giantess sighs happily before lifting you from using psychic, then she gets up and sits down, setting you on her lap \"Thank you, my little master\" she says sweetly. Eventually...</span></div></div>",

Her bigger form then disappears, but you can still feel her, meaning she is invisible \"Master? Where did you go?\" Melody says giggling. You chuckle as Melody flies to the door and opens it before flying down in the pokemon center. You can see almost nothing as the room is completely dark, but Melody doesn't seem to worry about it. She wanders around for a few minutes before stopping in front of a door. The kitchen. The giantess flies in and searches for the fridge; she eventually finds it and opens the door, light immediately shining out. You can see some oran berry juice, some Lava Cookies and a bowl of macaroons. Melody turns visible again and you see her eyes widening \"You see what I see master?\" she says  licking her lips. She then lifts everything with her psychic and closes the door of the fridge. Melody then puts you on her shoulder, then she picks the juice in right hand, the cookies in the left and the macaroons on her head \"Is someone here?\" a sleepy voice suddenly says. You freeze and so does Melody. Light suddenly fills the room, revealing an half asleep Nurse Joy. The nurse looks around the room, just to see nothing, as Melody quickly turned invisible again; you notice her body sweating and she bits her lip, while trying to keep the balance of the macaroons on her head. Nurse Joy eventually shudders and shuts the light down, before getting back to her room. Melody sighs loudly in relief, before getting back to your room. She enters in the open door and sets you and the food on the bed, before quietly closing the door and turning visible and sitting down in front of you \"Eat up master!\" she beams biting in a cookie. You also dig in; first you eat a cookie, then a single macaroon, then washing them down with a river (to you) of juice. After eating, you feel like you're going to throw up as what it was a little snack to Melody, it was a full three meals. The green headed pokemon gently rubs your belly \"That was a good snack, wasn't it?\" she asks smiling. You sigh happily as Melody giggles before she....</span></div></div>",

Like a slumber party!\" she says giggling \"If we played some games, that would've been a real slumber party\" you say smiling. Melody puts a hand on your head \"Just wait until tonight cutie~\" she says in a seductive voice. You blush and this only makes Melody giggle harder \"Believe me when I say you're the cutest master ever\" she says leaning and kissing your cheek. This has the only effect to make you blush fiercely, your face completely red. You two then remain silent for a bit, and your blush eventually fades. After a while, Melody finally speaks up \"Well, since we already had breakfast, why don't we play a morning game?\" she says \"What game?\"you ask \"Um... Let me think... Well we could play truth or dare again.... Or we could... You know... do THAT again\" she says. You blush again at the last as you know that 'THAT' means she wants to mate again \"So my little master cutie~, which is gonna be? Truth or dare, or you know what?\" she says seductively while winking at you. You take your time thinking of what to do \"I think we could.... Uhhhhh.... Let me think...\" you say. A good fifteen minutes pass; it's now 7 am, and you're still thinking. Melody's cheerful expression dropped a while ago, and now she's bored out of her skull \"Gee master, you're slow\" she says \"Yeah, I got this... I know let's... Let me think\" you say again 'Let's make things interesting' Melody thinks \"Well, hurry up, because you have one minute before I decide for you master\" she says flashing you with a grin \"Ehy no fair...

She returns shortly after holding a leaf. She closes her hand and brings the leaf to her open mouth with shaking hand. After a brief moment of hesitation, she drops the leaf in. The bitter flavor makes her shiver. Two minutes pass as she quickly spits the leaf out \"Gross!\" she says rubbing her tongue with her hands. You laugh heartily at this \"Oh, you're having fun? Well, now it's my turn\" Melody says grinning, while getting in front of you. She almost touches your head with hers as she speaks \"Truth or dare, master?\" she asks \"Truth\" you say.

You exactly know what to ask \"Did you ever do something weird that involved me?\" you ask.

Melody sighs \"Well, I've, for a long time, been... fantasizing about... you\" she says \"What?!\" you say confused \"That's right. When I discovered you had a shrinking fetish, I started fantasizing of how would have been if my master was so tiny to be literally in my hands. And now I know. So I started working on the song that shrank you down a while ago. And here we are\" she says, and it's now her turn to blush wildly \"I had no idea\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah. But come on, game's still on! Truth or dare?\" she asks \"Dare!\" you say \"I dare you to give me a foot rub\" she says \"Fine you say. She  places her toeless feet in front of you, and you start rubbing them. You smell a good odor, which comes from her feet. This must be that blueberry lotion that Melody is used to use every now and then. She lets loose a moan every now and then \" You're doing... Great... Keep going\" she says between moans. You continue rubbing her feet until she stops you \"That's enough\" she says picking you up and kissing your upper body lightly \"Thank you\" she whispers nuzzling you to her white face. You hug her cheek in response, this makes her blush and giggle. She then lowers you on her lap, staring at you lovingly, before speaking \"Come on, game's still on. Your turn\" she says softly. The game goes on for many rounds, and between funny or embarrassing truths and dares, time passes quickly, until you look to a clock, and see it's now 10 AM.

True to her word, she goes get your bag, then she comes back and picks you up; she kisses you softly and puts you in her green hair, before flying to the door and opening it.

After fifteen minutes, the sun is completely settled as Melody flies in front of a rather large tree \"What do you think master? Can we sleep here?\" she asks. You examine the tree to see if some pokemon lives in it, as even just a Pachirisu would be a possible danger \"Yeah, it is safe\" you confirm. Melody nods and flies up to the tree, then she lies down on a branch and yawns \"*yawn* we really enjoyed the day, didn't we master?\" she asks smiling contently \"Yeah, it was fun\" you admit. Melody giggles and kisses your forehead, before laying you on her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up in the sky, just to see a huge moon that lightens the whole land \"Look Melody\" you say pointing to the sky. Melody does as commanded and looks up \"Ohh\" she exclaims \"The sky is so beautiful!\" she says with a massive smile painted on her face. This makes you smile as well as Melody mumbles something \"Perfect conditions...\" she whispers \"What?\" you ask. Melody starts singing in answer; sure, you've been listening to Melody singing lots of times, but she never singed like now, with a happiness in the voice that overjoyed your heart. You almost feel to get up and dance. Meanwhile, the sound of Melody's voice makes other pokemon to come; they stop under the tree and look up in amazement to the singing green haired pokemon. Melody  notices this and sings with more passion in response. After a while, she finally stops singing, and the pokemon down the tree cheer loudly \" Thank you all~\" Melody whispers, then she looks at you \"So? How was that?\" \"It was... Incredible...\" you say, still under trance. Melody giggles harder at this \"I really have you under my spell, uh master? Ehehehe\" Melody says still giggling. But she cuts herself off, yawning loudly. A red blush appears on her white face, as Melody puts a hand to her mouth. She then giggles one last time \"I think it's bedtime, right master?\" she asks you \"Yeah, me too\"  you say yawning; this day has really tired you out. You look down and see the various pokemon that were here before have left, certainly to go sleep too. You yawn and lay down on Melody's chest, while she covers your body with her hair \"The best bed you'll ever have\" Melody whispers one last time, just before you close your eyes. And, within minutes, you fall asleep. Melody notices this and kisses your head softly, careful to not wake you up. She then lies down on the branch and smiles brightly \"Good night my little master, love you\" she says closing her eyes. She must be as tired as you, because after five minutes, she falls dead asleep.</span></div></div>",

Melody, on the other hand, isn't having dreams as good as yours; in fact, in the dream, she opens her eyes to find herself sitting on a bed, in front of a normal sized you, who is giving her the back. He seems  slightly taller than before \"Master! You're back to your normal size?\" she says with a curious expression. You turn around and look at her with a weird expression \"Normal size? What are you talking about?\" you ask \"Didn't you say that you wanted to be tiny forever?\" Melody asks again, more and more confused \"Tiny? You're the one being tiny right now, if you ask me\" you reply. Melody looks at you with a weird look before looking around. She notices that everything is huge. Her jaw shuts open \"But.. How?\" is all she manages to say \"No clue. But the point is another one\" dream you replies. Melody looks with a curious expression \"You see Melody, since you're so small, I... don't have any other use for you. You can't fight like this, so...\" you say picking out a pokeball. Melody recognizes it as hers; she didn't enter that thing from ages. She looks in shock as you put it on the ground and crush it with your foot \"This is a goodbye\" you finish. Melody looks shocked for a few moments, before bursting in tears \"Ma- master...\" she  says crying \"Don't need to call me like that now. Goodbye\" you say turning around and starting to walk away. Tears pour down Melody's face as she tries to follow you; she falls from the bed and notices she barely reaches your heel \"Master... please... I love you...\" she says crying, but you can't hear it anymore now.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\nMelody's eyes shut open as she gets up and sits down on the branch she is on, then she starts crying. She covers her eyes with her hands as tears fall from her eyes. Unknown to her, you have fallen on her lap and her tears fall on your head. You open your eyes slowly and hear the sound of someone crying. You look up to see Melody crying \"Melody why are you crying?\" you ask worried. Melody looks at you for a brief moment, with her eyes filled with tears, before picking you in her arms and tightening you full force in a hug to her chest. You almost run out of air, but fortunately Melody feels this and softens her grip \"Melody, why are you crying? Come on, tell me\" you ask again, but she still doesn't answer as she keeps sobbing and sniffing. You clearly need to calm her down, so you hardly free yourself from her hug and start climbing her body \"Wha- what are you doing *sniff*?\" Melody asks as you hardly get on her head. She doesn't try to stop you. You sit down on the white \"ground\" that is her forehead and start petting her long, green hair \"It's okay, I'm here, don't cry anymore\" you whisper sweetly. Melody keeps crying for a few more minutes before finally calming down \"What happened Melody? Why were you crying?\" you ask again. Melody sniffs deeply, before picking you from her head; she looks at you for a bit, before kissing your face deeply. She then pulls off, leaving a completely blushing you. She sits you on her lap \"Okay, I'll explain everything\" she says sighing.<br>\r\n~  <br>\r\n\"That's horrible!\" you say shocked. Melody nods sadly as you continue \"You dreamt about an evil me that abandoned you because you were somehow shrunk?\" \"Yeah\" Melody confirms \"Melody, that's horrible. I don't even know how can you dream about such thing. I would never do that, even if you were actually shrunk\" you say. Melody smiles a little \"I know, but that nightmare somehow crossed my mind\" she explains \"It's not your fault. Would a hug make you feel better?\" you ask. Melody doesn't answer; she simply looks at you with a massive smile, before wrapping her arms around your small form and closing it in a tight hug. You return it with a smile as Melody leans closer \"Thank you\" she whispers. She then kisses you on the cheek. At least she intended to kiss your cheek, but in reality, she kissed the whole right side of your head, covering it in drool \"Whoops! Sorry!\" she says \"Don't apologize, I'm used to it by now\" you say smiling, causing her to giggle. You then yawn loudly and so does Melody \"*Yawn* I think we should go back to sleep\" Melody says \"Yeah, but have I to sleep on your chest again?\" you ask smirking \"You better, or else\" Melody replies with a grin \"Or else whaaaa-\" you can't even finish that she grabs you and lies down again, then she lies you between her breasts before covering, as always, your body with her hair \"Or else I'll make you ~\" she says in a singsong voice. You chuckle and look up in the sky to see that the moon is still shining. It must be 4 or 5 AM. Melody yawns again \"Good night master\" she says leaning closer to your head \"Thank you again\" she whispers in your ear, before playfully kissing it. You smile a little as you close your eyes. Melody closes her eyes too. Minutes pass fast, and by that time, you both are already dead asleep.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\nEventually, dawn comes, and the sun's first rays begins to shine, as the day slowly replaces the night. Light blazes into your eyes. You slowly wake up and open your eyes. You find yourself in the same position as you were the last night, still on Melody's chest. You sit up \"About the time, master\" comes Melody's voice. You look up to her as a pair of black hands comes to grab you. Instantly, you are brought up to her face \"Good morning master!\" Melody beams with her usual smile \"Good morning, Mel- ahhhh\" you don't get to finish that her large white lips start to smooch you all over. You almost run out of air as Melody stops \"Urgh... What was that for?\" you ask blushing \"Well, I had to thank you somehow. I slept like an angel after you helped me\" she explains giggling \"That's nothing. You helped me with my nightmares, so it was only fair to return the favor\" you say \"Awwwww, aren't you just the sweetest little master cutie ever\" Melody says kissing you once again, just making you to blush more. You stare at each other for a bit, before a loud noise is heard nearby, making the Pidgey's flee. You and Melody blush simultaneously, knowing what that noise is: it's both your and her stomach grumbling, asking for their daily first meal \"We should search for breakfast\" you say \"That, or we could resume our journey and eat a yummy lunch at the pokemon center\" Melody says, watering at the thought of the food. You sigh as  Melody's stomach grumbles again \"I need yummy in my tummy\" Melody says giggling. You chuckle before answering...</span></div></div>",

You notice this \"What's up Melody?\" you ask \"Uh, well, you see... I don't know which way to take....\" she replies with a small blush on her face. You silently laugh to yourself, before answering \"That way, Melody\" you say pointing to south. Melody smirks \"Thanks master. Oh, and laughing silently doesn't work with me. I read your mind~\" she says. This time a blush appears on your face, while Melody laughs, as she starts flying towards the direction you pointed, with your bag 'following' close. Eventually your blush fades and you stop grasping Melody's hair as you sit down on her head, enjoying the morning breeze. Melody starts humming to herself, though the sound doesn't escape your ears.

Melody groans at your statement \"I'm hungry! When will you teach me teleport?\" she asks annoyed \"Too bad, Meloetta can't learn it\" you reply laughing. Melody groans again as she lowers her head, closing her eyes. You fall from her head \"Melody!\" you scream. Her eyes shut open as you fall right in her hands \"Phew! That was close!\" you say, staring at Melody's sorrowful face \"Sorry!\" she apologizes \"Don't be, it was accident\" you say smiling. Her face instantly lights up, as she puts you on her head again \"I'll be more careful this time\" she says. You smile as you start petting her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems forever, you finally manage to see the orange roof of the Pokemon Center \"Melody! Look!\" you say. Melody squeals happily as she fastens her flying. Within minutes, she is in front of the door. She pushes you in her hair, making sure nobody can see you, and flies in. She goes to Nurse Joy's desk \"Good morning\" Melody says smiling \"Good morning to you, Melody\" the  pink haired nurse says with a smile \"How do you know my name?\" Melody asks \"Well, my sisters said a lot about you and your trainer\" the nurse says smiling \"Speaking of which, where is he?\" she asks. Melody sweat drops, and so do you. Melody mutters something under her breath \"I'm sorry?\" Joy asks \"Well, I said that he sent me here first while he stopped in the forest. I heard him talking about a rare herb or something. He'll eventually come\" she quickly improvises. The nurse looks at her before shrugging \"Anyway, could I have some breakfast, please? I have to meet up with my master outside\" Melody asks \"Sure\" the nurse says disappearing into a room. She comes back after a minute, holding a bag \"Here you go\" she says handing it \"Thanks!\" Melody says picking the bag \"See you around Nurse Joy\" she says flying outside \"Thanks for coming here\" the nurse waves her goodbye. Melody looks around to make sure nobody is looking at her before flying towards the forest. She sits down against a tall tree and pulls you out of her hair \"So? Do we have breakfast?\" you ask \"Right here\" your Meloetta says showing you the bag. Melody sits you next to her and opens the bag, revealing some Lava Cookies, a small bottle of moo moo milk and various kinds of berries. Melody waters at the food beside her...</span></div></div>",

Melody lets out a cute giggle \"Aren't you just a little gentleman~?\" she says, leaning to bite her cookie... somehow she ends biting her own teeth \"Ouch!\" she exclaims, looking for whatever took her cookie. It doesn't take long to spot a rather large Pidgeot, crumbs falling from it's mouth \"Hey! That was my breakfast you!!\" she shouts annoyed. She always hates when someone steals her food. The Pidgeot completely ignores her \"Urgh! Not the way to treat a lady!\" Melody yells again. You see the Pidgeot snickering. You crack a smile and start to chuckle. Unluckily for you, Melody notices \"What are you laughing about?\" she says angrily \"Melody, you should calm down. It's no big deal\" you say. The Pidgeot seems to just notice you \"Hello there snack\" it speaks, sounding female. In an instant, she flies at you and lands mere inches from you. You don't even have the time to think as the Pidgeot lowers her beak. Too bad for her, Melody is fast to think and holds her, before using power up punch and throwing her far \"Don't you dare\" she says angrily, while picking you up. She smiles briefly at you \"This is for sure a BIG deal, uh master?\" she says. Even though the situation, you manage to smile a little as she saved you. Again. But the Pidgeot gets back on her talons and charges at you two again. Melody puts you in her hair \"You'll be safe there\" she whispers, before using close combat. She hits her harshly, but the Pidgeot is still fighting. She uses brave bird, but Melody dodges and the bird crashes in a tree, fainting. Melody looks for a few moments before sighing in relief \"Whoa! That wasn't much of a chore, was it master?\" she says pulling you out of her green hair \"Yeah, I owe you\" you say \"Don't even say that\" she replies nuzzling you \"Come on, we have a breakfast to finish\" she then says \"Yeah, but I think we'll better finish it somewhere else. This place is too... loud\" you say. Melody just nods and turns her attention to the bag where the breakfast is. Just to find out a wild Rattata is eating it. As soon it notices you staring at it, it flees. You both groan simultaneously \"One good way to start the day\" you say \"Come on, we can still find  something to eat\" Melody encourages you, petting your hair with her fingerless hand. You sigh \"Let's get going then\" you say. Melody giggles cutely before starting to get away, ignoring the fainted Pidgeot.</span></div></div>",

Melody jumps back in alert as the Pidgeot hardly stands up on her talons. She briefly glares at you two; Melody returns her glare. They silently stare at each other for a while, completely ignoring you, who are still sitting on Melody's head. After five minutes, the Pidgeot literally drops to the ground, her wings on her eyes, and starts crying. Melody tilts her head confused. You sighs, grasping her hair tightly, before looking at the bird pokemon \"Why are you crying?\" you ask. The Pidgeot looks at you two before standing up. She sniffles a few times before talking \"I have to find food for my little Pidgey's back at my nest. Unfortunately I couldn't so *sob* I decided -\" \"Attack us and try to use me as food\" you end somewhat annoyed. The Pidgeot blushes \"Yeah, I'm really sorry about that, please forgive me\" she apologizes \"Apology accepted\" you say smiling \"Yeah, just don't try to attack my master again, or else\" Melody warns, before smiling as well. The bird pokemon sniffles a few more times \"Now I have to get back to look for food though\" the Pidgeot says, turning around \"Wait! We'll help you out\" you say \"Really?!\" both Pidgeot and Melody ask, the first smiling and the other shocked \"Sure\" you say \"Can you wait for a second?\" Melody asks Pidgeot, before picking you from her head and turning around \"Why do we have to help her? I want to continue our journey!\" she whispers \"It's only right to help the others Melody. And plus, who knows what'll happen?\" you whisper back. Melody desperately tries to find a reason to fight your logic with, but she cant can't. She sighs \"Fine\" she surrenders. You smirk. Melody turns around again \"We'll be glad to help\" she says Pidgeot. A smile forms on her beak as she start flying, Melody and you following close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of searching through this forest, you managed to find a good amount of berries; Melody is carrying them with her Psychic \"How far is that nest of yours?\" Meldoy asks tiredly. Pidgeot stops \"Look upwards\" she says. Melody does ad told and notices a nest; within it there are three Pidgey's, chirping like crazy, asking for their food. Melody sighs in relief before putting the berries  down on the ground \"Thanks you guys! How can I repay you?\" Pidgeot asks, a wide smile on her beak \"Really, there's no problem, don't worry about it\" you say. The bird pokemon doesn't answer, but she leans towards you two, giving you a hug with her wings. Melody hugs back, and so do you, enjoying the warmth of her feathers. After a while, you break the hug \"Goodbye guys. If you ever need something, you know who to ask\" Pidgeot says \"Thank you\" both you and Melody say, before starting to fly away. Pidgeot waves you two goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we directed, master?\" Melody asks after a while \"Well, I think we're going to reach the next pokemon center\" you reply \"I'd like to have a bed to sleep in tonight\". Melody nods \"As you wish master\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After eating and taking a nap, it's now 6 PM. You are  laying on the bed with your eyes closed, not sleeping, just resting, when Melody finally speaks up \"Master! I'm bored!\" she says in a huff. You open your eyes \"Then do something\" you say tiredly \"But I want to play with you\" she says whining \"Not now Melody, I'm resting\" you say \"Pleaaaaaase\" she pleads. This time, you stand your ground \"No Melody, I wanna rest\". Melody pouts \" You leave me no other choice\" she says. Instantly, Melody pins your arms with her boulder - like hands and stands right before you. You wonder what she's gonna do to you, when she makes her saddest expression: eyes wide and tearing, shaking lips and whining. You try to fight her, you really do, but your will can do nothing against the power of her cuteness \"Fine! You can play with me!\" you yell. Melody squeals in joy, releasing you in the meantime. You rub your arms before looking at her \"So? What game do you want to play?\" you ask \"Telling you the truth, master, I don't want to play, I want to do that...\" she says seductively, rubbing your chin with her hand \"Now Melody?\" you ask \"Yes, right now\" she confirms. You sigh, knowing that you can't fight her, so you start undoing your pants. As soon your remove them, Melody gently pushes you on your back and gets on top of you \"Time for my Arousing Song\" she says, starting to sing once again the familiar song that makes you go erect. Once your member is at its full, Melody lifts her skirt and lowers herself on you. She starts humping you; you just let her as she moves a hand to stroke your hair. You give in to the pleasure and start to moan loudly, getting a smile out of Melody, before she starts moaning as well. After ten minutes of her humping, you can't hold it in anymore \"Melody, I'm about to-\" \"Me too!\" she says, cutting you off. In fact, not even a second later, a wave of white goo exits her vagina, soaking you. You also let out a load of your cum, yours mixing with Melody's one. After a few minutes, Melody hardly stands up from you, not still having recovered from her orgasm, and lies next to you \"That.... was... wonderful\" she says panting. You haven't the energy to talk, so you barely nod. Melody smiles and gives you a peck on the cheek. You blush before closing your eyes; within minutes you fall asleep. Melody looks over you and notices you're sleeping. She smiles happily, before closing her eyes and falling asleep as well.</span></div></div>",

In your dream, you open your eyes and find yourself next to a sleeping Melody, who is lying on the ground, next to you. Moments after you, she opens her eyes as well and looks around confused, before she spots you. She moves to pick you up \"Master!, where are we? We're not in the Pokemon center anymore\" she says. You look around and, true to her word, you both are in some kind of forest, but the scenario is one of the scariest you've ever seen: there are no leaves on the trees, the sky is completely dark, and near you appears to be some kind of lake, but the water is bloody red \"This place is horrible!\" Melody exclaims, tightening you in a hug. You also feel slightly uneasy here. You were thinking when a scream catches your attention. Both you and Melody turn around to see a Honchkrow. You look at it confused, while Melody's eyes widen \"You again?!\" she asks somewhat scared \"Krow! This time, I won't let that snack flee\" he yells. You look at Melody more confused than ever \"Remember that Honchkrow that attacked us while you were asleep?\" she asks, tightening her grip on you. You remember, when a splashing sound catches your attention: you turn to see a group of Sharpedo's. You remember them from your previous nightmare. At this point, you start to shiver, but it's not over yet: the ground starts to shake. And within moments, a group of Krookodile's appear, looking at both you and Melody with maniacal smiles. You remember that not too long ago when you were still normal sized, you had Melody to defeat them because you accidentally entered into their territory. Of course, Melody could take them on again, but not with the other Pokemon menacing you. A loud scream catches your attention: The Honchkrow has called his Murkrow minions. At this point, every hope you had before is gone \"Master?\" Melody asks worriedly \"Y-yes?\" \"What do we do now?\" \"I don't know Melody. I really don't know\" you say. At this point the three groups of Pokemon charge at you. Melody hugs you tighter than ever as she closes her eyes. You do like her and close your eyes waiting for your doom. The last thing you hear is Melody's cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Melody shut your eyes open, both sweating and panting. Melody looks at you \"Master, I-\" \"-had a nightmare with all our old enemies?\" you ask \"YeaYeah. You had the same nightmare?\" she asks. You nod \"I can't explain why we keep having nightmares. What could be causing them?\" you ask exasperated. Melody seems to be deep in thinking when she finally speaks up \"I do have a theory master\" she says. You look at her curiously as she explains \"You see, there is a Pokemon that gives nightmares to people\" \"You mean Darkrai? But why would it give us nightmares?\" you ask \"No clue. But I think it owes us a LOT of explanation. Why don't we pay it a visit?\" Melody asks grinning \"Wait, how do we know where to find it?\" you ask \"Well, it's surely around. It can't give nightmares from a long distance\" Melody says. Before you can talk, she uses Relic Song and shifts in Pirouette Form \"Why did you change from?\" \"You know, Fighting types are super effective on Dark types\" she replies picking you up and flying out of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long passes before you and Melody spot a figure of a Darkrai: It's standing in midair, looking downwards. Suddenly it looks in your direction and sees you and Melody. It looks at you two for a second before...</span></div></div>",

But is just a second before the Darkrai flees \"Hey! Come here!\" you hear Melody shout, obviously pissed, as she chases the Darkrai, still holding you in a tight hug. The Darkrai flies at its full speed in the night, trying to escape Melody, but she manages to keep up, as she is way faster in this form \"Stop! I won't hurt you... yet\" she says, whispering the last part. Darkrai completely ignores her and keeps flying away. Eventually, it tires of flying and descends in the woods, making you lose sight of it \"Oh no, you don't!\" Melody yells, picking you and holding you by your ears, so you can't hear anything as she uses Hyper Voice. You can't hear it, but her voice is so powerful to wipe away trees. You stare at your pokemon impressed as she spots the Dark type pokemon. Melody makes her way to the ground, but the Darkrai starts to fly again. Melody groans as she gives chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so of flying through this woods, both Melody and Darkrai stop, both panting \"Finally *uff* we're here *pant* face to face\" Melody says. Darkrai doesn't try to flee this time as Melody gets near it. She then drops you. You fall to the ground, and probably to your own death, but instead you are lifted by psychic and held up in the air. Melody then grabs Darkrai by the arms and stares at it menacingly, before speaking \"Now, you will explain why are giving me and my master nightmares or else\" she says, sounding exasperated. The Darkrai contemplates its opponent for a few moments before talking \"Fine\" it says, sounding female. You are shocked as you always thought Darkrai was a male. Back at Darkrai, she starts her story \"I am a lonely pokemon, I always was since I was kid. I never had a friend, because everyone, pokemon and people, would think I would give them nightmares. That always pissed me off. But one thing really angered me: one day, while I was passing through a city, I noticed a tiny human and a pokemon. You two. Imagine what the sight of so much love unleashed in me. Pure anger. Why didn't I had someone that loved me that much? If wasn't fair. I was so jealous that I started to give you nightmares. Until tonight when you discovered about me. And here we are\" Darkrai explains. You try to take in the facts: she's a lonely pokemon that is jealous of your and Melody's relationship. Melody releases her as she continues \"Now you know too much. So I'll just have to send you to sleep and use dream eater, so you'll have no memory of what happened\" she says as she puts her hands together and forms a black sphere \"Melody! That's dark void! Dodge!\" you order as Darkrai fires. Melody dodges just in time \"Use power up punch Melody\" you say. Melody's fist glows red as she punches Darkrai right in the face. She's sent flying back, but she gets back up and uses dark pulse. Melody is hit by the attack, but it doesn't do much damage as she is a fighting type \"Melody use close combat\" you order. Your Meloetta moves fast and hits Darkrai repeatedly with the most powerful fighting move. Darkrai growls angrily as she charges another dark pulse \"Melody, finish this! Use hyper beam!\". Melody puts her hands together and forms a reddish orange sphere. The two pokemon fire simultaneously, causing a huge explosion. If it wasn't for psychic, you would've been blown away. The smoke then reveals Darkrai, charging dark void again \" Melody, quick, put her to sleep. Use relic song!\" you say. Melody nods as Darkrai fires her attack. Melody starts to sing, the wave of sound blocking the dark sphere for a second d before...</span></div></div>",

want harm you in any way, you feel Melody poke you with her finger and ask if you run out of dare, you told her that you dare her to put you in her mouth and then swallow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looked at you for some time then she finally spoke, never taking her her eyes off you Melody told you that she love to do it but she have to do it in the morning as it a bit last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two went to bed as usual in your same places as you been doing since you were shrunk but when you woke up you found yourself laying on a metal tray as you looked around you saw two giant bowls one had cookies in it and the other one had berries and before you could do or say anything you was being picked up and put in the bowl of berries, as you look up, you see Melody looking down at you with a loving smile  on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody look down at her cute tiny master in the bowl of berries and give him a loving smile then she asked if he was ready to be her breakfast, you remembered the dare and smiles at her nodding yes, Melody gave you something that looked like a small bracelet and a tiny torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody told you to put the bracelet on as it will protect you from being digested so you put the bracelet and held the torch in your right hand, just then you felt the bowl that you was in rise up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody couldn't believe that lastnight her tiny master dared her to eat him, when she knew about the stories you read this was one of the things she was hoping you would ask for and she was happy that she kept the bracelet and the torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Melody saw you put the bracelet on she picked the bowl of berries with you in it, keeping her eyes on you and saying look at all them delicious and cute looking your berries.. it's a shame my master is not here to help me with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit in the bowl of berries, you couldn't believe this was going to happen, as you listening to what Melody was saying and then you saw her giant paw pick one of the berries out and eat it, Melody would two more berries then she would say I think I'll s save some for laster, she would get up and walk to the fridge and put the bowl inside and wait a few minutes and open the fridge door up again and say think I we have one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch Melody giant paw take two more berries, you thought you would be the next berry but you heard her say that she would save some for laster, you felt Melody get up and start to walk somewhere, as Melody was walking the bowl started to Shake, all the berries side moving around bumping into you of the berry juices cover you making you just about to the same colour as em, just then you heard the fridge door open and your bowl  was placed inside and then the fridge door was closed, it took you a few minutes to remove most of the berries out of the way, just as you moved the last one out the way you heard the fridge door open again, as you turn around you could see Melody looking in and you heard her say just one more and then you saw her giant paw come in and picked you out of the bowl,  you felt yourself raising up on till you was looking at Melody beautiful face licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody liked messing with you some time and this was one of them times, Melody opened the fridge door and looked in the bowl of berries she could see you looked just like one so after saying that she could have one more, she picked you out of the bowl and bought you up to her face and started to licking her lips, and before throwing you into her mouth she said.. now there a cute berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on Melody wet but smooth tongue, the tongue started to move to each side of her mouth rubbing you on the side of the mouth and then to the roof of her mouth I am you was enjoying it and you knew Melody was as well, when Melody stopped moving you around in her mouth and sucking on you, you started move to the back of her throat and here came the bit you was looking forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody though that she kept you waiting too long so with one last gulp she could feel you going down her throat to her waiting stomach but she swear she you could hear you going weee on the way down, when Melody knew you was in her stomach she look around see what to do, she spotted the bowl of cookies, with a smile on her face she said I forgot about the cookies I'm sure my master wouldn't mind if I take some and I could save him some when he gets back, Melody back to the bed then sat down and picked the bowl of cookies up and started to eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally landed in her stomach as you got up you turn the torch on and started looking around you could see all the berries digesting and you wasn't going to be but then you thought you heard Melody say something about cookies and then everything started move, you felt like that you was in a bouncy castle as you was bounding around, when everything stopped moving you looked up just in time to see a giant cookie coming down from the sky it just missed you but land in the diges juice so you couldn't get to, you was Melody would eat anyone and as luck would have it two more headed to the stomach, you ran to the last cookie, you took some bits and started eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody had just finished the cookies off so she thought it would be a good time to talk to you, Melody called to you but when there was no answer Melody started to get worry, she started to think what if the bracelet didn't work or if a cookie fell on you killed you, just then you answered her, Melody started screaming I thought the bracelet didn't work or worse I killed you with the cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Melody screaming and what she said, you started to get upset with yourself, you apologise to her I'm sorry that you had a mouthful of cookies, Melody could sense that you was upset, she tried to calm  down by putting her paw on her stomach rubbing it a little and try say it was okay  ,you put your hand where you thought her paw was and told her to listen to you and you told... Melody  you are the most beautiful wonderful pok\u00e9mon i ever met and love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter some small talk which felt a bit weird from where you was, Melody never took her paw away from her stomach, Melody asked If you want come out now but you said no wanted stay a bit longer, Melody asked what you wanted do now.</span></div></div>",

Where are you heading down there master?\" Melody  asks, making the whole surface of her body shake beneath your feet, menacing to make you lose your balance.<br>\r\n\"Melody! Careful!\" you shout at her.<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" she says in an apologetic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going downwards.\" you reply, somewhat embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"So my little guy wants to have some real fun, uh? I sure don't mind~\" she replies. You see a grin growing wide on her white face. Knowing Melody, you know that means no good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you turn around and start walking, Melody's smirk growing wider each step you take. You walk on the immense black landscape, stopping where the black stops and the white skin begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush spreads on your face as you eye the white lips right in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Mh~ master... go on...\" Melody moans as you are standing on a very sensible part of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody is enjoying the activity of her tiny master on her body, until he stops by her crotch. A moan escapes her mouth. That feels wonderful. Then, a devious plan crosses her mind. As her tiny master walks on her lips, her eyes glow of an azure light. And so does her crotch, which immediately spreads at her mind's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are walking on Melody's vertical lips, when suddenly they spread.<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you shout as you fall down,  deep into the depths of Melody's love tunnel as her pussy lips close again, trapping you in a dark, tight and slippery place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" the pale giantess moans. Having her master inside her feels amazing, a feeling like no other.<br>\r\n\"Mhh, seems I lost my cutie... let's find him~\" she moans, swiping her paw towards her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inhales sharply as she inserts her paw inside herself.<br>\r\n\"C-Coming master... H-hold on!\" giggles mix with her own moans as her paw slides deeper inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spit out Melody's love juice. You can't really make out whatever she's saying. Everything's pretty muffled from here. And dark. And hot. Very hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, because of darkness, you don't manage to see a large black paw sliding toward you, Melody moaning each inch it descends. And then... a huge wave of vaginal juice washes you on the giant paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody lies back.<br>\r\n\"Lo me... lo-love master...\" she whispers, exhausted. She waits full five minutes before pulling out her own paw, which is covered in her juices. A familiar tiny body is laying on it, looking half dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally breath fresh hair again. You have to narrow your eyes because of the bright light blinding you.<br>\r\n\"Don't do it anymore...\" you mutter under your breath, unable to talk properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Melody is able to hear you.<br>\r\n\"No promises~\" she giggles. You mutter some incomprehensible things in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Meloetta drops you on her belly, which rises and falls along her breath. She rests on your bed for a while, never having recovered from such a violent orgasm, while you take your time recovering as well, still tired as hell from this experience. As much your erection is telling you that you actually enjoyed it, your mind is screaming you don't want to do it anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, not under this circumstances...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody slowly sits upright, picking you off her belly.<br>\r\n\"That was awesome!\" she says cheerfully, placing  kisses on both your cheeks.<br>\r\n\"But now, how about...</span></div></div>",

Sun is in fact about to settle down, and the moment has come for you and your beloved pokemon to go back home, after the usual day of training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon in question has a small, blue body with a star shaped, dark blue head. She has golden eyes and two tails. A red gem is on her forehead, two similar gems on her tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf, who is floating a few meters in front of you, flies over you, quietly sitting on your shoulder with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Quite the training today, right master?\" she asks as you start walking. You nod, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Indeed. You're getting even stronger, Azelf. And I just have a bowl of ice cream with your name on it.\" you say her, getting a cheer in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the front door, you step into your house, the same one you and Azelf have been sharing from years. As you turn on the lights, the pokemon floats off your shoulder and goes straight for the couch, while you head into the kitchen, just to return a minute later, holding Azelf's desired prize: a bowl filled with ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, both you and you're pokemon are sitting next to each other, the bowl between you and her. You turn on the TV, while Azelf, not losing any time, digs into the bowl. You give out a sigh as you grab a spoonful of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep skipping through the TV channels as the ice cream in the bowl disappears spoon after spoon. And, soon, nothing more remains in the bowl. You toss it on the table in front of the couch, while Azelf moves on your lap, snuggling up to you. You start petting her head, making her coo in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you yawn deeply.<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to bed now. Are you coming Azelf?\" you ask the blue pokemon.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" she replies, floating off to let you get up. You turn off the TV and slowly head to your bedroom, Azelf following close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou literally collapse on your bed, slowly crawling under the sheets. Azelf floats next to you, snuggling up to you once again.<br>\r\n\"Good night, Azelf...\" are the last words that escape your mouth before you fall unconscious. Azelf gives a smile. Her chance came earlier than she had anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer golden eyes start glowing azure, and so do you. When the light dies down after a few minutes, Azelf contemplates her work with a smile. <br>\r\n\"Good night, master.\" she whispers, careful to not wake you up.<br>\r\n\"Love you.\" she closes her eyes and lies her head on your pillow.<br>\r\n\u2018This is going to be fun.\u2019 she thinks to herself, quietly falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the moon in the sky is replaced by the morning sun. The dawn's first rays penetrate into the house through the windows, the light getting in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBothered by the feeling, you rub your eyes, before slowly opening them. Your gaze darts around for a moment, trying to spot Azelf on the bed. But she doesn't seem to be here. Weird. She always sleeps with you. The smaller bed you had made for her was, in fact, never used. But where could she be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a soft noise. It sounds like... snoring. Slowly, you turn in direction of the sound. And a gasp escapes your mouth as you realize where you have been sleeping all night long...</span></div></div>",

The surface seems to be... pulsing for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait a moment... blue fur...\" you whisper, slowly looking up. It takes you several seconds of doing so to spot the blue face of your now <i>huge</i> pokemon, who is currently asleep on your pillow.<br>\r\nYou let out a gasp, which sounds more like a squeak. You look around. Everything around you is huge! You look back at Azelf, and you determine that you must be near her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf, wake up.\" you say, poking the furry surface. Your pokemon mutters some incomprehensible words in her sleep, but doesn't wake up.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, wake up.\" you repeat, a little louder, poking her furry belly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, she moves her arms in her sleep and wraps them around you, shoving you into her belly while 'trapping' you in a hug. That feels... nice. The pillowy fur cushions you and its warmth is pretty comforting. You almost feel like going to sleep again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awakened by the feeling of things moving. You open your eyes to find yourself back on the bed, your own pokemon stirring. She then opens her golden eyes and looks around, as if trying to spot you.<br>\r\n\"Master?\" she calls out.<br>\r\n\"Azelf! Down here!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon looks down to you. She blinks a few times, before smiling.<br>\r\n\"Hi there master. Enjoying the new situation?\" she asks cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"\u2018Enjoying\u2019? What do you mean?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf giggles.<br>\r\n\"Please, I did shrink you for a reason. I was there when you were reading <b>those</b> stories.\" she says with a smirk. You blush.<br>\r\n\"Okay, how?\" you ask after several moments of awkward silence.<br>\r\n\"I have my methods. My spirit can leave my body, remember? That turned out to be pretty useful.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush even more.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I can explain...\" you say awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry master, I don't mind. Just look at you! You look so <b>cute</b> at that size!\" she cheers, reaching down to pick you. She closes you in a soft hug. You notice that you're roughly the size of her tiny paws now.<br>\r\n\"There. Isn't this nice?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"This way, you get to live your dreams, while I get to have a cute little master to play with~\" she sings, tightening her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, she finally releases you and holds you in her paw, staring down at you sweetly.<br>\r\n\"Say, what do we do now?\" you ask her. She places a paw on her chin, seeming to be thinking.<br>\r\n\"Well... there's a lot to choose from. Those stories were really hot stuff, weren't they?\" she says seductively. The blush returns on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf continues.<br>\r\n\"But, I think that the first thing we should do is get breakfast.\" you nod. Her two tails slide beneath your feet lifting you up.<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" she says, before turning around, starting to float towards the door, you floating right behind her as you are on her tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can share an apple.\" she says upon getting in the kitchen. She picks one and used her psychic to slice it. Then she settles you on the table and sits next to you. While she eats her three slices in less than a minute, it takes a good while for you to eat your single slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you finish, she gets a hold of you and floats on the couch, settling you on her belly.<br>\r\n\"Now we can finally begin~\" she says cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"What are we starting with?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Well, as I said, there's a <b>lot</b> we can do.\" she says. She ponders something for a few moments, before looking at you, smiling.<br>\r\n\"How about we start off with this?\" she says as she...</span></div></div>",

You always treated Mesprit like a princess, and she has always been there for you. Being the pokemon that created emotions, she always managed to cheer you up whenever you were sad and she laughed with you wherever you were happy. This relationship blossomed for ten years, until one day Mesprit decided to go further. You could never guess that that one day would've changed your life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and exhausting day of training with Mesprit, you finally declare the end of the training. Mesprit happily flies to you, receiving a pat on her head \"Good job today, Mesprit. You did great\" you say \"Thank you master\" she replies, hugging you with her short arms \"Come on, let's go back home. I got a big bowl of cookies waiting for you\" you say. Mesprit cheers; she always had and she still does love cookies, they're just after you in the things she loves. Luckily, you always manage to keep her in perfect shape, thanks to the training you two do every day. Mesprit gets on your head and grasps its sides possessively, her two tails swinging happily behind her. Smiling, you make your way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, you head straightght for the kitchen. As promised, you get a bowl of cookies from the pantry and head for the couch. As soon you drop yourself on it, Mesprit flies off your head and picks the bowl from your hands. She then sits down on your lap, the cookies in front of her, and digs in \"Make sure to save me some\" you say, picking up the remote and turning on the TV \"No promises\" comes her reply. Chuckling, you reach down and pick a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bowl is now almost completely empty. Yawning, you get up \"I think I'll hit the hay now. Are you coming?\" you ask, getting a nod from Mesprit, who floates to your shoulder. Turning off the TV, you make your way to your bedroom. Yawning once again, you lift the blankets and get comfy under them, Mesprit in your arms. You had always slept together since you were a kid. It takes you a few minuets to fall asleep, but you eventually begin to snore. Mesprit looks at you with her golden eyes, decided to go ahead with her plan. Flying from under the blanket, she focuses. The gem on her head and the two other gems on her tails begin to glow \"Good night master\" she says \"When you'll wake up, you'll be completely different\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn comes, sun's rays shining through the night, making it fade away. You open your eyes. For some reason, your bed I comfier than last night, you can't tell why. Looking to your sides, you notice Mesprit nowhere in sight. She must've gone to finish the remaining cookies in the bowl. Chuckling a bit, you try to pull off the blanket, but you can't. You look at it and your jaw drops. This isn't your blanket. In fact, two weird objects, each with a red gem, cover your body. They seem like Mesprit tails... wait. Looking down you see you're no longer in your bed, you have been laying all night long on a whitish grey surface that seems Mesprit's fur. And, in the end, you look up and notice the pink face of your now gigantic pokemon sleeping on your pillow \"M-Mesprit?!\" you call out. Your pokemon opens her now as big as your head eyes and looks at you \"Good morning master. Slept well?\" she asks like nothing happened \"Mesprit, shat happened to me?\" you ask \"Oh, that? Well, I shrank you down so your dream would come true\" she says. What? How does she know about your fetish? \"You're wondering how come I know about your shrinking fetish\" she says \"Yes?\" you say \"Well, I noticed you reading those stories where pokemon shrink their trainers to have fun with them, either in playful or sexual way. It's not like you were invisible, you know\" she says giggling. You blush as her two tails unwrap from around tour body \"And so I decided to make you live the same experience\" she says, pulling you in a hug. She's now fully able to hug your whole body with her short arms. You return the hug, happy that Mesprit decided to do this for you \"Now master\" she says \"What do you saying of having some fun?\" she asks. You notice she's saying it...</span></div></div>",

Mesprit squeals happily, picks you up and nuzzles you \"Thanks master, I promise you'll have more fun than you ever had\" she says \"And why yes, I have the perfect game in mind, I think you know it pretty well\" she says. You stare at her curiously \"It's called cat and mouse\" she giggles \"In every story you read, every pokemon play that at least once with their trainers. And were not different\" she says. You nod, she's right. In every story you (and apparently she!) read, the nice ol' cat and mouse was never absent. You perfectly know the rules, and you also know that there's a catch \"What's the catch?\" you ask \"Oh right, that. Well, what about this? If you win, you'll get a special reward. If I win, you'll have to do anything I ask for the rest of the day\" she says. You find this pretty right, so you agree \"Any time limit?\" you ask \"You pick\". You want this to last, at least for you to have fun. You know Mesprit would never hurt you in anyway so... \"What about an hour?\" you say \"Are you sure? That's pretty long for someone your size, you're sure you can hide from this big, pink and grey cat for that long?\" she asks playfully. You nod, confident \"Perfect! And now that's settled, go hide you mouse, you have time until one hundred before I chase you\" she says releasing you, while giggling. You are about to speak, but \"Don't worry, no cheating with psychic!\" she says, shutting you up. Mesprit then turns around \"One... two... three...\" she starts to count. Before she reaches four, you've already dashed to the edge of the bed. Grasping the blanket, you climb down and look around for a possibly hiding spot. You see the closet slightly ajar, you could hide there. Or you could try and push a drawer open to hide in it then. Or you could hide somewhere else in the house. By the time you are deciding, Mesprit already reached forty. Your time is running short, so you decide that it's 'safer' to hide...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With your time running short, you quickly decide to hide in another room. Mesprit would for sure search this room for first, so she would have more probabilities to find you. As she reaches sixty, you dash out of the door and look around. Upstairs there are a bathroom and a storeroom. Downstairs there are the kitchen, the living room and a bigger bathroom. Luckily, you don't have any brothers or sisters, and your parents left you the house along lots of money when they died. Sure, you were saddened when that happened, you even fell into depression for a small period. But thanks to Mesprit, that somehow managed to cheer you up, you snapped out of it. It's because of this you owe her your life. She was the reason you are not alone in the world, it's thanks to her if you have someone to count on when things don't go right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think of hiding in the storeroom, Mesprit would hardly find you there, thanks to all the objects that you store there. Or you could hide in the bathroom. You shake the thoughts off, hiding on this floor would not be a wise idea. Mesprit would for sure check it for first, so you have to hide downstairs \"Eighty... eighty one...\" you hear Mesprit from the bedroom. So you rush to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a whole, long minute to reach downstairs \"One hundred! Ready or not, here I come!\" Mesprit shouts from upstairs. Knowing that she'll check the bedroom and the other room for sure, you use your time to look for a hiding spot. Something catches your attention. The couch. Hiding between its pillows, Mesprit would have a hard time finding you. Rushing to it, you grasp the leathery surface and start climbing. As you get on the top, you hear Mesprit's voice \"Um. Seems master's not here. Well, I'll just check downstairs\" she says. You sprint towards the pillows and leap forward, landing between them. Shortly after, Mesprit comes downstairs \"Mousy~ where are you~\" she says in a singsong voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks around for her small, adorable master. He must be somewhere around here, there's no other hiding place. She then looks at the couch and smiles. Highly probable that you're there. She's about to move the pillows, when a familiar smell catches her nose. Turning around, her eyes widen. Standing on the table on the kitchen, the bowl of cookies from last night \"Well well well. Seems master will have to wait, I have some unfinished business\" she says, flying to her beloved cookies. From under the pillows you are, you sigh. Almost found you. Wiping some sweat, you decide to find another hiding spot while she's busy with the cookies. Slowly, you crawl out and carefully climb down the couch. Mesprit is still busy eating cookies. You decide to tip toe in the bathroom. But as you walk, Mesprit turns around, an empty bowl behind her. Unluckily, she spots you \"Found you!\" she says, a playful smile on her face. Smiling as well, you dash towards the bathroom, Mesprit flying behind you \"Come here mouse, I'll get you sooner or later\" she giggles. You stop in front of the wall, as Mesprit flies in front of you, her sgadow completely obscuring you \"What a shame, just five minutes and you would have won. Oh well, looks like kitty gets her mouse\" she charges at you. You wait for her to be close enough and in the last moment, you move to the side and she bumps in the wall \"Ouch!\" she exclaims, falling to the ground \"Are you alright Mesprit?\" you ask worriedly, while getting close to her. Just as you make another step, her tails move and wrap around your waist \"Gotcha!\" she exclaims, pulling you in a hug. You both end up laughing, you hug her back \"Let's call this a draw\" she says \"Fine. But what about the catch?\" you ask \"What about this, you get your reward, but you have to do one thing for me\" she says. Finding it right, you nod \"Great. Now for your reward, close your eyes\" she says. Nodding, you close your eyes as told. Immediately after, you feel a pair of lips being pressed on your cheek, smooching you. You open your eyes, a small blush crossing your face. Mesprit giggles \"Ummm... wha-what do I have to do?\" you ask \"Well...</span></div></div>",

You almost sink into her grayish white fur; each strand is almost your height, some of them are even taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your pokemon. Her eyes are closed, and she's moaning softly at the feeling of your hands rubbing through the soft fur that covers her belly.<br>\r\n\"Am I doing good Mesprit?\" you ask the pokemon giantess. She purrs in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep rubbing this gigantic landscape of a belly for a while. You suddenly stop, your arms sore from all the petting you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit notices. Her eyelids slowly open, revealing her golden eyes.<br>\r\n\"Why did you stop?\".<br>\r\n\"Because I'm tired. I just need a little break.\"  you state.<br>\r\nMesprit's lips curl into a smile.<br>\r\n\"My little master is tired? I think you earned a little massage of your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Mesprit's tails wrap around your waist and bring you into Mesprit's open paws. She lies you on your belly and starts rubbing your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit, the feeling of the soft and warm fur of the paw mixed with the relaxing feeling of the other paw slowly rubbing your back is really great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh happily. This is what heaven must be like. But eventually it all comes to an end as Mesprit stops her massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot even move as your legs seems to have melted from excessive relax.<br>\r\n\"So? Did my little cutie master like that?\" she asks sweetly. <br>\r\n\"Yes...\" is the only answer you can mutter. That and the pink blush that appears on your face.  Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes pass, and you're now sitting on the golden eyed pokemon's belly, while she's laying down on the couch, petting your head slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So master...\" she says after a while, almost in a whisper.<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now?\".</span></div></div>",

I was actually <i>hoping</i> for a suggestion like that~\" Mesprit chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, you find her arm reaching out for you, pushing you down on your back and covering your whole body but your head, giving you an almost accurate idea of just how small and helpless you are to this pink and blue titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She</i> is in control now. And you find that you don't mind it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds pass, and so do minutes as you just lay on the giantess' belly. The only noises you can hear are the ones coming from within Mesprit. Aside from those, pure, wonderful silence surrounds both you and your pokemon, crafting a soothing, peaceful aura around the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Silence gets you all relaxed and happy, doesn't it?\" your pokemon suddenly asks, but in a mere whisper, so that this heavenly atmosphere isn't broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just produce incoherent syllables in response. Mesprit giggles softly, and you find her other paw sliding its way toward your head as the giantess start petting you softly. You sigh contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost an hour of this, Mesprit decides to try something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she her paw grips the back of your shirt. She brings you upwards, past her massive belly, past her... hills... and finally past her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw holding you comes to a halt above the pokemon's pink, smiling face.<br>\r\n\"Aw, look at you. You look so cute like that~\" she whispers, gently lowering you towards the cavern that is her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder. As much as you liked reading about it, you weren't exactly fond of vore. <br>\r\n\"Mesprit...\" you call out, trying to get her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your fears turn out to be for naught as the paw holding you moves to the side of her face and pushes you into her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other paw joins the first as she pins you in between her cheek and her paws, nuzzling you lovingly.<br>\r\n\"Master...\" Mesprit whispers, her eyes closed, a faint blush spreading on her face as she nuzzles you. She can feel your happiness. She can feel <i>her</i> happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't deny it - and neither could you: this is something more than just simple affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if wanting to empathize her own thought, Mesprit suddenly stops nuzzling you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before you can even think of complaining, she gazes at you sweetly, before gently lowering you to her lips, her nuzzling shifting into kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places brief, soft kisses on the area of your face, which grows more and more red each and every time her lips make contact and leave it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel... happy. You always dreamt to shrink around a pokemon giantess. And your dream came true. Not only, but you shrank around Mesprit. Even better, she was the one to do it, because she wanted you to live your dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you can definitely feel the relationship between the two of you changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvolving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat so far has been a relationship based on reciprocal affection is now blooming into something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your mind, Mesprit finally pulls off, her cheeks now burning brighter than before. And yet, her smile never left her face while she kissed you. You dare to ask:<br>\r\n\"Does this make us...?\"<br>\r\n\"A couple? I think so, cutie~\" the giantess chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spends a few moments staring at you intently, before speaking again:<br>\r\n\"Say, little master,\" she says, once again cuddling you. Though this time not to her belly, but to her chest, right in between her subtle breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next question takes you off guard:<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you like to take this game of ours a little... further?\" she asks, both her smile and her blush widening as she imagines what comes next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit... are you really sure?\" you ask, unsure about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour golden eyed goddess giggles a melodious, paradisiac giggle.<br>\r\n\"Think about it. There's me, you and a big, warm bed upstairs. Also, nobody around to bother us two.\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout actually waiting for an answer, Mesprit hovers off the couch and in direction of the bedroom you two share. More specifically, in direction of the <i>bed</i> you two share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a dreamlike state, you barely make out what's going on. But you perfectly knows what Mesprit wants to do. And you want it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, it wouldn't be just sex. It would be the ultimate way to be with your goddess once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your mind comes up with other ways to continue this game of yours before getting to <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you ponder your next move, Mesprit arrives to the bedroom, and gently lays on the bed, sitting you in front of her.<br>\r\n\"So, my little cutie~\" she sings.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" </span></div></div>",

Though not with your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your <i>tongue</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick your goddess' sex, backing her into pure bliss, moans starting to escape her lips once again as your tongue slides on the wide surface of her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Mesprit can't hold it in anymore. <br>\r\n\"MASTER!\" she shouts as a tidal wave of love juice rivers out of her sex, washing you away from it. Some of the stuff even ends up in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there on your own bed, waiting for Mesprit to recover from her orgasm. But little you know is that your own pokemon isn't even half done with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you find one of her tails sliding in between your small form and the smooth surface of the bed. Before you even process what's going on, the tail you're laying on retracts, pulling you towards Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, more accurately, towards Mesprit's still dripping slit. You hear the emotion pokemon talking to you:<br>\r\n\"My little cutie,\" she says with a giggle as you approach her.<br>\r\n\"Round two!\" with these last two words, your bedroom, Mesprit and all the light fade away as you are enclosed in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your first look of the insides of your own pokemon, finding yourself inside of a dark, slippery, fleshy and hot cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your eyes begin to adjust to the darkness, you notice drops of Mesprit's juice dropping from the 'ceiling'.<br>\r\n\"Master,\" you her Mesprit's muffled voice.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit?\" <br>\r\n\"Come on! The fun's not over yet!\" she chimes excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning to nobody, you instantly start to wiggle and squirm within the confines of your goddess' sex, immediately getting her to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to please her by rubbing the sticky walls, licking them, while crawling up and down in darkness, Mesprit howling in pure pleasure as you do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is enjoying what you're doing. And you are enjoying it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like a self-imposed task, pleasing this pink headed pokemon until the very end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich doesn't take long to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit suddenly screams in pleasure as another wave of cum washes you towards her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shakes as you're ungracefully thrown out of your pokemon's body, landing onto your own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a shadow looms over your form as Mesprit moves to stare down at you. You notice a deep, red shade covering her cheeks; drops of pearly sweat run down her face, her eyes are glazed with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her mouth is smiling, suggesting that your goddess was fully satisfied by your activities.<br>\r\n\"You... were... wonderful!\" she exclaims, reaching out for you. But her paw stops in midair as she notices the state you are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... you're not getting anywhere near my fur right now.\" giggles the titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stand up, and notice yourself covered from head to toe in Mesprit's juices.<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, sorry! You got me pretty excited, you know.\" she snickers, picking you with her psychic powers.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we both need a bath.\" she declares, floating off the bed, and out of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit hovers into the bathroom and, gently letting you down on the sink, she turns on the water of the bathtub, like you taught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waits for it to be completely full, before using psychic to pick you, while turning off the water.<br>\r\n\"You first, cutie!\" she chimes, dropping you into the warm water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before you can talk, she dips herself as well, before surfacing again, her face looming over your whole being.<br>\r\n\"Isn't this nice, little master?\" she giggles, her paws getting a hold of your body and pulling you in a hug.<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, it is.\" you reply, relaxing at the nice feelings that the warm water gives you, while enjoying the smoothness of the pink headed goddess' fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased by your answer, Mesprit pecks your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bath lasts for about an hour, before Mesprit gets out of the water, places you on the sink again and shakes herself dry, splashing water everywhere.<br>\r\n\"I love taking baths!\" she says cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"I noticed.\" you choke back a laugh as you look into a nearby mirror.<br>\r\n\"I'll need new clothes, though,\" you say, noticing that you're completely clean, but your clothes are damp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. At least, Mesprit could have given you time to remove them.<br>\r\n\"Hey, speaking of, how am I supposed to change myself now?... You're not growing me back, are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotion pokemon just giggles.<br>\r\n\"Why would I? You've been tiny for two hours, and we have a loooot more things to do. So don't expect to grow back to your old size anytime soon, cutie.\" she says, giving a wink.<br>\r\n\"About your clothes...\" she then mumbles, floating out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to return shortly after, a pair of black pants and a white shirt - that your recognize as yours - floating behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can question what she's up to, you notice your clothes glowing azure. And your eyes widen as they shrink down before you. Mesprit gently deposits them next to you.<br>\r\n\"Try them on.\" she says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and slowly undress - Mesprit eyeing you with a grin - before throwing your wet clothes aside and putting the new ones on. They fit just fine.<br>\r\n\"Cute.\" Mesprit comments as she picks you up, and places a kiss on your forehead.<br>\r\n\"That's for our 'little' game~\" she chirps. You flush red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, what do you want to do now?\" you ask as your pokemon hovers back into the living room.<br>\r\n\"Well, how many things a human-pokemon couple can do?\" she asks, gently pecking you as the word 'couple' escapes her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder an answer but, before you can talks, Mesprit comes up with an idea...</span></div></div>",

Mesprit smiles lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she manipulates you so that you're now laying face down on her blue fur, while her tails and paws rest on your back, keeping you perfectly still.<br>\r\n\"Now then, sleep tight little master~\" Mesprit chirps, leaning forward and pressing her lips on your head.<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams.\" the goddess adds while her eyes are hidden by her eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay your head on the giantess' chest, listening to her rhythmic, soothing heartbeat, which is like a sweet lullaby sung by your pokemon's body as if it was trying to help you get asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, you make out the sound of Mesprit's soft snoring, and you deduce that she's fast asleep. You close your eyes as well, praying that this isn't a dream, that you really are shrunken and at the mercy of a giant Mesprit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these happy thoughts, you finally drift off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

She flies on the bed and drops you on it, before landing herself. She sits down in front of you and spreads her short legs.

You let her as your pants quickly come off, leaving you with only your boxer and shirt \"Um, these clothes are annoying me\" Mesprit says, literally shredding them from your body. You are now completely naked, a blush spreads through your face, while Mesprit simply giggles as she lies down on the bed \"Try and make this memorable for me master~\" she says, spreading her legs. Your member goes to its fullest length at the sight of the waiting sex. Mesprit giggled once again, feigning shock \"Oh my! Look at the size of that thing!\" she says playfully as her two tails move to your back and push you closer. Felling a little sheepish, you insert your cock in her and start thrusting. Immediately, Mesprit starts to moan loudly, followed by you \"F-faster! D-deeper!\" Mesprit says between moans. You obey and thrust as deep as your little member can reach. You keep doing this for a good amount of time \"Master! I'm about to... Ahhhh!\" Mesprit shouts as she orgasms, cum flying out of her sex.

Smiling, you pet her star shaped head, making her coo in appreciation. The truth is that the both of you lived together since you were five, and you're now twenty, so it's been fifteen years you live together. Jirachi has always showed her ability to grant wishes by getting you what you wanted when you were a kid, and she now uses her power to get you supplies and whatever you two need to live. You had your wonders of where all the stuff comes from, but Clair always assured you that she gets it out of nowhere, calming your suspects. Luckily, you own your house. It was your grandma's legacy, she specifically left it to you when she died one year ago.

Sleep tight\" she replies. You close your eyes and soon drift to sleep. Clair looks at you and smiles. Time to go ahead with her plans for you.

Weird, this isn't your bed. And your blanket isn't yellow... well, it wasn't last night. You look up. And the sight makes your jaw drop. You see the gigantic face of your sleeping pokemon, and apparently you slept on her chest, right under her now huge neck, her two tails wrapped around you like an actual blanket all night long \"What? Clair!\" you shout. Clair opens her eyes alarmed and looks at you \"Good morning master. Slept well?\"she asks calming down \"Clair, what happened to me?\" you ask \"Well, you always had been nice to me, treating me like a pretty princess. And now, I want to repay you for everything you did to me\" she explains \"I really did nothing all these years. And what makes you think that shrinking me would make me happy?\" you ask, trying to act obvious \"Please, don't try to fool me master, I noticed you reading those stories\" Clair replies.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were making your way back home after a long day of work at your typical 9-5 job. You were just ready to relax for the rest of the day and not have to worry about anything work related. You even had the next 2 days off from work as well. You took out your keys and opened up your door and stepped into house. After closing and locking the door, you set your bag down. You took a few steps forward when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Victini immediately flew right towards your and hugged your neck joyful, seeming to be very,very happy to see you have returned. The soft fur against your body, mixed with her natural warmth of her being a fire typing felt relaxing and warming at the same time. Plus you were a sucker for her fluffy hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Finally! You're back! I have been waiting for you allllllllll day to come back! You know how boring it is without you here. But now you're back, we can finally have some fun! I've learned this new trick today and I've been practicing all day to show you!\"</span> Your Victini gave you some loving nuzzles against your chest while you petted her on the head a few times. Eventually she let go of her hug and moved back to float eye level in front you smiling with glee. You couldn't help but chuckle, seeing your Victini like this was just too cute. Although you were curious about what she meant with that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nice to see you too~ I'm always happy to see you when I come home. Let me get out of my work clothes and into some more normal clothes. Then we can have this fun that you're mentioning, whatever it may be.\" You reply to her with a smile as you make your way to your room, closing your door behind you. Your Victini waited happily on the other side, humming happily to herself. Good thing she was nice enough to respect your privacy while you changed. You tossed your work shirt and pants into the laundry hamper, and got on a normal shirt and pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready, you can come in now!\" You call to her. Right after you said that, the door was open and your Victini flew on in. You sat on the edge of bed, and patted your lap a couple of times. Your Victini got the message and plopped herself down into your lap, smiling up at you as you pet her. Then she excitedly begun speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Okay! So I think I've found out how to make your dreams come true! I am confident that you'll love this! I have practiced for the past 6 hours to perfect it! All I need to do is get your consent for being able to do this!</span>\" She looked up your eagerly, with those adorable eyes of hers. Of course your were a tad cautious of this. You had no idea what she was even planning, her vagueness did not help either. Of course, she was your Pokemon, and you of course trusted her, you know she would not purposely harm you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Sure, you can have your fun, and do whatever you want to show, I trust you. So what are my 'dreams' and how will you make them come true?\" You ask the Fire/Psychic type, trying to get more info on this. You thought of what it could be, a few ideas popping up in your head. A smirk appeared on your Victini's face as she snickered. holding a paw in front of her mouth as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Shrinking you! That's what! Come on, I am part psychic type you know. I can read your thoughts and all that. I know what you're into and what you fantasize about! And since you agreed, there is no backing out now~!</span>\" That bluntness totally put a blush on your face as you listened to what she said. And she was right, you couldn't deny it. You definitely had a thing for wanting to be shrunken down. Opening your mouth to say something, nothing came out of your mouth. You were too blushy and flustered. That just made your Victini giggle with glee as she floated out of your lap and turned to face you. That is when a light blue glowing ball of light began forming between her hand paws. Your eyes fixated on it, watching it grow in size until it was about the size of a baseball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Ready? Since I sure know I am~! Here we go! Down you go!</span>\" That blue ball of light was suddenly flung at you. You tried to quickly get up and off your bed to dodge it. The ball of blue light hit you square in the chest. It didn't hurt at all, but you could definitely feel the magical power in it flowing through your body, it almost tingled. Now standing up, and with your Victini having hit you with this supposed 'shrinking attack', all you could do was wait to see if it did anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Y-You think this is really going to work?\" You ask in a flustered voice. You had no idea if it was or not. However, you had a hunch that it was going to work and soon you would be shrinking down in front of your Victini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">\"Yes of course! And I know that you're going to love every second of it! There is so much that we'll be able to do when you are all cute, and shrunken!</span>\" The mythical Pokemon said to tease you. It seemed like she was confident in this new attack. A tingling sensation went though your body, as if you were zapped by a small bit of static electricity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it started. Everything around you was getting larger. Your bed, your desk, your loving Victini who had planned this, everything. Including your clothes that you had just put on a few minutes ago. They were getting larger. No that wasn't it...You were getting smaller, shrinking down in size. The shrinking was going quite fast, you losing multiple inches a second. You began fiddling with your clothes, trying to get them off before you got buried in them. 5 feet... 4 feet... 3 feet... 2 feet... At the rate you were shrinking though, it was easier to just climb out when you were small enough, which is what you just did. When you were only 1 foot tall, you had manged to climb out of your clothes, which now looked like a hill of clothes behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Victini landed in front of you, now easily larger than you. In less then a minute, the Victini that was once almost 1/5th your size was now taller than you. And you were naked in front of her. Out of embarrassment, you covered up your private parts with your hands, blushing who knows how much. Somehow you had managed to speak, to ask a question to your now taller than you Vicitni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How s-small are y-you even planning to make m-me?\" You stammer to her, as you pass the half foot mark. Who knows how small you would become? You looked up at your Victini who was just smiling down at your now tiny, shrunken form. Luckily she did seem to have an answer for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Awwwwww~! You're so adorable when you're small and tiny! Why didn't I think of doing something like this sooner? I should have shrunk you down months ago! I get to have some fun of my own and you get to have your own fun! Also I'll answer you! Im shrinking you down until you are...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

You've been living with your Cobalion lover, Eisen (German word for \"Iron\") for about 3 years by now, and she's recently discovered your shrinking fetish. The playful doe doesn't really mind, besides, she's always been larger to you. for a 7' tall Cobalion, she's always been your \"Iron Titan\". Eisen's brash, but never intends to hurt you. Your lover actually has a soft spot in her heart for being the master, the one on top, the alpha-female. to her, it's nothing but cute role-play. Now, we begin...<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nIt's about 4:21 AM, and you awaken with possibly the worst headache ever. You remember drinking huge quantities of RC, and making sweet love to Eisen but nothing else. As you groggily try to stand up, you are blasted with horrible smelling air that knocks you right on your ass. Your vision finally returns, and you see her suddenly MASSIVE muzzle just inches away from your body. It was your Cobalion, Eisen, now the size of a fucking giant. she continues her tomboyish snoring, blowing more of her foul-smelling breath at you. You tough it out, and soon tap the Cobie's truck-sized nose a couple times. You notice Eisen's golden eyes opening up, and then she began to give a windstorm of a yawn. this one really knocked you down, almost damaging your vision again. The Cobalion looked over and gave a nice, warm grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning, Clay. Did I leave you in the dryer to long?\" Eisen said sarcastically. \"You actually look kind of cute for an inch-tall man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. Eisen always gave you a tough time, but you still love her all the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night was insane, wasn't it? Well...\" The Cobalion soon grabs you and places you on the nightstand, before getting up and revealing her full, naked form. \"I still got a lot of juice in me from our little 'game', Clayton.\" you blush at the word \"game\". she's talking about one of your role-plays. The most recent was her as a powerful, barbarian queen, and you were a peasant who was enslaved and forced to pleasure her. from her feet to her face, you had to kiss, lick, and rub the Iron Titan. Just the though of it makes you shudder in pleasure. Eisen notices this and shoots a more malevolent grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why don't we continue?\" she asked. \"The small, loving serf pleases the queen, and she shrinks him with magic? Soon... </span></div></div>",
