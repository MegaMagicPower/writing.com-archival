Rouge was watching TV at the time so Sonic aimed the Remote at Rouge and fired.  Sonic began to chuckle as he saw Rouge still staring at the TV, because she looked just like Sonic.  Sonic's old body was now dressed in Rouge's garb, make up and all.  even the hair was like Rouge's.  Sonic's spikes were the same length but now styled in Rouge's usual due.  Sonic's laughter died down, when he looked down and saw Rouge's lovely lady lumps sticking out from his cheast.  Sonic dropped the remote in awe as he saw that he now looked like Rouge in a pair of running shoes and nothing else.  Rouge's hair was even shaped into somthing that resmbled spikes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" Sonic said to himself with Rouge's voice. His name was Sonic the Bat.  He was born with incredible speed.  But with that gift came sacrifice.  His wings do not function like other bats, as they can hardly keep him up.  Instead he uses them for his signature homing attack.  His ears also only pick up sound as good as regular ears as opposed to one's like most bats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge the Hedgehog is a sexy female hegdehog with an incredible abiltiy.  She can expand the spikes on the back into waht would be a sizable wingspan.  She could also hear better than most hedgehogs.  He uses her abilities to server her country as one of the military's best agents.  Sha also had an inceribly large soft spot for jewls, ans uses her spike wing trick to sneak in a steal them as a master cat burgaler.  She also is good with men becuase of her incredible body.  Some joke that Sonic should of been a hedgehog becuase of his near-useless wings and faulty hearing, and that Rouge should have been a bat because of hear incredible hearing and wing like spikes.</span></div></div>",

I don't wear shirts\"  Sonic said under his breath. He looked himself over and found himself in a white and red belly button shirt and maching skirt.  Her usual running sneakers had transformed into boots of the same style with 2 inch high heels at the end.  Her gloves now looked like Rouge's only with yellow cuffs.  Sonic's spikes went down now and he even had bangs.  Sonic fely her new face and make up was detected.  Over all Sonic liked her new body.  Her name was Olivia Marissa Hedgehog, but every one still called her sonic (thankfully).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's attentiong then went to Amy, who as a boy's name was Jamie Tomhas Rose.  But was just refered to as Jamie.  He liked girls, mostly Sonic His shoes were like amy's boots, only in sneaker form, and the gloves were like Sonic's oldones.  But like it current ones, the cuffs were yellow.  some kind of sweet band was on his head and the hair wasn't much different.

Sonic then used the samll and neglected age swap button and Tails changed even more.  He gre talled, his tails got long, and his hips and boobs grew the way they should.  Tails clothes were now a pair of boots similar to his old snaekers, a red and white top, red gloved with white cuffs, and white middle and ring fingers, finally tied together by a red and white bottom that resmbled a bikini bottom, giving any guy that walkes by a nice shot of her thighs.  \"Tailsko\" came out from under the plane, whipped the grease off her gloves, and noticed Sonic.  \"Heyy.

Charmy was 16 (See Knuckles Chaotix) but small for his age but oddly enough, the gender swap made him considderably taller and had long hair.  He had also changed clothes into a bee suit type thing.  Sharmy doesn't have stripes all over him, but the clothes made it look like it.  Sonic then looked through the window of the next room and found Espio practicing his ninja technich.

Mina the Mongoose was a good choice too.  Her clothes are sort of what Sonic\u2019s would look like if he was a girl, making things less awkward.

Rouge was still at the vanity table, only this time she was putting on Amy\u2019s makeup.  Sonic looked down and saw the skin suit clinging to him.  Rouge\u2019s suit had exaggerated some curves that he didn\u2019t really have.  Rouge\u2019s heart shaped breastplate sat attached to Sonic\u2019s flat chest like nothing was different.  Rouge\u2019s elbow length gloves were also on his arms, making them seem more feminine.    Sonic was then a little surprised to see that he was in stand perfectly straight in Rouge's 4 inch heeled boots.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps by somehow swapping with two people at once, his own clothes had simply disappeared. \"Great. What am I supposed to do now?\" Looking through the window again, Shadow was still there. His clothes were pretty similar to Sonic's old ones, and he had been aiming to swap with Shadow in the first place, so perhaps he should offload this copy of Rouge's outfit plus Shadows shoes onto him. Then again, also long as Sonic kept the remote, he could swap again whenever he wanted, so there was really no harm in keeping these clothes for a while, since his regular clothes were no longer available.</span></div></div>",

She was only a little slower than Sonic but had a great voice, mostly in singing.  She liked kareoke but didn't intend on becoming a professional singer any time soon.  Sonyc described her voice as \"Her little gift to New Mobtropolis\", playing small shows at local clubs and benifit concerts.  She probably wanted to simply avoid the bright lights and didn't want ot get caught up in fame.  Oddly enough, she still is famous.  For stopping the various plots and scheme's of the evil Dr. Robotnik.  She uses her incredible speed for good and justice, and still is able to live a (somewhat) normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinos was a yellow mongoose, slightly faster than most other mongoose in red running shoes and gloves.  His name is pronouced like \"Minus\" but with an \"o\" insted of an \"u\".  Like Sonyc, he is a good singer.  The two have done some duets, but Minos managed to get further with his singing because he wants to get famous with it.  The two have vowed to saty friends no matter who gets famous.  Minos has also helped Sonyc with some missions but is considdered a side member of the team.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well It's been nice talking two you Sonyc\"  Minos said as he began to walk of...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
