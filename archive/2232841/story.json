Upon opening the door, the hazy memory returns to you. A late-night, drunken purchase made sometime last week. Granted, it wasn't too expensive or anything, but it's always risky ordering anything past the third page of results on Amazon. You certainly didn't even expect anything to arrive this soon (or at all), even in the near-blackout state you were in when ordering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\", you laugh to yourself, picking up the small, bubblewrap bag. You return to your room, having already disgarded the packaging material. What was left was looked like a standard, storage flashdrive\u2014 no box or any kind of branding to be seen. Better use a virtual OS and scan this for anything sus, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou boot into a virtual system, and 15 minutes later... nothing. It's clean.
