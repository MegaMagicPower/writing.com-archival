Everyone, himself included, was fairly drunk at this point, and the games had been replaced by loud talking and sporadic laughter. David himself was sprawled on the coach, feeling fairly drowsy after his drinks, so his only contributions to the conversation were his occasional chuckles. Sinking more into the couch, which felt far more comfortable now than it ever had in the past, David's vision began to darken as he nodded off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke with a start to what sounded to him like an incredibly loud gasp, groggily wiping his eyes and glaring around for the source of the sound. After blinking a few times, however, his annoyance was immediately replaced with total shock. He gaped at his surroundings as he craned his neck. He had somehow shrunk to just a few inches in height, and was in the middle of a flat green expanse that was his couch cushion. As if that wasn't disconcerting enough, staring down at him with her now gargantuan eyes was none other than Daria, a look of surprise and joy on her face as she covered her mouth to prevent making more sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stumbled back in shock as Daria brought her face right next to him, her alcohol smelling breath enveloping him as she grinned, then said quietly \"is that you David?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo shocked to formulate words for a second, David blinked at her incredible features, before shaking his head to clear it and saying \"yeah, Daria. I don't know what happened, but it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria gave him the same look he had seen her give her cat multiple times, adoration practically radiating from her face. \"Who cares how it happened,\" she giggled. \"You're so damn adorable right now!\" Following these words, she snatched David in her palm, slightly winding him with her sudden hard grip around his torso, before lifting him up above her head and smirking up at him, her face looking a mixture of playful and seductive. \"This will be a fun night.\"</span></div></div>",

Smiling to herself, Daria locked the door behind her, then held David in front of her face, barely able to contain her joy at what had just happened. \"How are you so adorable right now,\" she practically squealed, her alcohol smelling breath washing over him as she held him slightly to close to her gargantuan face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Daria,\" David said, nervously. \"But could you put me down please and maybe call a doctor?\" Daria's excited face immediately shifted to a smirk, her eyes taking on a predatory nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so worried,\" she asked condescendingly. \"I mean, I've been squeezing you hard enough to crush you for about a minute now, and you haven't even flinched.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blanched in surprise. Now that she mentioned it, her hands did feel like they were putting a lot of pressure on him, yet he was in no pain at all. \"Daria,\" he yelled. \"What if you HAD crushed me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria pouted insincerely while saying in a fake offended face \"but I didn't.\" She then smirked up at him again, barely able to contain her drunken mirth. \"But do you know what this means? This means you are tougher than you should be, that you can survive things you normally wouldn't. Don't you see the opportunities we have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at her with complete shock easily visible on his face, so she just sighed and said \"never mind. It'd be better just to show you honestly.\" Daria then searched around the bathroom until she found some floss. She quickly broke some off and used it to tie David's arms and legs so he couldn't move. Shocked, David barely had time to exclaim anything when Daria used a smaller piece around his mouth, muffling any protests he would have made. \"Don't panic,\" Daria said grinning. \"I'm sure you will enjoy this too, maybe even more than me.\" She then hid David in her grip once more, then exited the bathroom and returned to the living room with the rest of the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't noticed David's or her disappearance yet, as they were too busy with their own talk, but Daria had been counting on that and now looked around for her first target. Sitting down on a couch, her eyes met Lauren's, who looked far more drunk than Daria, who smiled then patted the cushion next to her, signalling Lauren to sit down. Lauren stood and started walking to the couch, occasionally stumbling, then turned to sit. As she did so, Daria placed David on the cushion right where Lauren was aiming for, and smirked at the look of shock on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming above him was a very pronounced and round ass being barely contained by black yoga pants. David couldn't help but admire it at his normal size, it was definitely a great ass, but at this scale it was awe inspiring. As if in slow motion, her butt protruded over his head, casting him in shadow. He couldn't even struggle against the floss he was so entranced. Then, as if the spell had been broken, time moved normally again and Lauren's ass plopped down on the couch, completely smashing him into the cushion under her right cheek. As she sat, she leaned back and rested against the back of the couch, her ass remaining stationary on David who found his body conforming to the curve of her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up,\" Lauren asked Daria, beaming at her with slightly flushed cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" said Daria, unable to suppress her smirk. \"Just wanted to sit next to you.\"</span></div></div>",

The rest of the girls looked at her while confused before getting up and walking over to her. Once they were in a semicircle around her, Daria grinned even wider, then said \"I have a surprise for us that will make tonight a bit more fun.\" The others stared back at her, confused as to what would be worth getting them all to stand like this when they were already quite drunk. Daria grinned widely one last time, then moved her hand in front of her and opened it, revealing the miniature David for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was shocked to suddenly be able to see again, but as he looked around that shock became fear. Staring down at him were all of the girls that he had been drinking with just an hour ago, and at this scale both their beauty and their intimidation were magnified. Each one stared down at him as if from miles above, their clearly drunken faces taking the on series of emotions. Shock, confusion, adoration and lust. It was overwhelming experiencing all of this at his scale; and the fact that the most sober one there was Daria made him all the more terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer revealing David was met with silence, followed by excited squeels from all around, forcing David to cover his ears. Daria quickly got the girls quiet, then explained how she found him on the couch. She then smirked down at him, placed him on the table in the middle of the room, then led the girls just far enough away to be out of earshot. They started whispering excitedly amongst themselves, then burst into a fit of giggles as they dispersed and returned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, David,\" Daria said in a gleeful tone, crouching down so her gigantic face was about level with him. \"We decided what we are going to play now that you are like this.\" She smirked back at the other girls following this, then turned her attention back to him and said \"Truth or Dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood open mouthed for a few moments while she continued grinning, then forced himself to collect his thoughts and try to reason with Daria. He explained how he should be taken to the hospital, not playing games, but Daria and the others agreed that his condition wasn't life threatening, and they should enjoy this once in a lifetime chance. Realizing arguing was pointless, David resigned himself to this game, then asked \"So is it just normal Truth or Dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria chuckled, her minty breath washing over him. \"Well, it's a bit different than normal,\" she said. \"We take turns asking you truth or dare, and you answer them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if I don't want to do the dare then,\" David asked, feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria just smiled and said \"Well then we just get to choose what we do anyways. Might as well try and voice your opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded sadly, realizing no matter what happened, he was at their mercy. If he was going to have to do things, might as well choose them himself. Seeing this, Daria grinned even wider, then her and the girls sat in a circle around his table; impatience showing on all of their faces as they waited for the first person to ask.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily smiled dazedly at him, clearly showing how drunk she was, before putting her face right in front of his and asking \"Truth or Dare?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid flinched as her warm breath enveloped him, her gigantic face looming uncomfortably close to him, but decided to ignore this and answer truth. Why pick dare when he knew the girls would use it to their advantage? Emily looked thoughtful for a second, seeming as though she did not anticipate him choosing truth, then smiled once more and asked her question in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think is the best kisser out of all of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was surprised by the question, seeing as how he had never kissed any of these girls, but then took a moment to consider his knowledge of them and their past experiences. Realizing the excitable and experienced Daria was probably the best, he looked at her and nervously said \"I think Daria probably is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily frowned and leaned back dejectedly, apparently she wanted to be acknowledged as the best. David was going to apologize to her when he felt thin fingers wrap around him from behind and lift him. He was turned so that Daria's gigantic face was inches from him, her smile larger than it had been all night. She whispered \"Thanks for the compliment,\" then proceeded to pull David towards her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had time to resist, he was enveloped in a full body kiss by her plush lips, experiencing the soft, suctioning sensation all over his body for what felt like 5 minutes, but was likely a few seconds. Every fear he had seemed to disappear immediately, he was in a state of bliss. Daria pulled away from the kiss with an exaggerated smooching sound, smiled at him again, then proceeded to kiss him repeatedly all over his tiny body. Each kiss made David feel better and better as he realized this wasn't so bad. Then he felt something slip out from between her lips and wrap itself around him. Daria's tongue began rubbing all over him, while slowly pulling him into her mouth. David started to feel scared at this new development, but in just a few seconds his head and torso were though her lips and in the cavern that was her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was moist and slightly sweet smelling, and her tongue kept running along his face and chest. All of a sudden, he felt a strong sucking sensation and his ear drums felt like they popped, as Daria began to suck on his upper body like a lollipop. This continued for a few minutes before David was pulled out with a slurping sound and left sitting in Daria's palm, staring up at her dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked absolutely radiant, and her cheeks were redder than before. She leaned in close, whispered \"Hope that was good for you,\" then licked him one last time. Standing up, she took him to the sink and rinsed him off gently, before drying him with a towel and depositing him back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sat dumbfounded for a few seconds, then voiced his confusion. \"I chose truth though, it wasn't a dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria giggled before saying \"That is true, but we never said we wouldn't do what we wanted based on your answers.\" The rest of the girls smiled hungrily at him, excited for a chance that they get their turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Daria said. \"Since I was chosen, I get to ask next. David, truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed before answering truth again. If something was going to happen to him regardless of his answer, he might as well have a say in it. Daria grinned at him before asking \"Who do you think has the best boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid immediately blushed, realizing what was about to happen based on his answer, as all the girls around him laughed. They seemed to lean forward in an attempt to flaunt theirs, but David already knew his answer before any of this. \"D... Daniella has the best ones,\" he answered softly. Emily and Casey looked upset as they sat back in their seats, but Daniella was laughing heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached over and grabbed David, bringing him to her face level and saying \"They are pretty big, aren't they?\" She tilted her hand so David was looking down at her massive chest, then proceeded to bounce and shift in her seat, making her breast bounce tantalizingly and leaving David with a difficult to conceal response. Thankfully, she wasn't paying enough attention to him to notice, she was too busy pulling the front of her shirt open and lowering him between the massive globes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was immediately enveloped by the softest cushions he had ever felt, their warmth overwhelming him. He couldn't move very well, as their massive size combined with the tightness of her shirt left them wedged together, but he was in bliss sandwiched between them. He looked up, and saw Daniella beaming down at him, her face looking like she was enjoying this even more than him somehow. Noticing his gaze, she winked at him, then proceeded to bounce her breasts like before, buffeting David from all sides with the orbs motions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a combination of relaxed and aroused, David closed his eyes and enjoyed the experience, then felt a new sensation as Daniella squeezed her breasts together with her hands, completely smothering him between them. After a few seconds, she released this hold, then gently plucked him from her chest and placed him back on the table. At this point, all the girls noticed David's obvious excitement, and a fit of giggles ensued, with Daniella blushing deeply the whole time. Finally, after the laughter subsided and David's member became less pronounced, Daniella looked at him then asked her next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all know you are going to choose truth, so I'll just ask it already,\" she said. Smirking a bit, she asked David \"Which of us has the best ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's jaw dropped as he realized his answer would determine which of the gigantic women sits on him. Having always been an ass man, the thought was both chilling and incredibly arousing. Looking around, he realized he had admired all of these girls asses before, but there were three choices that were certain. The girls with the biggest and softest asses, Casey, Emily or Lauren. Casey's was the largest, Emily's the roundest, and Lauren's the perkiest. It was a tough choice, that wasn't helped by the fact that all the girls had stood up and turned around, waving their asses at him to influence his decision. </span></div></div>",

Calling it a bar was misleading, as in reality it was a glorified club with blasting music and trashy dancing all around. As usually happens, the group David was with dispersed with the hopes of finding some girl to dance with, and David headed to the bar to get more drunk than he already was. However, as David was heading to the bar, his head felt strange. He reached for the bar to stabilize himself, then blacked out. He awoke on a hard and slightly sticky surface, loud music penetrating his ears, and he groggily looked around, only to sit up in shock. He was on top of the bar and just 4 inches tall! Before he could have time to process this, he heard a sharp intake of breath, and looked up to find himself staring into the gigantic eyes of a very drunk...</span></div></div>",

Her eyes stared at him as she grinned widely, her thick lips looking especially so at David's new perspective, and when she began to giggle, David felt some fear at his current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\" Mariah said in an excited tone. \"Is that you David?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood motionless for a few seconds while Mariah stared expectantly at him. Then, collecting himself and remembering that Mariah was a trusted friend of his and would not hurt him, David nodded before saying loudly, in order to be heard over the music, \"Y-yeah! It's me! I don't know what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah giggled in what would have been an adorable manner if she wasn't towering over him, her already tall appearance making her seem to tower even more than the people drunkenly chatting on either side of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so adorable,\" she cooed, bringing her face closer to him to get a good look, her warm, alcohol smelling breath washing over him, leaving him a strange combination of afraid and aroused. He gaped at her mouth, realizing he could fit inside it with relative ease and quickly suppressed thoughts of the types of things she could do with her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that, Mariah,\" David stammered, \"but I am really scared right now, and I really should get out of here as soon as I can! Will you please help me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah scrunched up her face in thought as she tried to drunkenly piece together all that was happening. She looked around her as if to verify something, then said \"But David, this club is much better than usual tonight. Why go home so early without enjoying it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid made as if to protest, but Mariah looked satisfied with her own logic, nodded as if to reaffirm herself, then leaned in so her face was inches from his body. \"Besides,\" she said, her tone getting seductive, \"dancing with you like this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she leaned in and engulfed his upper body in a slightly wet kiss, enveloping David in a feeling of warmth and softness that could not compare to anything else he had experienced. She held the kiss for a few seconds, leaving him in absolute bliss. When she pulled away, he was left stunned staring at her for a second, and as such was caught off guard when her hand, which had snaked behind him during the kiss, wrapped him in her long fingers and lifted him to her eye level as she stood to her full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked at his tiny form, then said in a sultry voice \"now how are we to dance together?\" While saying this, David noticed far below him Mariah was slowly shifting her hips back and forth. When he looked back up at her and saw her grin in response, he knew this had been a deliberate motion on her part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, Mariah,\" David stammered, suddenly realizing what she might be thinking. But too late, Mariah smirked even more at him, looking both amused and turned on, then pressed David against her breasts, which did not feel small anymore at this scale, before sliding him slowly down her chest, across her stomach and behind her, until he was staring down at her protruding ass. David felt both terrified and incredibly aroused as Mariah pulled the back of her tights back, showing her shapely rear in its full glory, then dropped him in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His back pack was balanced uncomfortably on his lap, yet despite the discomfort he found he was having trouble staying awake. Setting an alert on his phone to go off when he was approaching his stop, David succumbed to his exhaustion and shut his eyes, lulled to sleep by the motion of the bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid awoke to his phone vibrating in his pocket. Groggily, he reached for it and pressed the lock button, putting the alarm on snooze. Then, slowly, he opened his eyes, wiped the sleep out of them, then stared in a mixture of shock and disbelief. The first thing he noticed was the fact that he was somehow laying down on a soft surface, despite the chair he had been in having barely enough room for his legs to fit. Then, as he gazed around, he saw the very same chair magnified to a ludicrous scale looming over him. He had shrunk while he was asleep. Looking around, he realized he was on the seat of the chair he had been sprawled in, his back pack was nowhere to be seen, but he was still clothed and had his phone. Thinking quickly, David pulled out his phone and went to his contacts to call someone for help. He chose to call Mariah, thinking she would be the quickest to reach him. However, as he hit dial, he felt tremors and saw someone very large approaching his row. To his surprise, it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David looked up as he heard a loud ringing sound, then was pleasantly surprised to see it was none other than Mariah coming on to the bus. He held the phone to his ear anxiously, saw Mariah reach for her purse and pull out the phone while heading his way. She answered and pressed the phone to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she said, inquiringly. David prepared to say something back, then noticed with horror that she was turning into his row of seats. He looked up and saw her now gigantic, toned ass towering over him, being hugged very tightly by her yoga pants. She began to sit, her ass becoming even more pronounced as she stretched her pants tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid yelled into the phone \"don't sit down!\" He heard his voice magnified through her phones speaker, then swore as he saw her jump in shock, then fall onto her ass due to her imbalance. He was flattened into the seat by a very firm and shapely cheek, yet somehow David was unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering at this turn of events, he was interrupted when he heard a voice all around him as well as from his phone say \"what was that about David? You really surprised me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to slide his arm holding his phone to his face so that he could talk, but Mariah's ass was unyielding as it pressed him into the seat. \"Stand... Up!\" David half groaned, half shouted. Apparently it had been loud enough for Mariah to hear though, as he felt the immense weight upon him start to relent. He was blinded by sudden light as Mariah stood up, looking confusedly around her. Thinking quickly, David said \"Down... Chair...\" into his phone, while trying to fill his lungs with the air they were deprived of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah turned her head and looked down at the chair where David was, then gasped in shock. She reached down and plucked David from the seat, looking at him with eyes full of confusion and concern. \"David,\" she asked, \"is that you?! How did you get so small?! Was I sitting on you?!\" She asked these questions in a torrent, giving David no time to respond, so he gestured for her to lean close to listen to him, her gigantic face filling all his view, then explained that he did not know what happened to him, that yes, she had sat on him, but no, he was unharmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah looked relieved to hear he wasn't hurt, then suddenly her face took on a strange expression as her eyes glanced over him. David wondered what had happened, then looked down and realized that he had a very obvious erection, apparently caused by his proximity to her ass. He blushed and tried to hide it, but Mariah smirked at him and bit her bottom lip. \"So I take it, since you weren't hurt by my sitting on you, you must have really enjoyed my <u>gigantic</u> ass,\" Mariah said, rubbing her hand along her butt to accompany this statement. \"Well, until we find out what's happened to you, I assume you'll need someone to take care of you, and I'd be more than happy to help.\" She grinned at him, still biting her bottom lip. \"Can't risk you being seen by strangers though, at your size someone could easily steal you, so I need to keep you somewhere safe and close to me, so I can keep track of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah licked her full lips sensually as she said this, reaching her hand holding you behind her. \"But where could I keep you,\" she asked, patting you against her ass cheek with every word. Suddenly, as if she had just had a brilliant idea, Mariah gasped and said \"How about this?\" With that, she placed him on her chair in the bus, positioned her gigantic ass over him and smiled over her shoulder down at him, positioning her rear so that he was roughly centered relative to it. She then softly sat her ass down upon him, engulfing him in her firm cheeks as she shifted left and right, causing him to slide between the cheeks and be firmly grasped on both sides by ass. Mariah grinned widely as she bounced in her seat a few times, feeling complete pleasure at having you at her disposal. \"This will be a fun bus ride,\" she said to herself, feeling you squirm between her cheeks and clenching them in response, engulfing you in their firm grasp.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Casey, looking slightly sweaty and very tired, was walking towards him with booming steps, and David quickly hung up his phone while it was still dialing Mariah. Even with her unkempt appearance, Casey still looked stunningly beautiful, and David gaped awestruck at her monumental form looming ever more over him. She looked very out of it as she got closer, her eyes showing a combination of exhaustion and boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a red t-shirt and yoga pants, so it was clear she had changed out of the clothes she had practiced in, and David couldn't help but imagine the scale of her already larger than life figure at his new size. However, he didn't have to imagine it turns out. As David scrolled through his phone to try and call Casey, he was not paying attention to his surroundings until he felt the booms move in front of him. Shaken from his task, he looked up only to see two towers clad in black looming over him. As he watched, the towers moved to a different position, and David looked up to be greeted by a tremendous sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey's ass had always been an object of admiration for him. Not only was it incredibly large, but thanks to her athletic lifestyle and likely some good genes, it also had a perfectly rounded shape, which became more pronounced when she shook it at the clubs. Now, however, David found himself utterly dwarfed by it as he stared upwards. It stuck out prominently from the rest of her above him, casting him in its shadow, and he couldn't help but appreciate the way her yoga pants hugged it so well. It was as if two gigantic, black clad orbs loomed motionless above him, but they did not remain motionless for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey wanted nothing more than to get home, shower and eat. Her practice had been as tiring as usual, and due to the amount of credit hours she needed to take each semester for her scholarship, she was also academically overwhelmed at the moment. Feeling gross from the slight sweat on her and annoyed that she had to take a 20 minute bus ride before she got home, Casey had no patience at the moment. As soon as she spotted an open chair, she stepped in front of it, sighed, then unceremoniously plopped down, feeling the chair tremble in response to her ass. She smirked, at least she had somethings going for her, she thought as she shifted her ass to get more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was admiring her form in awe when he heard a loud sigh emanate from far above him, then felt a tremendous force as her gargantuan ass came crashing down on him, her right cheek forcing him down into the chair and engulfing most of his form. David was shocked by this sudden impact, and as such took a moment to register the fact that aside from the pressure he felt bearing down on him, he was completely unharmed. Another thing he noticed was that after its initial impact, Casey's ass felt much softer than he thought it would, it was as if someone was pressing a gigantic pillow onto him. Feeling relieved that he was mostly unharmed, David then remembered exactly who he was under and started to feel arousal as he had never felt before, as his member tried to rise it was pushed unrelentingly down by her mind mindbogglingly large ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying himself more than he thought he would, David was shocked out of his stupor by the giant cheek pressing down upon him suddenly pressing into him more and sliding down the pillow. He was dragged along, sandwiched between a bus pillow and a heavenly ass. As the sliding finished, he felt the ass lift slightly then shift back where it came from, and before he could react, he found himself trapped between the two monumental cheeks, which spread as Casey sat and trapped him in their midst. If his old position had been heavenly, his new one was unbelievably incredible, as he was practically hugged between the two cheeks which wobbled slightly given their owners movements. She shifted a few more times, but David found himself snugly between her cheeks and so moved with her, experiencing the sensation of being caressed between the two with every movement they made. He felt content, ready for a long bus ride in utter bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You always dreaded this lecture, and not due to the subject matter. It was the only college lecture you'd heard of with assigned seating, and your seat happened to be right next to your ex girlfriends best friend. You and Leah dated for a few months, and were quite happy until you split up after being apart during the summer, and the break up was not pleasant for either side. Leah is short and slim, yet somehow also has D-cup breasts and a round rear that puts many to shame. She has wavy brown hair and a gentle looking face, but is more than willing to be not so gentle when the situation calls for it. You had not spoken with her since the break up, but seeing her best friend every day is a sad reminder of what was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki is Leah's best friend, a skinny Indian woman with long black hair, cute features and small but well defined curves. You and her got along very well while you and Leah were dating, however she started to act cold towards you following the breakup, since she felt you were responsible for it. Having to sit next to her three days a week was incredibly awkward, as every time you have tried to talk to her, she acts as though you don't exist. Now, having given up on putting up with her silence anymore, you got to class early and avoided any eye contact throughout the duration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still a few minutes before lecture started, and Tiki had yet to arrive, so you sat looking at your phone, when all of a sudden you were overcome by a wave of dizziness. When it passed, you found yourself standing at a mere 4 inches tall in the center of your seat, completely overwhelmed by the vastness of your surroundings. Thankfully, you were fully clothed, however, this made your size change all the more peculiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could consider this more, large tremors started occurring close to you, shaking your chair and knocking you onto your ass. You look in the direction they are coming from, and stare in fear as a gigantic Tiki, wearing a plain tank top and skinny jeans, is walking towards her seat, looming above you like a mountain. Overcome with fear, you freeze in place, then start to tremble as her eyes meet yours, looking surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki would always give you a mean look when she arrived in this class, however she did not see you in your seat today, which was strange. She did, however, see your backpack in front of the chair, and a small shape on the seat itself, so she assumed you went to the bathroom. But when the shape moved slightly, she decided to get a closer look, and was surprised to find where you actually had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tiki leaned her face in close over you to get a better look, you could feel her breath washing over you like a gale, while her eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed as she adopted a cruel smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well,\" she whispered, her voice overwhelming to your small form. \"Seems like karma is a real bitch, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trembled in fear as her gigantic hand suddenly wrapped around you and lifted you to her face, her mouth, large enough to swallow you, loomed in front of you as she spoke. \"As much as I would love to take advantage of this situation, I can think of someone else who deserves to more,\" she whispered to you, smirking even more. \"Then again, I gotta keep you somewhere until we get to her, so I'm sure she won't mind. After all, she did tell me about your little... fetish.\" You felt a chill wash over your body as she said this. Very few people knew about your giantess fetish, and less so still knew you had a particular interest in butt related content. You had told Leah before, as you shared your kinks with each other, but having Tiki know made you realize how severe this situation had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStammering in an attempt to protest, Tiki smirked at you, before walking to her chair, placing you face up on it, then shifting her tightly denim clad ass over you, covering you in its shadow. She smirked over her shoulder at you, before slamming her ass on top of you, smashing you into the chair. Her denim scratched at your skin as she ground her ass around, smearing you between her firm cheeks and the hard wooden surface. Finally stopping her movements, Tiki could barely contain her laughter as she felt you squirm beneath her cheek. She was excited for what Leah had in store for you next. </span></div></div>",

Sprawled out on his couch drinking tea and catching up on some Netflix series, he felt completely relaxed. For him at that very moment, the world consisted of just him and whatever show was on. However, he started to feel sleepy as this lounging continued, and felt himself begin to nod off, so he paused the show. He lay back on the couch and drifted off, then awoke suddenly to a strange sensation spreading across his whole body. He sat up with a start, and was shocked to see that everything around him had greatly increased in scale. Looking around the massive expanse that was his couch, he quickly realized he had somehow shrunken to 4 inches in height.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The front door opened and a voice called out \"David? Ready to watch a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt a wave of panic overtake him as he remembered Alayna was supposed to come watch a movie with him, since they were both bored and home alone. Realizing his compromising position on the couch, he began to sprint to the side of the seat farthest from the TV in the hope that Alayna would not sit there. Panting, he came to a stop, then heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps approaching. Looking up, he saw Alayna glancing curiously around her as she entered the living room, wearing grey tights and a baggy hoodie. She noticed the TV was on, then seemed to come to the conclusion that he would be coming back shortly, because she started to make her way towards the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it seemed like she would sit where David had predicted, as she angled herself towards the seat with the remote next to it, but then Alayna seemed to notice something, and suddenly charged her course. Caught off guard, David could only stare in shock as her round ass, practically chewing on her pants, loomed over him then crashed down, smashing him into the cushion under her soft yet heavy rear. Shocked that he wasn't in any pain, he tried crying out, yet before he could form the words, the gigantic ass shifted suddenly as Alayna reached for something near the seat, the cheek he was under rolled his body until he was position in the pronounced gap between her cheeks caused by her form hugging pants. Feeling a relief from the pressure for the moment, David took a deep breath, then was sandwiched between her cheeks as she moved back to her initial sitting position, her ass compressing around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlayna had moved where she was going to sit because she noticed David's laptop was open next to the couch. Always looking for more to tease David about, she smirked as she plopped onto the cushion then reached for the laptop. Settling into a comfortable position, she opened his browser, then started to look through his history in hopes of finding some ammunition to use against him. Seeing a word she hadn't seen before, \"Giantess\", Alayna clicked the first link she saw, and was joyfully surprised at what she saw. It was a website called Deviantart, and the images being shown were those of giant women sitting on small men, or some variation of this theme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at the bombshell she just discovered, Alayna started looking through the images. <i>It kinda makes sense that he goes for this stuff,</i> she thought to herself. <i>All of a girls attractive features become magnified at such a scale. I wonder how it would feel to be the girl in this situation though. I mean, it would probably be fun for at least a little while, feeling someone completely at the mercy of my ass.</i> Alayna started to smile more as she began picturing a small man completely at the mercy of her ass. She was normally self conscious, but her ass was a point of pride for her. All her exercise and clothing went into accentuating it, and having a man not only at the mercy of her favorite feature, but also enjoying himself was actually pretty exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alayna realized she had been looking at the computer for at least a few minutes, and she quickly closed the window and put the laptop back, then sat waiting for David. Meanwhile, he was in a state of both bliss and nervousness. Completely enveloped by her soft cheeks, he was both comfortable and turned on. Yet at the same time, he knew that he needed to get her to notice him or else he could be trapped until he starves. Wondering what to do, he was surprised by his phone, which had apparently shrunk with him, vibrating in his pocket. Unknown to him, Alayna had gotten impatient and sent him a text asking where he was. The vibration of his phone also did not go unnoticed by her as she felt a tickle in between her cheeks, so she reached back and scratched, only to find her finger discovering a strange shape between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlayna's gigantic finger probed David's form for a little while, then pinched his leg and dragged him from his confines. David found himself dangling upside down staring at Alayna's gigantic face, her confused look quickly turning into shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?!\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">David is a 20 year old college student who shrinks to 4 inches around women of your choice. Due to fetish logic, he is extremely durable, however, he is not pliable like in other similar stories. There are two main settings for this story, College and Home, home being the city he is from initially where he can run into childhood friends. This story will mainly focus on butt interactions, so if you do not like that, I would recommend not reading. Other than that, please enjoy my first attempt at an interactive story and let me know what you think.<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\nThe settings of these characters are not finalized, for example a character from home could be written to visit college, these are just for general expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily- At 20 years old, Emily is a stunning blonde who is fully aware of her own looks. While not obnoxiously confident, she can often times treat others poorly inadvertently due to her not being able to empathize well. Aside from this, she is kind at heart and tends to act goofy around her friends. You and her almost dated years ago, but ended up sticking to being friends. She is average height, with above average and perky breasts as well as a shapely and decently sized rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren- You met Lauren your first day of college and have been good friends ever since. She has long black hair and a beautiful complexion that tempts most men. She can be vulgar and weird around you, since you are so close, but she is also a good friend. She has average sized breasts and a very round rear, and strangely finds small versions of things absolutely adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah- Mariah was your first college crush. Taller than average, but still an inch shorter than you're 5'10 height, she has long and wavy brown hair. Her body is fit without being overly muscular, she has a six pack and a very well toned and wide ass, yet her chest is below average in size. She parties hard and tends to lose her cool exterior when she's drunk, revealing a overly touchy and giggly side very different from her sober self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey- A student athlete with an incredible body and amazing looks, Casey should be a stuck up snob, yet somehow she is a loud and hysterical friend of yours with practically no ego to speak of. Her blonde hair frames her beautiful face, but her ridiculous body steals most of the show. Her chest is well endowed and perky, and her ass is the biggest you have seen that somehow manages to retain a very nice shape. She drinks whenever she isn't practicing field hockey or studying, and admits to others that she is \"ratchet\" with her butt being utilized very often in her dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniella- You have known Daniella since you were kids, as your parents are very close. She was possibly the first crush you ever had, her round face conveying a beauty quite different from most others, with very cute features. She has long dark brown hair which she keeps straight, and very large breasts, though her sizable butt is not as shapely as it used to be. When you two hang out, you either get along very well or get on each others nerves, you never know which it will be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlayna- You have known Alayna since you were both toddlers. Her mother and your mother are best friends to this day, and she has always lived two houses down from yours. You always get along when you hang out, and act more like siblings than friends at times. She has long brown hair and a pretty face, but she dresses in such a way as to hide her surprisingly very attractive body, with perky breasts and an ass that reflects her time training in kick boxing, very well toned and sizable. You have always been physically comfortable around each other, and she jokingly flaunts her assets a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria- You met Daria in high school, and though she is a bit younger than you, you get along very well. She is a short and slender girl with long straight brown hair and a pretty face with sharp features. You would always joke with her about her small breasts, and she would get playfully annoyed, but her butt is incredibly perky and round. To say she is \"experienced\" would be an understatement, and though you like her too much to say this to her, she is a bit of a slut. She is fully comfortable with her sexuality and can objectify men at times, yet she is also incredibly caring, especially about her friends. That doesn't mean she doesn't tease you whenever she can though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
