            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Space. The final frontier. Humanity had finally started expanding beyond the confines of Earth. With the home world peacefully unified under the United Nations of Earth, scientific missions slowly turned into permanent colonies in the solar system. Now, in addition to the UNE, the Republic of Mars, Ceres Consortium, and Confederacy of Jovian Moons all work to expanding our reach to the stars. But interstellar travel seemed hopelessly beyond our grasp, our fastest ships confined to a fraction of light speed. At least until they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey called themselves the Erimosi. They were humanoid, and to our eyes looked like tall, statuesque men and women with jet black skin and snow white hair. Otherwise they could pass for a human. We were lucky that the first advanced alien race we met was also so peaceful and benevolent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were happy to share the secrets of warp drive with us, and to start telling us about the galaxy. In exchange, they only wanted to learn as much as they could about humanity, something that interested them endlessly. For instance, they were amused to learn about our male dominated past, and our 50/50 gender ratios. Apparently this was an oddity, and most sentient races were 90/10 female to male, something the Erimosi considered ideal for perpetuating the species. They also speculated that so many males was a cause for our violent and warlike past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that the Erimosi weren't telling us everything. They admitted as much. We were told that many of the humanoid galactic races had 'strange customs,' to which humanity would be particularly 'vulnerable.' They wouldn't say more about this, simply saying we would have to understand this first hand. The Erimosi told us they had decided, with much restraint, that they would not engage in these 'customs' with us. At least not until they thought we were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with their help, humanity started building scoutships and training scouts to begin exploring the galaxy on our own. They were to be small one-man craft, built to travel long distances quickly. There were to be no weapons, unless you counted overloading the communication laser as a 'weapon.' The ship would be provided with some information from the Erimosi, as well as an artificial intelligence to operate as the ship's computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where you come in. You've graduated at the top of the first class of scouts. You've trained in simulations on how to operate the ship, as well as first contact protocols. The first scoutship prototype as just rolled off the assembly line: The SP-001 <i>Swift Feather.</i> The second won't be completed for months, giving you first pick as to where to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your new space suit and head to the hanger. The suit covers you completely from your neck down to your fingers and toes. It's a surprisingly thin, skin-tight fabric provided by the Erimosi. It's able to protect your body against extreme heat and cold, radiation, and hostile atmospheres; all while preserving mobility and the sense of touch. It's an amazing material, years ahead of anything that can be made on Earth. A small device has been inserted in your ears to act as a universal translator, as well as act as a short-range communication device with your shipboard AI. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Pilot!\" A young, feminine voice exclaims in your ear. \"I'm the artificial intelligence for the <i>Swift Feather</i>! Ar-in version 12.7.2 to be exact, but you can just call me 'Erin.' It's a lot more personal that way.\" You didn't expect the new AI to be so\u2026 bubbly. Yet another invention that's light years ahead of humanity. No human computer program is remotely capable of emoting anywhere near the level you just heard. You just hope the AI is also an equally competent navigator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\u2026 Erin. I'm your pilot.\" you say to Erin as you approach your ship, getting used to referring to your computer by name. The <i>Swift Feather</i> is a marvel, a sleek bullet shaped craft made mostly of engine, with anti-matter conventional thrusters as well as the massive warp drive capable of jumping dozens of light years in a single bound. You run your gloved hand along the white metallic surface, the suit conveying the touch as well as if it were with bare fingertips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Erin interrupts you, \"you want to feel me up for a while, or do you want to hop in and get started?\" The chastisement from the AI oddly embarrassed you, and you stop inspecting the hull and enter the ship itself. The cabin is small: there's a bunk along one wall, a food dispenser along the other, and then the cockpit area. But it's a small price to pay for the benefit of being able to blast off into the unknown reaches of a galaxy filled with alien races and exotic planets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down in the cockpit, leaning back in the comfortable pilot seat which seems to mold to your form. You look over the panoply of controls and displays in front of you, and realize you're not entirely sure where to begin. \"Now, where to go first?\" You wonder aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are plenty of options!\" Erin pipes up cheerfully. \"You could make a first contact with an alien race. The Erimosi have put a number of nearby humanoid species into my memory banks, so I can give you a brief description of the best targets to start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could also scout a potential colony world in  another solar system for you humans.\" Erin continues. \"There are a number of candidates, and a survey of the colony world will be crucial to the planning efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could also travel into unmapped space. As you know, the galaxy is a very large place. Even the Erimosi have not traveled to most of it. However, I'm programmed to warn you against this action. The Erimosi cannot predict what might happen in unmapped space. It could be dangerous, and potentially harmful to your person. Not to mention your lovable ship AI.\" Erin adds, prompting you to roll your eyes at the computer's personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, if you are still unsure what course of action to take, you could consult the Erimosi for advice. I am certain they will happily receive you at their embassy on Phobos, Mars's larger moon.\" You sit in your chair and ponder your expansive options. So much to do, and the choice is yours. Where to start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide that making first contact would be the best way to go. Right now, the only alien race humans know about are the Erimosi. It'd be good to know the neighbors, and have a better understanding of who's nearby. Besides, it'd be pretty cool to meet new alien races. \"Erin, give me the list of best aliens to make first contact with.\" You tell your ship AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" It/she replies happily. \"I'll give you an overview of the top four candidates, identified by the Erimosi as best for humans to encounter. The Erimosi gave priority to proximity to Sol system and humanoid appearance. These major priorities were weighted at a ratio of 7:2 against the minor categories of\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" you stop Erin before she goes into excessive detail. \"I'll trust that it\u2019s a good list. We're all very grateful to the Erimosi for all their help and guidance, and they haven't steered us wrong yet. Just tell me about these top four aliens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do, captain!\" Erin complies easily. The outlines of four humanoid figures appear on your screen. Mostly humanoid, at least. The first two appear normal, although the outlines appear fuzzy. On further inspection, you notice the second outline has pointed ears at the top of its head, reminiscent of a cat or a dog. The third being is human above the waist, but appears to have a snake-like lower half. And the last one appears to have four arms. All things considered, that's about as close to human as you think you're going to get. Not that you'd know any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the Ufu, Yathi, Kichi, and Giglin.\" Erin tells you, as each silhouette  is highlighted in its turn. \"Which one do you want to know more about?\" Your eyes narrow. A physical outline isn't exactly much to go on, but at least she's giving you the choice of where to start. But which to choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Tell me more about the Ufu.\" you tell Erin. The first silhouette promptly expands to take up the entire screen on your command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can give you a picture of one of them.\" Erin brings up an image of an Ufu on your main viewer. It's a female approximately five feet tall, with crimson eyes and snow white skin along with a covering of what appear to be white feathers. Long white feathers cover her head in an approximation of shoulder length human hair. Shorter, medium length feathers appear to cover the arms, legs, and back of the creature. Very short feathers of a soft, downy appearance cover her front, starting at her neck and continuing down her breasts, flat toned stomach, and inner thighs. You notice that you can make out a narrow indentation in the feathers for her navel, and observe that were she human, she'd be in good shape and rather attractive. Black clothing that looks like underwear or a bikini cover her. You can't tell if this is normal clothing for her race, or if this is merely for the purposes of presenting a more complete physical image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an Ufi. One Ufi, multiple Ufu, got it? The Ufu are considered to be a very friendly and affectionate race,\" Erin tells you, \"making them ideal for human contact. Their culture is based on the mutual giving of gifts and services. I should note that the Ufu consider it quite rude to refuse their generosity. Otherwise they are very amicable. The Ufu have heavily colonized a number of worlds, and are a major race in the region. Because of their disposition, location, and political influence, the Erimosi recommend you contact this race first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you continue to look at the image. Despite the obviously alien features, the woman shown is quite beautiful. Friendly, affectionate, beautiful, and close by? That does sound like a perfect recipe for a friendship with Earth. And if they all look like her, you wouldn't mind getting to know them personally. \"That's good enough for me.\" You say to your computer. \"What are the recommendations for first contact?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice, captain! There are three equally valid procedures for you!\" Erin responds happily. You can't tell if the way she responds is her 'natural' enthusiasm, or if there's a hint of humoring you in her voice. Either way, she continues. \"First, there's always the straightforward approach. We can warp to the Ufu home system, and hail them on universal frequencies. In all likelihood, they'll direct you a landing zone, where you can introduce yourself! I'm sure they'll be very interested in learning about a new sentient race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That approach does make sense.\" you agree. \"Their homeworld is probably where their ambassadors are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention their xenobiologists.\" Erin says. \"They will probably want to make a physical examination of you at some point.\" Getting a physical from an alien gives you a bit of pause, but you do see the point. It's probably important for any alien to learn what you can eat, what harms humans, and of course general scientific curiosity. While it might be an annoyance, it is your duty when you took this job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another option would be to contact a remote outpost.\" Erin chirps. \"By contacting a small group of scientists, you will have the advantage of interacting with a group interested in learning about alien things, but also the intimacy of a small number of them. After you've sufficiently introduced yourself, those scientists can act as a liaison between you and the rest of the Ufu. We already have the location of an Ufu outpost that would be suitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the final option would be to make contact in interstellar space. Neutral ground is a bit less intrusive, and puts both parties on equal footing. It also allows them to willingly come to you! We can sit and direct a contact request directly at Ufu space until they arrive. Since the Ufu are friendly, they'll probably show up in a matter of minutes!\" Erin tells you, running down the three options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to agree, all those approaches make sense in their own way. Going to their homeworld is logical, but you'd be outnumbered by over a billion to one. That could be a little overwhelming. Visiting the outpost would be more manageable, but if the scientists don't want to be distracted from whatever work they're doing, you might not be welcome. Finally, making a space contact solves both those problems, but there's the risk the Ufu might not want to come. It also means you'd be cooped up inside starships for even longer. Mulling your options, you decide the best course of action would be to:</span></div></div>",

While it's for your benefit, Erin is operating the ship faster than you can keep up with. Your happy to have an AI like her to keep the ship running quickly and efficiently. It'd take you much longer to look up the coordinates, then calculate and execute the jump properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens, faster than light travel! It happens in an instant, your vision blurring with the uneasiness that comes from being in warp space. When your sight clears, the stars have changed, and a large blue-green orb not unlike Earth fills a quarter of the view screen. There's a little less ocean than Earth, and from the look of the lights on the night-side of the planet, many more cities. You wonder how many Ufu populate their homeworld. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up what data you have on Uf Prime: the planet is about 70% the size of earth, and about as much gravity. You'll be a little lighter down there, and have a little more spring in your step, which you hope doesn't result in you falling on your face. The planet is about half ocean, half land, with extensive forest cover outside of the cities. The population of Uf Prime is over 20 billion! Clearly, the Ufu don't mind crowds. You decide to look over the details some other time, as you've got more important matters to attend to. A blinking light indicates your being hailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unknown alien vessel, this is Uf Prime Traffic Control.\" A girlish but professional sounding voice sounds in your speakers. \"Please identify yourself and your destination.\" Your screen fills with a visual of the woman's feathered head. The plumage is a robin's egg blue, her face a snowy white. Her eyes have the same albino-red look that the image in your databank showed. She isn't wearing any clothing on her head, but you can't see her from the neck down to get a sense of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" you reply. \"I am a human from the planet Earth, and this is my vessel Swift Feather. My mission is to introduce myself on behalf of my species to our galactic neighbors. We come in peace!\" You feel like you said that rather well, and mentally congratulate yourself on the important first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? A first contact?!\" The Ufi's eyes widen in what looks like surprise. \"Uh\u2026 h-hello! We welcome you to Uf Prime! We haven't had a first contact in over ten years!\" She says, and as she talks Erin quietly shows you a conversation to about 16 Earth years. \"The Prime Minister and Minister of Science will both want to speak with you. I'm transmitting landing coordinates to you now. You've been given priority clearance to land in the Capital.\" While you can tell she's talking in a profoundly alien language, your translator mutes the incomprehensible sounds and reproduces them in your ear in English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Traffic Control. I would be honored to meet with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Science,\" you tell her graciously, signing off. The coordinates are put into your computer, and Erin effortlessly pilots you down through the atmosphere, giving you a few moments to think. You're getting to meet the leader of the whole planet, maybe their entire species! Erin told you the Ufu have heavily colonized a number of nearby worlds. If they're anywhere near as populated as this one, that makes this Prime Minister a very important person. And the other sent to meet you is the science advisor. This gives you a sense of their priorities. You wonder what sort of questions the science minister will have for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship lands quickly, descending gently onto an overly large landing pad. It appears to be specially for the Capitol building, as right in front of you is a large building that looks important, with domed spires that remind you of minarets on Earth. A quick glance at your instruments shows you the air here is perfectly breathable, even with a little extra oxygen than you're used to. Not bothering with a helmet, you step outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out onto the platform, you see a crowd starting to gather, dozens of Ufu milling around some distance away, with more showing up every moment. It was a sea of varied pastels, with feathers of pink, gold, tan, and blue covering their bodies. Many had those blood-red eyes, but others were of brilliant blue, and some seemed to be a pale gold. All of them were short, at least by human standards, and seemed to be overwhelmingly female. You could easily tell this based on their clothing, or rather, lack of clothing. Glossy black garments like the one you saw on your ship was apparently standard attire, although some seemed to pick other colors. Clearly, Ufu didn't care much for modesty, not that you minded at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping past the throng were two figures. One was a step forward than the other, and you guessed this was the Prime Minister. Her feathers were a pastel pink, her eyes bright red. She wore the same skimpy black bikini, but with some kind of lapel pinned to her left breast. Behind her, with pure white plumage and blue eyes, was the Science Minister. Both looked at you with a pleasant and curious expression. You returned their gaze, trying not to ogle their exposed bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prime Minister stopped, and began to speak. \"Greetings, Uman,\" she said, and you decided now wasn't the time to correct her pronunciation. \"I am Prime Minister Iyafya, leader of the Ufu people. This is my Minister of Science, Yedah.\" She gestured to the white-feathered woman beside her, who bowed slightly, a gesture you returned. \"On behalf of my people, I welcome you to our homeworld, and hope that our races can interact with friendship and laughter.\" Hmm, that phrasing was a bit odd, but then again, they were aliens. You bow again, and begin to speak, but before you do...</span></div></div>",

Something about getting along peacefully between two alien races, learning from each other, and becoming friends. All the standard diplomatic stuff you\u2019ve trained for, memorizing all those carefully crafted speeches you memorized at the academy. This was all pretty much going exactly as you had planned.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut then the crowd started to move. There must be hundreds of Ufi crowding around you, a sea of curious faces looking at you. It feels a little strange to be the object of attention to so many people, but you are a strange alien they\u2019ve never seen before. But\u2026 the crowd was definitely getting closer now. As if unable to restrain themselves any longer, some of the more ambitious Ufi were walking up to you. They started to speak to you, although they were doing it all at  once.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, Uman!\u201d said a cheerful pink-feathered female Ufu. \u201cI am Tatyal of\u2026.\u201d \u201cUman! My name is Zyosha\u2026\u201d you heard another say, this one with pale yellow feathers. \u201cUman!\u201d \u201cGreetings!\u201d \u201cWelcome!\u201dYou heard more and more try to introduce themselves to you, making you feel like a celebrity in a throng of fans. The Ufi were now right next to you, trying to get your attention.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHello, everyone! Please, one at a time!\u201d You try to say loudly and slowly to the crowd. \u201cI can\u2019t  understand if-aha!\u201d You gasp and jump a little in surprise. An Ufu to your right was trying to get your attention, and reached out a feathered hand to brush against your right side. And that feather touch really tickled! The suit did nothing to dampen the sensation of soft feathers moving against your sensitive skin. Unfortunately, your jump moved you in the direction of the blue Ufu\u2026 Tatyal? Who reached out to put her hands against your ribs. As she steadied you, her hands moved and squeezed ever so slightly, but even that little touch was more than enough to tickle you again, prompting another flinch and gasp.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYour jumpiness was not lost on the Ufi around you. The crowd murmur rose, and they seemed to speak quickly and excitedly to themselves. You couldn\u2019t make out exactly what they were saying. Although at the moment, you didn\u2019t really care. A wide eyed pink Ufu reached out to deliberately brush her hands across your stomach, running feathery fingers along the tight thin fabric of your suit just below your navel. The ticklish feeling of feathers and fingers lightly but somehow deliberately tickling along the smooth skin was impossible to ignore, and you sucked in your quivering stomach with a giggle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHehe, h-hey guys\u2026 cut it out! That kind of tickles-s-s-ehehe!\u201d You stutter, as the crowd tightens around you. Somehow, telling them that they were tickling you didn\u2019t have the desired effect. Instead of backing off, the Ufi around you got even more excited. You felt hands reach out all around you, stroking and brushing against your whole body, as you let out a burst of ticklish laughter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThe Uman is tickish!\u201d \u201cListen to it laugh!\u201d \u201cSister, here! This spot is very ticklish!\u201d \u201cAh, the Uman has a sensitive belly, see!\u201d \u201cAnd here as well!\u201d You could hear the Ufi crowd seem to marvel at your ticklishness, reaching out feathery hands to explore and confirm for themselves as they chattered quickly in their own language, too much for the translator to keep up. And here you were, squirming from the grasp of one Ufu to another, as hands pawed at every ticklish spot you had! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two hands reached out and clasped onto your wrists, pulling at them.

You go to Iyafya and Yedah, and they start to lead you through the crowd, with security clearing a path for you. The two Ufu take you inside the Capitol building to a room with many tables and devices, which you presume is a science lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease sit down,\u201d Yedah gestures you to one of the tables.

Erin quickly gives you a conversion to around 69 kilograms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a reasonable weight,\u201d Yedah observes. \u201cThe typical Ufi is somewhere around 1600 joals, so we are very similar races. Now for the last part of the physical, we need you to lie down on the table. We also need you to remove your shoes and socks, as they will get in the way. Lastly, you need to raise the top part of your spacesuit so that we can see your stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you find the last two requests a little strange, you think to yourself that the Ufu probably have good reasons for what they are asking you to do. In accordance with this, you bend down and remove your shoes and socks. You get up onto the table and then pull up the top of your spacesuit, showing off your slender abdomen to the aliens. Once this is done, you lay down, feeling the coldness of the table on your bare back. \u201cPlease raise your arms in the air,\u201d Allena requests. You obey, and one of the Ufi straps your wrists to the table; while this is happening, another Ufi straps your ankles down. \u201cI apologize if this seems mean, but it is necessary for the test. In addition to the restraints, we are going to hook up some equipment to you so that we can measure the results.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and lift your head up. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound intrusive, but what exactly is this test?\u201d you ask Yedah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn accordance with our desire that our races share both friendship and laughter, we need to test how ticklish you are,\u201d the Science Minister notifies you. \u201cIn addition to this, the test will show where you are most ticklish, which will tell us how we both can best enjoy the relationship between our species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you state, now a little nervous, although it does not show on the outside. You are very ticklish, and now the Ufu have you tied up just for tickling. Then again, it couldn\u2019t be that bad, could it? It is just tickling, not some form of torture that they will use against you. Suddenly, you remember something that makes you shiver, although not enough for anyone to notice: Yedah made you bare your belly and your feet in preparation for the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think we are ready to begin the test,\u201d Allena proclaims. While you were asking Yedah about the test and thinking about what was to come, she had hooked up all the equipment to your arms and legs. \u201cWe will start with the alien\u2019s\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You were insanely ticklish on your armpits and they were going for them from the get-go? You steeled yourself as Allena and Yedah approached you from either side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped audibly as the Ufu duo proceeded to reach their feathery forearms out and began waving them gently about your armpits. \"E-eheheheep! Ohoho my gohohohod!\" was all you could manage to respond with, along with a few jerks as you struggle helplessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. But how will you react if I were to do this?\" Allena began cutting up the sleeves of your spacesuit, exposing your bare underarms. \"Don't worry, we'll fix it after!\" she added, not making you feel much better in the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an effort to tease you, the two scientists were wiggling their menacing fingers in the air just before slowly descending onto your poor armpits. In an instant, they began scribbling their deft fingers in and around your smooth hollows. \"AHAHAHAA, OKAHAHAY, OKAHAHAY! PLEHEHEHASE STAHAHAHAP!\" you yelped, arching your back and fighting back as much as possible, trying to pull your arms down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe natural feathers of the Ufu around their wrists also made it an unbearable, tickly situation for you. They continued to spider their soft fingertips, dancing around the edge of your hollows teasingly. With Allena on your right and Yedah on your left, they drilled their fingers deep into your hollows, driving you crazy. Your laughter was met with cute giggles by the two scientists, showing amusement in your plight. \"OHOHOHOO! NOHOHOHOO MOHOHOHORE! AHAHAHAHAHAA!\" was all you could sputter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, they stopped the assault on your armpits. \"Okay, looks like your armpits are <i>unbearably ticklish!</i>\" Allena commented as she wrote down her findings. \"Now, let's take a look at your... \"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Tell me more about these Yathi.\" you tell Erin. Your screen fills with an image of one of them. The Yathi is female, and according the description stands 6'7\" (200 cm) tall, which is apparently the standard height for Yathi women. The most prominent non-human characteristic is the covering of short, grey fur across the entirety of her body. She also appears to have pointed ears coming out of the top of her head. The two facts remind you of a cat or a dog, although considering her humanoid features and size, the image of a werewolf also springs to mind. The only clothing the Yathi seems to be wearing is a sash of some kind that functions as a short skirt tied asymmetrically around one hip, hanging low on the other. It covers her nether-region, but the rest of her is bare. Either the fur suffices for these people, or this image is merely for your edification. At any rate, you notice her figure: firm, large breasts; the soft outlines of musculature on her arms and legs underneath the short fur; the faint marking of ab muscles on her taut stomach; short claws on her fingers and toes; and sharp teeth barely visible behind parted lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Yathi are a warrior race with a strict honor code.\" Erin tells you, describing the species as you carefully examine the slowly rotating image. \"While they are a relatively new species in the galaxy, they have expanded aggressively to over a dozen systems. Their ships are small, containing no more than a handful of crew, but heavily armed and shielded. This makes them slow to maneuver, but unmatched in close quarters. The Yathi themselves are physically quite strong, as their homeworld experiences high gravity. I believe you have noticed the musculature. However, this makes them significantly uncomfortable in zero-g situations, and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait!\" You say, stopping Erin's soliloquy on the Yathi, who sound more dangerous by the second. \"Why would we want to make contact with them? They sound like they'll just eat me, and hunt down us weak Earthlings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, captain!\" Erin reassures you. \"Sol System is under the protection of the Erimosi, who have been in space many centuries longer than the Yathi. Your home system is completely safe. As for why you should contact them, Sol System is very close to Yathi space. It is inevitable that your two species will come into contact. All the more reason to establish relations sooner rather than later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh with both relief and worry. You're glad that Earth has such powerful patrons, but at the same time that doesn't do you much good way out here. \"So Earth is safe, but they still get to eat me, great. Tell me more about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to worry, captain. Besides, eating sentients would go against the Yathi honor code.\" Erin says, which is at least somewhat reassuring. \"They have other methods of dealing with people they don't like!\" Not reassuring. \"Anyway, Yathi culture has a strong sense of hierarchy. Individuals establish dominance over others, who then submit. Those above are bound to protect the ones below them; and those that submit are bound to obey their superiors. I recommend not showing any signs of weakness, Captain. The Yathi will not be able to resist exploiting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noted, Erin.\" You say, trying not to fear this race of Amazonian wolf-people. At least, that's how their starting to seem in your mind. \"How do you recommend I make first contact with this kind of race?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Visiting their home world is not advised.\" Erin tells you sternly. \"Not only would you be at the mercy of millions of Yathi, but the gravity would be uncomfortable for a human, and unhealthy over prolonged periods without an exo-suit. However, there are a few protocols for contacting aggressive species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I recommend contacting as small a population as possible. We could land on the outskirts of their newest colony world, and make contact with a single individual. Once you have made successful contact, you would be able to speak with the Yathi on equal footing.\" Erin says primly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly does 'successful contact' entail, Erin?\" you ask her, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026\" Erin trails off for a moment, as if hiding something. \"There is always establishing dominance. Their newest world has relatively low gravity, which may give you some small advantage. I believe in you, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan, the confidence of a computer not exactly helping. \"You said there were other options as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Option two is to contact a Yathi vessel. The Erimosi do not believe they will fire on a first contact scout ship, instead preferring to bring you aboard. From there, you can communicate your intentions on their ship. The military command structure, plus the fact that such a ship should only hold four or five Yathi, indicate potential for success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, while the Erimosi usually do not like to interfere with first contact situations, in this instance they may allow for\u2026 assistance.\" Erin says, sounding reluctant to even give this option. Again, you're surprised by how much emotion a ship AI can convey. \"A damaged Yathi vessel was intercepted by a passing Erimosi starship. They could only rescue one of the Yathi, which is receiving medical treatment onboard. This may allow you to make contact with the Yathi under more\u2026 beneficial terms. However, the Erimosi have programmed me to stress that productive first contacts are made without outside interference, and I am not allowed to recommend this option. But if you choose it, I'll take you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree interesting choices. First, meeting a lone Yathi on a remote world might be best. You'd learn about each other one on one, and then slowly meet more. But you could also be viewed as an enemy spy or something, if they're really that warlike. Meeting one of their military ships sounds crazy, but then again they might not be so aggressive if they don't feel threatened, and a strong military code of conduct keeps their instincts in check. And finally, you'd choose the last option in a heartbeat if it weren't for Erin's reluctance. The last thing you want to do if anger the Erimosi, and it sounds like they have their reasons for thinking it\u2019s a bad idea. But it'd be so easy to show your good intentions if the Yathi were weak and docile enough to not try anything on you! Thinking it over for some time, you decide on a course of action:</span></div></div>",

Within a minute, the engines are ready, and she continues, \u201cI\u2019m engaging the warp drive. This might feel a little weird.\u201d Suddenly, you feel the warp engines activate, and you are thrust back in your seat. Your whole head becomes cloudy, and it takes you a minute to reset after the ship slows down from the jump. When you finally come to it, you see a small planet in your view screen. \u201cIn English, this colony\u2019s name is Feather Hole. It is 45% land and 65% water, and the water makes the land appear very green from outside. The gravity here is at about 50% of Earth\u2019s, which would make it just 3% of the gravity on the Yathi home world. Since the gravity is so low, the Yathi are fairly uncomfortable, making them a little less effective at being hostile. The air is about 50% oxygen, so you will want to keep your helmet on. That is all I have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Erin,\u201d you respond. \u201cAny other advice on dealing with the Yathi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure you meet a lone Yathi,\u201d Erin advises. \u201cThis will make sure that you are the safest that you can be. Secondly, if you can find a weakness on the Yathi, use it against them. If you establish dominance, the Yathi will be bound to obey you by their honor code. Going along with this, I want to remind you to not show weakness. They will exploit any weakness they find on you to try to get you to submit to them. Lastly, be confident! Especially with the low gravity here, the Yathi will be less likely to be aggressive if you appear confident that you can establish dominance over them. You can make successful contact with the Yathi and will if you are confident!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you answer Erin with a little sureness, giving yourself at least a small chance to survive this. \u201cWhere would be the best place for us to land?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found a hill on the north side of the planet,\u201d Erin proclaims. \u201cThere appears to be a single Yathi headed there, but I do not detect any other Yathis in the area. It might be your best chance to meet a lone Yathi. Should I land us there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do so,\u201d you confirm. Erin guides the ship down slowly, and you get out of the ship, your suit and helmet still on. \u201cHow far away is the Yathi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is about a mile away, and she should see the ship soon,\u201d Erin notifies you. \u201cYou should meet her a little away from here, but do not stray too far. It will be better if she has to walk longer than you, as she will be a little more exhausted. I will be able to talk with you through your suit\u2019s translator, and I will give you advice as needed. You can do this, Captain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the faith in me,\u201d you confidently say, believing that you can make good relations -with a relatively tired Yathi. You walk about one hundred yards and then wait for the Yathi to come to you. Once the Yathi is about two hundred yards away from you, you call out, \u201cHello! I am a human from Earth, and I have come to establish peaceful relations with the Yathi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d the Yathi calls out as she approaches you quickly, stopping a few feet away from you. \u201cMy name is Lieutenant Quiana, and I am a patrol officer here.\u201d What does Quiana do next?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the misgivings from Erin, and the Erimosi that programmed it into her, you decide that meeting up with the Erimosi ship and meeting an injured Yathi would be the safest choice. \"I know you don't like it, Erin. But I think we should rendezvous with that Erimosi ship. Please set a course there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, captain.\" Erin says, still sounding reluctant. \"I'll take us there, and relay our situation to the Erimosi captain.\" With that, you suddenly feel the acceleration of the engine, which quickly delivers you into deep space. Then, without even a warning, Erin pops the warp drive. Perhaps its because you picked the option she didn't want, but without any warning, the warp jump disorients you more than you expect. The stars change and a large vessel pops into your view screen, but you sit there dumbly for a couple minutes as your faculties slowly return to you. The human body just wasn't designed for warp space, even if it only lasts an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you're sitting there drooling, I explained our situation to Captain Uriana, of the Erimosi light cruiser.\" Erin tells you. <i>That</i> massive thing is a <i>light</i> cruiser? You can't imagine what an Erimosi flagship must look like, they've never brought one to Sol system. Still, the light cruiser is larger than even the biggest Earth-made vessels. It makes you glad the Erimosi are on your side, even if they'd prefer you make contact on your own. The <i>Swift Feather</i> heads towards an opening docking bay, and the larger ship engulfs your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the vessel is Erimosi, you don't even bother to check to see if the atmosphere is compatible. While Erimosi prefer air that's a little higher in oxygen content, it's perfectly suitable to humans. You hop out of airlock and onto the ship, but once there you're met with a fresh surprise. The dress code on this ship is nothing like what you're used to seeing from Erimosi back home! You're used to seeing Erimosi wearing long, conservative robes, making them look like priests or nuns. But the handful of Erimosi you see here are wearing almost nothing! Two of them stand in front of you, with a handful more mulling around in the background, all female. At least that met your expectations, Erimosi men only comprise 10% of the population, and tend not to leave homeworld. But the Erimosi look like they're ready for a day at the beach, each of them wearing the equivalent of a strapless bikini in various bright colors. Their bodies all look like statuesque representations of a human ideal, as if carved out of obsidian, their jet skin revealed to you in all its glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Erimosi in front of you steps forward, followed by another. \"Greetings, human. I am Captain Uriana. This will be your attach\u00e9 while on board, Doctor Enoa.\" She tells you, gesturing to her compatriot. The captain is clothed in a white garment, while the Doctor's are green, making you wonder if those are distinctions between command and medical. Behind them, you notice others wearing red as well. \"I understand you are here to meet the Yathi we took on board. Enoa can give you the details, however I have duties to attend to. You will excuse me.\" You tell the captain that you do in fact understand, and she bows before promptly turning and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're wondering about our clothing.\" Enoa says to you, and you realize that your expression is probably fairly easy to read. \"Our research indicated humans would respond best to the robes that you have been accustomed to, at least initially. However, what you see here is more typical for our people. We don't like covering ourselves like you do. You'll find that most humanoids are more like us than like you that way.\" Enoa tells you, and starts directing you towards a hallway. You nod at the revelation, but in reality its more than a little shocking. You'd love it if they dressed like this all the time, you can't help but linger over the attractive forms of Erimosi officers as they pass by you in the wide corridors of the luxurious looking ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the Erimosi seem to be returning your gaze just as eagerly. \"Enoa, I feel like I'm being stared at a little.\" You tell her in a low tone, although you hear the Erimosi who just passed you giggle lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well most Erimosi have never seen a human before, only heard about them. You may not believe it, but they're very interested in meeting with you. However, on the Captain's orders, I'm the only one assigned to you, and everyone else is to carry on in their duties.\" Enoa tells you. The idea of all these advanced, not to mention rather attractive, aliens all interested in you is pretty flattering. You'd love to meet with them, and you'd imagine you'd have time despite the mission, but Enoa seems to have indicated otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand, why do I have to be kept away from everyone?\" you ask Enoa. A conflicted expression appears over her soft features, and her pale blue eyes look away, a hand playing with her white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd\u2026 be a distraction.\" She finally tells you, after a disconcertingly lengthy pause. \"We're actually on a tight schedule, and I can attend to any of your needs. Come, this way! I'll take you to the room in the med bay with the Yathi.\" Enoa says, changing the subject quickly. Her answer didn't completely answer your questions, and you feel like the Erimosi are hiding something from you. The Captain barely said a word to you before leaving, and now the only person allowed to talk to you is this doctor. Still, Erin did say the Erimosi didn't want you to make first contact this way, and they might have their reasons. You are interfering with whatever they're doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you walk down the corridor, you continue to feel eyes on you from the Erimosi passers by, heading to their stations or to their quarters. Some seem to whisper just outside the hearing range of your translator. And you also notice Enoa's eyes on you every so often as well, furtively glancing when she believes you aren't looking. It's too much to believe that they find you as beautiful as you do them. Is a human that interesting to them? Erimosi weren't supposed to be as curious as humans, that's why they don't explore much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think of what to say next to Enoa, as you start to reach the medical/biological wing of the ship, certain symbols in the corridor taking on the green shade of the doctor's skimpy clothing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What can you tell me about the injured Yathi, Enoa?\" You ask her, getting down to business and forgetting for now the strange looks and behaviors of the Erimosi. Doctor Enoa nods and readily begins relaying the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found her vessel derelict in deep space.\" Enoa tells you somberly. \"There were signs of combat, and  this one was the only survivor. We don't know what kind of ship they ran into, or what happened. The survivor was barely alive, but we were able to nurse her back to health, slowly. She didn't make it easy on us. She tried to break half of the med bay and escape to her ship, not that we took it with us. We had to restrain her for her own safety and ours.\" You notice a slight smirk on the Erimosi's lips as she says this. While it might indicate a dark pleasure at the task, you'd probably be just as smug if you had to deal with such a difficult patient. \"She's still weak, and spends much of the day sleeping, but she's regularly conscious now. All she's willing to say is name and rank: Sub-Commander Wura. She won't tell us what happened. We were about to take a more active approach with her, but maybe you can connect with her in a way we can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat certainly brings you up to speed. Despite the unfortunate circumstances for this Wura, this is actually just what you wanted. Not only is the Yathi weakened, but also restrained. You can talk to her without having to worry about her attacking you, and hopefully you can get her to be cooperative. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the Erimosi have had any luck, although your not sure what Enoa meant by taking a 'more active approach.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you reach the medical facilities, and Enoa directs you to the Yathi's isolated room. \"This is her room. It's completely soundproof for\u2026 everyone's sake.\" The Erimosi doctor explains. \"So if you need assistance, just press the green triangle next to the door. I'll let you talk with her alone.\" While you initially want to protest, you remember that the Erimosi strongly believed in making first contact without their help. You're already getting a major exception this way, so if she's not willing to be in the room with you, the Erimosi have still done more than enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room and see this Sub-Commander Wura in the center, reclined on a slightly elevated bed. She looks to be asleep, giving you a chance to examine her for a moment. Her forearms are in restraints high above her head, looking like they were stuck their with alien duct tape. Her shins are bound similarly, and a strap of some kind ties her waist to the bed tightly. It doesn't look like she has much room to maneuver. Wura is tall, probably around six and a half feet or so. Her feet stick out just over the edge of the bed, and you note the claws at her toes. Short, light grey fur covers her entire body. From her neck, down to her chest and stomach, and all the way to her inner thighs is a lighter fur of an underbelly, in a silver-white. You can detect the outlines of muscles on her arms and legs, which make you thankful for the restraints. You can also see the outlines of her abs through the short fur, toned slightly short of a hard six-pack. She also has a full chest modestly covered by a green garment presumably given by the medical staff here. Her face has a soft, content expression, as if having a pleasant dream. But you can notice the sharp teeth underneath her gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat to get her attention, having examined her long enough. Her eyes flutter awake, and you see the vertical pupils focus on you within the golden irises. A growl rumbles in her throat. You speak quickly, trying to make your intent clear. \"Hello, Wura. I'm a human, from a planet called Earth, and I'm here to\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you\u2019re here to interrogate me, are you?!\" Wura sneers. \"Those Erimosi couldn't do the dirty work themselves! You won't get any more than I've already said, I'm not telling you anything about my vessel or my mission.\" The look she gives you would make you feel like a trapped deer, if it weren't for the restraints that don't budge at all under her tugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm here to contact the Yathi, to establish relations between our races! I don't\u2026\" Before you can tell Wura that you really don't care about her mission, her ship, or any of the things she doesn't want to tell you, she interrupts you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out of these! Take me back to my ship!\" She demands haughtily. \"I don't need your charity, if that's what you call this!\" She continues to berate you, and with frustration you step outside the chamber, needing a moment of calm to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnoa appears from another room and arches an eyebrow at you in a human gesture. \"She thinks I'm here to interrogate her for you. And I can't get through to her without her yelling at me!\" You exclaim in frustration. \"I just don't know what to do to get her to stop growling and yelling and listen to me for a minute.\" You scratch your head, trying to come up with a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want her to stop talking, there is something you could try\u2026\" Enoa tells you, her eyes gleaming with some kind of energy. \"You wouldn't know it, human, but Yathis are actually very\u2026 <i>ticklish</i>. And with her bound up with this, you have an effective method of making her more cooperative.\" Enoa flashes you a wide grin as you gape in surprise. That certainly wasn't a method you'd think of, especially for a proud warrior race like the Yathi. But now that you think about it, even after five minutes you already want to teach this Wura some manners. With a nod and a grin of you own, you thank Enoa for the information and head back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWura is just glaring at you now, as if waiting for you to speak first just for the sake of yelling over you. But you glance over her stretched out form: her inner arms and taut underarms are exposed, as is the entirety of that hard looking midriff. And you also look down at those clawed feet sticking out from the edge of the bed. You have plenty of options to see if you can get Wura into a bit of a better mood. But where to start this new ticklish tactic?</span></div></div>",

You crawl behind the glaring Yathi, who still hasn't said a word, then stroke your fingers down her duct taped lower arms, enjoying the sudden change in mood for Wura. Her muscled arms tense up in ticklish anticipation; her mouth trying to hold in the giggles that she knew would give away her secret,  a secret that you already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Wura demands, her mouth curling into an involuntary smile as your hands slide closer to her underarms. She must be pretty ticklish if she's already smiling from even the hint of tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to talk like civilized beings, but you wouldn't let me talk. So I thought this might help calm you down.\" As you speak, your hands continue their journey down Wura's arms, now teasing her exposed upper arms. \"Unless you feel like it isn't necessary for me to continue?\" You glare in return at the Yathi, figuring even an alien could figure out a sarcastic stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever dropping her tough girl attitude, Wura growls, \"I'll never talk. Let me out of he-hahahahahastopthat!\" Your fingers have finally reached their destination, Wura's exposed armpits. You spider tickle them lightly, which is still enough to cause the ticklish Yathi to giggle and struggle in her restraints. Her giggles evolve into snickers and chuckles as you press into the flesh of her sensitive underarms, caressing her nerves with ticklish sensations. Wura seems to have dropped her earlier restraint, her beautiful laughter flows freely out of her mouth. You're actually enjoying the Yathi's laughter, not to mention her helplessness. You continue to tickle the defenseless Yathi silly, running your hands down her ribcage quickly, which causes a yelp from Wura, then run your hands back up to her underarms. <i>This must be hard on her,</i> you think, remembering what Erin told you about the Yathi, <i>she was probably trained not to show weakness, and being tied up probably doesn't help that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercymercyhahahahahastop!\" The poor Yathi manages to plead through her laughter. You recall that the Yathi determine ranks in their society through submission; whoever submits to another must obey that person without question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy is sounding a bit better. Maybe now you're ready to talk?\" You almost want her to keep fighting, you really enjoyed tickling her. Wura didn't respond to your question, instead using her energy to struggle against the duct tape once more. You feel like a little more tickling will finally break the Yathi. The question was, where?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The werewolf like creature pants on her dais, try to recover from your tickly assault. \"Perhaps it's time to try something different.\" You think, quickly stepping out of the room. You return brandishing a long slim feather, courtesy of the Erimosi. Wura glares over at you, looking annoyed, then spits through bared teeth,\" I already told you, human, I'm not going to talk. Now let me ou- gahahahaha!\" You shut Wura up fast with a few quick strokes of your feather in her underarms again. The ticklish Yathi giggles and squirms, not at the level she was before, but enough to show that she's still being tickled by the feather. You look down into her fierce uellow eyes, then say,\" For the last time, Wura, I'm not here to interrogate you.\" You see Wura briefly giving you a defiance look, before bursting into laughter again. \"I just want to talk without having you scream at me every few seconds. Can we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yathi, with obvious difficulty, growls,\" You will never get anything from me!\" You sigh, not truly disappointed, then say,\" So be it.\" You drop your feather, then suddenly reach down and tickle Wura's thighs. The Yathi yelps, trying to pull away with no success. Her beautiful laughter grows in volume significantly as you amp up the tickling on her thighs. You tickle the inside of Wura's legs, feeling her hard muscles resisting under her short fur. You smile, teasing the Yathi's thighs and enjoying the laughes that come from her because of it, then suddenly have an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reclaim the fallen feather, temporarily stopping Wura's tickle torture. Without giving her too much of a chance to recover, you climb back up to her stomach, sitting down. Then, you quickly run the feather over the top of Wura's breasts. The surprised Yathi giggles, her eyes widening as she realized your intent. Grinning slyly, you slide your hands behind her furry back, undoing the straps to her medical clothing. It slides off, and you get your first look at a Yathi's chest. The breasts are large and well formed; Wura glares at you with a similar expression as if she was a hungry wolf and you were a cowering rabbit. You don't let that faze you as you run the feather all over her chest, teasing the ticklish Yathi. Wura still giggles as the feather tickles her, but something else is in her expression, something that almost looks like she <i></i>wants<i></i> you to go on. You're surprised at the realization, thinking,\" Maybe aliens aren't so different from humans after all. Wura seems to be a fine example.\" The last part of the thought puts a smile on your face as you continue to tickle the defenseless Yathi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half hour passed before you finally stopped playing with the Yathi's chest. You feather tickle Wura's neck, which almost causes you to get your hand bitten off, then switch to her ears, a place out of the reach of Wura's mouth. Her ears twitch in response to the feather, the Yathi still giggling. After a few more minutes of tickling, the Yathi finally gives up, saying,\" I submit! Just stop tickling me, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWura pants as you remove the feather from her body. Now you must decide what kind of a person you are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remembering what you've learned about the Yathi, you decided that it would be better for humanity to take a more... aggressive stance towards its warlike neighbors. After all, this is a very power structure based species, so if your first interaction showed the Yathi that humanity isn't to be pushed around, friendly relations would probably come much easier. Besides, the Erimosi's diplomatic protection would prevent a war, should worst come to worst, you figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted the feather in front of Wura's helpless left armpit. She flinched and whimpered.<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare look away from me when I tickle you!,\" you command, stroking her horribly sensitive underarms with the feather and your fingers. She gasped and started giggling, but soon managed to look you directly in the eyes through her laughter. <br>\r\n\"That's better. You are to address me and everyone else on this ship as your superior, do you understand?\" you say, ceasing your tickly assault, looking into her panting face. You keep the feather poised over Wura's helpless armpit threateningly. She nodded her head hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean your head next to hers and speak authoritatively, \"I am a human. I heard of a Erimosi vessel with a wounded Yathi on board. I thought it would be a good chance to make first contact with your species. However, you refused to even speak to me! I do not think that humanity deserves such an insult! Do you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated and started stuttering, \"I, uh, I... I didn't know! I du-AHAHAHAHAHA!!! NO!!!! PLHEEEHEHEHEHEHEEESE! GAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off by finger tickling her right armpit, massaging the extra-fine fur on it. In a galaxy where the warfare was based on tickling, it must surely be a massive liability to have armpits that were so pleasant to stroke, to say nothing of what having such soft fur pressed into your most ticklish spots would <i>feel</i> like... you smiled at her forced mirth and the tears that were starting to form in her eyes, and you did so rather smugly. You traced circles on the inside of her exposed, firm belly button with the quill of your feather while your fingers slowly and methodically massaged and felt their way around her armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now as restitution, you will pay this debt of honor with your laughter and freedom!\"<br>\r\nThat sounded pretty official! You were pretty surprised with yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAHHAHAHAHAH! I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW!!!!\" she yelled, the desperation clear in her eyes and voice before she melted back into laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not here to interrogate you? I came here to establish relations, and you refused to talk to me like a reasonable person. So now I'm have to punish you for your insolence,\" you explain, as if to a child why they have to sit in time out for 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun the feather around in your hand and started poking and stroking her belly button with the quill, driving her laughter to silence, a ear to ear smile plastered on her face. Her sharp fangs suddenly seemed much less scary. You let her linger on the brink of ticklish oblivion for several seconds until you finally stop to let her breathe. She seemed grateful for the break, and while she focused on panting, you thought of your next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could get Wura to submit to you personally. That would let you gather information on the Yathi on your terms, and if domination is so prevalent in their culture, perhaps having one submit to the first human to explore the galaxy would deter the Yathi from showing aggression toward humans as we expand throughout the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest your hand on top of Wura's head and stroke it gently, almost lovingly. She tenses up at first and then relaxes, glad that you haven't started tickling her again. You seem to have tickled most of her bad attitude and defiance out of her, and you can't deny you had fun doing it! If she submits to you, you would be able to restrain and tickle her on a whim. Not to mention how fun to would be to have her stripped completely naked while you tickled her into entire submission. If Yathi are ticklish like humans, perhaps they have other humanlike vulnerabilities to exploit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, if you didn't want to take Wura as your slave, you could certainly just keep teaching her about how important it is to treat sentients with respect. In fact, since you've already technically made your first contact, and Enora is supposed to attend to your <i>every</i> need... well, another pair of hands would certainly help you drive the point home. In fact, Enora would probably enjoy helping you, and would possibly even be willing to be more flexible with the rules considering all the trouble Wura has caused! It would also be educational to see just how effective an Erimosi can be at tickling, maybe you could even learn a thing or two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scritch on Wura's taut underarms to make her jump and giggle, and then you keep it up for a few seconds while you speak, \"Break's over. In light of your rude and aggressive behavior, I've decided to...\"</span></div></div>",

You can feel the musculature of her abs under the soft silver fur. Sub-Commander Wura continues to silently glare at you, although you think you can see a curious and concerned look in her sky-blue eyes. With a grin, you curl your fingertips and slowly drag them down her stomach, dragging along her fine fur and feeling her stomach tense underneath your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" the Yathi asks in a rushed voice, her face tensing as she tries not to react to what you're doing. \"Stop that! Don't touch me!\" Her eyes dart between your face and your fingers, as she tries to keep her body from betraying her, from giving away her secret. But unfortunately for her, you already know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to talk, and I wanted to ask for your help.\" You tell her calmly, as your fingers slide down her stomach agonizingly slowly, something Wura is clearly trying very hard to ignore. \"But you wouldn't even listen to me. So I'm going to do this until you start feeling a little more cooperative. Unless you're willing to listen to me now?\" You arch your eyebrow at her, a gesture that's probably lost on the alien, who doesn't seem to notice your skepticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrr, I have nothing to say to you, Erimosi pawn! Let me g-ehehehee!\"  Your fingers had reached the end of their patient journey, getting to her waistline. Then they had started back up again, this time raking against the grain of her fur. This was too much for the Yathi to control without laughing, as you feel her lower belly ripple under your touch. She begins to giggle, a very pleasant sound to your ears. Her face contorts into a wide grin, and aside from the row of sharp, pointy teeth, it's a pleasant expression. If you could get Wura to be nicer to you, she'd probably be pleasant company. At least she wouldn't be hard on the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it'll take more than one little tickle to get her to that point, you realize. And honestly, you don't want to stop so soon. Your fingers scratch up her belly, and then repeating the process. Down and up her stomach, your tickling increasing in speed with each movement. Wura tosses her head back, trying in vain to control herself, snickers and chortles slipping past her lips continuously. Your fingers idly zigzag their way up and down her belly, with all the patience in the world. Enoa, the Erimosi doctor, wasn't lying, Wura really is ticklish! It probably doesn't help that she's tied down without any means of defending herself, her body stretched out for you to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skitter your fingers along her waistline, just above the green medical garment that might as well be underwear. It seems to be a particularly effective spot on Wura, as her hips buck and her laughter ratchets up a notch. You linger there, tickling in a quick, constant pace, watching her with a grin. \"Nahahahahaha! No stahahahahap! Plehehehease nohohoho!\" Wura sputters between fits of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease? Well, you seem to be making some progress if she's willing to ask nicely. \"Are you willing to cooperate? Can we talk like civilized sentients now?\" You ask her pointedly, without stopping the tickling. You don't want to give her a chance to recover her resolve, and honestly you've found a very fun spot to exploit. Wura doesn't respond, just lying back and continuing the writhe and laugh. You feel like you're close to getting her, just a little more...</span></div></div>",

In a placating tone, you say,\" I just wanted to establish relations with your race, Wura, but you wouldn't even let me talk.\" You let a single finger touch the heel of the Yathi, then let it wander her foot, tickling all the way. Wura growls, but it sounds more faked than threatening. She struggles to hold back the giggles that your fingers are eliciting from her feet, giggles that would give away her secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to tease the bound Yathi's foot, feeling her pulling back in an attempt to alleviate the sensations. \"I've heard your race is very, ticklish... Wura. Maybe this will convince you to talk?\" You ask, adding a second finger to the gentle tickling on Wura's sole. The silver Yathi again pulls at her restraints, then finally allows a giggle to escape her clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that she's tied up and helpless, Wura still barks,\" I'll never talk with you, puny human. Now I demand you stop and Ahahahahaha!\" You can't help but admire Wura's resilience, but you also can't help running your fingers down Wura's soles. You scratch gently in her arches, then quickly tease the area underneath her toes, careful to avoid the sharp claws protruding from them. The ticklish Yathi lets out a stream of laughter, obviously foot ticklish. You continue to torture the bound up alien, now rotating your fingers between the sensitive spots of Wura's toes. You're actually enjoying listening to the Yathi's helpless laughter, and to extract more, you tickle the pads of Wura's toes. The poor Yathi is howling with laughter, pulling at the duct tape the Erimosi bound her with. You remember that Erin told you that ranks in the Yathi race are determined through combat and submission. \"She must absolutely hate this, being so helpless.\" You think, your fingers making another journey down to Wura's arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of foot tickling, Wura manages to say through her laughter, \" PLEASESTOPHAHAHAHAMERCY!\" \"Maybe she's ready to talk?\" You think to yourself, aiming the same question at a still laughing Wura. The Yathi doesn't respond, but it's clear it won't take much more to convince her to talk. You're about to start tickling another body when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In addition, I am typically the officer who interacts with any aliens who come on the ship, such as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how often do you get to see other species?\u201d you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite often, actually,\u201d Enoa notifies you. \u201cRepresentatives from our allies are allowed on board often, and I show them around with assistance from military Erimosi. As I hinted at before, I also treat them if they get injured, and if any tests are needed, I administer them. In addition, in the evenings, when they are not on official business, I entertain them and make sure they are comfortable during their stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you entertain them?\u201d you question, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could explain it, but it would be easier to just show you,\u201d Enoa answers. \u201cWould you like to be entertained?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be fine with me,\u201d you declare, and the Erimosi guides you to an empty room in the medical bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would take you to another room, but there would be too many other Erimosi,\u201d she proclaims. \u201cThis space will actually do well for the entertainment. I am sure that you will enjoy this; the foreign species doctors on other ships have informed me that this method works well on humans. Please remove your spacesuit and shoes and then lie down on the examination table.\u201d You look at Enoa questioningly, but she gives you an insistent gaze, so you remove your shoes and the spacesuit, leaving you in just your underwear. Feeling a little exposed, you lie down on the examination table and look up at the doctor. \u201cYou look a little uncomfortable. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am just in my underwear,\u201d you reply. \u201cThat isn\u2019t normal for humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said earlier, most humanoids don\u2019t like covering themselves up,\u201d Enoa announces. \u201cThe entertainment is more effective if I can see your skin. Is it alright if I begin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d you affirm, and the doctor\u2019s hands come down and start tickling your bare belly. \u201cAHAHAHA! THAHAT TIHIHICKLEHES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, of course it does,\u201d Enoa states as you squirm around. \u201cTickling is a wonderful way to entertain someone, and it looks like you\u2019re very ticklish.\u201d Her fingers spider all over your stomach, exploiting your sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHysterically laughing, you manage to gain your bearings enough to wriggle onto your back, and you cover your sides with your arms. The doctor ceases her tickling attempts when you turn over, and then you turn your head to her. \u201cYou entertain people by tickling them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, believe it or not, tickling is a very common form of entertainment,\u201d the Erimosi informs you. \u201cNearly all species are ticklish, and the vast majority of them like being tickled. In fact, after a long day of work, most foreign representatives don\u2019t mind letting me tie them up and tickle them. They get a safe word, and when they need me to stop, they say it. It\u2019s a way to make sure they don\u2019t hurt me and also ensure that I don\u2019t tickle them past their limits, and both sides have lots of fun. You look like someone who could use a little tickle therapy. Would you mind being tied up and tickled? I\u2019ll give you a safe word so it doesn\u2019t turn into tickle torture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could do it,\u201d you respond. \u201cI did come here to learn about how aliens interact so I can have productive contacts, and this is somewhere to start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tie you to this examination table,\u201d Enoa broadcasts. \u201cTurn over and put your arms up. I want to have full access to that ticklish tummy of yours.\u201d Reluctantly, you roll over so that you are on your back again, and you raise your arms in the air, exposing most of your tickle spots. The doctor pulls out a strap from under the table and uses it to secure your arms, and then she restrains your ankles with a strap at the bottom of the table. \u201cYour safe word is going to be \u2018Red\u2019. Is that alright?\u201d You nod to confirm this. \u201cGood. Well, I think we should start the tickle therapy on your\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

So why am I so interesting here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnoa looks furtively, and seems reluctant to tell you anything. But after a moment she acquiesced, telling you \u201cThat is true, we aren\u2019t a curious species like humans. Humans seem to be interested in everything, poking their fingers into every topic and place they can find.\u201d The human phrase is \u2018poking their noses,\u2019 but you don\u2019t correct her. \u201cIt\u2019s true we explore the galaxy very slowly, and only when we see something that interests us. Like humans! When we discovered your species, we were very interested in meeting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is an answer, but it doesn\u2019t tell you enough. \u201cBut Enoa, why are my people interesting to you? What makes the Erimosi curious about us?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Enoa says slowly. \u201cThe Erimosi aren\u2019t curious about everything like you, just very interested in very particular things. And some of those are things that humans definitely have, that you definitely have\u2026 it\u2026.\u201d You look at Enoa attentively as she seems to be on the verge of telling you some kind of secret, but to your disappointment, she stops herself and changes the topic. \u201cActually, human\u2026 once we were aware of your arrival, some of the crew have been petitioning to be allowed to meet with you. While I cannot permit you to interact with large numbers of the crew, you could meet with an individual. If you are interested....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that\u2019d be great!\u201d you tell Enoa. \u201cThe Erimosi have done so much for us back on Earth. I\u2019d like to meet someone outside of the Embassy. And if they really want to see me, I think that\u2019s only fair.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnoa bows slightly as you walk. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind. The petitioners held a lottery for just such a contingency. Under the circumstances, I can authorize a little time with the winner for you. She\u2019s a young security officer named Balla. I can take you to her quarters.\u201d You agree to Enoa\u2019s suggestion amicably. While you were here for the Yathi, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to spend some time with the crew. After all, they are taking time out of their duties to accommodate you. And if they really want to meet with you, who are you to say no? Still, it is a little strange that you\u2019re being separated from them so much. And the fact that Enoa only agreed to let you meet with more of the crew when she was talking about something she was uncomfortable with. What was she about to say back then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are.\u201d Enoa says, stopping your train of thought. You were standing in front of a door, one of many in this hallway, another sign of how big this ship was. You idly wondered how many Erimosi were on this ship. \u201cThis is Balla\u2019s quarters.\u201d Enoa pressed a button at the wall, opening the door. Inside was an Erimosi in a red garment, again little more than a bikini covering her waistline and chest. If she were human, you\u2019d put her around 20 years old, but you weren\u2019t exactly sure how long lived Erimosi were, or long long they were children. \u201cBalla, since you won the lottery I\u2019m letting you meet. You can spend time with the human until your duty shift begins, and you are not to invite additional crew during that time. Agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalla jumps up from her sitting position at her bed, grinning enthusiastically. \u201cAgreed! Thank you, Enoa! Come in, human! Come in!\u201d Balla calls to you energetically, grabbing your hand and bringing you into your quarters. You turn around to see Enoa bowing slightly as the doors automatically shut behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalla\u2019s room is small, but comfortable enough for two people. The only place to sit is on Balla\u2019s bed, against the far wall. She sits down there, and motions for you to join her. \u201cThis is so exciting, I actually get to meet the human!\u201d Balls says gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why the Erimosi on this ship are all so interested in meeting with me. Is it because I\u2019m the first human to travel into deep space?\u201d you ask her curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalla leans in close to you, her face mere inches from yours. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s not point in hiding it from you now, human. Now that you\u2019re here, what I really want is to\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

She pulls up an image of a Kichi for you: and you were right about them reminding you of snakes. Below the waist, these creatures have a long, snake like tail with no arms or legs. Scales of a golden brown color cover this specimen. But above the waist, she appears almost human. She has what appears to be long black hair and a humanoid face, although the pointed ears, yellow-gold skin and vertical, reptilian eyes are out of the ordinary. Her torso is also human-like: she has a normal and attractive chest of a human woman, clothed in some kind of black wrap around her chest and shoulders in an \"X\" shape. Her body is somewhat elongated compared to a human, and it makes you notice her stretched out, smooth stomach and long narrow navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their homeworld of Kich is a hot, dry world dominated by reptilian-like life forms.\" Erin tells you. \"The Kichi have acquired significant territory near human space, making them an important race to contact. But you need to be careful when dealing with them, the Erimosi have described their interactions with the Kichi as deceptive and deceitful. The Kichi are cunning and sly, using any means of flattery and trickery to achieve their goals. They are also not reluctant to lie or steal, and could be characterized as effectively amoral. Thankfully, the Kichi don't believe in violence, and can be considered more mercantile than militaristic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The most unique aspect of Kichi physiology are their eyes, which contain certain pulsating chromatophores capable of flickering faster than human or Erimosi eyes can detect. Simply by making eye contact, the Kichi are capable of sedating most sentient races into a hypnotic state, at which point you can guess how willing the Kichi are to take advantage. The Erimosi recommend using protective eye-wear whenever in close proximity to Kichi. The probability is high that their eyes will be quite effective on humans. However, the visor on your helmet is designed to prevent this effect, so I suggest you keep it on at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, you think. Sneaky, amoral snake aliens that can hypnotize you to do their bidding. Why can't the galaxy have more friendly aliens in it? \"Alright, so I'm supposed to keep my helmet on the whole time and not trust a word they say. Sounds like a ton of fun. How's this first contact supposed to be productive at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Erimosi believe that if you can convince the Kichi that humans will not be easily manipulated, your two races can engage in productive dialogue, even trade. Kichi-Erimosi relations, while difficult, have evolved to this point, even helping each other on occassion. The Kichi are not a warlike people, and prefer to rely on cunning. If the first human they see is perceptive enough to see through their tricks, they might have a high opinion of humans in the future.\" Erin tells you logically. It does make sense, if you get pushed around by these people, they'll think all of humanity can be taken advantage of just as easily. You'll have to be careful as a representative of all Earthlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noted, Erin. So, where do we go to meet these Kichi?\" you ask, starting to get an idea of how the mission will go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do have some options.\" Erin elaborates. \"First, you could be straightforward and travel to Kich. Your suit will protect you from the heat, and your helmet from Kichi eyes, as long as you keep both of them on. Second, the Kichi have colonized a world that produces a gas that, if inhaled by humans, produces\u2026 side effects. This offers a plausible excuse for you to keep your helmet on at all times. Finally, you could intercept a Kichi ship. Many Kichi vessels are one-person ships like this one, and it would give you the opportunity to meet with the species one on one. Which method do you prefer?\" </span></div></div>",

I'd be protected from that hypnotic Kichi eyes and I could stay in close contact with you through the suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Erin says happily. \u201cAnd I'll be able to monitor your vital signs as long as you keep the suit on. Just don't let them take it off of you, then I won't be able to track any physical phenomena affecting you.\u201d You hear the engines gearing up as Erin plots the coordinates. \u201cSo, the plan is heading to the Kichi colony of Resha Prime. I should let you know that its also home to one of the Kichi noble families. Merchant princess Ssuna of the Resha house is there, at least if she's not on vacation. If humanity can make one of the Kichi houses pro-human, it'd be a big victory for your species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about that fact. Pulling up information on the view screen, it looks like Kichi government is complicated and decentralized. These merchant princesses, rich heads of dynasties that hold entire planets and vast riches, are the closest thing their race has to leaders, and Kichi decisions are made by a vote of the five most powerful princesses. If you could make even one pro-human, it would be a big start to developing a good relationship with the Kichi species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to know, Erin. Set course for this Resha Prime, and engage when ready.\u201d You tell your AI, who doesn't respond aside from beeping in what you assume is an affirmative. But before you have time to read any more about the Kichi or this Princess Ssuna, the warp drive engages and you are immediately disoriented by the jump to another system. You blink your eyes and try to focus, the strange experience of traveling faster than light taking a moment to wear off. When it does, you're looking at an alien world: One with fewer oceans and more deserts than Earth, but otherwise very similar. Instruments indicate gravity is slightly less than Earth standard, and the warning against breathing the air is also displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour screen fills with an image of a Kichi as the planet hails you. \u201cUnknown alien vessel, you are in Kichi space, under the authority of the Resha Dynasty. Identify yourself immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, but realize that the question is a fair one. You did pop in unannounced. \u201cGreetings, Kichi. I am a human of the planet Earth. We have been informed of your races existence by the Erimosi, and I have been sent to Resha Prime in order to establish peaceful relations with your people. If possible, I would like an audience with the Princess Ssuna.\u201d You try to look authoritative and diplomatic, but in reality the whole thing makes you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it looks like you don't need to be. The Kichi smiles back at you. \u201cInteresting. It has been some time since the Kichi have encountered a new species, and we are honored that you have chosen Resha Prime as the location to contact the Kichi. Her serene eminence Princess Ssuna is residing in the palace, and I will see if she is available to meet with you. You are authorized to land at the Palace Spaceport, and an honor guard will be sent to greet you. I hope you enjoy your stay with us, human.\u201d The Kichi tells you, and the view screen goes blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin sets the ship down where instructed, and before you notice, you've arrived on the Resha Prime. You exit the <i>Swift Feather</i>, making sure to keep your suit and helmet on and secured. As you do, you see four Kichi, presumably your honor guard. They are all women, and each holds what looks like a ceremonial staff in one hand, a long metal rod with a stiff feather on the end. These Kichi look a little different than the image on the ship: their  scales on their lower halves are a crimson red instead of a pale gold, and the same goes for their eyes. They also seem a little taller. Perhaps this is a regional difference for this planet, or for memebers of the Resha house? Either way, it's something you note, as you look from one of the attractive female guards to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, Erin...\u201d you say into your helmet, in a way that the Kichi can't hear. \u201cWhat 'side effects' does the air on this planet have on humans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I forgot to tell you!\u201d Erin says. \u201cIf you breath in the air here, there's a biological chemical here that will\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Please come with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go quietly towards the palace, your honor guard surrounding you on all sides. Within a couple of minutes, you have arrived, and the guard takes you to the awe-capturing throne room. Looking around, you see several expensive jewels intermixed with feathers and trophies on the walls. A Kichi, whom you assume is Princess Ssuna, is leaning back on a couch on one side of a table, and a Kichi attendant appears to be tickling her bare belly with a feather as she laughs hysterically, causing you to think of this as a reason why extreme sensitivity could be bad for you. However, as you and the honor guard approach the table, the attendant ceases the tickling and leaves. The Kichi ruler calms down for a minute before getting up off her couch, standing tall to make her rank known. \u201cHuman, I present to you Merchant Princess Ssuna of the Resha Dynasty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for having me here, Princess Ssuna,\u201d you address the ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is our honor to be the place where you first encounter the Kichi,\u201d the princess responds. \u201cHowever, since this is the first Kichi settlement that you have visited, my scientists will need to take some basic measurements on you.\u201d You nod in affirmation, and two Kichi scientists come and take you to a wall. While one measures your height, the other one has you step on a scale to measure your weight. The scientists report their findings directly to Ssuna when they are done, departing the throne room afterwards. \u201cWell, my scientists are finished with their measurements. It appears that you weight slightly less and are quite a bit shorter than a standard Kichi. Now that they are done, would you like to sit down and talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be appreciated,\u201d you reply, and the two of you head to the table where Princess Ssuna was being tickled earlier. As the two of you sit down, two Kichi attendants come over to you, both wielding a couple of feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a tradition at the Resha Dynasty Palace that during first contact conversations, both species in the conversation get tickled with feathers,\u201d Princess Ssuna proclaims. \u201cIt is a way of establishing common ground between different species, as well as getting both participants to smile and laugh. I must ask you to take off your suit for this; it will make the tickling much more enjoyable and\u2026 effective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, you begin to worry about the effects removing your spacesuit would have on your sensitivity and consider whether to remove it or not. You think for a minute before deciding\u2026</span></div></div>",

Once you are both ready to talk again, Princess Ssuna speaks up, \u201cHuman, I am impressed by your endurance.

In Kichi culture, it is just an honor to be tickled. Since we are very ticklish, but we love tickling, we are sometimes honored by getting tickled on our bellies or armpits. Oh, I have an example. Remember how we were both tickled to begin the talks. That was a tradition rooted in establishing the honor of both myself and you. Having the representative of another species tickle the royalty is another tradition rooted in honor. Of course, if you do not like to tickle, we can pass this one by, and I will not hold it against you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m happy to be the tickler; I just wasn\u2019t quite expecting this,\u201d you announce. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to participate in your tradition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d the Kichi princess proclaims. \u201cAttendants, can you put me back on the couch, and restrain me this time?\u201d The attendants rush over to their princess and take her to the couch she had been getting tickled on when you walked in, quickly tying her down. \u201cNow, human, don\u2019t go easy on me because I\u2019m royalty. I really enjoy being tickled and testing how much I can take. However, if I say \u2018scales\u2019, that is when you need to stop because I\u2019m getting exhausted. No one that I\u2019ve been tickled by has gotten me to say that, though. Take it as a challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and walk over to the bound princess, eyeing her attractive, stretched out body. Soon enough, you get down to business, beginning to tickle the exposed stomach of your target. \u201cTickle, tickle, Princess Ssuna!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d she quickly breaks out into hysterical laughter. \u201cTHAHAHAHAHAT REHEHEHEHELY TIHIHIHICKLEHEHES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course it does, princess,\u201d you tease your ticklee, two minutes into the tickling. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to tickle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Princess Ssuna continues laughing uncontrollably as a couple of your fingers find her bellybutton and stick inside it. \u201cNAHAHAHAT THEHEHERE! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Although you are initially unsure of what to do, you continue tickling her navel, remembering that she told you not to go easy on her. The other hand continues finding tickle spots across her midriff as you torture her most ticklish spot. \u201cOHOHOHOHOHOHO AHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Princess Ssuna lasts about four minutes and fifty-one seconds after this, and then she screams out, \u201cHAHAHA SCAHAHAHAHALES!\u201d Hearing the safeword, you immediately stop, and the princess\u2019s attendants rush over to release her. She brings her arms down as she tries to catch her breath. After a few minutes, Ssuna catches her breath and looks up at you. \u201cWow! I can\u2019t believe you actually got me to say the safeword. As I said before, no one ever has gotten me to say it, even my royal ticklers, in double the time that you made me give in. That is really impressive. Thank you! That was the most fun I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are very welcome, Princess Ssuna,\u201d you respond. \u201cI also had a lot of fun tickling you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this incredible skill you just displayed has given me some ideas I think you will like for after the ceremonies are all done,\u201d Ssuna declares. \u201cHowever, we still have some formal ceremonial activities to complete.

However, I still hope that I can get my fingers on that bare belly of yours for a good tickling later. By the way, you will need to expose that ticklish tummy of yours again, and we will need to bind you to the couch. Like me, you will be tickled for a maximum of fifteen minutes, although you can end the tickling by uttering a safeword that you will pick out. What do you want for your safeword?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the word \u2018Gold\u2019,\u201d you declare as you pull your spacesuit up. \u201cSo, what exactly do I need to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let Sashes answer that question,\u201d Princess Ssuna gestures to one of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust lie down on the table,\u201d the Kichi honor guard speaks for the first time. \u201cWe will restrain your wrists and then begin the ceremonial tickling.\u201d You do as the guard orders, and soon one of the attendants restrains your wrists, leaving your upper body vulnerable. \u201cRemember that you can say your safeword at any time, and we will stop tickling. Otherwise, we will be tickling your stomach with our feather staffs. Are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod for the honor guard to begin the tickling, and within a few seconds, four feathers begin tickling your bare belly. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you cannot contain your laughter as the feathers traverse your ticklish torso. \u201cOHOHOHOHO MYHYHYHYHY!\u201d You squirm around a little, but your restraints prevent you from escaping the feathers, which are finding more and more ticklish spots on your midriff. When a feather creeps into your navel, you find yourself emanating the same behavior as Princess Ssuna, screaming for the tickling to stop. \u201cOHOHOHO PLEHEHEHEHESE NAHAHAHAT THEHEHEHEHERE! AHAHAHAHA! PLEHEHEHESE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Your squirming becomes slightly more intense, but you manage to hold off saying the safeword as the feather continues to tickle your bellybutton and the others traverse your tummy. After five minutes, your pleading dies out, as you run out of energy to do anything but just laugh. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHA! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Seeing this, the honor guard slows down their feathers a little, although they keep them on your most ticklish spot. However, after going into pure laughter, you get a new determination not to beg, even though you really cannot stand the tickle torture you are being put through. The Kichi seem to notice the newfound determination and continue fluttering their feathers across your abdomen. You continue to resist the urge to yell out the safeword as your midsection is relentlessly feathered, and after fifteen minutes, the tickling stops, leaving you collapsed on the couch. Quickly, the princess\u2019s assistants rush over and untie you as you breathe heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Ssuna walks over and sits next to you, observing your behavior carefully as you recover from the honor tickling. Right as you begin to breathe normally again, she questions, \u201cHuman, how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat tickled a ton,\u201d is the only thing you are able to think of as you sit up, next to the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of the point,\u201d she smiles. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you affirm. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, just a little tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess the good news is that the official introduction ceremony is finished now,\u201d Princess Ssuna proclaims. \u201cI will have to say that I am amazed at your resilience with that tickling the honor guard was giving you. Most aliens would have given up very quickly with a feather staff in their bellybutton, but you managed to persist through it. Because of this, I will support humans in the Kichi government. I will be honored to establish peaceful relations with humans. On another note, I have a proposal specifically for you based on your endurance and your skill when you tickled me. I do not want an answer now, but I would like to offer you a position as one of my royal ticklers. We will give you a tour of the royal ticklers\u2019 quarters and responsibilities, as well as what you would expect if you choose to accept, later, but your skill has impressed me very much. Right now, though, Sashes and the remainder of the honor guard will take you to our best guest room for the night. I will meet up again with you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Princess Ssuna,\u201d you respond. \u201cI am very happy that we will have peaceful relations between our two species, and I will consider your offer as I get more information.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease come with us,\u201d Sashes instructs you. You follow the honor guard to a large room. It has a fairly large bed, as well as a couch, a few chairs, and a pole, which you guess is used for tickling willing guests. \u201cThis will be your room for at least this night. We will be in the adjacent rooms if you need anything. Is there anything you would like right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis may sound weird or normal, but can I tickle you?\u201d you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kichi guard breaks out into a wide smile. \u201cOf course, human,\u201d she eagerly answers. \u201cI love being tickled, and you don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been waiting for a good tickling.

After a few seconds, you hear the loud roaring of the thrusters and engines, as you feel the whole craft starting to move forward. The ship quickly gained speed, before achieving lift and getting off ground. \"Ok, now I just have to configure a few key systems in here... If you'll just sit tight, we'll be in space in just a few more minutes...\" You AI says, as you see a screen to your right flashing with numbers, some you recognize as the altitude and longitude. You comfortably lean back in your seat, just looking at the blue sky and clouds as your ship climbed even higher and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, you see blackness all around you, along with some glittering lights dotted around randomly. You were in space! \"Ok Erin, now do you have any ideas on how do we find a Kichi ship?\" You ask her, unsure of how to actually find one to intercept. \"Well lucky for you, my <i>careless</i> little pilot, my sensors have picked up a ship that is close by us, with signs telling us that it is a Kichi craft.\" Your AI quickly says, obviously also excited to explore who was inside this new craft. \"I'll set us up for a course to intercept.

The effect is disorienting, but by the time you've adjusted you see the Kichi ship growing larger in your viewscreen. As your own spacecraft flies in closer to the Kichi ship, you see the other spacecraft slow down, almost beckoning you to board it. Both of your ships quickly link up, as a button on your panel lights up, indicating that both of your ships were linked up, and ready to be boarded. As you get ready to board, you remember Erin's warnings, and quickly checked whether your helmet was put on tight. After a few seconds, you get ready to board her ship to greet the Kichi when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you would, kindly meet me in my ship, we can talk about why you wanted to link up your ship with mine.\" You heard the sultry voice over your own radio, coming from the other ship. You give an audible gulp, as you you cross the bridge linking both of your ships. You wonder what sort of people the Kichi are like. Would they be hostile towards you? Shy away from you? Or maybe take a liking to you? As you finally cross over to her ship, you notice that the interior of the ship is quite small. In fact, if you had to guess, this ship could only hold one passenger, albeit that one Kichi you heard over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in awe of this new ship, you didn't realize that you were finally at the airlock of the Kichi's ship. As you wait for the airlock to open to allow you permission inside the Kichi's ship, you heard a voice over the speaker's in the airlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, it seems that my visitor is a \"human\", hmm? Well, I heard that your species just recently achieved interstellar transportation. Congratulations on that! Now, before you come over to my ship to discuss business, I need to dis-infect you. You know, you might be carrying space germs for all I know. Now, if you would kindly take off that suit of yours, we can start the dis-infection process.\" You nod, seeing logic in her statement. As you start to step out of your space suit, leaving your in your shirt and long pants, you notice the doors to your ship silently close behind you. \"Ohh, I almost forgot. Please take off your shoes too. The dis-infection machine needs to be <i>very</i> thorough to clean everything.\" Nodding, you quickly take off your shoes, and place them next to your space suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's begin the dis-infection process!\" You hear somewhat of an excited tone in the Kichi's voice, as you begin to wonder why was she so eager about this \"dis-infection\". Your answer came soon, as two metals hands grabbed at your wrists, pulling them over your head. You see a hole open up in the walls of the airlock, as a appendage with what looks like a rotating brush on it's end slowly crept towards you. \"Ohh human, I think you're going to have a <i>giggle</i> of this...\" You hear the Kichi say, before the intercom clicks off. As you struggle, the appendage slowly crept up in your shirt, until it was at your underarms. You stifle a giggle, feeling the ticklish bristles make slight contact. However, as soon as the brush started to whirl and rotate, you burst out giggling, surprise at how ticklish the brush was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhehehehheeey! Leheheheeet meehhehee gooohoohooo! Theehehee brushes! It tehehehheeeckles!\" You manage to splutter amidst your frantic giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course it does. This is the dis-infection process, you ticklish human! Just hang on for a few more minutes, the brushes will clean everything off you. And by everything, I <b>truly</b> mean <i>everything</i>.\" You hear the Kichi says impishly, the ticklish sensations making it hard to hear her over your own giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to control your giggles again, you start to see multiple slots pop open in the airlock, as more of those whirling brushes came out, attached to long metal tubes. The brushes quickly went to work, another one joining in the 'cleaning' of your underarms. Another brush quickly rotates at your belly, making you burst into a long stream of belly-aching laughter, as another zips down the rim of your pants, bristles tickling your sensitive inner thighs. Lastly, another two brushes went to town on your tootsies, cleaning your arches and soles with tickly bristles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAHAHAHAAAP! I CAAHAHAHAAN'T TAHAHAHAHAKE IT! PLEEHEHEHHEASE! NOOHOHOHOOH MOHOOOHOOORE! HAHAHHAHHAAA! IT TEEHHEHEECKLES SOOHOHOHOHOOHO MUCH!\" You snort and chuckle in bouts of giggles and laughter, your whole body struggling to escape the metal clamps. Finally, when you thought you were going to pass out, the brushes slowly retracted in their sockets, and the clamps release you down on the floor, giving you a much deserved rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well human, you didn't do too bad, I guess.

I\u2019ll be in the room to the right of where you will come out of the airlock.\u201d You slowly walk out of the airlock, freed from the robotic hands. As you turn right, you see the Kichi sitting on what appeared to be a beanbag at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease come sit down,\u201d she states, gesturing towards a beanbag on the other side of the table. You sit down, and she continues speaking. \u201cSo, this is what a human looks like. Very interesting. I heard that you have only met the Erimosi so far. We are glad to finally meet up with your species. From the Erimosi, we have learned that you are a very ticklish species, and I have confirmed that with the cleaning. So, human, you have done fairly well at the first test for being so ticklish. Let\u2019s get down to business, though. Where are you most ticklish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Erin\u2019s advice about the Kichi\u2019s perceptions based on manipulation, you decide to negotiate and try to manipulate the Kichi herself. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t tell you that, unless you are willing to make some exchanges with humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of exchanges?\u201d the Kichi asked, seeming curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I must be guaranteed safe passage from this ship back to my own when we depart,\u201d you begin the negotiations. \u201cSecondly, when you return to your home planet, the human race is to be respected as a fellow species in the galaxy. Thirdly, I will need to know your most ticklish spot. Fourthly, I will need to tickle you and be able to tell the human race how ticklish the Kichi are. For this, you will need to return to my ship so we can get proper measurements. With the tickling, we must make sure that no one gets exhausted, so five Earth minutes is the maximum time for a session of tickling. My watch will beep when the tickling should stop. Lastly, you must tickle me on my ship, as to assure me that I will be respected as a fellow species. How does that sound to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we might be able to make this work,\u201d she answers, \u201cbut before we go back to your ship, I will need to be able to tickle you here to finalize the measurements on the ticklishness of humans. I must also be tickled here before we go back to your ship so that I can be guaranteed, as you say, to be \u2018respected as a fellow species\u2019. Following this, we can go to your ship and perform the experiments there. Also, as you said first, I will need to be guaranteed safe passage from your ship back to mine prior to departure so that we can both go free. Finally, the Kichi have advanced in science, and I received an operation that allows me to endure more tickling than normal, so I can stand double the normal tickling. If you want, you can tickle me for ten Earth minutes. Are these conditions agreeable?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Also, do not be concerned about the bondage.

My name is Marilu.\u201d You walk over to Marilu and lie down on the table she stands next to, which is surprisingly comfortable. \u201cPlease raise your hands up a little bit. It will make the tickling much easier.\u201d As you raise your hands above your head, Marilu grabs some wires from equipment nearby you and uses tape to attach them to your arms. \u201cThese will be used to measure your sensitivity.

It only takes a minute for your resistance to fully crumble, and you bring your arms down to try and protect yourself. However, by this time, Marilu is prepared, and she moves her fingers around so that your hands cannot protect you. She tickles all around your sides for one of the minutes, and when you try and defend this, Marilu goes back into the center of your abdomen. As you squirm to try and get away, the Kichi easily manipulates your movements to keep you safe on the table while remaining a very ticklish mess. Marilu reaches your bellybutton at around three minutes in, and you break down even more, squirming even more and laughing harder. \u201cNAHAHAHAHAT THEHEHEHRE!\u201d Your hands dart in to try and protect the sensitive spot, and the Kichi begins wiggling her fingers in there faster, causing you to yell and scream for mercy. \u201cPLEHEHEHEASE! NOHOHOHOHO!\u201d Unfazed by your resistance, Marilu simply pushes your weak hands out of the way as she tickles out to the sides again. She quickly goes lower, and just as she reaches the bottom of your midriff, the Kichi pulls up the top of your spacesuit, revealing your bare belly. With all the newly exposed skin, Marilu uses a new tactic for the last minute of your tickle torture. She bends down and sticks her tongue out, rolling it all around your bellybutton. At the same time, Marilu uses her hands to continue and tickle your sides and the rest of your tummy. This new tickling method leaves you rolling over in laughter, and you are completely unable to protect yourself. \u201cHAHAHA! I CAHAHAN\u2019T TAHAHAHAKE IHIHIT!\u201d Once the minute is finally up, your timer beeps loudly, and the Kichi gives up her tickling effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did very well, human,\u201d Marilu declares as she takes the sensors off you. \u201cThe machine is indicating that your species is at the top of the charts in terms of ticklishness. I am surprised that you were able to stand that much tickling. You are not as weak as I thought you might be. Well, I should keep my promise, so you may tickle me here.

You nod and bend down, reaching your fingers to Marilu\u2019s bare stomach. When they make contact with the Kichi, a stream of giggles immediately escapes her mouth. \u201cHEHEHEHEHE!\u201d Soon enough, however, you upgrade the tickling to a full wiggling on your ticklee\u2019s tummy, searching it for the most ticklish spot. Her sides are not very ticklish, so you go in towards the middle, and her response increases to full laughing. \u201cHAHAHAHA! THAHAHAT TIHIHICKLES!\u201d Enjoying being in control of the tickling, you wiggle your fingers a little harder against Marilu, and she starts to squirm a little bit, although she manages to keep her arms up. You tickle like this until four minutes of the tickle session have passed, and then you decide to test her resolve, and you go into the Kichi\u2019s bellybutton. \u201cNOHOHOHO!\u201d Marilu explodes in laughter, clenching her fists and wiggling from side to side. Observing that this is clearly the Kichi\u2019s most ticklish spot, you decide to give her a taste of her last method of tickling: mouth tickling. You blow a raspberry on Marilu\u2019s navel at five minutes, and her arms shoot right to her head, but she is able to stop them there. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA! AHAHANYHEHEHETHIHIHING EHEHEHELSE!\u201d Noticing the effectiveness of the tickle method, you keep blowing the zerberts on the Kichi. You combine this with your fingers tickling the front of Marilu\u2019s midriff to tickle torture the Kichi for the remainder of the tickle session. Nevertheless, when your timer beeps to show that ten minutes have come, you cease the tickle torment. Marilu continues to laugh for another minute following the tickle session, and then she sits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Marilu has recovered, you change the subject to another question you had. \u201cEarlier, you said that you usually travel from world to world in this ship looking for work,\u201d you announce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is what I usually do,\u201d Marilu confirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of work do you usually get?\u201d you inquire. \u201cI was curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am hired by different companies to tickle people for information,\u201d she discloses. \u201cThe company hires someone to kidnap the person, and the kidnapper brings them to my ship. I tickle them in this room until they divulge what the company wants, and then I turn them over to the company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you tickle interrogate different aliens?\u201d you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Marilu affirms. \u201cIt is a very lucrative job. That\u2019s why there is so much bondage in this room and so many tickle tools here. Different species require different tools and different spots to get them to talk. However, my favorite species to tickle is my own. I always try to get the interrogation job when someone needs something from a Kichi. Most Kichi, like me, are very ticklish on their bellies, so I tie them to that torture frame.\u201d She walks over to a bondage device that would restrain the victim in a Y position. Once she is there, the Kichi pulls several parts of the frame right outside where the ticklee\u2019s stomach would be, and you realize that these can hold different tools. She moves them to position the supposed tickle tools right at the ticklee\u2019s abdomen, and then Marilu presses a button beside the machine, causing the different tickle tool holders to move in random patterns. \u201cAs you can see, I can place tickle tools in the holders and bring them out to touch my ticklee\u2019s tummy. There are about twenty holders here, and all of the feathers and other tools you saw around here are fitted so they can be held in these. When I press the button, all the tools will start to rotate and tickle torture the entire midriff. Then, it is only a matter of time before the ticklee gives me the information that I want to know. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would tickle quite a bit,\u201d you proclaim as you look at the tickle holders moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to try it out for a few minutes?\u201d Marilu offers. \u201cI can stick some feathers and dusters in the holders, and you could get in the machine. I know it would be a break from our original agreement, but I will still make sure you get out and back safely onto your ship. You will get a safe word, and when you say it, I\u2019ll stop the machine. After that, you can choose tools and put me in the machine until I say the safe word. You would have to pull up your suit to expose your midsection to me, though. All of my tickle tools only work on bare skin. Also, I will adjust the restraints so they will fit you. Most Kichi are taller than you, so unless I adjust it, they wouldn\u2019t restrain you. When you are finished, I will put them back for me. What do you think?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Also, please place your feet through the bottom restraint and then your arms through the top holes.\u201d The Kichi sets the tools down while she locks you in the restraints, and then she pulls out the holders and places everything in them.

It will be my turn in the machine once I put the restraints back to normal. While I am doing this, can you get seventeen more feather dusters? I want to be tickled by all dusters.\u201d You comply with her request, setting the dusters down on the table by the machine as the chains are adjusted. Once everything is back to normal, the Kichi removes all of the tickle tools except the three dusters from the holders and replaces them with the new feather dusters. \u201cThat black button tightens and loosens the restraints. When I am in, move all the holders to my stomach, and the red button starts and stops the tickling. My safe word will also be \u2018Prison\u2019. I\u2019ll get into position, and then you can lock me in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Marilu quickly positions her body so the chains will go over her, followed by you pressing the black button and locking her wrists and tail. With a tied up prisoner, you move all of the holders so the feather dusters are touching all over the Kichi\u2019s bare belly. You head back to the edge of the tickle machine and press the red button, initiating the tickle torture. As the feather dusters randomly pick patterns to take over the ticklish tummy, Marilu leans her head back and breaks out in high-pitched laughter. \u201cHAHAHA IHIHIT TIHIHICKLEHEHES! HAHAHAHA!\u201d Your ticklee is soon violently attempting to squirm away from her own interrogation methods, but the restraints secure her in place. Following six minutes, the Kichi begins begging for the tickling to stop. \u201cPLEHEHEHESE! MAHAHAKE IHIHIT STAHAHAP! NOHOHOHO MOHOHORE!\u201d Nevertheless, you do not acknowledge these protests, as she has not uttered the safe word. Finally, at seven minutes and forty-eight seconds, Marilu screams out, \u201cPRHIHIHIHIHIHIHSOHOHON!\u201d Recognizing the safe word though the hysterical laughter, you press the red button again, and the tickle torture stops. You take all of the holders away from the Kichi\u2019s midriff, and then you free her by pressing the black button. \u201cHow long did I last?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeven minutes forty-eight seconds,\u201d you notify her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I lasted a little bit less than you,\u201d she comments. \u201cWell, I guess you did very well then. It usually takes around fifteen minutes for the average Kichi to divulge all of the information that I interrogate them for. Of course, I typically put tools in only half the holders for interrogations, so we did remarkably well, you exceptionally so. Let\u2019s head back to your ship and get finished with the business of the first contact now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, and the two of you cross over into your ship.

You walk over to a table and start to lie down when the Kichi speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I please get a chair over here?\u201d she requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you oblige, retrieving a chair to set by the table. \u201cAnything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more thing,\u201d she responds. \u201cI would like your spacesuit up like in the tickle machine to make this a little easier.\u201d You pull up the suit to show your midsection, and your guest indicates that is all she wants. Since she is now content with the situation, you lie down and hold onto a bar above your head. This is so that you are less likely to try and defend yourself from the tickling. Once you are on the table, Marilu sits in the chair and brings her tail up to the table. \u201cYou can start your timer now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the timer on, and the tip of the tail begins wiggling against your right side. As it tickles a little, you giggle a bit and shift towards your left side, but you still hold on to the bar. \u201cHEHEHE! THAHAT TIHIHICKLEHES!\u201d The tip keeps wriggling for half a minute, and then Marilu moves it above your midriff to your left side. Suddenly, the tickling resumes on your other side, and you travel back towards the Kichi, beginning to laugh. \u201cHEHEHEHE! HAHAHAH!\u201d Her tip tickles this side for the remainder of the first minute of your time, and then it ceases again. Slowly, the tail comes up your ticklish tummy, oscillating between the top and bottom of your stomach as it travels towards your right side to keep you laughing. The tail suddenly stops at the tip enters your bare bellybutton, at which point it twists rapidly inside the cavity. You burst out in hyper-ticklish laughter as you violently squirm to get out of the tickle torture. \u201cNOHOHOHO! HAHAHAHA! STAHAHAHAP! PLEHEHEHESE!\u201d It takes all of your effort to keep your fingers wrapped around the bar above your head as the tip of Marilu\u2019s tail tickle torments your navel. Refusing to escape, you allow the tail tip\u2019s tickle torture to go on for the rest of the time you are obliged to be tickled. When your five minutes are up, the Kichi removes her tail from your bare belly, and you get up after recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, where can I get the equipment to measure ticklishness?\u201d you ask your computer.

You retrieve some tape from a drawer by the table and secure her wrists to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your ticklee is bound, Erin speaks up again. \u201cWould you like me to conduct the tickle test?\u201d she questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do that?\u201d you wonder in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Erin responds. \u201cThat is a tickle table, after all. As well as the ticklishness measuring equipment, I have plenty of tickling devices available there to conduct tests. A measurement can be taken with just the subject in the room; no other people are needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Marilu, who seems unopposed to Erin doing the test, so you state, \u201cYes, Erin, you can do the test. Tickle her bare belly for ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, sir,\u201d the computer confirms. With that, another strap goes across the ticklee\u2019s tail, making it so she cannot move side to side anymore. Four hands come out from the side of the table and travel straight to the Kichi\u2019s midriff, beginning to tickle all over it. \u201cKitchy Kitchy Koo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile two of the four hands tickle her bare sides, the other two are occupied with wiggling over the front of Marilu\u2019s ticklish tummy, and the reaction is instant. \u201cHAHAHA NOHOHO! IHIHIT TIHIHICKLEHES TOHOHOHOHO MUHUHUHUCH!\u201d she cries out in hysterical laughter as she fails to escape the tickling. After two minutes, a two-fingered hand emerges from the right side and travels straight into the Kichi\u2019s long bellybutton. Both of the fingers fit in comfortably, and they start sliding back and forth, covering the full length of the most ticklish spot. Unable to do anything, Marilu\u2019s laughter and pleas increase a couple of octaves. \u201cPLEHEHEASE! NAHAHAHAHAT THAHAHAHAT! STAHAHAHAP! IHIHIHIHILL DOHOHOHOHOHO AHAHANYTHIHIHING!\u201d You sit back in the chair that you had brought over, enjoying seeing the Kichi go through the computer tickle test. After nine minutes, though, the tickling slows down and stops on time. All of the hands retract back to their original positions, but the ticklee is still laughing from the aftereffects of the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marilu\u2019s laughter dies down, you ask Erin, \u201cWhat was her ticklishness? I\u2019m also going to need some context on the measurement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Kichi had a measurement of 88760 guwaks,\u201d Erin announces. \u201cThe guwak scale goes from one to one hundred thousand guwaks, with one being not very ticklish and ten thousand being the most ticklish possible. One guwak means that you will burn one calorie in a week of tickling. I also measured your ticklishness, and you were at 95000 guwaks on your stomach. Both of you are very ticklish there, if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, you look back at Marilu, who is still bound, and think about how ticklish she is. It wouldn\u2019t really be breaking the promise if you kept her in there a little longer and tickled her a little more after giving her a break, would it? Then again, maybe you should let her go right away. You eventually decide to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, you lower your mouth and blow a raspberry on Marilu\u2019s bellybutton, and her laughter spikes to hysterical. \u201cNOHOHOHOT THEHEHERE!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou tickled me pretty good there,\u201d Marilu proclaims. \u201cIn fact, I know some Kichi that would really enjoy being tickled like that. One of the companies I frequently contract jobs with has two executives that really like my tickle interrogation work. They said that if I get a partner who can tickle as well as I do, they would pay me and the other tickler a large sum to take them onto my ship, tie them up, and tickle their bare bellies. While I do not know how long they want to be tickled, they did say they were willing to have it go on for a while. I could lend you some of my tickle tools if you want to use them in tickle torturing these executives, and you would make quite a bit of money. However, there was one more part of the agreement. The executives said that they were very ticklish, and they wanted to be able to get their revenge after we were finished tickling them. For this, they desired to tickle our bare bellies for five minutes, although they expressed no desire to restrain us. All they requested for their revenge was that my fellow tickler and I have nothing covering our stomachs and that they have access to any tools we have on board. They also informed me that we would be tickling them longer than they tickled us. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have a few questions,\u201d you respond. \u201cFirst of all, where are these executives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are on the Kichi colony Feather Jewels,\u201d Marilu notifies you. \u201cIt is a few light years from here, but we can get there in a matter of minutes. The colony is inhabited by around one hundred thousand Kichi citizens, as well as their tickle slaves. For our stay, we will be going to the capital city, Feather Prime, where most of the businesses are centered. Feather Jewel is a center of commerce in Kichi lands, so it holds many businesses and executes, and I know it very well. Most of the business I get requires me to come there to pick up ticklees. Specifically, the tickling industry is very prevalent on Feather Jewels, and this translates to everyday life for the citizens there. For instance, there are laws on the colony that prevent anyone from wearing any more than what I have on, except in special circumstances. This is to create more opportunities for tickling by exposing all tickle spots, which can be tickled by anyone at any time. If you were to step foot on the colony, you would probably have to remove your suit and shoes, as they cover up various tickle spots, but you would be able to keep on your helmet. This is because no Kichi would want you to not be able to breathe, and it is clear that the helmet keeps you alive. In addition, there is a law that all who are on the planet, even for a short time, shall undergo a basic tickle test to map out their tickle sensitivity. The most ticklish spot on everyone is marked by a special pen carried by the customs guards. When one leaves the planet, the customs guards give a ticklish washing that removes the pen marks on their tickle spot. Those are probably the major laws on Feather Jewels that will concern our stay there, and there is one more thing I should tell you before you ask further questions. The planet is called Feather Jewels for a reason: there are feathers everywhere, and they are treated as precious jewels. As you walk around, it is not uncommon to see all sorts of people getting tickled with feathers, and you will surely get tickled with at least a feather or two during your stay. The most common tickle spots are midriffs and armpits, though sometimes an unlucky Kichi will be pinned and have their tail tickled. Often, ticklings only last a few minutes or so unless they are to tickle slaves; it is against the law to tickle a free person for more than five minutes without written permission. Police monitor the streets very thoroughly, although they will pick up feathers and tickle people too. Additionally, it is against the law to restrain a free person while tickling them, but not to pin them down. I will make sure that you are not tickled too much as we go through the colony. Do you have any more questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, why is there such a focus on tickle slaves?\u201d you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the Kichi enjoy tickling in all forms,\u201d Marilu dictates, \u201cand some like being tickled more, while others like tickling others more. In addition to this, the Kichi are very mercantile, so we are always looking for ways to make money off our passions. Tickling is a common enjoyment among different species, not just the Kichi, so some Kichi buy and sell tickle slaves of all races. Unfortunately, the tickle slave industry has advanced so that people are sometimes kidnapped off the street and sold as tickle slaves, but I will not let that happen to you. We will get a security escort to protect us; however, they will also likely give us a taste of the spirit of Feather Jewels and tickle us some on our journey. Getting back to the topic of tickle slavery, I would not be surprised if some of the aliens that I tickle interrogated were sold as tickle slaves after I tickled the information out of them. The Kichi have legalized voluntary tickle slavery in their lands, which means that someone can volunteer to be a tickle slave, and they have also legalized selling traitors as tickle slaves. The second provision allows some companies to make former employees tickle slaves if it is proven that they committed corporate espionage or sold company secrets. Still, it is not legal to force someone into tickle slavery if they have done nothing wrong and have not volunteered. The volunteer clause requires the new tickle slave to sign forms that state how long they will be a tickle slave and their willingness to become a tickle slave in front of an official judge to make sure that they are not being forced into it. All in all, I guess that is what you should know about tickle slaves, and I want to reassure you that I will get us protection to make sure that we stay free. Are there any more questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would happen with my ship?\u201d you wonder. \u201cYou said that you were getting us both security, so I figure that we have to go in together. Would we need to both be in on one ship or could we land two ships in the same place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of the landing ports are large enough that two ships can fit, so we could both travel on our separate ships,\u201d the Kichi announces. \u201cI will inform them that we are together, and they will direct so to an appropriate port. Any more questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne last one,\u201d you answer. \u201cAt the beginning, you said that the executives offered you a chance to tickle them if you got a partner. Was you asking me if I wanted to do this a job offer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Marilu confirms. \u201cIf you want, we can become partners and tickle interrogate suspects together. We could do it on either of our ships or even use both of them for different interrogations. I think I gave you a brief description earlier, but in a job, someone brings the suspect to the ship, we tie them up, and then we tickle them until they give in. After that, we give them and the information to the company who hired us and get our reward. With two ticklers, we stand to make a lot of money and get more job offers. So, what do you say? Do you want to be my fellow tickle interrogator?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Now that we are partners, we must engage in the Kichi ceremony for becoming tickle partners. We both have to tickle the other partner\u2019s stomach with our tail, or in your case feet, until they say mercy. While the tickling is conducted, the ticklee will be tied vertically, and the tickler will sit in a chair in front of them. The ceremony is conducted to show the other tickler how effective their partner will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should probably head back to your ship, then,\u201d you announce. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have any vertical restraints here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s head there,\u201d your new partner declares, and you both walk back to the Kichi ship. When you get on, you head to the experiment room. \u201cEarlier I told you that this was an experiment room, and I do use it for experiments sometimes. However, now that you know about my work, you should know the official name for this room. It is my ship\u2019s tickle interrogation room, where the vast majority of ticklees are tied tightly with no chance of escape until they give me what I want. Here is a place where we can do the ceremony.\u201d She gestures to a wall with chains for restraining arms above one\u2019s head. In addition to this, there is a chair right in front of the wall, which could allow the tickler to sit down and reach their feet to the ticklee\u2019s midriff. \u201cSo, would you like to start as the tickler or ticklee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can tickle me first,\u201d you offer, removing the top half of your spacesuit and raising your arms to the chains. Marilu locks you in, and then she sits down in the chair. Slowly at first, her tail begins to slide up the bottom of your spacesuit towards your tickle spot. It soon reaches your bare belly, and then it goes straight to your vulnerable bellybutton. All at once, the tail begins wiggling inside the hole, and you break out in laughter, \u201cHAHAHAHAHAH! THAHAHAHAT REHEHEHELLEHEHE TIHIHICKLEHEHES!\u201d Smiling, Marilu continues to move the tail back and forth inside your navel, causing you to squirm a little bit to try and get away. You take the tickle torture for what seems like forever, and then you finally yell, \u201cMEHEHEHERCEHE!\u201d By the time you give in, the Kichi\u2019s tail is dancing back and forth at top speed, and you are thrashing around in the chains, vehemently trying to get out. Your partner\u2019s tail comes to a sudden halt, sneaking outside of your tummy button and retreating back towards the ground. When you recover from the tickle torture, you wonder, \u201cSo, how long could I stand your tail tickles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lasted for eleven minutes and twenty-eight seconds,\u201d Marilu notifies you as she unlocks the chains on you. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good time for such a ticklish species. I guess it\u2019s my turn now.\u201d Your hands are now free from the restraints, and you turn around and lock up the Kichi. Once you are seated in the chair with your spacesuit back on, you lean back and bring your feet up, resting them on her exposed abdomen. Your toes begin to wriggle on your partner\u2019s ticklish tummy, and she immediately reacts. \u201cAHAHAHAHA! YOHOHORE NAHAHAT TOHOHO BAHAHAHAD!\u201d Soon after you start tickling, you realize that Marilu\u2019s bare bellybutton can hold two of your toes, and you take advantage of this, sending the torment to her most sensitive spot. \u201cHAHAHAHA! YOHOHOHORE EHEHEHEVIHIHIL!\u201d The Kichi\u2019s laughter jumps an octave when you go inside the comparably large hole, and she begins to struggle against the chains. Looking to force her to give in quickly, your toes pick up speed, and her laughter keeps on increasing. Following a long time of tickling, she finally gives in and screams, \u201cMEHEHEHEHERCEHEHEHE!\u201d You stop wiggling your toes and move them back to the ground. As she gets her breath back, you release your partner, and then she inquires, \u201cSo, how long did I last?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got through ten minutes and fifty-five seconds,\u201d you state. \u201cThat seems like a pretty good time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Marilu confirms. \u201cNow I guess we should head to get the executives. Would you like to go to Feather Jewels on my ship or your own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to go on my ship,\u201d you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give your computer the coordinates,\u201d your partner proclaims. \u201cWhen we get close, I will direct you to the correct landing port.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you reply, and you head back to your own ship. By the time you get back, Erin has received the coordinates from Marilu\u2019s ship, and the two of you disengage from each other. Both vessels take off towards Feather Jewels, and you get to the outskirts of the planet within minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, your communications screen fills with the head of a Kichi, but not Marilu. \u201cHello,\u201d the Kichi broadcasts. \u201cThe ship before you, who identified herself as one Marilu, said that you two were together, and I want to make sure that her information is correct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d you affirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I will give you the same landing coordinates I gave her,\u201d the Kichi responds, and soon enough, Erin has the coordinates. \u201cI have one more thing that I would like to tell you because you are a human, and as far as I know, humans have never been to Feather Jewels before. On our planet, we have a law that prohibits you from wearing a full spacesuit. You should take the spacesuit itself off, but not your underwear, once you reach the planet\u2019s surface. You can also keep your helmet on so you can breathe. Thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did already know that, but thank you for making sure,\u201d you announce. Erin brings you down safely next to Marilu\u2019s ship, and you remove your spacesuit, leaving all of your tickle spots vulnerable. Once you have the proper amount of clothing on, you exit your spacecraft and walk to Marilu, who is waiting for you near a building. Four Kichi soon come out of the building and head towards you. \u201cWho are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are the customs agents,\u201d your partner informs you. \u201cThey will give us a choice between allowing them to conduct a tickle test on us or telling them our most ticklish spot. When they know our tickle spot, they will mark it, and then we can find the executives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four Kichi soon arrive at your position, and one of them declares, \u201cWelcome to Feather -Jewels! By law, we are obliged to mark the most ticklish spot on your bodies. We can find it out one of two ways, and you can both choose different ways or the same one. The first option is conducting a tickle test on you, where we will tickle you all over and then mark your tickle spot. Your other option is to just tell us your most ticklish spot, at which point we will tickle you there to confirm its sensitivity. Once your tickle spot has been marked, you are free to go wherever you would like, and when you leave, we will clean the mark off your body for you. So, which option would you like to pick?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The two of you will be able to explore Feather Jewels without much delay.\u201d The Kichi leads you inside the building to a room with a few tables in it. \u201cOur human guest can lie on the closest table, and the Kichi can lie on the second closest table.\u201d Marilu and you lie down, and the head Kichi continues, \u201cSo, what is your most ticklish spot, human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy stomach,\u201d you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTickle him,\u201d the Kichi orders one of her fellow agents near you. \u201cAnd your most ticklish spot, our fellow Kichi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy stomach as well,\u201d your partner repeats your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTickle her,\u201d the head Kichi orders a different agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can do anything else, you feel your hands being pulled over your head, and then fingers suddenly dance on your midriff. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you burst out laughing as you are tickled. The female customs agent runs her fingers all over your bare belly, hitting all of your sensitive spots and causing you to struggle. After a couple minutes, the tickling ceases, and the agent leaves to get a pen. You glance over at Marilu, who has endured the same treatment as you, and see that she is exhausted from all the tickling she has gone through today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like you both were right,\u201d the head Kichi proclaims. \u201cYour tummies are certainly the most ticklish spots on your bodies. Now we will just mark that with our special pens, and then you can be on your way.\u201d The agent returns, and she draws a red line on your stomach with her pen, causing you to squeal a little bit. Once you have been marked, your hands are released, and you get up. \u201cHave fun in Feather Jewels!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarilu guides you out into the lobby, and she quickly calls over a different customs agent. \u201cHello,\u201d she states. \u201cWe were looking for some security to go with us while we travel. We are heading to Navel Enterprises on business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Kichi responds. \u201cI\u2019ll call a team for you, but I do need your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarilu,\u201d your partner reveals. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d the Kichi instructs. You follow her to a desk, and she picks up a phone. \u201cYes, I was looking for a security team to escort two to Navel Enterprises. One is a Kichi, and the other is a human. The name is Marilu. Thank you! I\u2019ll send them there.\u201d She hangs up and turns to you. \u201cYour security detail will meet you in the lobby in five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Marilu states. She leads you to a couch, and the two of you sit down. Before long, your partner tells you to get up, and the two of you go to four Kichi with red lines across their abdomens, one of whom is holding up a sign with strange writing. \u201cI am Marilu. Are you our security detail?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d the Kichi holding the sign confirms. \u201cYou wanted to go to Navel Enterprises?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Marilu affirms. \u201cOnce we get there, I will pay you, and we will be fine. Shall we go?\u201d The security nods, and the six of you head out onto the streets of Feather Jewels. On the way, you observe the people of the planet, and it is not long before you see some Kichi being tickled with feathers. You keep walking, but you are soon interrupted when you feel a feathery sensation across your own midriff. Laughing, you look down to see one of the guards tickling you with a feather. Your partner is also being tickled by a security guard with a feather, and both of you give them a good laugh for the minute that they tickle you. After this tickling, you keep a close eye on your tickle spot until you see a feather lying on the ground, and you decide to get revenge. You pick up the feather and slide it up an unsuspecting security guard\u2019s side, and she begins giggling. Enjoying being the tickler again, you move the feather across the entire ticklish tummy of the guard, tickling her for a full two minutes. You find out while tickling her that she is most sensitive in her navel, and you begin to wonder if this is a common trait in Kichi. Following about fifteen minutes, you reach a large building. \u201cHere we are. Thank you for your services.\u201d Your partner gives some money to the security guard, and they depart, letting you walk into the business. \u201cThis is the building that holds the executive offices of Navel Enterprises. I interrogate people for them on a very regular basis, and they are my best contractors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk up to a receptionist, who broadcasts, \u201cHello, and how may I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking for Reclos and Nolujo,\u201d Marilu notifies her. \u201cI am Marilu, and both of us need to see them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will give them a call and see if they are available,\u201d the receptionist responds. She makes a quick call before turning back to you. \u201cThey are on Floor 53, and they are expecting you and the human. The elevator is to your left. There will be a receptionist on near the elevator to direct you to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Marilu states, and the two of you go to the elevator. Once you are in, she presses the correct button, and before long, you are at the 53rd Floor. The door opens, and you both head out to see a new receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you the ones looking for Reclos and Nolujo?\u201d the receptionist questions, to which your partner nods. \u201cThey are in the first room on the left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Marilu repeats the polite phrase. The two of you go to the room, where two Kichi are sitting in chairs. As you look over them, you notice that both of the executives have a red stripe on their bellies. The gesture you to the two empty chairs in the room. \u201cNice to see you again, Reclos and Nolujo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs it is to see you,\u201d one of the Kichi, whom you later learn is Reclos, agrees. \u201cSo, is this about our offer if you got a partner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Marilu confirms. \u201cYou said that my partner and I could tickle you aboard my ship, and this human is my partner. I am sure you will be very satisfied with his tickling skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to see a small demonstration,\u201d Nolujo declares. \u201cCould you tickle Marilu\u2019s midsection for thirty seconds, human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d you reply. You walk over to your partner and reach down to her abdomen, wiggling your fingers. Once you begin touching her, Marilu breaks out in laughter and begins squirming. You tickle all over her tickle spot in the thirty seconds provided, showing your skill at the art. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may stop now,\u201d Reclos dictates after thirty seconds, and you immediately cease. \u201cYou have proven yourself worthy to become Marilu\u2019s partner. Now we shall head to Marilu\u2019s ship in\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Let us go.\u201d The four of you get up and walk over to the receptionist. \u201cPlease have a limousine for the customs building meet us at the bottom floor; we will be out for at least a few hours.\u201d The receptionist nods, and the four of you get in an elevator. When you reach the bottom floor, you walk outside and see a limousine waiting. \u201cYou two can sit on the seats on the left side; Nolujo and I will take the right side seats.\u201d The four of you get into the limo on the left side, with Reclos and Nolujo closer to the driver. \u201cPlease take us to customs, and take the long route out with special treatment. We will be leaving the planet.\u201d As the limousine begins to move, you and Marilu feel your hands being grabbed and pulled to the ceiling, where they are secured. \u201cOn our way to the ship, we have a few questions for the human. These are questions that we always asked potential employees so we can learn about you and your species. However, our version has a twist. If you give us an acceptable answer, we will tickle Marilu with our tails. If you do not, our tails will tickle you. We will be tickling your bellybuttons because our company is named Navel Enterprises. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you affirm, hoping that they do not ask embarrassing questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Nolujo states as the two executives move their tails up in the seat between Marilu and you. \u201cFirst off, when you and Marilu became partners, did you do the tail tickling ceremony?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we did,\u201d you confirm. \u201cI gave in after almost eleven and a half minutes, and Marilu lasted for just under eleven minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Nolujo responds. The tails slither over to Marilu and enter her navel, and soon your partner breaks out in laughter. For five minutes, the tails wiggle inside her tummy button, and then they suddenly stop and return to the seat. \u201cNext question. Do you have any experience in tickle interrogation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot any professional experience,\u201d you answer. \u201cI came into space as a human scout, and I chose to establish peaceful relations with the Kichi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe appreciate your honesty, but that wasn\u2019t the answer we were looking for,\u201d Reclos informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tails slide over to you, and you immediately begin to try to break free. Suddenly, both of them creep into your bellybutton, and they begin to wriggle around, making you burst out in laughter. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA! NOHOHOHOHO!\u201d The appendages frequently touch each other as they dance around in your innie navel, and you laugh hysterically, begging for mercy. Nevertheless, after five minutes, the tails cease the tickle torture and go back to their resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore we go on to the next question, I would like you to know that because of your experience, we would have tickled you no matter what answer you gave,\u201d Reclos announces as you pant. \u201cIf you had said that you had experience, we would have tickled you for lying. You got tickled now because we prefer to hire interrogators with experience. However, that will not stop us from hiring you, as Marilu has plenty of experience and I think you will pick up quickly. Now that you have caught your breath, I think we should go on. These questions will have a thirty-second tickling. What does the human race breathe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe breathe oxygen,\u201d you reply. \u201cThat is what this helmet is giving me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nolujo declares. The tails move over to your partner and tickle her tummy button for thirty seconds. \u201cNext question. What is the average height and weight of a human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAround 1.65 meters tall,\u201d you respond, \u201cand 69 kilograms in weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Reclos says. The tails immediately begin to tickle your partner again, but they quickly stop. \u201cThe average Kichi weights 60 kilograms and is 2 meters tall. How is the human planet, Earth, governed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Earth is divided into six hundred sectors that all fall under one central government,\u201d you answer. \u201cThe government is divided into three branches. The legislative branch has two houses, one representing population of the sectors and the other treating all sectors equally. In this, the members pass laws and send them to the executive branch. The executive branch has a leader called the President, who has limited power over which laws pass and which do not. In order to become the President, he or she must win a majority of the electoral votes. Each sector has the same number of votes as representatives in the legislative branch. The winner of each sector takes all of the electoral votes. In addition to the President, there are different administrative and enforcement bureaucracies that apply the laws that pass. Lastly, there is the judicial branch, which deals with challenges to both sector and federal law. The members of this branch are appointed by the President with approval of the equality-based house of the legislative branch. Over all of the branches of government is the Constitution, which says how the government is to be run and what government can and cannot do. I can tell you more if you want, but that is the basic overview.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nolujo affirms before the tails make a dash for Marilu. Your partner\u2019s bellybutton is tickled for another thirty seconds, and then the tails sit down on the seat. At this point\u2026</span></div></div>",

Once the fare is paid, the four of you exit the limousine and head into the customs building. You all walk to a receptionist, and Nolujo speaks up. \u201cThe four of us are going to leave the planet. The ship we will be taking is parked in Docking Bay 18.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease wait for agents to come,\u201d the receptionist replies. \u201cThey will remove the ticklish spot markings from you and then take you to your ship.\u201d Nolujo nods, and you wait by the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, eight official Kichi come to the desk. \u201cPlease come with us,\u201d one of the agents proclaims. \u201cWe will be assisting you with taking the markings off.\u201d You all walk with the agents to a room similar to the one you were tickled in earlier. \u201cPlease choose a table and lie down on it, arms up above your heads.\u201d From closest to furthest from the door, the tables are picked as follows: you, Reclos, Marilu, and Nolujo. Once you are on the table, you raise your arms up, and then restrains hold onto your arms and legs. Two Kichi agents leave the room and return thirty seconds later with two buckets, which they set between you and Reclos and Marilu and Nolujo. \u201cWe are going to scrub the markings off of your abdomens. We have to be very thorough in the removal, so this might take a little bit of your time. Let\u2019s get started.\u201d The customs agents position themselves so that there is one on each side of the travelers. Once they are ready, each agent by the buckets pulls two scrub brushes out of the buckets, handing one to their partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch as the agents by you reach down and touch the brushes to your bare belly, and then the \u2018cleaning\u2019 begins. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you exclaim as the brushes are scribbled around your tickle spot, echoed by everyone else being tickled. You squirm around to try to avoid the tickles, but the Kichi agents attack you ruthlessly, pressing the brush in to limit your movement. As your sensitive stomach is tortured, you can only laugh and scream for mercy. \u201cPLEHEHEHEHESE STAHAHAP! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d The brushes scrub all around your midriff, on occasion stopping for a short period as it is put back in the bucket to get new water. Even when a brush is taken off to refill the water, the other brush is still tickling you, and you are in a constant state of tickle torture. This torment continues for fifteen minutes, and then the brushes cease. Right after the tickling ends, your chains come loose, and you sit up to watch the others continue to get their tummies tickled. You notice that Reclos is squirming around the most, while Marilu is controlling herself the best. Finally, following another fifteen minutes, all of the tickling on the Kichi concludes, and they are let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait here for a minute,\u201d the head customs agent declares as four of the agents depart for an unknown reason. A minute later, the agents return with eight large feathers in their hands. \u201cThis is the first time we have had a human on Feather Jewels, and we would like to give his whole party a gift. There are two options for you to pick from. You can either tickle our bare bellies with these feathers for five minutes, or you can let us tickle you for five more minutes with the feathers.

The four of you all get two feathers each, and then the Kichi customs agents lie down on the tables, two to a table. \u201cYou may tickle our midsections with the feathers now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou easily lift the feathers up and bring them over to the two Kichi lying on the table you were on earlier. Lowering the feathers to their stomachs, you begin swiping them back and forth, causing the Kichi to start laughing. You alternate between wide and short strokes to try and find the most sensitive spot on your ticklees as they squirm around from the tickling. Like the other Kichi that you have encountered, the agents appear to be most ticklish on their navels, so you slide the feathers in and wiggle them around. The ticklish customs agents bring their arms down to try and block the feathers, but you manage to keep the tools in the large bellybuttons. For the rest of the five minutes, you torment your ticklees, doing your best to make them pay for giving you a harsh tickling. At the end of the tickle time, you lift the feathers off of the bare bellies, and the customs agents get up from the tables. One of the agents collects the feathers from everyone, and the head agent instructs you to follow her out to your ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get out to the ships, Reclos joins you in the Swift Feather while Marilu and Nolujo opt for the Kichi vessel. You get your spacesuit back on, and then your partner calls you over the communications system. \u201cHuman, I am sending you coordinates for space to meet up at,\u201d Marilu informs you. \u201cWe will see you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot them,\u201d you respond before you temporarily cut off communication with her. \u201cReclos, you can sit on the couch right over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the executive replies as she sits down on the couch in the living room, still close enough that you can speak. \u201cSo, is the rest of your body as ticklish as your navel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answer. \u201cThat\u2019s my most ticklish spot. I have a question about the Kichi. Do all Kichi have their tummy as their most ticklish spot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe vast majority do,\u201d Reclos reveals. \u201cA few have more ticklish tails or armpits, but the midriff, which is always bared on a Kichi, is almost the universal tickle spot for my species. In fact, the most severe sentence a criminal can receive is life in the tickle dungeons with belly tickling. This means that they spend the rest of their life in the tickle dungeons, with their stomach being tickled sunrise to sunset. Of course, there are breaks so they can be fed, but it is still torture for the ticklees. Why do humans cover their ticklish spots with their clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe lived in some very cold areas where it was beneficial to cover ourselves up, and it became a tradition,\u201d you explain the presence of your spacesuit the best you could. \u201cSince I have never been a tickle interrogator before, I was wondering what kind of jobs I could expect to receive from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe typically will send Marilu and now you former employees who have been hired by a rival company,\u201d Reclos declares. \u201cSince you appear to be very capable, you will get the highest-ranking employees with the most knowledge about our operations. We only occasionally go after the lower-ranking employees, as they usually do not know company secrets. The good news for you is that the higher the former employee was, the more you will get paid for interrogating them. Because of this and the fact that you will be getting the highest-ranked departures, you will be bringing in quite a lot of money, up to forty-five million chiiks per interrogation.\u201d Erin quickly translates this into $5.9 billion. \u201cI have another question for you. Where is your favorite place to tickle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to stick with the abdomen,\u201d you decide. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty fun to tickle a ticklee there, and it\u2019s really easy to bare. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will find out later,\u201d Reclos dictates. \u201cI have noticed that you do not appear to have had much experience with tickling before you encountered Marilu. Do humans not tickle each other often?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, humans do not tickle frequently,\u201d you admit. \u201cOur clothes are one of the reasons that we do not tickle as often as different species do. Without exposed tickle spots, we do not have the access that you do to each other to tickle them. On occasion, we will bare our tickle spots, such as if we go to a warm place, and more tickling occurs then, but it is still not big. I have certainly enjoyed participating in all the tickling that goes on with the Kichi, though. What does Navel Enterprises sell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe develop and sell tickle machines that focus on the navel,\u201d Reclos broadcasts. \u201cSince humans do not tickle as much, you would probably like to see our micro-sized tickling machines. They are often flown into the bellybutton, and the ticklee does not notice them until the machine is activated. These machines actually tickle the nerves themselves, stimulating the tickle sensors to make it appear as if different tickle tools are tickling the navel. Since the ticklee cannot see, much less remove, the machine, it is pure torture for them. We only sell the micro-sized machines to the government for tickle dungeon use. The vast majority of our revenue comes from self-tickling machines and the remotes for them, which consumers buy to use on themselves or friends. The machine comes in many different sizes, all visible to the eye, and the median size is about the size of your bellybutton. Of course, there are many that are smaller than that, and also some that are larger. You place these directly inside the ticklee\u2019s navel and then press a button on your remote to control the intensity of tickling. Along with tickling themselves, which is the main application for this, consumers have found this optimal for tickling between friends and punishing the person who fell asleep first at a sleepover. This type of tickle machine comes in many different forms, each one utilizing a different tool on the ticklee. I think that is a good overview of what we do at Navel Enterprises. I have one last question for you. Where is your favorite spot to be tickled?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably my tummy,\u201d you disclose. \u201cIt can get pretty torturous if it gets tickled too long, but I still enjoy it the most. Actually, having it tickled for a short time is pretty fun.\u201d At this time, you feel the ship\u2019s warp drive turning off, and you realize that you are almost to the meeting point. \u201cI think we\u2019re close to where Marilu wanted to meet.\u201d The Swift Feather drifts to the meeting point, where you see Marilu\u2019s ship and\u2026</span></div></div>",

Once Erin linked up the ships again, you followed Reclos onto the Kichi vessel. \u201cYou are going to need to go through the disinfection process, human and Reclos,\u201d Marilu\u2019s voice came inside the airlock. \u201cWe can never be too careful with space germs. For your information, I also made Nolujo go through this before she entered my ship. Remove your shoes and spacesuit, human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds of you obeying the orders, metal hands come out and grab the Kichi and you. The full complement of brushes appears from all over the airlock, heading towards the two of you. This time, two brushes go to your bare belly, while one takes each of your armpits and each of your feet. When they reach you, the brushes begin whirling over your tickle spots, causing Reclos to break out in laughter. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you scream out as you are tickled. Determined to outlast the executive, you refuse to beg as you are tickle tortured. Reclos gives in within a minute, pleading for Marilu to take the brushes off her. Hearing your fellow ticklee begin to beg, you hold steadfast and try to stay strong through the whole tickling experience. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d The brushes on your ticklish tummy focus in on your navel, causing your laughter to spike; however, it does not take away your strength. Following five minutes of tickling, you feel the brushes slow down, and then they cease. Reclos and you are dumped to the ground, and you quickly recover and get up. After putting your spacesuit back on, you head over to the executive, still lying on the ground. You reach down and start tickling her stomach, and she immediately curls up into a defensive position, so you stop. \u201cGet up. We\u2019ve got to go into the ship.\u201d You help her up, and the two of you head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the airlock, you immediately spot Marilu and Nolujo. \u201cWe\u2019re heading to the interrogation room,\u201d Marilu notifies the two of you. \u201cYou two can follow Nolujo and me.\u201d The four of you walk to the interrogation room, with you following Nolujo and Reclos behind Marilu. While it is tempting to tickle all the bare skin that the executive is showing, you manage to refrain from an early tickle torture. You quickly reach the interrogation room, and you all sit down, Reclos with Nolujo and you with Marilu. \u201cSo, you gave me a vague description of what you were going to pay us to do. Can you elaborate more now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Nolujo answers. \u201cWe want the two of you to tie and tickle interrogate us on our bare bellies. As Marilu probably knows, tickle interrogators are being used more to get company intelligence from rival companies, even if the employees have not switched sides. We want you to tickle us until we give you a safe word, which would signify the information that the rival wants in a real tickle interrogation. We are trying to practice being tickle interrogated so that we are prepared if it happens for real. If the interrogation takes less than thirty minutes, you are to continue tickling us until thirty minutes have passed. Once the interrogation is done, we would like to tickle your bare bellies for five minutes. You do not have to be restrained, but we do want to have access to all the tools that you use on us. Are those terms agreeable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Marilu confirms as you nod your head. \u201cWe will restrain the two of you on these tables. Reclos\u2019s safe word will be \u2018Jewels\u2019, and Nolujo\u2019s safe word will be \u2018Snake\u2019.\u201d Your partner quickly binds the two Kichi executives down to the tables, stretching out their bodies to make them more ticklish. Once the executives are helpless, Marilu goes to a closet and picks out several things from there. She brings them over to you to observe. As you look over the tools, you see that she has brought over several feathers, as well as a few dusters, feather drills, electric toothbrushes, brushes, and some machines that you do not recognize. \u201cWho would you like to tickle, human?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You pick out several feathers, a couple feather dusters, a feather drill, and some electric toothbrushes and head over to the executive, while Marilu takes several feathers, a few of the machines, a feather drill, and a feather duster and takes a seat next to Reclos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you start, I need to teach you how to properly tickle interrogate a victim,\u201d Marilu proclaims. \u201cFirst off, a tickle interrogator restrains their victim. After that, the tickler teases the ticklee.\u201d Your partner takes out a single feather and lightly flicks it over Reclos\u2019s bellybutton, causing her to flinch. \u201cTicklish? Good. I love ticklish bellybuttons. I\u2019m going to get really acquainted with your navel during your time here. Where else are you ticklish? How about your sides?\u201d A feather is flicked over each of the executive\u2019s sides, and she lets out a little \u2018Eep\u2019. \u201cI heard that giggle. Your sides are ticklish. Why, I bet that whole tummy of yours is ticklish, isn\u2019t it? Should we test that? I think we should.\u201d She picks up a feather duster and swipes it across Reclos\u2019s midriff, and the executive begins laughing. \u201cWow! A really ticklish tummy. We\u2019ll have to spend a lot of time here.\u201d At this, Marilu gives you a nod, and you start teasing Nolujo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear you\u2019re ticklish,\u201d you declare to Nolujo. \u201cIs that true?\u201d The tied up Kichi doesn\u2019t respond, so you continue, \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll just have to find out. Is your bellybutton ticklish?\u201d Just like Marilu, you take out a feather and quickly run it in and out of the navel. Nolujo gives you a giggle in response, failing to contain her reaction. \u201cYou\u2019re ticklish there. That means that this is going to be fun. Let\u2019s see where else you\u2019re ticklish. If your bellybutton is ticklish, I bet the front of your stomach is just as sensitive. I can hear it calling me to tickle it, with you leaving it exposed and all.\u201d You press a feather duster down to her abdomen and pull it across, and while Nolujo tries to restrain herself, she gives in and laughs. \u201cYou can\u2019t resist laughing for the tickler, ticklish Kichi. You\u2019re going to get tickled all over that bare belly, but I still have one more place to cover my bases. Are those sides of yours ticklish? I bet they are.\u201d You set the duster down and pick up two feathers, flicking them up Nolujo\u2019s bare sides. The executive lets out some giggles as the feathers make their way towards her ribs, showing you that her sides are sensitive. \u201cYou\u2019re also ticklish here. This sounds like the perfect package for your tickle torture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Marilu after giving Nolujo a steady dose of teasing, and she broadcasts, \u201cOnce a subject has been sufficiently teased, they will often be more ticklish. This is the perfect time to tickle interrogate them. Make her say \u2018Snake\u2019!\u201d Your partner picks up a feather duster and swipes it across Reclos\u2019s midsection, and the executive begins to laugh. \u201cSay the safe word or I will just keep tickling you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOHOHOHO!\u201d Reclos laughs as her tickle interrogation commences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to say the safe word?\u201d you give Nolujo one last chance before you interrogate her. She shakes her head defiantly, and you lower your fingers to her midriff, wiggling them against her skin. \u201cTickle, tickle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Nolujo gives in to the ticklish feelings. You spread your fingers across the bare belly, tickling all over her sides before moving in. Testing out the entire tummy, you find that like nearly all the other Kichi, her navel is the most ticklish spot here. \u201cNOHOHOHOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHERE!\u201d Two of your fingers fit into the hole, and you use them effectively, making sure that they hit everywhere in the divot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to give in yet?\u201d you press the executive as you torture her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNEHEHEHEHEHEVER!\u201d she refuses. \u201cIHIHIHIHILL NEHEHEHEVER GIHIHIHVEHEHE YUHUHUHU WHAHAHAT YUHUHUHUHUHU WAHAHAHAHANT!\u201d A few minutes in, you realize that your fingers, while effective, will not get her to give in. You pick up the feather drill with one hand and an electric toothbrush in the other. Noticing that you can fit both of these in her navel, you switch them on and insert them into Nolujo\u2019s tickle spot. Suddenly, the executive\u2019s laughter levels spike a couple of octaves when the real torture begins. \u201cNOHOHO! DOHOHOHOHNT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll stop if you say the safe word,\u201d you promise, looking at the clock and seeing that it has been six minutes and ten seconds so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Nolujo is reduced to just laughing as her bellybutton is tickled. Without any more protesting, you keep pressing the tickle tools hard into her skin and enjoy hearing her laughter. You tickle everywhere inside the hole on Nolujo\u2019s sensitive stomach, and her laughter just keeps getting louder. Wanting to wear her out before she can stop laughing enough to say the safe word, you continue moving the drill and toothbrush around for a full ten minutes. You then remove the feather drill from Nolujo\u2019s navel and pick up a feather duster. At this point, Nolujo can finally utter intelligible words through her laughter again. \u201cHAHAHAHA! IHIHIT TIHIHIHICKLEHEHES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to say the safe word now?\u201d you demand to know of your ticklee as the clock hits sixteen minutes and twenty-one seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Nolujo yells out,</span></div></div>",

Turning them on, you restart the tickle torture on the Kichi, who immediately begins laughing. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NOHOHOHOHO! STAHAHAHAP!\u201d Ignoring the pleas, you continue to torment your ticklee, who struggles violently against her bonds. The navel tickling continues, as the bondage holds Nolujo fast to prevent her escape. As you approach the end of the half hour, you blow a few raspberries in the stomach hole, making Nolujo squeal each time your mouth hits her tickle spot. The term finally concludes, and you remove all of your tickle tools from Nolujo\u2019s navel. Once you set everything down next to the table, you free the Kichi from the restraints, and the two of you watch as Marilu interrogates Reclos. The other executive gives in after forty minutes, and then she is released by your partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs promised, you can tickle our bare bellies for five minutes,\u201d Marilu declares when both executives have recovered from their interrogations. \u201cWe will lay down on the tables, and you can use any of the tools next to the tables.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove the top of your spacesuit, exposing your upper body to Nolujo, and lay down on the table. Smiling, she grabs the feather drill and the electric toothbrush and tries to place both of them inside your bellybutton. However, it is too small, so she keeps the feather drill in there and moves the toothbrush out to your left side. She suddenly turns both of the tools on, and you burst out in laughter. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA! NOHOHOHOHO!\u201d The Kichi bends and moves her tools to get the most ticklish reactions out of you, and you squirm around laughing. Nevertheless, as the five minutes come to a close, she relaxes her tickling method, and the tickle torment ceases on time. You sit up after you catch your breath, putting back on your spacesuit top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat part was very fun,\u201d Reclos proclaims after both Marilu and you are up as you are both handed a large stack of paper. \u201cYou are each getting paid two hundred and forty chiiks for your services, and we will contact you when we have a job for you.\u201d Before Reclos speaks again, Erin converts the value of the money you just received to three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. \u201cFor right now, we would like to invite you to spend some time with us on Feather Jewels. We would like to give the human a free tour of Navel Enterprises, and Marilu is certainly welcome to come, too. Would you like to go?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The two of you walk back onto the Swift Feather, and you set course for Feather Jewels. As the two ships detach, Reclos, who has reclaimed the couch, comments, \u201cI saw that your tickling technique was superb. Nolujo may be very ticklish, but she does not give in easily to torture. You humans must be great ticklers because of how sensitive your species is. I am glad that we will have you in our employ when we need to get something out of a ticklee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you accept the compliment. \u201cI have a few more questions about the Kichi while we ride back. Earlier, you said that tickle torture is used in the prisons as a form of punishment. What offenses will you serve a tickle dungeon sentence for committing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you, likely none until the Kichi and humans establish formal relations or become enemies,\u201d Reclos notifies you. \u201cIf our two species were to become enemies, for coming to a Kichi planet, you would be sentenced to life in the tickle dungeons with belly tickling, our most severe punishment. However, since you had productive contact with Marilu and you are now engaging in business with the Kichi, that is not likely to happen. With formal relations, the smallest punishment that would get you in the tickle dungeons is four hours in the tickle dungeon with light tickling, and this is only applied if the alien had knowledge of the law already. This is actually a fairly common sentence to receive, as you can be put there for doing something as simple as covering up too much of a tickle spot, stealing something of small value, being unemployed for more than a week, or not showing up to work on time without cause. In fact, I have had this sentence for not showing up to work on time a total of ten times already. The dungeon ticklers that administer this sentence are very nice, and they only tickle you for a few minutes before giving you a break. On a slightly different note, the unemployment law does not apply to anyone under 16, and most Kichi get a job at 14 or 15. Time spent in the dungeon is supposed to encourage them to go and find a job. On the complete other hand, with formal relations, you can get the ultimate dungeon penalty for only murder or treason. Criminals that commit these crimes are put with the most ruthless Kichi ticklers and tormented for hours upon hours. You seemed fairly nice, and I doubt you would ever get put in a Kichi tickle dungeon, much less get a very severe punishment. For Kichi, the punishments are the same as for other species with formal relations. I have a new question for you. In general, where is the most ticklish spot on humans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe majority of humans have either their stomach or feet as their most ticklish spot,\u201d you inform the Kichi. \u201cI think that the feet are usually more ticklish than the stomach, but it depends on the person. What do you do outside of work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there are usually tickle clubs open all day,\u201d Reclos declares. \u201cWhether you want to be tickled or be doing the tickling, the tickle clubs have it all. They always have a vast assortment of tools to help you enjoy yourself at the club. In addition, there are hired ticklers and ticklees that service you and anyone you bring along, and they are very good at what they do. All ticklees, whether it is you or a hired ticklee, are tied down and tickled until the customer has had enough or the ticklee is completely worn out. In addition, you can even hire a tickler and then assist them as they tickle your friends or get tickled by both them and your friends. These are just some of the perks of going to tickle clubs. Other than the clubs, I do have a family and a modest home that I like to spend time with and at. In addition, I own twelve Kichi tickle slaves, all of which are very sensitive to feathers. The theme parks my family and I go to always involve tickling in some form on every ride, mostly midriff-focused. In fact, nearly everything on Feather Jewels has tickling involved in it, and because of the Kichi\u2019s tummy ticklishness, the midsection is often the target. A new question for you. Where do humans enjoy being tickled the most?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTypically whatever is less ticklish, the belly or feet,\u201d you answer. \u201cHowever, this is not always the case, as some humans, like me, enjoy being tickled more on their most ticklish spot or another spot on their body. Most humans like being tickled on bare skin more, but as I said before, tickling is not very common among adults on Earth. How much tickling should I expect to endure on this tour of Navel Enterprises?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would depend on the type of \u00actour that you pick out,\u201d Reclos dictates. \u201cThere are two types of tours that we do at Navel Enterprises, the interactive tour and the observation tour. In the interactive tour, you test out several of the devices that we make at the company as you pass by where they are produced. The observation tour allows you to watch different Kichi endure the tickling as you go by the device production lines. For a normal tour group, the observation option is not available, but you\u2019ve endured tons of tickling today. I think that if you want to take the observation tour, we can arrange it for you. However, I do want you to experience the micro-sized tickle helicopter, which I told you about earlier. We won\u2019t tickle you with it for long, but it is a magnificent piece of innovation that the first human to meet the Kichi should have the honor of being subjected to. When you are done with the tour, it will likely be closing time. Nolujo and I usually go to a tickle club for a few hours after work, and then we head to our separate homes. You and Marilu are welcome to join us for free or you could head somewhere for the night. If you come with us, you can stay at either of our houses for the night. Anyways, you can decide which tour you want when we get back to the company. It looks like we\u2019re almost back to Feather Jewels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds after this, a Kichi head comes onto your view screen, and the voice on the other end says, \u201cHello, and welcome to Feather Jewels! A ship with a pilot named Marilu said that you would be landing in the same port as you. Is that true?\u201d You confirm this, and then the Kichi continues, \u201cI am transmitting the coordinates to your ship. When you land, we will have agents come out to mark your tickle spot. Thank you for visiting our planet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin guides the ship down to the ground, and you remove your spacesuit before heading out with Reclos. Outside, Marilu and Nolujo are waiting for Reclos and you, and you are soon joined by four customs agents. Once again, you tell the agents your tickle spot, and they test and mark it. Your party exits the customs building, and you head back to Navel Enterprises...</span></div></div>",

This is the standard tour, and typically, the tourists do not get the option to take the other tour, the observation tour. In the observation tour, you just watch different employees get tickled by the machines. I thought this might be better because of all the tickling you have already gone through today. However, no matter which type of tour you pick, I want to make sure you feel how the micro-tickle helicopters work.

We would like to go on an observation tour, and at the end, we would like to have these two get tickled by the micro-sized tickle helicopters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I see your bellybutton?\u201d the receptionist questions, and you wonder why. Nevertheless, Reclos leans over the table, showing her navel to the receptionist. The receptionist takes out a small scanner and points it at Reclos\u2019s tickle spot. Once the device is nestled in, she pulls the trigger to scan, causing the Kichi to squeal with laughter. A beep comes from the scanner, and the receptionist removes the scanner from Reclos\u2019s midsection. \u201cThank you, Reclos. Your tour guide will be out in a minute. Her name is Weselj.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, another Kichi comes through a door behind the desk. \u201cHello,\u201d she proclaims. \u201cMy name is Weselj, and I will take you on an observation tour of Navel Enterprises today. Now I have to ask this for my curiosity: Who is the executive here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the one that scanned in, and Nolujo here is also an executive,\u201d Reclos answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you down here,\u201d Weselj declares. \u201cWe don\u2019t get executives with small groups here very often. Now I have another question that just popped up, also because of my curiosity. I have never seen anyone like you; what is your species?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a human,\u201d you inform her, knowing that the question was directed at you. \u201cWe achieved interstellar travel very recently. I am the first human to come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am honored to be able to host you, then,\u201d Weselj dictates. \u201cWell, let us get started on the tour. Follow me.\u201d The four of you follow Weselj through the door, and you soon find yourself in a very narrow path, where you have to raise your arms above your head to keep walking. \u201cIf you were on the interactive tour, this pathway would be your first tickling. This hallway is usually filled with feathers at the belly level, and in order to get through, you have to endure the tickling. We will get to see our first tickle scene when we get through here.\u201d When you exit the hallway, you come upon a group of Kichi, one holding a small round object. \u201cThis is our most basic tickle device, the bellybutton ball. The ball goes into a ticklee\u2019s bare bellybutton, and with the press of a button, the ball begins to tickle the ticklee.\u201d The Kichi with the round object places it inside her navel, and then she takes out a remote, handing it to Weselj. When the guide presses the top button on it, she immediately bursts out into laughter. \u201cThe ball is now sending feathers all around the inside of her navel. We have several different tools on the balls, ranging from feathers to fingers to brushes and everything in between. In addition, we have different sizes of balls to fit multiple sizes of bellybuttons, so even this human can get a bellybutton ball to fit him. On each remote, there are three buttons. The top button turns the machine on or off, while the middle button increases the tickle intensity and the bottom lowers the intensity. Bellybutton balls are available at Navel Enterprise locations all around, and even in the gift shop here, for 2.25 chooks each (which you later learn is $3). I think that is all for the bellybutton balls, so let\u2019s head to the next product.\u201d Weselj turns off the ball, and the Kichi who had been getting tickle tortured during her speech relaxes and takes it out. Following this, the guide hands the remote back to her ticklee, and you all walk into another narrow hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you see in the new room is a Kichi with a vest covering her midriff. \u201cThis device is a tickle vest,\u201d Weselj explains as everyone files in and the Kichi hands her a remote. \u201cIt tickles an entire tummy when activated with the different tools on it. You can pick and choose which tool to use with the remote. For instance, this is the feather setting.\u201d Weselj presses a button on her remote, and the Kichi collapses with laughter, clutching her stomach. After twenty seconds, the guide deactivates the tickle vest. \u201cAlong with the feathers, there are also fingers, a tail, and electric brushes to use on the vest. There are five different settings available for the speed of the tickling on tickle vests, which are available for 9 chooks. That is all for this section; let us head to the next product.\u201d The five of you walk through another narrow hallway into a room containing\u2026</span></div></div>",

These two scientists have remotes that control two helicopters, and they will be tickling you. How long did you want them to get tickled?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one minute,\u201d Reclos quickly replies. \u201cWe only want them to experience the helicopters, not exhaust them with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Weselj declares before looking to the scientists. \u201cYou may tickle them for a minute.\u201d The two scientists nod and stare down at their remotes, which look like controls to fly a drone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they begin to press buttons and appear to fly the helicopters, you wonder where the machines are, as you cannot see them. Suddenly, you feel something tickling a nerve inside your navel, and you clutch your midriff, starting to laugh. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you yell in laughter. \u201cWHAHAHAT IHIHIHIS GOHOHOHOING AHAHAHAN?\u201d The tickling quickly increases in intensity as more nerves are targeted by your tickler, and before long, you fall down to the ground. Hysterically laughing, you try to get rid of the torturous feeling in your bellybutton, to no use. You feel as if all the several million nerves in your navel are being targeted for tickle torture by the time thirty seconds have passed, and you give up struggling at this point. This extreme tormenting continues for another fifteen seconds, although it feels like several minutes to your hyper-ticklish tummy. With only fifteen seconds left, the tickle intensity drops as rapidly as it built up. You remain collapsed on the ground for a few minutes after the tickling completely ends, at which point you look over to Marilu. Laying down on the ground, your partner appears to be just as exhausted as you from the short tickle torture. Eventually, Reclos and Nolujo walk over to the two of you, and they roll you onto your backs. Apparently tired of waiting, Reclos reaches down and begins poking your bare belly, throwing you into another fit of laughter. \u201cHAHAHA NOHOHO!\u201d You pull your arms back to protect your stomach, and the executive ceases her fun and helps you get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Marilu and you are both standing and recovered from the tickle torture, Weselj grins at the two of you and announces, \u201cWell, that was fun, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Marilu and you simply glare at her, so she continues, \u201cThat was the last stop we are making, so let\u2019s head back to the tour room.\u201d She takes you through another couple of hallways, and you end up back in the tour room. \u201cThank you for taking this tour of Navel Enterprises, and have a nice day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all thank Weselj for the tour before Reclos and Nolujo lead you out of the room. \u201cHow did you enjoy the tour?\u201d Nolujo inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was pretty interesting,\u201d you comment, and Marilu nods in agreement. \u201cI liked learning about the different products and seeing them in action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like a bellybutton ball or a tickle vest?\u201d Nolujo wonders. \u201cWe would be happy to buy you the products if you want them.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Let us go to the gift shop.\u201d The executives lead you to the gift shop on the main floor, and when you enter, you see several different tickling devices. You follow Reclos to a section with several hundred bellybutton balls. \u201cWhat\u2019s your bellybutton size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a thing like that before,\u201d you respond, confused at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the diameter of your navel, and it determines what size bellybutton ball fits in it,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe\u2019ll just try out some to find out what it is.\u201d The executive picks out a ball a little less than the size of her bellybutton, and she tries to stick it in your tummy button, but it is too big. \u201cThat\u2019s probably about two sizes too large. Let\u2019s try a different one.\u201d Reclos grabs another bellybutton ball and places it in your navel, where it fits snugly. \u201cThat one works! Your bellybutton size is 8. Just to let you know, the average Kichi has a bellybutton size of about 12. So, what kind of tool or tools do you want on the ball?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of tools are there?\u201d you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of possible tools,\u201d Reclos answers. \u201cYou can get fingers, feathers, electric toothbrushes, Kichi tails, and even things like paintbrushes or raspberry machines. Does that give you some ideas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I try out the raspberry machine?\u201d you ask, curious about what it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Reclos confirms. She goes and grabs another bellybutton ball, bringing it back to you. \u201cPut this in your bellybutton.\u201d You insert the ball, and then Reclos continues, \u201cI\u2019m going to put this on low intensity with a raspberry every ten seconds. I\u2019ll let it blow a couple on you and see how you like it.\u201d She presses a button, and you feel a small raspberry being blown in your navel, causing you to squeal and giggle in surprise. However, this ticklish feeling goes away in a few seconds, and you wait for the second raspberry to come. You giggle lightly when another raspberry enters your tummy button, enjoying the low-intensity tickling. After the second zerbert, the executive turns off the machine. \u201cYou can take the ball out of your navel now. How did you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was fun,\u201d you proclaim. \u201cI really enjoyed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is one of your options,\u201d she announces. \u201cWould you like the raspberry bellybutton ball or something else? We are willing to pay for up to three of these bellybutton balls for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll take this,\u201d you decide. \u201cI think I\u2019ve decided on the other two, but I have a question first. How do they make the Kichi tail bellybutton balls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey replicate a tail from natural materials and put it in the ball,\u201d Reclos notifies you. \u201cNo actual Kichi tails are in the machine; it just feels like a tail is tickling you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is good,\u201d you declare. \u201cI think I\u2019d like one Kichi tail and one electric toothbrush bellybutton ball, along with this raspberry ball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get them, and Nolujo can take you over to the tickle vests,\u201d Reclos dictates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Nolujo broadcasts. \u201cWe just need to find your stomach size to get a correct tickle vest.\u201d You follow Nolujo a few aisles over, where you see several different sizes of tickle vests. \u201cYou look like a 25 to me. Let\u2019s test it.\u201d She takes out a tickle vest and hands it to you. When you place it around your midriff, it covers the clear majority of the midsection, but a tiny bit is left uncovered. \u201cHmm, that looks one size too small for you. We want to make sure the vest is tickling your whole tummy instead of just some of it.\u201d You remove the vest and replace it with a new one from Nolujo. \u201cThat looks perfect on you! You can take it off now so we can buy it. Let\u2019s find Reclos with the bellybutton balls.\u201d As you head back towards the entrance, Reclos joins you. The two Kichi executives purchase the tickle tools for you, and then all of you head outside the gift shop, where you meet up with Marilu. \u201cReclos and I are headed out to a tickle club. Would you like to join us? We will pay for you if you come.\u201d</span></div></div>",

When all of you are in the pod, you are next to Reclos in the front, while Nolujo is behind you and Marilu is to the rear of Reclos.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019ll be a switch,\u201d you request to the Kichi at the desk as the laughter from under it increases substantially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can arrange that,\u201d the desk Kichi states as she uses her free hand to type on a small device. \u201cThat will be 152.5 chooks.\u201d Nolujo hands over some money, getting a small amount back. \u201cYour accompaniment will meet you on the fifth floor in Room 34. Have a wonderful and ticklish time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Reclos says as you follow the three Kichi away from the desk. You head over to a machine appearing to be an elevator, getting in with a few more Kichi. As you get in the elevator, Nolujo quickly reaches out and presses a button with a strange symbol on it, pulling her arm back in just as fast. One of the other Kichi darts her arm back and forth at the same speed, lighting up another button on the screen. After this, the doors close, and the elevator begins to move upward slowly. When it first stops, the other Kichi exit, and you are left alone with Marilu, Reclos, and Nolujo. You wait for the elevator to travel vertically for another thirty seconds before it halts again. This time, Marilu, Reclos, Nolujo and you walk out, and you follow them through a maze of a hallway. As you walk, you see several different alien species on the ground, some tickling and some being tickled, and laughter filling the halls of the tickle club everywhere you go. Eventually, Reclos directs the group into a room, where four Kichi are waiting for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d one of the Kichi announces as the four of you enter. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you are the four that are supposed to meet us here for some switch tickling? In this, you can choose whether to be tickled or to tickle us, and you can switch roles back and forth with us whenever you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is us,\u201d Reclos confirms. \u201cI suppose we should pair up.\u201d Your three Kichi quickly pick out partners, and you are left with an employee that is 2.2 meters tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello; my name is Sorwd,\u201d the tall Kichi introduces herself with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be your partner for today. Have you ever been to the Feathers Club before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I have not,\u201d you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, welcome,\u201d Sorwd proclaims. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a little explanation; you looked a little lost. What we are in now is a switch room, so we are free to switch back and forth from being tickler and ticklee. You are in control of when we switch and how the tickling occurs. This includes tools, time, restraints, and tickle spot. In this room, we have some chains on the wall and chains on the floor that ticklees can be locked in. We also have stocks in case someone like you with feet wants them tickled. As far as tickle tools go, we have a wide variety: you ask for it, it\u2019s probably here somewhere. Now I think we are ready to get down to the important matters for starting. If you are being tickled and want the tickling to stop, just tell me and I will stop immediately. However, if you are tickling me, you only stop when you want to or if I stop laughing. So, do you want to begin as the tickler or ticklee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll start out tickling you,\u201d you declare. \u201cI\u2019d like to use the wall chains on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she replies. \u201cJust so you know, my most ticklish spot is my midsection.\u201d The two of you head over to the chains that are resting on the close wall, and Sorwd slips her wrists into the restraints. Before she has a chance to think about getting out, you close the chains and lower your hands to her bare belly. Your fingers commence wiggling, and your ticklee quickly breaks down any defenses. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Enjoying seeing Sorwd laugh, you tickle all over, trying to find a particularly sensitive area of her stomach. Like all the Kichi you have tickled, you find your target at the center of the tickle spot, right in the navel. Both hands descend on the small tickle spot and drive the ticklee to high pitches of laughter, but she does not plead for mercy at all. \u201cOHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Following six minutes of the tickling, you slide your fingers out to her sides and then give her a break, and her laughter dies down quickly. \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I did,\u201d you affirm. \u201cIt was very fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you want to do now?\u201d she questions. \u201cI can direct you to tickle tools if you want, you can just keep tickling me with your fingers, or we can switch spots. Whatever you want.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You can pick whatever you want to get from there. Also, there is a stock of ticklishness-enhancing oils on the left side of the door.\u201d You stroll over to the oils first, looking over the foreign writing on them. Eventually, you decide on a couple to try on your ticklee, and you head over to get some tickle tools. You select a feather drill and another tool with a small clamp-like object at the end, wondering what it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to Sorwd, you set the feather drill and oils down and hold up the clamp tickle tool and inquire, \u201cWhat does this tool do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt clamps onto a vulnerable area, such as a navel, and sends vibrations through the ticklish area,\u201d Sorwd informs you. \u201cThat one is a very effective tool, and it typically cannot be used for more than ten minutes on even the best-protected species. This is because the intensity of the vibrations, if continued over a long time, can injure a species. Don\u2019t worry about this constraint; all our tools here automatically shut off after a minute to give the ticklee a break from tickle vibrations, and there are zero negative effects from this amount of tickling. In fact, I like the tickling that the vibrations produce, so don\u2019t feel bad at all about using that on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComforted by the Kichi\u2019s admission that she enjoys the ticklish vibrations, you clamp the tool on her bellybutton and flip a switch on it, lighting up a button. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d she screams out in laughter. \u201cIHIHIT TIHIHICKLEHEHES SOHOHOHO MUHUHUCH!\u201d Sorwd thrashes from side to side as much as she possibly can, trying to escape the tickling in a futile effort. As promised, once a minute hits, the vibrations quickly die out, and the light on the machine turns off. You give Sorwd a minute to stop laughing as you unclamp the machine and return it to the stock of tickle tools. When you return, she has calmed down and speaks up to you. \u201cWhew! That was quite the tickling. I always love that, even though it is temporarily exhausting. I\u2019m ready for whatever you want now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this oil?\u201d you question, holding one of the bottles close to the Kichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is 4 Guwak midriff enhancer,\u201d she notifies you. \u201cWe measure ticklishness in guwaks, and this increases the ticklishness of abdomen where it is applied by 4 guwaks for an hour. Relatively speaking, this is a weak oil, but it does make the ticklee slightly more ticklish. If you place it anywhere but the midsection, it will not take effect, as it only interacts with chemicals that are present in the midsection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious to see how much of an effect this will have on Sorwd, you take some out and rub it on her bare belly. You lift your fingers up to the Kichi and spider them over her tickle spot, and she bursts out laughing. \u201cHAHAHAHA! THAHAHAT REHEHEHELY TIHIHICKLEHEHEHES!\u201d As your fingers scramble around the ticklish tummy, you notice that Sorwd seems to be just as ticklish as when you were tickling her before. You continue to tickle her for a minute, and then you cease your efforts, and she catches her breath easily. \u201cI guess that one didn\u2019t have much of an effect on me; my stomach is already super sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess not,\u201d you admit. \u201cWhat does this one do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat one will affect my ticklishness,\u201d Sorwd announces. \u201cThat\u2019s 400 Guwak midriff enhancer, so it will increase my ticklishness by 400 guwaks for half an hour. I suggest that if you want to get really good laughter out of me, take advantage of the half hour you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited to see just how ticklish this oil will make Sorwd, you rub a full complement of it all over her most ticklish spot. \u201cI wonder how much this will tickle for you,\u201d you tease, running a single finger up her side. Sorwd gasps and giggles a bit as the finger travels on her skin. \u201cLet\u2019s really test this now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, you run all your fingers across the Kichi\u2019s ticklish tummy, and she rapidly breaks down in laughter. \u201cOHOHOHAHAHAHAHAHA! NOHOHOHOHO! PLEHEHEHEHESE!\u201d Smiling as you continue the tickle torture, you spider the broken ticklee\u2019s bare belly mercilessly for ten minutes, and she continues to struggle and beg for mercy. You pick the feather drill up where you had set it on the ground. Turning the device on, you insert it into your victim\u2019s navel. \u201cNAHAHAT THEHEHE BEHEHELEHEHEBUHUHUTOHOHOHON! IHIHIHITS TOHOHO MUHUHUHUCH!\u201d The drill eliminates the remaining resistance inside Sorwd, and she stops squirming, only laughing helplessly. After ten minutes, you have a little mercy on her as you remove the feather drill from her bellybutton. She is still laughing from the aftereffects of the drill when you blow a raspberry in her tickle spot, causing another spurt of laughter to exit her mouth. \u201cHAAHAHAAHA!\u201d Seeing that the Kichi is very weakened, you reduce your tickling to light strokes and wait a minute before blowing another zerbert in her navel. You end up raspberrying her once every minute for the remainder of her time of enhanced ticklishness, at which point you completely cease the tickling. Still recovering from the intense tickle torture, Sorwd continues giggling through the time you put the drill and both the oils back in their respective places. It takes her a full ten minutes to regain her normal breathing pattern, and she finally addresses you. \u201cYou\u2019re quite a good tickler, human. What do you want to do next?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Trying to quickly come up with a plan to get her, you are surprised when her hands reach out and begin tickling your sides. \u201cOHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you laugh out in shock.

Marilu is soon tickle torturing her partner behind you, and you see the glimpse in the Kichi\u2019s eyes that she is distracted, so you make your move. Sprinting towards you, you catch Sorwd off guard, and you tackle her to the ground, starting to tickle her tummy. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d she laughs at the newfound tickle torture. Pinned down with nowhere to move, the Kichi does the only thing she can to help herself: she brings her tail to your bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEHEHEHEHEHE!\u201d you laugh as the tail wriggles over your bare feet. \u201cYOUHUHUHUHU NEHEHEHED TOHOHOHOHOHO GIHIHIHIVEHEHE IHIHIHIHIHN!\u201d You press harder against the midriff, and soon your tickling pays off as the tail loses its energy to tickle. Right away, you punish her for tickling you by blowing a raspberry on her bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute of ending her tail offensive, Sorwd screams out, \u201cHAHAHAHAHA! IHIHIHIHI GIHIHIVE IHIHIHN!\u201d You raspberry her once more after she surrenders, and then you cease all tickling. \u201cYou tickle too well. How much training do humans give their children on tickling methods? I\u2019m guessing they start pretty young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, humans are just naturally good at tickling,\u201d you declare. \u201cWe don\u2019t train on tickle techniques.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d she remarks. \u201cWell, what should we do now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Have a wonderful stay on Feather Jewels!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave goodbye to her, and then you head over to where Marilu had been. An exhausted Kichi, obviously having been tickle tortured the entire duration of your visit, slumps in her chains as your partner sets her tools away. Once all her things are placed back, your group of four heads out of the tickle room back into the hallways of the tickle club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the halls of the tickle club, alien laughter continues to fill the air as a mix of ticklers and ticklees interact. A few orange aliens of an unknown species begin to approach your group, and you become suspicious about their purpose. Looking right next to you, you can see that Marilu also appears concerned, as she slides her hand into her pocket subtly. The aliens continue to come closer, and your partner removes a small piece of equipment from her pocket, preparing for a confrontation. Suddenly, you feel something tickling your bare sides, and you burst out in ticklish laughter, \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Your tickler is not using fingers, but something smooth that brushes against your sensitive sides. Unable to turn around, you collapse as the tickling extends to your entire abdomen, driving you crazy with laughter. You manage to roll onto your back just in time to see the rest of your group being taken down with midriff tickling. Within a few seconds, the unknown aliens lean down and tickle everyone in your group. Your bare belly is a target of interest for two of the new aliens, as they explore just how ticklish your most ticklish spot is. After what feels like hours of tummy tickle torture, the aliens finally cease -their activities, during which they restrain you and you have become a ticklish wreck.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cState your species name,\u201d one of the orange aliens orders you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a human,\u201d you stumble out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA human,\u201d the alien repeats. \u201cI have not heard of this species, but you seem suitably ticklish. I shall tickle your stomach some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please DOHOHOHONT!\u201d you are cut off as the alien gets back to running a tickle machine against your stomach. This particular tickle machine is like a small car that drives across your midsection, tickling as it goes. Nevertheless, this tickle session does not last nearly as long, as you hear some new laughter in the air before the machine is removed and you are untied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOHOHOHO!\u201d the orange alien, who is now the target of the tickle car, yells. You look up to see that a Kichi who appears to work at the club is the one that has freed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you thank the Kichi who has rescued you from the strange alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d the Kichi announces. \u201cRoliers are infamous for trapping anyone they can get their machines on and tickling them for extended periods of time. Luckily, they\u2019re just as vulnerable to the machines as other species. I\u2019ll make sure she stays occupied with these for a little bit. You are free to go wherever you want now. Enjoy the rest of your night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you again,\u201d you repeat before linking up again with Marilu, Reclos, and Nolujo. \u201cSo, we are heading to Reclos\u2019 house, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Reclos confirms. \u201cLet\u2019s head down to my pod.\u201d The four of you make an uneventful trip down to the bottom floor and out of the tickle club. Once you exit, everyone enters the pod in the same configuration as earlier. The pod drives to what you figure is Nolujo\u2019s house, and she is let out there. After Nolujo departs, the pod continues to run until it parks at a different dwelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to my home,\u201d Reclos proclaims. The place is shaped like a dome, and it is decorated with feathers around the windows and doors. When you enter, you see several more feathers and what appears to be a tickle room. Various machines reside around the room, as well as chairs and recliners. \u201cThis is my living room; it is where I typically spend most of my time here apart from sleeping. Plenty of tickling goes on in here during the day, but as you can see, no one is currently here. Right now, let me show you to where you will be staying tonight; you must be tired.\u201d The three of you head through a series of hallways with feathers hung up until you near the end. \u201cThese two rooms are where you will be staying tonight. Human, you will be on the left, and Marilu will be on the right. Please feel free to let me know if there is anything you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you both respond. You stroll into the left room, turning the light on as soon as you enter. In the room, you observe a bed, a few chairs, a closet, and surprisingly enough, chains hanging from the wall. Opening up the closet reveals tickle tools and oils intermixed throughout the shelves. Finally, you head to the bed, and you notice another difference: there are restraints on the edges of the bed. However, you do not worry about these right now, as you are very tired. You get under the blanket on the bed and fall asleep, waking up\u2026</span></div></div>",

Soon after, you are released from your bonds, which they had put you in during your slumber. \u201cWell, human, I think it is time for you to eat. Follow us.\u201d You follow the two Kichi to a room next to the living room. When you walk into the room, the Kichi usher you to a chair next to a table. \u201cSit down.\u201d You sit, and the Kichi head over to a counter, bringing back a plate of food and a cup of water. \u201cHere is your food, human; we read that humans eat this. We hope you enjoy it. Please let us know if you need anything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you reply. Looking down at your food, you see that they have given you some meat, most likely ham, and some fruits. You eat the contents of the plate and drink the water, enjoying your meal. Once you are finished, you call out to the two Kichi, \u201cI am finished; what would you like me to do with the cup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will take them for you,\u201d one of the Kichi states. Once the Kichi has set the cups at another place in the room, she returns to you. \u201cPlease come with us again.\u201d The two Kichi lead you to the living room, where Reclos is sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, human,\u201d Reclos declares. \u201cPlease take a seat. How did you sleep last night and how was your meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were both great,\u201d you answer as you relax on a recliner. \u201cBy the way, I never have gotten the chance to ask yet: who are these two Kichi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are my tickle slaves,\u201d Reclos notifies you. \u201cThey will be your hostesses today, and they will perform the Kichi customs for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKichi customs?\u201d you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you perhaps know, it is rare for a male visitor to come into a Kichi household, given that there are so few Kichi males,\u201d Reclos explains. \u201cSo a male visitor is always honored with fourteen hours of tickling. Of course, this includes appropriate breaks for meals and rest, but we must appropriately honor the presence of the male. Those feathers that my slaves are holding will make great friends with your midriff today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, are you telling me that you honor your male guests by tickling them?\u201d you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is the common method of greeting them,\u201d Reclos responds, looking at you as if you were crazy. \u201cTicklishness is held in high esteem among Kichi. The most ticklish Kichi are often elevated to the highest positions, and tickling is used for many awards. I must have neglected to tell you this earlier. But now to honor you being a guest here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly\u2026</span></div></div>",

The two Kichi tickle slaves cease your tickle torture, and you gasp for breath. \u201cGo in the next room.\u201d Once the tickle slaves have left, Reclos addresses you, \u201cWhat do you think of the tickle customs so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of tickling to take in,\u201d you answer. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can take fourteen hours of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have them go slower when they get back,\u201d Reclos promises. \u201cHopefully that will make it more bearable for you. Do you have any questions before I bring them back in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you quickly interject. \u201cWhat all species of tickle slaves do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust Kichi,\u201d Reclos declares. \u201cThey are the cheapest and easiest to obtain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kinds of species do Kichi enslave?\u201d you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tough question,\u201d Reclos replies. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s mostly Falwikes or Insoes. Falwikes are tall, extremely skinny, purple-skinned humanoids who are also incredibly ticklish on their bellies. They are also vulnerable to hypnosis, and tickle slavers usually ambush them from behind and tickle torture them to get them to look in our eyes, which hypnotizes them. On the other hand, Insoes are small creatures, also vulnerable to our hypnosis, with four eyes and four legs. Their most ticklish spots are their feet, although their legs are also very sensitive. They are typically captured by the tickle slavers because their multiple sets of eyes prevent them from ignoring the Kichi eyes. Once a tickle slave has been caught, they are transported on slave ships to tickle slave markets. There are no tickle slave markets on Feather Jewels, but there are some on nearby planets. Slaves typically go for 1500 to 10000 chiiks, depending on the species. Both Insoes and Falwikes are near the high end of the spectrum, given their sensitivity. Of course, Kichi, like other species, are not above making our own species tickle slaves. It isn\u2019t as common as taking foreign tickle slaves, especially because we can\u2019t hypnotize Kichi and there are several restrictions on taking Kichi as tickle slaves. However, we cannot ignore our own ticklishness, and there are different reasons a Kichi may end up being a tickle slave. Some enjoy being tickled so much that they allow themselves to become domestic tickle slaves, while others go into tickle slavery to pay off debt, and still others are just kidnapped and forced into it. This should be obvious, but the last one is obviously the worst, and it is condemned more than other forms. In fact, Feather Jewels is one of the few Kichi planets where kidnapping any species for the purpose of putting one into tickle slavery is against the law. On most planets, kidnapping all except for a few types of Kichi is illegal, but it is still legal to kidnap other species to put them in tickle slavery. Debt and voluntary tickle slavery usually come with heavy regulations on the use and amount of time that the slave can be tickled and restrained, but I do not mind following these regulations, as they are for the benefit of all. I know I got a bit off topic with regards to your question, but that\u2019s basically the practice of tickle slavery among the Kichi summarized.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d you respond, not knowing what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the issue is complicated,\u201d Reclos acknowledges. \u201cHowever, I do want to assure you that we will not attempt to forcefully make you a tickle slave or hypnotize you. We cannot waste the opportunity to have a wonderful tickler as yourself work for us, and it would be inhumane to force you into tickle slavery just as you are beginning your journey into the galaxy. That being said, I do know there are some who would not care about the implications of making the single representative of a species a tickle slave, but I am sure Marilu will watch out for you. If you get into any trouble with someone who seems like they may be this way, please contact us, and we will send assistance to you. Navel Enterprises has connections with the Merchant Queen of this planet, the honorable Queen Calle, and she will give us assistance to help you if we ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for offering this,\u201d you awe at the power that Reclos possesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are benefits to being the main seller of stomach tickling accessories to the Merchant Queen,\u201d Reclos admits. \u201cShe even lets us use her personal tickle slaves to help test the devices that we will sell to her. Wow. I\u2019ve really gotten off topic. Do you have any more questions?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Plus, you have to do whatever the other person says or be punished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you have a misguided view of tickle slavery,\u201d Reclos announces. \u201cNot all tickle slavery has no monetary benefits. In fact, voluntary tickle slaves are often paid a decent sum by their owners. Additionally, tickle slaves may get tickled for as long as their owner wants, but voluntary tickle slaves usually have some freedom outside of their tickling. While kidnapped and debt tickle slaves are locked up in cells when they are not being tickled or doing chores for their owners, voluntary tickle slaves are often free to roam their owner\u2019s house or even go outside with a way to get contacted by their owner. Most of these tickle slaves are allowed to act like normal citizens in public, as long as they come back when their owner wants to tickle them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you are amazed at this. \u201cI had no idea tickle slavery was like that. I just thought it was being locked up and tickled all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not alone, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Reclos proclaims. \u201cMany other species look down on the Kichi tickle slave trade because they believe that it is just regular slavery with tickling added in. While I do believe that regular slavery is horrible and should be stopped, tickle slavery is so much different, so I think it should be allowed to continue to flourish. I don\u2019t think I have emphasized how big of a role tickle slavery plays in Kichi culture. The vast majority of Kichi males are voluntary tickle slaves for their day jobs, as it pays very well and is highly respected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does that work?\u201d you inquire, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are tickle slaving companies that sell them out to other Kichi, typically noblewomen,\u201d Reclos explained. \u201cThey are sold out as voluntary tickle slaves for the day, and they are paid and released at the end of each day. My husband does this, and he makes about three times what I make at Navel Enterprises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like quite a bit,\u201d you declare, surprised, before you begin to speak your thoughts. \u201cI wonder what it would be like to be a tickle slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure you would like it, human,\u201d Reclos warns quickly. \u201cIt is a lot of tickling, and your owner would not stop when you begged for it. However, if you really would like to learn about it, there is at least one company on Feather Jewels that does tickle slave simulations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTickle slave simulations?\u201d you ask, your curiosity peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a company named \u2018Tickle Slave for a Day\u2019,\u201d Reclos reveals. \u201cThey allow customers to simulate being a tickle slave for a day, and if the customer lasts the entire day, they connect them with tickle slaving companies for potential employment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast the entire day?\u201d you question, a little alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince it is just a simulation and the customer is not actually a tickle slave, a safe word is provided,\u201d Reclos notifies you. \u201cIf the safe word is uttered during the stay, all tickling stops and the customer is released. This is to make sure the customer has more control over the situation, and it makes it so they don\u2019t have to endure tickling past their absolute limits. If the customer cannot make it through the entire day, they will not likely enjoy voluntary tickle slavery, so the simulation company allows them to go without informing any of the other potential tickle slaves. In addition, another safe word is given, which will not end the day of tickle slavery, but just tell the tickler to stop tickling and avoid tickling a certain spot. This is used if a ticklee finds that they are uncomfortable being tickled in a tickle spot, and the tickler will not tickle there for the rest of the time. The money is collected before the tickle slave shows up, and there are no refunds for an early release, as per the agreement the ticklee signs before beginning the simulation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds interesting,\u201d you state. \u201cWhat is the simulation like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, all customers come in the night before, where they are put in a locked room, simulating a tickle slave ship,\u201d Reclos begins. \u201cMost tickle slaves, including voluntary ones, are connected with tickle slavers, who lock them in chains on a tickle slave ship before selling them. Voluntary tickle slaves are paid a significant amount of the money they are sold for, but since this is a simulation, no money is paid to the ticklees. During the simulation, customers are tied to the walls of the room, hands above the head, with bondage on the wrists and ankles. However, the ticklees are not stretched out, and the bondage is not painful. In the morning, there is a tickle slave market, where customers are \u2018sold\u2019 to employees of the simulation company, who will become the \u2018mistresses\u2019 of the customer for the day. A tickling, focusing on the most ticklish spots that were identified in the paperwork filled out during the purchase, is immediately applied to the ticklee. After this, the day progresses as a normal tickle slave\u2019s day would, with a small \u2018village\u2019 inside the large building to simulate tickle slaves being able to wander around. Each customer is given a pager so their \u2018mistress\u2019 can call them back at any time for more tickling. Of course, if the given safe word, which is initially said at the payment time and restated to the customer before they are bound and in the morning, is said at any time, the customer is quietly released from the simulation building and thanked for their business. At the end of the day, professional tickle slaving companies send representatives to meet with the customers that last, which about 50% of the typical customer load does. The customers are free to negotiate with the tickle slavers to be sold into voluntary tickle slavery then, get contact information and negotiate later, or avoid volunteering to be a tickle slave entirely. When the customers that decide to become tickle slaves choose to act on this desire, they are given a comprehensive form that allows them to choose terms of service, including the time to serve, any particular spots they would like to be tickled in often, and any spots they would not like to be tickled during their service. The tickle slavers use this information to take them and sell them under their terms to a willing owner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite a process,\u201d you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Reclos affirms, giving you a couple of minutes to process the enormity of information before speaking again. \u201cDo you have any more questions I can answer now, or would you like to continue with your honor tickling?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, there is one category which you fall under that is not included in the exception law. If this is the first planet that a foreign species visits in Kichi territory, they must undergo the tickle trial unless they are a tickle slave, regardless of business affiliation. We\u2019re going to have to bring you to the tickle dungeon to prepare you for your tickle trial. Chances are, you\u2019ll be cleared to conduct business with Kichi at your trial, but there is always the possibility that you end up spending time in the tickle dungeons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t do anything about this before the trial,\u201d Reclos announces. \u201cWe will be at your trial to try to get you no dungeon time. You will notify us of when the trial is, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d the officer confirms. \u201cYou may even come along with us; it will not likely be that long before the trial begins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, release him; the officers need to take him,\u201d Reclos orders her tickle slaves. The two slaves unbind you from the chair, and the officers come over to you, cuffing your hands behind your back. As they are doing this, Reclos retrieves Marilu and comes back to the living room. \u201cLet us go to the dungeons, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d the head officer broadcasts. You are led outside to a larger pod, and a couple of officers usher you into the back. While the head officer and another officer get in the front, the back is occupied by you, Marilu, Reclos and two Kichi Tickle Police officers. Another set of cuffs are placed on your ankles, preventing you from getting up, and you are strapped into your seat. As the police pod begins moving, you notice that despite you being tied up, there is still three of you to two tickle police, so you might be able to escape and avoid this tickle trial. Then again, it might be a better idea to let this trial take its course and just get out without tickle dungeon time. But what if they want you to spend time in the tickle dungeon? You eventually decide to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You choose to stay in and let your tickle trial happen. These Kichi Tickle Police seem nice, you reason, and they did say that you would probably get out without any time in the tickle dungeons. On your way to the dungeons, the back of the pod is eerily silent, everyone considering their next move in the situation. You finally get to a place where the pod stops after ten long minutes, and the Tickle Police remove the chains from your ankles, although your arms remain behind your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exiting the back of the pod, you are taken by the police inside, where you meet more officers. \u201cWhat is your species name?\u201d an officer questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a human,\u201d you respond, a little intimidated by all the Kichi Tickle Police around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d the officer inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey told me it was for a tickle trial,\u201d you answer, still not quite sure what you are about to go through. You look around nervously, looking for any clue about your situation, but all you get are blank stares from the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProceed with him to Station 12 and prepare him,\u201d the officer orders the police that brought you in. They immediately usher you to the right, through a series of hallways, and into a corridor. When you get to a room where a guard is holding the door open, you are brought inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman, we will prepare you for the tickle trial here,\u201d the head officer announces. \u201cFirst, we need to read you your rights and allowances. You have the right to have at most five Feather Jewels citizens represent you during your tickle trial. You have the right to produce your testimony of why you should be allowed to do business with the Kichi. You have the plead directly to the Kichi Merchant Queen Calle of Feather Jewels, who can declare you fit, partially fit, or unfit for business. You also have the right to not plead to her and instead plead to an eleven-member tickle jury, who can only declare you fit or permanently unfit unanimously. Any indecision among them or a partially fit ruling by Queen Calle will result in a short stay in the tickle dungeons, after which you will be released. The exact time that you will be sentenced depends on either how many judge you fit and how many rule you unfit or Queen Calle\u2019s brilliant judgement. Lastly, you have the right to refuse tickling on a spot without penalty since it is inappropriate for even humans not close to you to touch you there; however, you must let us know of it before the trial begins. Now for your allowances. You are allowed two choice breaks from the tickling every half hour; all you must say is \u2018Break\u2019. In addition, you are allowed breaks from tickling if we sense you are having trouble breathing or are in serious physical pain. These types of breaks do not count against your choice breaks. Of course, you can be at any level of laughter during your tickling; you do not have to restrain or let yourself go while being tickled. You are allowed one spot for us to avoid tickling for non-touch reasons, although this will result in your stomach receiving tickling for the time that the other spot would have been tickled. The only constraint on this spot is that it cannot be your most ticklish spot, which in your case is your stomach. Lastly, you can choose to limit yourself to receiving tickling from at most three Kichi at once. The catch with this allowance is that more jurors, as well as Queen Calle, are more respectful of ticklees who allow themselves to be tickled by more than three ticklers at a time. However, you can still get out without dungeon time without exceeding three ticklers, although it is more difficult. Now that you have been read your rights and allowances, we are obliged to ask you about spots you refuse to allow us to tickle for biological reasons. Are there any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you reply. \u201cIn between my midriff and legs, not including my waist, are the body parts used for human reproduction. I also never allow anyone to touch the backside of this. These are the only spots that I require be avoided, as only very close humans touch each other there. I do not mind if you tickle me anywhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will oblige that when your tickle trial occurs,\u201d the head officer confirms. \u201cDo you want to appeal to Kichi Merchant Queen Calle now? If you do not, you will still have the opportunity to appeal during the tickle trial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I would not like to appeal to her right now,\u201d you notify the tickle police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is perfectly fine,\u201d the officer replies. \u201cNow\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

We will go to her now.\u201d The officers help you up, and they lead you out of the room. As you walk through several more hallways, you wonder what this Queen Calle will be like. Would she be a kind Kichi, looking out for the best interest of all, would she want to tickle torture you, or could she perhaps be somewhere in the middle? As you consider these things, you are stopped in front of a large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Kichi guards by the doors open them, and when you are ushered inside, you see several Kichi in a row with feathers stretched through the middle of the room. As you walk in, the feathers start shaking up and down, at which point you realize that they are right at your abdomen level. Prompted by the officers, you walk right into the stack of feathers and begin laughing as they caress your bare belly. You continue to endure the ticklish sensations on your midriff for about a minute as you walk through the middle of the room. When you reach the end of the feathers, a Kichi stops you, running her fingers over your ticklish tummy. She then slowly begins to move to the side and stops tickling you as she proclaims, \u201cHuman, I present to you, Merchant Queen Calle of the Kichi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to the front of the room to see a Kichi relaxing on a large chair, which you assume is a throne. \u201cWelcome to my throne room, human,\u201d Calle broadcasts as she gets up. \u201cIt is truly a pleasure of mine to have a human grace me with their presence. I see that you are very ticklish, which I personally think is very attractive.\u201d She walks over to you and places her fingers on your midsection. \u201cRegardless of what the feathers say, I always like to test ticklishness in aliens for myself.\u201d All at once, her fingers move across your ticklish tummy, and you break out in more hysterical laughter. She tickles you for a minute, finding your bare bellybutton particularly amusing. \u201cWow! I love this human! His ticklishness matches the upper limits of what I have observed. Human, I am even more honored than before to be with you. Officers, please come over here.\u201d The tickle police hurry over to the two of you, and when they get there, the queen continues, \u201cSuch a ticklish alien should not be bound as he is. Remove his handcuffs now.\u201d Although they look a little concerned, the officers comply, removing your restraints. You rub your wrists, glad they are free from the cuffs. \u201cHuman, you\u2019ve endured quite a bit of tickling, and you\u2019ve proven yourself worthy. Please tickle my stomach now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little surprised by the request, you nevertheless place your fingers on the queen\u2019s abdomen and wiggle them around. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d the Kichi laughs as she quickly backs away. Not quite sure what to do but not wanting to be too aggressive, you do not follow her to keep tickling. She quickly recovers from the five-second tickle, proceeding to ask, \u201cWhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how much tickling you wanted, and I didn\u2019t want to go too far,\u201d you reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, humans are so cute!\u201d she exclaims as she comes back to you. \u201cWere you afraid that if you went too far, you\u2019d have an extra sentence in the dungeon?\u201d You nod affirmatively, and she continues, \u201cWell, this just shows that humans are also very smart. I\u2019m so glad we could meet them! Also, I am really looking forward to doing business with humans. Human, you can keep tickling me if I squirm away. I\u2019ll make sure you know when to stop; it\u2019ll be about a minute. Go ahead and start again.\u201d Knowing your limits now, you reach out and begin to tickle Calle\u2019s bare belly again. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHA! IHIHIHIT TIHIHIHICKLEHEHES!\u201d The Kichi Queen managed to stand the tickling for a few seconds, but she quickly squirms away, squealing in happy laughter. Not about to let her get away, you follow Calle and dig your fingers into her navel, eliciting a whole new kind of laughter. \u201cNOHOHOHOHOHO! TOHOHOHOHO MUHUHUHUCH!\u201d The very ticklish queen easily succumbed to the tickling that you gave her, and she collapsed to the ground. Still not ready to stop, you get down on your knees and continue focusing on the Kichi bellybutton, and your ticklee squirms side to side, unable to avoid the tickle torture. Finally, after just over a minute has passed, Calle manages to laugh out, \u201cOHOHOHOHOKAHAHAY! IHIHIHITS TIHIHIME TOHOHOHO STHAHAHAHAHAP!\u201d Once you hear the cue to end, you remove your hands from the merchant queen\u2019s midriff and get up. You offer a hand to Queen Calle, and she takes it, standing up as her laughter dies down. \u201cHumans are quite good at tickling. I haven\u2019t been tickled like that in a while, not even by my personal ticklers. I think that humans are some of the most wonderful aliens that the galaxy can offer. Unfortunately, I believe our time here has come to an end; your tickle trial is to start up soon. You have made a very positive impression on me, much better than nearly every other alien I have had the chance to meet up with. Please feel free to appeal to me if you desire, and I would love to meet up with you after your tickle trial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for allowing me to spend some time with you, Merchant Queen Calle,\u201d you announce, to which the Kichi smiles. \u201cI also hope to see you sometime else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you have said this, the head guard returns and cuffs your hands behind your back again, reminding you that you are still a prisoner. She leads you out of the room, through another round of the midsection-level feathers, and back into the hallways. You walk for another few minutes until you enter a room.</span></div></div>",

You are taken to a comfortable chair in the center of the room, where your arms are tied above your head and your ankles are also tied down. In front of you is what you presume is a tickle jury, eleven Kichi sitting down in three rows of benches. Merchant Queen Calle enters and takes a seat next to the tickle jury, and then Reclos, Nolujo, and Marilu come and sit on a bench to your right. To your left, six Kichi with tickle tools reside, waiting for the tickle trial to start. As you are taking this all in, one of the members of the tickle jury broadcasts, \u201cI think everyone is here. Let us commence the tickle trial! The ticklee is a male member of humans, and he is represented by the Kichi Reclos and Nolujo of Navel Enterprises, as well as Marilu of Feather Jewels. Human, would you like to say anything in defense of yourself at this point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to your team of Kichi, and Reclos steps up. \u201cQueen Calle and members of the tickle jury,\u201d she addresses, \u201cthis human deserves to do business with the powerful Kichi. As I have learned during the short time I have spent with him, humans are very intelligent. This makes them ideal business partners for us because they are incredibly capable of not only assisting us in what we can do well, but also giving us new ideas and helping us expand our knowledge. In addition to this, humans are extremely ticklish and as good, if not better, ticklers than us. This shows that they can share the joy of tickling that the Kichi race has found, both in dishing it out and receiving it from us. Lastly, I would like to make the point that humans are kind and nonviolent. In this way, humans will not try to overthrow us and enslave so all, but instead will work with us for the betterment of both the Kichi and humans. I ask you to please allow humans to do business with Kichi on these conditions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything else you would like to say before the tickle testing begins?\u201d the juror inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now,\u201d you respond, a little nervous about what will happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many ticklers are you willing to have tickle you at once?\u201d the Kichi questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many do you have?\u201d you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you are brave, human,\u201d the juror observes. \u201cWe like a ticklee who doesn\u2019t mind the presence of several ticklers and will have six ticklers for you. I want two ticklers each on his neck, armpits, and ribs, please.\u201d The six ticklers to the right of you all get up and approach your upper body. \u201cTickle him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, you feel sixty fingers running over your upper body, and you burst out into laughter. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you yell. \u201cIHIHIHIHIT REHEHEHEHEHELEHEHEE TIHIHICKLEHEHES!\u201d You squirm and thrash around, trying to escape the tickle torture these Kichi are forcing you to endure. However, you refuse to beg for them to stop, thinking that they will take it as a sign of weakness. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d As you hysterically laugh, the Kichi get out tools and begin using them on you, exploiting your vulnerability. \u201cHOHAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Your voice goes up in pitch as you are tickle tortured, and then just like the tickling started, it suddenly stops. Still weakened from the tickling, you residually laugh for fifteen seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was five minutes of tickling,\u201d the head juror informs you as you recover. \u201cYou did not beg at all. We are impressed. Time for your lower body. I need two on his feet and four on his legs. Tickle him again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you finish recovering from the last tickle torture, you feel forty fingers run across your legs, while two tails tease your ticklish toes. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you laugh, although your laughter is not as intense as before. The Kichi on your legs increase their tickling speed, trying to get you to laugh harder, but your legs are simply not very ticklish. Meanwhile, the tails on your feet wriggle in and around your toes, keeping you effectively immersed in laughter. Overall, you find it easier to keep control of your ticklish reactions this time, and the five minutes does not seem as long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was five minutes on your lower body, which must be significantly less sensitive than your upper body,\u201d the head juror remarks, looking over at your Kichi representatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReclos stands up and motions to speak, which the head juror acknowledges. \u201cIf I may, I would like to point out that the upper body is much more ticklish than the lower body. The human\u2019s midriff is extremely sensitive, as you will find.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we shall see,\u201d the juror proclaims. \u201cAll six ticklers will now focus on the human\u2019s bare belly. Human, especially for this one, we will not judge you if you beg. Tickle torture him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you feel the full force of sixty Kichi fingers on your hyper-ticklish tummy. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHOHOHOHOHO!\u201d you give in to begging right away. You thrash around, trying to escape the tickle trap the Kichi have set for you. Nevertheless, it is all in vain, as the ticklers seem content to torment you. Around a minute in, tails and other tools are introduced, and you are overwhelmed by the ticklish feeling. \u201cNOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO! DOHOHOHOHOHOHOHNT DOHOHOHOHOHO THAHAHAHAT!\u201d You endure four minutes of pure tickle torture, and then the Kichi abruptly cease, stepping away from you. Sweating profusely, you continue to laugh for another full minute as the effect wears off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are finished laughing, the head tickle juror declares, \u201cWell, the jury has reached a decision on your fate. You will...\"</span></div></div>",

The defining factors were the evidence that you would not likely become hostile to the Kichi race, the tickling skill that Merchant Queen Calle told us you have, and the incredible resilience you showed while being tickled. In particular, the testimony by Reclos and the sensitivity of the human midriff are what convinced us that you will not be hostile to the Kichi. We would like to congratulate you on allying the human race with the Kichi, and may both races be bettered as a result of this. The tickle trial is now over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after the head tickle juror concludes her speech, the tickle police officers come over and unbind you from the chair, helping you up. You walk over to Reclos, Marilu, and Nolujo, who begin to escort you out of the courtroom. \u201cWait!\u201d Queen Calle exclaims, causing the four of you to turn around. \u201cI would like to request the human to come to my throne room again. Of course, your Kichi representatives would also be welcome. Would you like to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I would, Merchant Queen Calle,\u201d you enthusiastically respond, happy for the invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen please follow me,\u201d Calle states. The five of you follow the queen to a small pod outside the courtroom. \u201cPlease get in the pod. My driver will take us to the throne room.\u201d At this, you all squeeze into the pod, with the driver, Calle, and Nolujo filling up the front. You end up in the middle of the backseat, Marilu on your left and Reclos on your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after the pod starts moving, you feel a poke to your left side. \u201cHEHEHE!\u201d you let out a tiny giggle as you accusingly look at Marilu. Then comes a poke to your right side. \u201cHEHEHE!\u201d You jerk back over and stare at Reclos. Suddenly, a whole complement of fingers runs up and down your left side, followed quickly by the same on your right side, and you lose your control. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHOHOHO!\u201d Hearing your laughter, Calle glances back at you and smiles, soon joining her own fingers in the mix on the front of your bare belly. \u201cSTAHAHAHAP THAHAHAHAHAT NOHOHOHOHOHOW!\u201d Your entire stomach gets tickle tortured on the ride to the throne room, with even your navel getting its good share of the tickle treatment. By the time you get back, you are pleading with the three Kichi to stop and let you out. \u201cWas that really necessary?\u201d you ask once you stop laughing. \u201cI just went through a tickle trial, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am the Merchant Queen of a planet whose main attraction is feathers,\u201d Queen Calle counters. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to the tickle dungeon, so I think this was an acceptable alternative. Come with me; the throne room awaits us.\u201d Slightly reluctantly, you and your group follow the queen into her throne room. When you arrive, the entire group enters the ornately decorated room, and Calle goes to sit on her throne again. \u201cPlease bring two couches for my guests to sit on.\u201d A few attendants quickly rush out of the room and bring back two couches, which they set down facing the throne. You and Marilu sit down on the left couch, while Reclos and Nolujo recline on the right couch. \u201cWell, I invited you to get to know humans a little more. So far, I know that humans are extremely ticklish, but they are also skilled ticklers who happen to be kind. What else should I know about humans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have gotten the opportunity to work as a tickle interrogator with Marilu here,\u201d you announce. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten any jobs yet, as we\u2019ve been touring Feather Jewels. Is there anything specific that you would like to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat made you come to the Kichi?\u201d Queen Calle asks. \u201cThere are several thousand species in the galaxy, so why us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wanted to meet a species that was partially like humans, but looked a little different,\u201d you answer. \u201cI figured that I\u2019d probably be dealing with all sorts of different species on my exploration of the galaxies, and I wanted to see how I\u2019d react to someone who looked different than me. I was also very intrigued by the fact that Kichi have tails, so I decided to meet them first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery intriguing,\u201d Queen Calle comments. \u201cHow ticklish did you think the Kichi were before you visited us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually had no idea about how much the universe was based on tickling had before I came here,\u201d you admit. \u201cI was surprised when one of the first things that I did when I met Marilu was get tickled, and even more shocked that once I spoke to her, the first thing she asked me was my most ticklish spot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Calle proclaims. \u201cI heard that the Erimosi were the first ones to encounter humans. They did not tell you about the tickling customs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you confirm. \u201cThey told us that other aliens in the galaxy had particular customs, but not what they were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is particularly strange, since the Erimosi are very adept ticklers,\u201d the queen declares. \u201cIn fact, this palace sometimes brings in Erimosi if I want an extended tickling. I hire them to tickle my bare belly for however long I want to be tickled, and they have never disappointed. If you are going into a career of tickle interrogation, they will likely be your most qualified competitors for jobs. Even the palace at Kich, which has almost exclusively Kichi employees, has some Erimosi hired as royal ticklers. They are experts at manipulating their fingers and tools to get the most ticklish reaction out of ticklees. If you get the chance, have an Erimosi tickle you; it is a very fun and revealing experience. Then again, you may not end up having a choice, since you are in the tickle interrogation business. I hear that Erimosi interrogators sometimes practice their techniques on competitors to eliminate the competition. Anyways, what is your plan after you depart from the Kichi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think before responding,</span></div></div>",

Also, I am sure that we can get you some jobs, as I have seen your talent up close. As a matter of fact, I think some of the prisoners in my dungeon could use some of your tongue loosening effects, if you would be willing to take on the challenge. I must warn you, however, that interrogators who fail are punished severely, typically as new prisoners in the dungeon for some time. In that time, they will frequently become subjects for other tickle interrogators to practice their craft on. On that point, I have some former interrogators who are available for tickle practice, with no consequences for failure, if you would like to take some time before you interrogate the real criminals. Rewards for success will be very handsome, in the range of one to five thousand chiiks per successful interrogation, in addition to private tickle sessions with me if desired. You may have as much time as you desire to discuss it with your partner and decide whether you would like to start now or not. If you do decide to move on to somewhere else, I will always have an opening for you to tickle interrogate my prisoners. I also have openings for you to simply tickle torture my prisoners, without the risk of becoming a prisoner yourself. Anyway, take all the time you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will take some time to think about it,\u201d Marilu dictated before you had a chance to say the same. \u201cIs there a private room nearby where the human and I can discuss this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Queen Calle confirmed, seeming pleased. \u201cSabrene, would you please show them to the noble quarters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course, my queen,\u201d one of Calle\u2019s guards agreed before turning to you. \u201cPlease follow me. I will show you to your quarters for as long as you stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like us to come with you two?\u201d Nolujo questioned us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Marilu politely declined. \u201cThis should just be our discussion, since we are the interrogators. We will still be in contact with you regarding tickle interrogation jobs for Navel Enterprises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Reclos stated. \u201cWe will let you know if we require your services.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore we go, I would like to know: how quickly can we meet with you if we have further questions or make our decision, Queen Calle?\u201d I inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything on my schedule for the rest of the day?\u201d Queen Calle asked an attendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my queen, you are free for the rest of the day,\u201d the attendant quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I will be free for the rest of the day to meet with you for whatever you need,\u201d Queen Calle informed us. \u201cI will have an attendant go with you. Laubeller, go with them, and attend to all their needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my queen,\u201d an attendant responded as she came over to Marilu and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around thirty seconds of awkward silence, Queen Calle spoke up again, \u201cHuman and Marilu, please take all the time you need to discuss this. We would be happy to host you for however long you want to stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Queen Calle,\u201d you thank the queen again, and Marilu does the same. \u201cSabrene, was it? Thank you for waiting for us. I think we are ready to go now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease follow me,\u201d Sabrene instructed. She guided Marilu and you down several hallways until you came to an ornate wing of the palace. In the wing, you see several well-dressed Kichi primarily tickling, but also being tickled by, Kichi in servant outfits. Feathers adorn the walls, although some of them have been taken off to be used in the ticklings that have caused laughter to fill the air. \u201cThis is the wing for the noble quarters. I must say, Queen Calle must be very impressed with you to invite you to stay here. Not very many non-nobles even get to see this wing. Here is your room.\u201d Your room is very similar to the outside, with feathers adorning the walls, as well as paintings of Kichi dressed like the ones you saw outside tickling both other Kichi and foreign species. Several beds, all with restraints on them, were around the room under the paintings. \u201cIf you need anything, please ask Laubeller, and as the queen indicated, please feel free to take your time discussing her proposal. She did not say this, but the way she talked to you, I don\u2019t believe that she necessarily wants you to only talk about it while you are here. Laubeller can fill you in on the other activities that you are welcome to participate in here. I hope to see you again, but I do have to go back and do my job for the queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Marilu thanked the Kichi guard before she left. \u201cWell, human, what would you like to do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s the equivalent of pleasure worlds, except tickle worlds focus on just tickling you while you stay there. To summarize them, several ticklers tickle you all over day and night, with just a few breaks per day. This may sound like tickle torture, but their ticklers are specialized in making sure that their ticklees are having fun while being tickled. When the tickling is getting exhausting and torturous, the ticklers lighten up on the more sensitive areas and focus on the areas where the ticklee just giggles instead of taking breaks. I will say that I have never heard a bad review of a tickle world, and every tickle world that I have been to, I would go again. When I asked them, the employees of the tickle world said that their favorite type of ticklee is one with an extremely ticklish tummy, as it is a very easy spot to toy with and multiple ticklers can be there at once. This means that you would be very welcome as a ticklee, so you would be able to pick your ticklers at the tickle world. However, this is just a suggestion for you. I should get back to business. Are there any other species that you are particularly interested in meeting? We could possibly provide a place to ensure that you make contact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was told that the Erimosi would also like me to make contact with the Ufu, Yathi, and Giglin species,\u201d you reveal to Calle. \u201cIf it is in your power to provide a place for this, I would like to meet these species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can provide contact with the Ufu and possibly the Yathi, but we have not established any relations with the Giglin yet,\u201d Queen Calle informs you. \u201cIn fact, there is an Ufu embassy on Feather Jewels, if you would like to us to introduce you to them there. For the Yathi, we would have to go to Tail Slithers. It is another Kichi planet where the Yathi have established an embassy. Of course, if you do not want to meet another species yet, we can delay the introductions. What would you like to do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Luckily for you, since so many jurors sided with you, your tickling sentence will not be as harsh. You will be tickled for four hours a day for these two days, and the tickling can be divided up significantly. All tickling will be on your bare belly, and your ticklers will clarify any further questions you have when you get to your cell. In addition, since your Kichi representatives failed to successfully represent you, they will also be sentenced to two days in the tickle dungeon. The tickle trial will now be adjourned.\u201d You are unlocked and taken out of the courtroom by two Kichi guards, who bring you to a cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are in the cell, the guards sit you down on a chair and tie your arms above your head. They leave the cell, and a few minutes later, two new Kichi enter. \u201cHello,\u201d one of them addresses you. \u201cMy name is Wufof, and my partner is Oveuza. We will be your ticklers during your tickle dungeon sentence. Before we begin your tickling, do you have any questions about what will happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you answer. \u201cCan you go over what all this sentence entails? The head juror wasn\u2019t really clear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wufof declares. \u201cBasically, you have been sentenced to a very small time in the tickle dungeon. The Kichi would like to know more about the human species\u2019 ticklishness, specifically on the midriff, so we will be performing a total of sixteen tickle tests on your stomach. Each test will be approximately fifteen minutes long, and some will be structured so one begins right after the last one ends. In addition to this, we will also tickle your tummy for another three hours, but not test it then. All this tickling will be divided up so that you do not get exhausted, with thirty minutes of tickling at a time maximum. Once that tickling session is done, you will get at least a thirty-minute break so you can recover. You can yell out a safe word that we will give you if you need the tickling to stop during part of the three-hour free tickling span. If you say the safe word during the tests, we will inform you that a test is going on, finish the test, and then give you at least two hours afterwards for a break. Also, you will be kept healthy, as we have healing liquid and food so that you do not become weak during your short time here. Four hours today will be spent tickling you, and you will get four more hours of tickling tomorrow, making eight hours in total. Does that answer your question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d you respond. \u201cI have another question. What kinds of tickle tests will be performed on me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of the tests will focus on how your midsection reacts to being tickled by different tools and methods,\u201d Oveuza informs you. \u201cThese include fingers, tails, feathers, feather dusters, tongues, raspberries, squeezing, writing utensils, electric brushes, standard brushes, oils, and tendrils, and we will test each all over your abdomen. The purpose of these tests is to observe how the molecules inside the human body react when each different substance hits a very ticklish spot. This tells much about the sensitivity of the ticklee, including why the spot is so ticklish and how to safely make the spot more sensitive. Of course, we will share this information with humans if they do not already possess it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d you interject. \u201cYou can do all that with just a fifteen-minute tickle test? Humans have definitely not come that far in science, at least not on tickling. We will be very interested in the results when you get them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am glad you are excited, human,\u201d Oveuza states, smiling. \u201cThe Kichi are always happy to share scientific discoveries with fellow allied species, which humans are set to become. Of course, we are also always happy to find out any species\u2019 ticklish weaknesses and ways to exploit them, in this case to help both Kichi and human have fun while a Kichi tickles a human. If you would like, I can also put in a request to include what happens when a Kichi\u2019s belly is tickled, along with your test results, in the information delivery to your ship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d you confirm. \u201cHumans also would like to know how to most efficiently and enjoyably tickle the Kichi so that both species can have fun as the tickler and the ticklee. Also, sorry for getting so off topic. You were telling me about the tests that you were going to perform on me, and I interrupted. If there is nothing else on the molecular analysis of tickling, can you please continue with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was all we have on the molecular analysis,\u201d Oveuza affirms. \u201cWe will also be performing a spot test on your midriff, which will tell us the most ticklish part of the human midriff. There is also one test that takes up two sessions, and we will not be your only ticklers for it. We are bringing in a total of ten ticklers to tickle your tummy and test how you react to a sudden gang tickling. The practical application of this test is to see how well humans would stand up against a common method of interrogation practiced by some species, where they bring in several ticklers to torment the most ticklish spot of the prisoner. In most cases, the ticklee gives up the information in a short time, but some species last significantly longer than others. I do not believe anyone has lasted thirty minutes, but we will keep our promise to stop if you endure it that long. In that test, you will be asked an extremely revealing question and then tickled until you give up the answer. Following your \u2018surrender\u2019, Wufof and I will lightly tickle you for the remainder of the thirty minutes. I know that might sound horrible, but keep in mind that these tests are to get a better feel for the relationship between humans and tickling, and they are not designed to purely torture you. We will be extra careful to make sure you have plenty of time to recover from that tickle session, and just so you know, your answer from that test will not be recorded or leave your cell. All of the equipment for our tests is in the back of the chair that you are sitting on, and it will automatically record data as you are tickled. I believe we have explained all the tests to you. Do you have any further questions?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It is on the way to the tickle club, anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want to pay for the Quills Hotel?\u201d Marilu questions. \u201cThat is the most expensive hotel on Feather Jewels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you have shown us a wonderful time,\u201d Nolujo responds as the four of you walk out to a circular car. \u201cYou deserve the best we can offer.\u201d Nolujo and Marilu get in the back of the pod, while Reclos and you take the front. A comfortable ride takes you to a large building, and Reclos stops by the entrance, allowing Nolujo, Marilu, and you to exit and head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter the massive lobby, you are amazed by what you see. Thousands of feathers and Kichi symbols line the walls, and everything is ornately decorated. \u201cWelcome to the Quills Hotel,\u201d a Kichi receptionists warmly welcomes you. \u201cHow may I help you tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA suite for two,\u201d Nolujo requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny extra accommodations?\u201d the receptionist asks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeat for the human\u2019s breakfast, and anything else they would like,\u201d Nolujo answers, getting out a card from her pocket. \u201cPut all of it on my card.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be 375 chooks,\u201d the receptionist announces before taking the card. \u201cYou will be in Room 425. Your attendant will lead you there and take any luggage you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your stay!\u201d Nolujo encourages as she heads out and another Kichi comes out from a door by the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d she greets Marilu and you with a wide smile. \u201cWelcome to the Quills Hotel. I am Rinaba, and I will be your attendant for the night. Here are the keys to your room.\u201d She hands a small keycard to both Marilu and you as you get in an elevator. After she presses the button for level 4, Rinaba turns back to you. \u201cSo, what brings you to Feather Jewels?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork,\u201d Marilu comments happily. \u201cWe contract with Navel Enterprises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d Rinaba replies. \u201cWe get many customers working with Navel Enterprises to come here. Would it be too much to ask what you contract in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInterrogation,\u201d Marilu responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you must be pretty good ticklers, then?\u201d Rinaba assumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Marilu proclaims. \u201cWe enjoy our job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you would like it, the hotel has some tickle slaves that we could bring up to your room,\u201d Rinaba declares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Marilu dictates as the elevator comes to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust let me know if you end up deciding to take them,\u201d Rinaba states. \u201cFollow me; your room is not too far from here.\u201d After thirty more seconds, you show up at a room. \u201cHere it is. Room 425. The chambermaids will be here in just a minute, and just dial the front office number if you would like anything from me. I will be happy to provide any services. Enjoy your stay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unlock and open the door, and Marilu follows you in. Like the rest of the hotel, you are amazed at the d\u00e9cor that the suite exhibits. A few feathers are on the wall of the first room, along with a Kichi painting and some symbols. A large bed sits on the right side of the room, and a cabinet resides beside it. Walking past the bathroom into the other room, you find a similar setup. \u201cWhich room would you like, human?\u201d Marilu offers you the choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll take this one,\u201d you choose the second room. \u201cAlthough both look very nice. Do you know what Rinaba meant by the chambermaids would be arriving soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have heard of this hotel, but I have never stayed in here,\u201d Marilu responds. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything about chambermaids, though, so I\u2019m not sure why they are coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a knock at the door. \u201cRoom service!\u201d a Kichi voice calls in. You head over and open the door, showing two Kichi with feather dusters standing outside. \u201cHello, you must be one of our guests tonight. We are pleased to be your chambermaids. Have you ever stayed at the Quills Hotel before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you say, still wondering why the chambermaids are in your suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we are happy to welcome you to your first stay here,\u201d the maid kindly comments. \u201cNow, we will have to ask each of you to go and lie down on your beds. Get comfortable.\u201d Reluctantly, you obey the chambermaids, and one of them follows you, leaving the other with Marilu. \u201cOne of our customs at the Quills Hotel is to tickle all guests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, the feather duster that the chambermaid is holding has made contact with your bare belly. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you laugh as the ticklish feeling. \u201cOHOHOHOHO NOHOHOHOHO! NAHAHAHT THEHEHEHE BEHEHEHEHELEHEHEHE!\u201d The duster continues its ticklish journey across your sensitive stomach, making short stops at your bellybutton and each of your sides. You try to squirm away and block the tickle attack, but it is no use, as the feathers consistently maintain contact with your midsection. A while later, when you have no idea how much time has passed, the feather duster finally come off and stop tickling you. Still giggling, you take a few minutes to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for allowing us to provide you with an insight to our customs,\u201d the chambermaid addresses you. \u201cRinaba should be back soon to explain some of the choices you have for the night. Let her know if you would like to have us come back to tickle you more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heads into the other room, and then both maids leave the hotel room, leaving you with Marilu. \u201cWell, that was unexpected,\u201d you admit to your companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of,\u201d she allows. \u201cTickling is pretty important for Kichi society, so it can be expected. I wasn\u2019t thinking it would be that intense, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to respond when the door opens and Rinaba walks in. \u201cHello, again,\u201d she pleasantly greets you. \u201cI hope you had fun with the chambermaids. Their dusters always seem to find the most ticklish places on our guests and make them giggle with excitement. However, I am not here to dwell on our chambermaids\u2019 actions, although you are free to give me comments about them, good or bad. I would like to notify you of some of our services that you can choose to pick from. I believe I told you this earlier, but we have tickle slaves that we could bring to your room and let you tickle for the night. In addition to this, we have specialized ticklers that can tickle you, along with the chambermaids. The chambermaids are particularly ticklish themselves, so if you get the chance, you could engage them in a tickle fight. We also have a variety of oils and ticklishness enhancers that you can use to enhance your or others\u2019 ticklishness. You may pick and choose from the list, or suggest something. I could not have covered it all, and we hopefully have what you are looking for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll get one of those tickle slaves for the night,\u201d Marilu states. \u201cWhat about you, human?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Kichi start tickle fighting at a young age; Kich is a very dangerous planet. Let me explain it to you. Kich is notorious for having many native Kichi taken and sold into tickle slavery. On the planet, tickle slaver gangs will do anything to get tickle slaves, and many Kichi are afraid of them. Sometimes they even threaten schools to make them hand over a certain number of students as tickle slaves. When someone is taken into tickle slavery, they are often tickled by their kidnapper in order to coerce them to go into the vehicle. Kichi learn how to tickle fight in order to be able to defend themselves. If someone is going to try to force you somewhere by tickling, knowing how to tickle fight can allow you to gain the upper hand and defend yourself. We get very good at tickle fights so that we can protect ourselves from the tickle slavers. With that in mind, do you still want to have a tickle fight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about what Marilu has just said. If this is all true, you probably don\u2019t have much of a chance against her; she\u2019ll probably tickle you silly before you can lay a finger on her. On the contrary, if you don\u2019t do this, you may never to have the chance to tickle her again. \u201cI think that we should still have one,\u201d you decide. \u201cMercy will be the safe word to stop the tickle fight. However, because you have the obvious advantage of being trained to tickle fight, I get a feather duster to make the fight fair. Is that acceptable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can have two feather dusters,\u201d the Kichi confirms. \u201cNevertheless, there is still one more thing required to make the tickle fight fair, and this is why I am allowing you to have two dusters. You must take the top of your spacesuit off so that both our midriffs are bare. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree that only one of us having their most ticklish spot exposed makes for an unfair fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d you affirm, removing the top part of your spacesuit. Once you have done this, you go over to the tickle table and retrieve two feather dusters. You turn around and face Marilu, who is about two meters away from you. \u201cWhat\u2019s the winner\u2019s reward?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that the loser should have to go through a ten-minute bare belly tickling from your computer on that table,\u201d Marilu announces. \u201cThe winner can tickle them anywhere else during the ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like an acceptable reward,\u201d you respond. \u201cWell, are you ready to start? Ready, set, go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the signal to begin the tickle fight, the Kichi quickly slithers over to you and\u2026</span></div></div>",

She hurries back to her ship, and you sit down on the chair near the tickle table. Two minutes later, she drives in on a vehicle with a large crate on the back of it. You go to the back of the vehicle, seeing that the crate is actually magnetically attached to the back of the car. As you observe the crate, you notice that it is about six meters long and wide and seven meters high.  \u201cThis is a mobile tickle crate, along with the car that can move it. In here are two machines. Come in, and I\u2019ll show you what it can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarilu goes up to the door of the crate and unlocks it using the car key, and the two of you walk in. Once you are in, you look around and see two tables in opposite corners, with chairs near each of them. Feathers and feather dusters line the back wall, while electric toothbrushes and brushes are along the right wall. On all the walls, everything is locked in clear cases, with a small door to open each case. Bottles and bottles of baby oil cover the left wall, and small contraptions fill on the wall behind you. On the far left corner, you see a few small machines with vertical X restraint patterns, probably for upper body tickling. In the final corner, you see several sets of stocks, most just for feet but one set of double stocks. \u201cWhat are each of these for?\u201d you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with these tables,\u201d Marilu dictates as the two of you both observe one of the tables. \u201cThey are identical tables, so I\u2019ll just explain one of them. This is the control screen. Before I tell you about it, you can use this machine alone or have someone else controlling the machine. First off, the ticklee will expose all of their tickle spots and stand right beside the control screen and have a body scan. This will give a layout of their body for when the tickling screen comes up. Next, you tell the machine if there is just a ticklee or if there are ticklers present. Press \u2018single\u2019 for if you are alone or \u2018multiple\u2019 if there are other people there. After you select one of these, the next screen that will appear is the bondage screen. You have the options of being restrained in an X, Y, or I position. Following bondage, if you selected \u2018single\u2019, the tickling screen comes up. You select tools, spots, and the tickle speed, and once you are done with that, you select a time. This can be done multiple times so that you can have different kinds of tickling during your session. Once you have done this, you get into the position on the table, the restraints secure you, and the tickling commences. The tickling will go where you entered for as long as you selected with the tools you chose. However, if you need to stop in an emergency, the safe word is \u2018blue\u2019; the tickling will stop if you say that. This is how the single program works. If you had selected \u2018multiple\u2019, after the bondage selection, the ticklee gets on the table and is restrained. The tickling screen comes up, and the other people can move tools to body parts and select a speed. On here, once a tool has reached a body part on the screen and has been assigned a speed, it comes and begins tickling the ticklee in that spot. Multiple tools can be put on the same body part, and tools can also go to multiple body parts. In order to make a tool stop, just remove it from that body part, and it will retract from the tickling. There are three ways to completely stop the tickling session. First off, you can press this red button, which will immediately stop the tickling; the second way is to move all of the tickle tools away from the body on the screen. The final way the tickling stops is if the ticklee says the safe word, \u2018blue\u2019. That is how the \u2018multiple\u2019 program works. Any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d you answer, still comprehending the powers of this tickle table. \u201cWhat are you going to talk about next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can talk about the vertical chains or the stocks next,\u201d the Kichi gives you the options. \u201cWhat would you like to learn about first?\u201d</span></div></div>",

This machine requires that all the tickle spots on the upper body be exposed, probably the belly, armpits, and ribs for humans. Like the tickle tables, this can be used by one person or multiple people, and the ticklee stands in front of the control panel to have their body analyzed. At this, the chains will move to the correct places to restrain the ticklee. The body analysis not only picks out body parts on the ticklee, but also determines the most sensitive spots on the ticklee\u2019s upper body. Once the ticklee is restrained, if no one presses the flashing \u2018multiple\u2019 button on the control panel in one minute, the machine will ask where to tickle, giving the ticklee verbal options with a visible diagram to aid. The ticklee picks a spot, and if it is the stomach, the machine will ask whether the tickle spot should be the sides, bellybutton, or the whole midriff. Also, the ticklee can request multiple areas in either stage, such as both the armpits and the tummy. When the tickle spot or spots have been chosen, the machine will display tickle tools and inquire which tools the ticklee wants where. You can mix and match tickle tools, and you do not have to use all of them. Following each selection of a tickle tool, the intensity of the tool is chosen by the ticklee, and then the ticklee informs the machine how long they want each tool to tickle them. After all of this, the tickling occurs, and that is what happens if there is no separate tickler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there is another tickler, they can either just tickle the ticklee themselves, have the machine do the tickling, or combine the two. The involvement of a non-machine tickler will cause tickle tools to be placed within the tickler\u2019s reach so that they are able to tickle their prisoner. Should the machine do any tickling, the tickler will dictate this similarly to the way the tickle tables work. Machine-only tickling runs like the \u2018multiple\u2019 setting on the tickle table, while combined person and machine tickling is controlled like the \u2018single\u2019 program on the tickle table, where the tickling routine is selected before it starts. However, I must warn you that non-machine only and combined person and machine tickling often leads to a tickle torture situation. Lastly, there is also a safe word on the vertical chains for any situation; it is \u2018green\u2019. The saying of the safe word, even through laughter, will cause all tickling to cease. Non-machine ticklers will be suspended by chains from the ceiling until the ticklee is released, at which point they will be let down.

Like the other machines in here, you can have just a single ticklee or ticklers and a ticklee. The ticklee always has to stand in front of the stocks; it will scan your lower body for ticklish spots. For the single ticklee, you press \u2018single\u2019 on the screen, and it will bring up the tickling screen. The tickling screen will only contain anything on the front side of the stocks. Similar to the tickle tables, you just move the tool to where you want it and assign a speed, a starting time, and how long it will last. Once you are finished with this, you get in the stocks, and the tickling commences when you are locked up. That is how you control the \u2018single\u2019 method. The other mode, \u2018multiple\u2019, works exactly like the vertical chains, and it also has all of the features that the chains do. For the stocks, the safe word is \u2018orange\u2019, and it will stop all tickling. Any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo the double stocks operate differently?\u201d you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey scan your entire body to alter the restraints if necessary,\u201d Marilu states. \u201cFor instance, for the lower body, they would reduce the number of holes to one because I only have a tail, and they would put it at the appropriate size. The double stocks also restrain your arms, but the machine was not made to tickle any upper body parts. That said, if there was a live tickler present, they could have the machine tickle your feet while they tickled your upper body. This could lead to a very torturous predicament for the ticklee and a fun situation for the tickler. I must note, however, that the safe word will still be acknowledged, and the upper body tickling will still cease. Are there any more questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think I get it now,\u201d you declare.</span></div></div>",

I hope that humans and the Kichi can have a productive and friendly relationship. Have fun on your adventures, and make sure the next prisoner you interrogate laughs as hard as we did in that machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was fun to meet you, also,\u201d the Kichi proclaims with a smile. \u201cYou are certainly welcome for the mobile tickle crate; it was the least I could do to help advance humanity. Like I said before, you and I had a good time here, and so you deserve the gift to assist your species in becoming a powerful race in the universe. I hope to see you again, and I hope that I get another shot at that ticklish tummy of yours. I assure you that the relations between the Kichi and humans will be friendly and productive for both sides. As for your final request, I will try to make all of my ticklees laugh as hard as we did before they give me their information. Now I have two last suggestions for you as we depart; you are free to reject one or both of them if you want. First off, your bare belly is extraordinarily ticklish; don\u2019t cover it up! Embrace your extreme ticklishness and expose your tickle spots. I can assure you that life will be much more fun and exciting if your tickle spots are exposed. Most aliens in the universe enjoy tickling and show off even their most ticklish spots for easy access. Secondly, let yourself get tickled a ton. Getting tickled is a way to have a weakness exposed in an enjoyable way, especially if the ticklee is very ticklish and therefore laughing hard. As well as having a good time being tickled, the vast majority of alien species love being the tickler. This is a very common method of getting to know other races because of the pleasurable aspect of it. I have no doubt that given the chance, humans will relish the opportunity to laugh as they are tickled by all sorts of aliens. If you allow yourself to be tickled often, it can be both profitable and exciting, and it can open all sorts of doors for you. Tickle testers make very good money, and extremely ticklish people like you are the most sought after tickle testers. Of course, you are free to reject one or both of these suggestions, but I have learned that these can lead to a happier life. That is my opinion for you. Goodbye, and I wish you fun and very ticklish adventures in the universe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye, Marilu!\u201d you call out as she begins to leave your ship. \u201cHave exciting and ticklish adventures, too!\u201d The Kichi turns around and smiles at you, then waves goodbye and slithers back onto her ship. When she is gone, you head back to the cockpit of your ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDisengaging from the Kichi ship,\u201d Erin broadcasts to you, and your ship floats back into free space. Marilu\u2019s ship separates from yours, and within a minute, she activates her warp drive, leaving you alone again. \u201cWell, captain, you have successfully made contact with the Kichi species.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI think that after having completed a mission, I\u2019m going to relax here for a little bit,\u201d you tell Erin. \u201cI have a few questions for you to learn more about the universe. Right before she left, the Kichi told me that many species use tickling as a way to get to know other species. Is that the \u2018strange custom\u2019 that the Erimosi told us about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Erin responds. \u201cTickling has widespread use, and its enjoyment in many species makes it a normal sight. It is usually a peaceful way for different alien races to find common ground, so it is often used in first contact situations, as you have already experienced. In some cultures, it is actually illegal to cover up ticklish spots because of the amount of tickling that goes on. You would be given time to adapt to the custom because it is humans\u2019 first contact there, but the typical lawbreaker would be forced to bare their tickle spots and then sentenced to public tickle torture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, they would be sentenced to a public tickle torture for not showing off their tickle spots?\u201d you wonder. \u201cAren\u2019t governments prevented from using torture to punish criminals?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, tickle torture is a standard punishment in many prisons, and tickle interrogation is often used to extract information from unwilling aliens,\u201d Erin explains. \u201cThese are both legal and endorsed by governments in an effort to lower crime; all other torture is banned throughout the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I need to make sure I don\u2019t break any laws and I should be fine, right?\u201d you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should tell you a few things with regards to that,\u201d Erin declares. \u201cFirst off, you will likely be given immunity because you are a peaceful representative of another species, and at the very least they will explain the rules to you and give you time to get in line with them. You will not be sentenced to any punishment for unintentionally breaking rules, and you will probably not be required to adhere to most customs during a short stay. Switching gears, if you encounter individual aliens, you will not have all the protections of government officials. In most cases, this will not make a difference, but some aliens will not hesitate to take advantage of vulnerable, ticklish humans. Due to the widespread popularity of tickling, tickle slavery is very common in the universe, and the Kichi in particular are heavily involved in the tickle slave markets. They typically will capture innocent victims and sell them into tickle slavery for a profit. I should note that people and families owning tickle slaves is legal in most nations here, although there are rules about how an owner can treat their slaves. In contrast, using tickle slaves to gain profit is almost universally illegal. With all that said, the vast majority of tickling that goes on is for the mutual happiness of tickler and ticklee. Many businesses make tickle tools and machines to emphasize the enjoyment of tickling, and high ticklishness is actually a respected trait among the universe. Additionally, most pleasure worlds and the equivalents of Earth theme parks have tickling as a central theme in them. The fun that is an inevitable part of basic tickling is the reason why most species enjoy it so much and allow themselves to be tickled a ton. I encourage you to enjoy all the tickling that occurs during your adventure, both getting the chance to tickle others and being tickled yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Erin,\u201d you state after the long explanation. \u201cI have one other question regarding my contact with the Kichi. If I\u2019m so ticklish and they kidnap and sell tickle slaves, why didn\u2019t I get taken as a tickle slave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I was telling you about the Kichi, I told you that they like to rely on cunning,\u201d Erin proclaims. \u201cYou must have convinced the Kichi that you were not going to be manipulated easily, so she was not able to trap you. Other than that, another reason could be that the Kichi you encountered took a liking to you. One of those reasons is why you are not a tickle slave now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you reply. \u201cNear the end, the Kichi mentioned \u2018tickle testers\u2019 and said that they make a lot of money. Can you elaborate on that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said earlier, the popularity of tickling in the universe has created companies dedicated to making tickle machines,\u201d Erin announces. \u201cThey hire ticklish aliens as tickle testers to test out their machines to ensure that they work as intended. Since most of the job involves extended periods of being tied up and tickled, tickle testers have high salaries to keep them there. Nevertheless, while the majority of companies are honest and pay their tickle testers, a few businesses use tickle slaves as testers to achieve maximum profit. This is illegal, and governments are trying to crack down on it, sentencing the people involved in these deals to maximum prison time. Ironically, in prison, they will inevitably be forced to endure long sessions of tickle torture, which is what they did to others in order to get incarcerated in the first place. However, if you get to a good company, being a tickle teeter would be a very profitable occupation. Typically, a tickle tester only has to work about twenty to twenty-five years before they have enough money to retire comfortably and live until ninety years old. Another option for tickle testers is working for a military. Since tickling is a weakness for every species, all of the fighting is done with tickle weapons. Governments pay double to triple the amount private companies pay their tickle testers because tickle weapons are designed to tickle torture their ticklees. If you are brave and ticklish enough to test tickle weapons, you should have a long and fun retirement. Does that answer your question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you answer, not expecting the long answer from Erin. \u201cWell, I think I\u2019m going to\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Let me have my fun!\" Your laughter continues to increase in volume as she teases your heels. Scrunching your soles only encourages her to force the tail tip into the wrinkles and tickle even harder! As you wiggle and squeal, you start to realize she has been wrapping further and further up your body... she's going to leave you completely helpless if you don't do something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slides from across the table to be closer to you, never letting up the tickling. \"Such a pretty laugh...\" As she gets closer, you notice her own midriff is bare... you begin to wonder if this might be your chance! \"Come on... laugh for me...\" This could be your last shot! Before she can wrap your arms, you have to tickle her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to reach out... and then....</span></div></div>",

However, in that brief second, you start to feel your mind getting cloudy, your eyes having trouble on focusing on anything, your ears not hearing anything else, other than the sound of Miranda's silky voice. Slowly, your body begins to relax in the grip of Miranda's coils, a goofy smile crawling on your lips as her tail climbs higher and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't the sound of my voice just sound so <i>delicious</i>, you ticklish human? You just <i>adore</i> hearing me talk, don't you?

Starting to giggle anew, your mind doesn't even want to try and escape. In fact, you start to think that maybe this tickling wasn't so bad at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA midst your girlish giggling, you hear the Kichi's honey-coated voice say...</span></div></div>",

Looking into those strange reptilian eyes makes your head feel cloudy, but in a pleasant way. As if you were floating on a cloud. You nod, a silly grin still plastered on your hypnotized face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goood\u2026\" Miranda hisses slowly. \"Now, I can't say I care for these human clothes. Kichi garments are so much prettier, wouldn't you agree?\" Miranda sits up straighter, arching her back and showing off her exposed, curvaceous form. You nod again, and honestly you'd have to agree even if you weren't compelled to. She's quite the attractive alien, and her revealing clothes only accentuate it. \"Yess, I knew you would. Now, would you like some Kichi clothes of your own? You don't have to say anything, just giggle if you agree.\" Miranda tells you slyly, as that tail tip of hers makes another teasing circle around your belly underneath your shirt. You easily comply, giggling at the ticklish strokes, the thought of batting away that tail with your hands somehow not occurring to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda taps a few buttons at a control on the table, and to your astonishment clothing starts to materialize on the table! The top is just like Miranda's, a tight black material that wraps around your chest and shoulders almost like wide tape. The bottom piece is a skirt that would be scandalously short on each, barely covering your rear and exposing the entirety of your thighs. \"There, just your size!\" Miranda coos, continuing to tease your belly with her tail, the tip softly wandering across your trembling skin, tickling effortlessly as you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I'll have to stop tickling you to let you put these on.\" Miranda says in a pout, her tail reluctantly withdrawing from underneath your shirt. After a moment you finally stop laughing, feeling the giddy aftereffects long after the dexterous appendage has pulled away. \"Now, slip into those and meet me on the bridge, my lovely little human!\" Miranda commands, and you snap to obey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miranda slithers to the front of the ship, you quickly disrobe out of the things you had previously been wearing underneath your spacesuit, little more than undergarments really, and into the even skimpier clothing given to you by Miranda. The fabric feels soft and comfortable against your skin, although something about it strikes you as odd. The inside of the garments are somewhat fuzzy or velvety, and as you start walking in them it brushes against you in a distinctly ticklish way. It moves against your rear and upper thighs in a feeling that makes you giddy, and the way the top brushes against your breasts makes you want to blush. While it tickles, it's also a strikingly pleasing sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't dwell too long on the clothing, as Miranda's command rings in your mind. You have to join her at the bridge! You follow her to the forward section of the ship, finding her nestled in what was effectively a large beanbag, the seat perfect for the snake-tailed woman. Miranda beckons you closer as she quickly taps on a wide panel of instruments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come human, come! Sit on my lap here!\" Miranda says, patting herself. You slowly walk forward, obeying the command, although a tiny voice in the back of your mind starts to begin to wonder why you should do everything the serpentine alien says. \"Excellent! I'll have plenty of time to cuddle and tease you before we arrive.\" Miranda tells you, wrapping her arms around your bare midsection as you lay on her. Her fingers gently stroke across your belly, exploring every inch of it in a way that makes you wriggle against her. She tickles with a slow and steady hand, as if not wanting to wear out or overwhelm you too quickly. It makes you wonder how long she's planning on tickling you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'll just engage the autopilot, and we can have a nice, tickly snuggle, my pretty human pet!\" Miranda coos at you as she tickles. \"Because I am going to take you\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

This sounds amazing to you and you happily nod along to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the snake woman's hands creeps to just below your breasts and the other gos down to your thigh, and she continues her ticklish exploration of your exotic body. \"You will be quite the prize my pet, infact i imagine most of my kind would commit quite a few crimes just to have one of you.

Despite the fact she's essentially taking you as a slave/pet her words are strangely comforting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda coos and caws as she gently tickles you, after a few more minutes of gentle exploration she smiles and whispers in your ear, \"Ahh my pet i see you're quite ticklish on your...\"</span></div></div>",

Say pet, did you know that most of us kichi are actually most ticklish where you would consider our waist to be? Its just that non Kichi tend to be terrible at tickling compared to us so they just don't find the right spots\" she says as she guides your hand to a certain spot on the area where her snake portion transitions to her more human portion. \"Try it out a bit pet, but be gentle. I was not kidding when i said were quite sensitive there!\". You lightly glide your nails across the rough and slightly scaly skin. Even with the gentleness with which your tickling when your hand passes over a certain spot she bellows out with a hearty laugh and squeezes you unintentionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, human you seem to be just as good at tickling as you are at being tickled!\" She says as she swats your hand away from her waist. She worms further into her bean bag and loosens her bear hug she still had on you. \"Let me tell you about myself human, For the first few years of my life i studied the great minds of my race, sir slargoth, madam microarch, and many others. Once i was old enough to engage in research i quickly began to study the art of tickling and I worked on some revolutionary eye implants that would allow us to hypnotise even those of my own species. After 3 years of study i finnaly had a breakthrough and i was well on my way to finishing the project. But about three months before the product was ready i was kidnapped by a rival corp. They held me for six months and attempted to tickle torture company secrets out of me. Saddly for them i was quite well trained on resisting such attempts and eventually a joint strike by my corporation and the local government set me free. Because i did'nt give up the info and because i then helped finish the project my corp decided to award me with a executive level retirement package. I usex the money to invest to the point that i now make a living off of just stocks and i can cruse this beuty around the galexy. I was actually planning on full stop retiring from everything, maybe buy a mansion and a few tickle slaves, but now that i have you, my dear, i may just forgo getting those other tickle slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relax into her chest as she tells you the story, with foggy eyes you watch the cosmos stream by you, patterns forming in the brightness of hyperspace. You both sit in silence for a few minutes reflecting on your life journeys. Miranda moves one hand onto your breast and asks, \"what does your species call your chest mounds, ours are fairly pointless and they arn't very sensitive but yours appear to be quite the oppisite.\". You recline onto her and reply, \"We call them breasts, ma'am. They are indeed pretty important to our species, our young suckle them and they release a nutriant rich milk. As such they are quite sensitive to pain and tickling.\". \"Fasinating.\" She says quietly, shifting her hand back towards your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you are speeding through space at an insane spped, breaking the spped of light like one would break a horse, time seems to go by slowly. You and your master make alot of small talk but she had stopped tickling you long ago and now you just cuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship slowed down and you heard the AI state \"gravity well detected, sub-light thrusters engaged.\". Ahead of you is a great orange star, still fresh with life and likly still having a few billion years of life in her. You still can't see any planets though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our new home human, Sol.\" The Kichi says with a happy smile. \"Sol? Thats the human home star!\" You said in confusion. Miranda responded with equal confusion, \"Odd, must be a translation error, out stars name also means home star. I assure you that this is quite a different star.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trip is much quicker, the powerful thrusters and the small ship size mean that even at sub-light speed the ship still goes stupidly fast. Soon the Kichi homeworld comes into view and both you and the Kichi get up to examine the amazing sight, the Kichi is sure to look into your eyes for awhile to make sure you stay sedated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is my home planet human. Just a thousand years ago it was mostly desert, but 300 years ago we began to push the desert back and now most non preserve land is either a tropical paridise or rollong flatlands. Most of the world was once covered in  mega cities but once the colony arch ships left property in the core systems became insanely expensive in an attempt by the core government to push Kichi to the frontiers. Rioting was pretty rare even by the people forced off their land because the if a family seriously wanted to stay they could find a way, also the mega cities were shitholes anyways. I grew up on a frontier so i havnt called this planet home for too long. Now for the most part the cities have been scrapped for materials and theres just the ocasional mansion or mega mansion. Because of our adaptability we are able to live in some pretty extreme environments so we have enough land to no longer need large cities anywhere. Truth be told my pet, you are a very lucky woman. If you had been picked up by a frontier colony ship they would have just sold you to the highest bidder regardless of their morals. Not to say im very moral but i like to think im in the 5th percentile of morality for my race\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.. you said you didn't own property earlier, where are we going?\" You ask now rather concerned. \"I actually do have a small wharehouse property, i was planning on buying a one use insta builder pod but even for me they're quite expensive, but i think i will get one in a few days. For now you'll just have to live in the whare house, pet.\" And once again her words oddlly sooth you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship glides through the sky, gentle as an alien's feather. Somehow the ship breaks atmoshphere quietly, very diffrent than the shockwaves made by earth ships. You and Miranda land in the hanger of her modderatly large wharehouse just in time to see a outgoing cargo ship leave. Inside the facility you see a great host of crates and robots through the ship window. The robots are fairly similar to the automated wharehouse bots of earth but they are floating on great pads that project a blue light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guide you to you temporary room human!\" She says with her standard smile \"Its been a few weeks simce ive had this much open space!\" She says slithering off into the great stacks of crates. You quickly follow her down the winding hallways. You eventually arrive in a hallowed out cargo container, inside is a large bed, a fridge, and other basic ammenities. Your master hands you a pair of glasses and says, \"These will keep you calm, theres going to be alot of culture shock\" you put them on and they keep you in a constant state of calm and hypnosis (you of course don't know this). </span></div></div>",

It's not terible but it is distracting. Instead you get up and spend a few minutes figuring out how the hell the water cooler worked. It was a sealed black cube with an internal resivoiur. A small spout was on the side that faced you, in addition there were four buttons. The first two you pressed made a mechanical whirl noise. The next sent out a stream of mild water. The final button sent out a puff of hot steam which you just managed to avoid being burned by. Turns out that the first two buttons made the first dispencer toggle between crushed ice or mildly cold water while at the same time toggeling the second dispenser button between hot water and steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hour passed quickly and slightly tickley the former due to the many odd machines in your room and the latter due to your fuzzy breast coverings. A gentle beep comes from your glasses letting you know its time to go, on a whim you say \"show time\" and to your supprise it actually does. It appears that these glasses are like our smart watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set off onto the path that appears on your left glass lens. It takes you down one of the more busy paths, a host of bots glide past you in both directions giving you just enough room to walk down the center of the path. Its fairly trippy to you now that you think about it, just this morning you left earth as an explorer and now you were a servant of a mildly important alien. Is this how the men who first landed on the moon felt? Sure eventually it became common place to visit the moon but all those years ago it wasn't so maybe they felt the same way as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe map leads you to a side room with a closed room. You knock on the door and it swings open, then once you enter it swings shut and locks, looks like this is happening. Ahead of you is a spiral stair case which you journey up till you find another locked door. You knock and hear Miranda's voice tell you to come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open the door the lights are off, shes clearly going to suprise you with something. You step through the door with a sly smile and a slight eye roll. Suddenly Miranda flies at you, stunning you and wrapping part of her tail around your legs constricting them. 'Oh yeah' you think to yourself, 'Snakes are really good at jumping huh?'. She has your legs completely stuck, and then she pulls you around so your facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing pet?\" She asks. \"Uhh... fine... startled would be a better descriptive word.\". \"Oh, sorry for the startle dear but i wanted to show you this room at a gradual pace.\" Just as she says this the rooms lights turn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in a carpeted room with 3 doors on each side of the room, you entered via the south door, there is also a exit/entrance door on the far north wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda pulls you toward the first door on the west side of the room. \"As you know you are my tickle pet, obviously this will involve tickling which is what i have theese rooms for!\" She says turning you around so you wont be able to see inside then unlocking and opening the door. \"This room is just a warm up room, you'll be getting used to it.\" She flips you around the room showing you it. From what you can tell she'll put a code into a panel then whatever she calls for will be taken out of the warehouse and deposit it in the room. The room is a decent sized room that could fit about 10 people comfortably. On the right side of the room is what looks like a coat hanger but which has a variety of basic tickle tools: alien feathers, brushes, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my pet, do you want to just cut to the chase or do you want to warm up?</span></div></div>",

You do and she lets go of your legs. She then puts your other hand it the strap and then does each of your ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay human, you ready?\". \"As much as a human turned tickle slave could be!\" You reply. She grabs a feather and slithers to you and begins toying with your stomach. \"A fun fact on the kichi race, we origionally despised tickling.\" She said befor doing a quick flutter of the feather on your stomach. \" but after some time we realised that such a weakness was the greatess weakness we had... so we purged it.\" She draws a circle around your naval. \"Starting from when we open our eyes first our parents tickle us, then as we grow older we tickle our friends and they tickle us.

Then she starts digging the feather deeper into your side. She suddenly stops and just stares at you, but before you can ask her what happened she just says, \"Such an odd race.\" Before she starts to work on your other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-h-hnd you-hoo said it-a gets worse from here?\" You struggle out. \"Well as you saw back on the ship we are much more ticklish then you in spots, but it is my duty to press you to the limit. Anyways i wantes to finish my little speech on my species,\" She stated dragging the feather from the top of your side to the start of your thigh slowly, eliceting a series of smaller giggles as she continues her story. \"Anyways, eventually we become obsessed with tickling to the point where our greatess weakness at birth is out largest strenth by our teenage years, about 23-45 years in your time. I tell you all this because i don't plan to hold you forever, one day you will return but...\" she quickly begins drilling your naval with the feather making you laugh till you gasp, \"today is not that day!\" She finishes.</span></div></div>",

The woman\u2019s hands move back towards her stomach to try and be protective, but you move your fingers in, and her hands swipe past your attack. At this point, the Kichi starts realizing that her defense is ineffective, and she closes her eyes, allowing her laughter to go up in pitch. With the Kichi immobilized, you go for her bellybutton, and your luck just keeps growing.<br>\r\nOnce you start tickling her bellybutton, the Kichi\u2019s tail starts uncoiling from around your ankles, leaving your bare feet free from the tickling.

If you resist at all, this feather will make a quick trip to your tummy and attack that navel of yours. Once you are found, we will head back to my ship, and you will be restrained there. I will come back here and acquire the necessary tools to make your slavery fun for me, by which I mean tickle tools. After that, our ships will disengage, and then I will have plenty of fun tickling you, especially that bare belly of yours. Your ship will just float free in space until someone decides to pick it up.\u201d The Kichi just nods, and you untie her. Even though she puts up no resistance, once her hands are again restrained, you make the feather enter her bare bellybutton and swirl around. Miranda breaks out in hysterical laughter and squirms side to side, to no avail. Following five minutes of torturing the Kichi with the feather, you stop and force her onto your ship. You tightly tie her down in your cockpit, and then you return to her ship, leaving her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving in the Kichi ship, you begin to investigate to find out what she has here. You eventually find a cart, which you take back to her stores of tickle tools. After filling up the cart with familiar and new tickle tools from the alien\u2019s collection, you roll it back onto your ship. You open a container on your ship that was meant for storing gifts from the aliens and place all of the tickle tools in there. Bringing the cart with you, you hurry back to the Kichi ship to acquire even more tools to torture Miranda with. You end up procuring four carts full of tickling tools from the alien vessel, and once this is all done, you return to the cockpit. \u201cErin, disengage from the Kichi ship; we\u2019re going away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume we are taking the Kichi with us, Captain?\u201d Erin inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Miranda is my tickle slave,\u201d you confirm. \u201cShe tried to tickle me into a trap, but I ended up tickling her and making her submit to me. She then gave me the choice to take her as a tickle slave, and I took that choice. I have acquired everything that is necessary from her ship, and we are ready to depart from it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Captain,\u201d Erin responds. \u201cI would like to inform you now that there is a large market for tickle slaves in the galaxy, and it is not a criminal organization. In fact, Kichi tickle slaves are very rare, so they sell for very large sums. If you would like to, we could go to a tickle slave market and sell this Kichi; you would probably be able to get enough money to purchase about ten tickle slaves. This would allow you to interact with other species of aliens as well as coming out with another tickle slaves and likely tons of money. Of course, if you would like to keep the Kichi, you still have some options. You could just float around in space and tickle your new slave, or I could give you more options of what we could do. What do you want?\u201d</span></div></div>",

If you had stood up a second sooner, your helmet would've smacked hard into a control panel, but thankfully you were still belted into the seat. \"What the\u2026!\" you cry out, looking frantically at your instruments. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question is soon answered by a stern feminine voice on the communicator. \"Alien vessel. You have entered a restricted zone. This is the personal space belonging to the Kichi Imperial Family. By order of Princess Shaiya, your ship will be boarded and you submit yourself to questioning by the Imperial Guard. Do not resist.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? This is all a mistake!\" You protest, hailing the Kichi ship back. \"Please, I didn't know this area was restricted! I'm just trying to make peaceful contact with\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kichi, apparently belonging to some kind of Imperial Guard, interrupts you. \"Save your breath, alien. I don't know who or even what you are, but I'll figure it out during official questioning.\" The Kichi ship cuts off communications, and you feel another jolt as the larger ship presses forcefully against your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, what's going on? Why is she ramming us?\" You ask, hoping to make some sense out of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our ships are docked with each other, but she's linking us up in a way that keeps us from disengaging.\" Erin tells you. \"When I figured out she was trying to lock onto us like that, I tried to break the link-up. Apparently she didn't like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to hear sounds on the other side of the airlock, your mind racing as you try to figure out what to do. \"Can we warp away? Is there anything we can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, captain.\" Erin responds. \"The warp engines need time to recharge. Even if they were ready, we can't warp while attached like this. Either both ships would get torn apart, or we'd warp somewhere together. I don't think either of those helps. For now, we're stuck.\" Erin pauses for a moment, as if consulting her databanks. \"But the Kichi have no record of harming prisoners or criminals. Even if they assume the worst, they shouldn't hurt you! If you can explain to them you aren't a threat, everything should be ok!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about that last part. Erin's got a ton of information stored in the ship's computer, so its probably true that the Kichi don\u2019t hurt their captives. Then again, the Kichi just now didn't exactly sound friendly. But if they're going to interrogate you, you still have the truth on your side. All you wanted was to make peaceful contact. Hopefully you can sort that out with the Kichi, and get on with it. And just who was this 'Princess Shaiya' the Kichi mentioned? Did you stumble onto some vacationing noble with an over-protective bodyguard? Before you can think too hard about any of that, the airlock of your ship begins to open.</span></div></div>",

You gulp, unsure as to whether you could take all of them at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I activate Protocol: Repel? You know, the one the Erimosi gave us just in case something that we <i>didn't</i> like invaded our ship?\" Panicking, you nod your head, not even knowing what 'Protocol: Repel' will do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here goes nothing!\" As alarms started to blare across the entire ship, you hear from behind you the door to the cockpit open, a Kichi Guard standing between you and the exit, her feather spear already pointed towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you must be the captain of this ship. Now if you would just put your hands where I can see them, I'm sure we can resolve this <i>diplomatically</i>.\" Gulping, you started to raise your hands, panic rising in your mind. Just as she was within an arms length of you, multiple mechanical two-clawed arms shot out from hidden sockets in the cockpit, grabbing at the surprised Kichi, and pulling her airborne towards the ceiling, her feather spear uselessly rolling to the ground in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go this instant, flesh-ling, or you'll be sorry! Wait, no, stop... Don't do tha-hahahahahahaat! Kehhehheehhehee!\" As the Kichi burst into a frenzy of giggles, you move to the side, seeing the claws that were grabbing around her hips start to vibrate vigorously, causing the Kichi to explode in a burst of ticklish spasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... gnrhrhhgg... Let me go... Right now-hahahhahaa!\" Head shaking with laughter, you see the arms move up and down her ribs and sides, their ticklish vibrations making the normally proud guard shake her head wildly, hands clenching and unclenching in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this was Protocol: Repel, Erin?\" Hearing a happy beep sound from your console, you move past the giggling Kichi Guard to your main living area in the space ship. Walking past your bathroom, you found it locked, hearing what seemed to be a multitude of mechanical arms inside, along with the laughter of another Kichi Guard. \"WAIT NOT THE BRUSHEHEHEHEHHEHEHHEE! STAHAHAHHAHAAAP! DON'T 'CLEAN' MEHEHEHEEE!\" Shaking your head in pity, you proceeded on wards to your main living quarters, checking to see if anything was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you opened the door, you come face to face with a feather spear, the tip of it almost touching your nose. \"Deactivate your defense systems on this ship, or I will help to <i>convince</i> you myself-HEY!\" Grinning, you see two mechanical arms grab at the Kichi's own, pulling her into your bed, before a blanket ties her down to the bed, leaving only her head exposed. As more hands slowly crept into the blanket, you hear Erin's voice over the intercoms, \"Initiating Wake-up procedures.\" As the hands started to poke and prod the trapped Kichi, you slowly see her facade crack, a wide smile appearing on her face. As soon as Erin said \"Initiating Phase 2\", you heard the Kichi before you scream out in laughter, before struggling like mad to get out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, you headed on towards your cockpit, seeing various Kichi being kept busy by your ship systems. One Kichi was fighting against your Egg-Beater, which had magically sprouted feathers on it's ends, while another two was trapped lying and sitting on your couch and chair respectively, both of them getting tickled by multiple mechanical appendages with feathers on their ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally reach the cockpit to decide what to do...</span></div></div>",

The Kichi next to you in the cockpit is held aloft by Erin's mechanical hands, which continue to wriggle up and down her sides. The alien woman is curled up in laughter, but the hands continue to wriggle against her hips and up to her ribs, keeping her in hysterical laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA screen showing your bathroom has another Kichi squirming in the shower as hands and brushes rub her all over, soaping her up in what seems to be the most ticklish way possible. Erin has the shower door locked, leaving the Kichi stuck with the plethora of tickling instruments. The Kichi on the bed is wrapped up tightly, but the blankets aren't thick enough to protect her from more of Erin's arms, little hands poking at her ribs and belly. Other hands appear to be snaking their way underneath the blanket for even more mischief. You recall Erin saying something about \"wake up procedures.\" With a shiver, you try to remember not to hit the snooze button on the rest of this trip, wondering if Erin was just making a joke or had that in mind for you, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main room, two Kichi had their backs to each other as they attempted to fend off feathery mechanical tendrils extending from the wall. You have no idea where Erin got all those feathers, but it seems to be working. The Kichi are outnumbered ten to one. For each one they bat away, at least two more wriggle against  their skin, stroking underarms, sides, even grazing over the tops of their breasts. And in the kitchen\u2026 well, you had no idea so many cooking utensils could be turned to ticklish purposes, the Kichi soldier on the ground, curled up and laughing as she doesn't even try to fend off the horde of brushes and feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, it seems like you've got things under control here. I'm going to go take a look at the Kichi ship. Keep them occupied, ok?\" Erin gives another happy sounding beep. It must be taking a lot of her focus to tickle six aliens to tears. It's a curious defense mechanism, but then again the Kichi all seem to be very ticklish, a fact you file away in your mind for future reference. If they're aggressive, you have an unconventional weapon against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to the airlock, not bothering to take your helmet. The air between the two vessels had already been mixing, and it looks like both species breathe the same kind of atmosphere. You walk across to the other ship, looking around. There's a wide entrance area, and inclines instead of stairs for the snake-like aliens. The lights of the Kichi ship are dimmer than yours, but still visible. You move quietly through the ship, wary in case there are other Kichi guards still around. But as you move from room to room, the ship seems deserted. Apparently all of them came on board in an attempt to capture you. Even the bridge is empty, although with the alien controls you couldn't hope to operate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize there's one room you haven't entered. Near the bridge is a closed door with a control panel to one side. You decide to push one of the buttons randomly. The door begins to open!

As you are about to leave the Kichi ship to return to your own, however, you notice what appears to be a machine in the corner. Curious, you walk over to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to examine the machine, you notice that the outside is covered in symbols, which you assume are part of Kichi writing. The machine is open, so you look on the inside. There you find that several feathers rest on the sides and on the lower part of the front. In addition to this, there is a chair in the middle of everything. You look up, and restraints appear to be at the top, right next to a button. The button seems placed so that one can only press it if one\u2019s arms are through the restraints. Wondering what the button does, you sit down on the chair, put your hands through the restraints, and press the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the restraints close around your wrists, and the machine shuts, trapping you inside. Hands come out from the bottom side of the machine and put your ankles in different restraints, and the feathers rush to your exposed sides and feet. All at once, the feathers hit their targets, and you break out in ticklish laughter. \u201cHAHAHAWHAHATAHA ISHA GOHOOING OHOHON?\u201d you scream. The feathers torment your ticklish tummy and feet, tracing out ticklish patterns on you. After a few minutes of the tickling treatment, you finally think to hit the button again. The button releases you from the tickle torture, the restraints loosen, and the machine opens up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreed from the tickling, you get out of the machine and look back. Is that what these Kichi guards were protecting? A tickle machine? You think back and realize the logic of the methods of Protocol: Repel. However, you thought you should probably get back to your mission: establishing relations with the Kichi. You could go back over and talk to one of the Kichi guards, try to establish some common ground with one of them so they wouldn\u2019t be so hostile. But the tickling maybe wasn\u2019t so bad, after all. You did get to control how long it was.

First of all, you don\u2019t get to ask any questions. A violation of this will get you tickled. Secondly, if you refuse to answer a question, I will tickle you. Thirdly, if you give an unsatisfactory answer, I will tickle you. Basically, I\u2019m going to ask you questions, and if you do not give me a good answer within a reasonable time, you get tickled. Do you understand?\u201d Chae nods, so you continue, \u201cWhy is this part of space restricted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Kichi Imperial Guard is passing by here to go back to Princess Shaiya,\u201d Chae answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the first human to ever have contact with the Kichi,\u201d you announce. \u201cWhy would you suspect that I am here to harm you, even though there is nothing to indicate it? I even informed you that we were on a peaceful mission before you boarded, and I was not lying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe needed to make sure,\u201d Chae replies. \u201cWe are never sure of the intentions when a ship docks with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lie,\u201d you claim, tickling the Kichi\u2019s stomach again with your fingers. \u201cYou slowed down and let us link up with you. If you did not want us to link with you, you should have just sped by and avoided us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTAHAHAP!\u201d Chae yells in ticklish laughter. \u201cI\u2019HIHIHILL TEHEHELL YOUHUHUHU!\u201d You stop, and Chae catches her breath for ten seconds. \u201cWe did not recognize your vessel. Since we were heading back to the princess, we wanted to make sure that you were not planning on taking over our ship. If you had done this, you could have easily lured the princess in and taken her hostage or killed her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then why did you board after I told you of the peaceful mission?\u201d you demand to know. \u201cI identified myself and my purpose before you came on, but you still came at me armed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said before, we hoped to be sure of your mission,\u201d Chae dictates. \u201cWhen we were convinced of your peaceful intentions, we would have quickly let you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were going to tickle the truth out of me?\u201d you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is what would have happened,\u201d Chae confirms, a little more relaxed. \u201cYou would have likely been released within the hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I be sure that you are telling the truth?\u201d you inquire, grabbing her feather spear from the ground. \u201cMaybe I should use the same tactics that would have been used on me.\u201d You look over the spear for a few seconds, feeling the feather at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s no reason to do that,\u201d Chae stutters, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that you are telling the truth yet,\u201d you proclaim, turning back to Chae. \u201cI think that I need to, as you were going to do to me, tickle the truth out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWielding the feather spear in your right hand, you put the tip of the weapon on Chae\u2019s right armpit and start moving it back and forth. \u201cHAHAHAHA!\u201d she laughs out as she squirms around in the bondage. Using the spear to tickle the first armpit, you begin wiggling your fingers around Chae\u2019s left armpit. \u201cNOHOHOHO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep tickling Chae like this for five minutes, and then you suddenly stop. \u201cAre you sure that you have told me the whole truth?\u201d you interrogate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she quickly answers. \u201cI told you everything that I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced,\u201d you reveal. \u201cErin, I\u2019m going to need some help with this. Can you get her stomach and feet? I\u2019m going to keep tickling the armpits.\u201d The mechanical claws return to Chae\u2019s sides and feet, vibrating as they make contact, while you put the feather spear and your fingers back into her hollows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOHOHOHO!\u201d Chae begs with panicked laughter. \u201cPLEHEHEHEASE STAHAHAHAP!\u201d The Kichi prisoner squirms around, trying to escape the tickle torture that you are putting her through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still don\u2019t think you are telling the truth,\u201d you declare. \u201cI think that you were going to tickle me until I told you that I was here to harm you, even though it would have been a lie. You would have used that to take me prisoner aboard your ship, and then you would have been able to keep tickling me. That was the real reason you allowed us to dock with you. You just wanted to make me a tickle prisoner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHAHALRIHIHIGHT!\u201d Chae yells out ten minutes later, giving in to your story of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, we can stop tickling her now,\u201d you announce, taking away the feather spear. The mechanical claws stop tickling and immediately retreat, and you give Chae a chance to catch her breath. \u201cDid you agree to my statement? Were you just here to tickle me until I gave you the opportunity to make me a tickle prisoner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she admits. \u201cWe were hoping to bring back a tickle prisoner with us, and we acquired one yet. We were almost done with the mission, and we were desperate, so we decided to link up with you and tickle you. The ship can get pretty boring when there is nothing really significant to do, and a ticklee would have been a nice distraction for us. When you tried to convince us of your peaceful mission before we boarded, we thought that you would be easy bait. We figured that since you would not want to compromise the peacefulness, you would have given into anything, even tickling interrogation. Once we started interrogating you, it was only a matter of time before you confessed to something. Confession would have meant that we could keep you, and you would be our new tickle prisoner. That is the real reason that we boarded the ship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick the feather spear in her bellybutton, making her laugh a little more, and then you cease and proclaim, \u201cWell, now that you have come clean, I might be able to make something work with you. You see, I still want to make peaceful relations with the Kichi, and now you know for sure that this is the truth. I want you to understand that I would not have tickled you like this if you had not come aboard my ship with such a hostile attitude. Is that clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Chae acknowledges. \u201cI see that now, and I apologize for my crew\u2019s behavior. It was for a fun reason for us, but I now realize what the consequences would have been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I could go and meet this Princess Shaiya of yours,\u201d you suggest. \u201cYour crew, with the exception of you, would have to stay on board being tickled to ensure that you do not try to deceive me again. We could begin to make peaceful relations there, and perhaps our species could return to our homes with a better understanding of each other. How does that sound?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Chae agrees. \u201cOn one condition. After we finish making the relations, you must release my crew back to my ship. That is all I ask of you, and we will make sure that you can go in peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs all of your crew on my ship?\u201d you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we all came over,\u201d Chae affirms. \u201cWe were going to thoroughly investigate your ship while a couple of up took you back onto our ship and tickled you. When we got back to the princess, your ship would have become one more of hers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes the princess know that you have encountered me?\u201d you question. \u201cIs she expecting to have my ship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were only going to tell her after we had you,\u201d Chae informs you. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind, will you please answer my question? I\u2019m still curious about my crew\u2019s future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey will be released after the relations are established,\u201d you consent. \u201cIt would go against my mission to keep them held here. Necessary measurements on the Kichi species will be obtained while I am meeting with Princess Shaiya. Do we have a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would be happy to make peaceful contact with you,\u201d Chae dictates. \u201cIf you want, I can guide our vessels back to the outpost. On the contrary, I could also give you the coordinates, and you could fly us there. I will speak for you to ensure that we get in safely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease give me the coordinates, and I will get us there,\u201d you request. Chae complies, and soon Erin has prepared to launch there. \u201cErin, please release Chae so that she can help me contact the Kichi outpost.\u201d Chae is released, and she comes and sits in the copilot\u2019s seat, although you keep her feather sword close to her stomach. After this, you get in your seat, strapping yourself in, and Erin secures all the other Kichi so they will not be affected by the flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swift Feather and the Kichi ship go jointly to the Kichi outpost, and as you near there, the outpost makes radio contact with you. \u201cHello, who is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChae of the Imperial Guard,\u201d Chae identifies herself. \u201cI have with me a vessel with a human on it. They wish to make contact with our species, and we thought it would be best if we talked to the princess. I have confirmed the peaceful intentions of the human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will happen,\u201d the Kichi on the radio states, recognizing Chae\u2019s attire. \u201cI\u2019m transmitting landing coordinates to you now. Your ships are being given priority clearance for landing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more thing,\u201d Chae broadcasts. \u201cI am the only Kichi coming off the ships. My fellow guards are going to be used to give the humans the measurements for our species. I have already given them permission for this.\u201d The Kichi on the radio nods in agreement, and Erin guides you down. When you land, both you and Chae unstrap yourselves from the seats, and Chae informs her crew of what will happen while the contact is being made. \u201cOnce we are done, the human will come back on board, and you will be released. You are to come straight back to our ship, and the human will go in peace.\u201d You ensure that your helmet is on good, and then you join Chae to head out of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Four Laughs, home of Princess Shaiya,\u201d a Kichi guard announces as you follow Chae to the ground. \u201cPlease come with me; the princess is waiting for you in earnest.\u201d The two of you trail the guard inside the alien base, and walk for a long while. When you stop in front of doors, the guard motions for them to be opened, revealing a very well decorated room. \u201cI present to you, Princess Shaiya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome!\u201d an alien joyfully proclaims from a throne as you and the entourage walk in. The doors are closed behind you, and you get a chance to observe the room. It is very ornate, with decorations all around. \u201cI am Princess Shaiya of the Kichi. Please come and sit down here.\u201d Two chairs are quickly brought on either side of the throne, and Chae and you sit down. \u201cSo, my guards tell me that you are a human. If I am not mistaken, our species have not met before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d you confirm. \u201cI was hoping to make peaceful contact with the Kichi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that you have met Chae,\u201d Shaiya observes. \u201cShe is one of my greatest guards. Chae, what do you think of humans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey would make a great ally,\u201d Chae speaks highly of humans. \u201cWe do not want to make enemies with them. Peaceful relations would be in our best interest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then it is settled,\u201d Shaiya declares. \u201cWe shall have peaceful relations. In addition to being one of my greatest guards, Chae is a great judge of these things. I also heard that you are keeping some of my other guards on your ship to collect measurements. While you are getting those measurements, I would like to request that we get some quick measurements on your species for our scientists.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you respond. \u201cI have no problem with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScientists, it is time for you to come over and evaluate the human,\u201d the princess tells some scientists. They head over to you, and you allow them to take your height and weight. After this, they ask you a few questions, and you tell them common foods for humans, what humans breathe, and basically everything they will need to know about the typical human. Once this is all done, Shaiya continues, \u201cThank you so very much. If you need any further measurements that the guards on your ship cannot provide, let us know and we will send someone for you. There is one more test that you must undergo, but we cannot do it here. Chae will be sufficient for this, so if you could both please follow me.\u201d Chae and you get up and go with Princess Shaiya to a different room, unaccompanied by Kichi guards. \u201cThe last test will be us tickling you. We are very interested in the sensitivity of different species to this phenomenon, so we would like to measure how ticklish you are. Although typically we restrain the ticklee, for the measurement, we would like to make you as comfortable as possible, so you will not be bound. You may keep your helmet on, as we want you to be able to breathe, but for the best measurements, we ask that you please remove the spacesuit and your shoes. I assume that you are wearing something under it.\u201d You nod in agreement, so she continues, \u201cChae will be tickling you, and then I would like you to tickle Chae. I will then tickle you, and you can tickle me afterwards. Please lie on the bed when you are ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove the spacesuit, leaving you in your underwear, and head over to the bed. Chae slithers over, still wielding her feather spear. \u201cHow long will this last?\u201d you ask as your tickler approaches, a slight gleam in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThirty seconds on each spot per tool,\u201d Shaiya orders. \u201cYou will be tickled on your armpits, ribs, belly, legs, and feet with the feather spear, Chae\u2019s fingers, and Chae\u2019s tail. The measurements will automatically be collected; this is a laboratory. When this is done, you will tickle Chae for ten minutes wherever you want, and then I will tickle you for three minutes. You may end the session by tickling me for three minutes wherever you want. Chae, can you please start with the human\u2019s\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

The spear begins to go back and forth, and you immediately break out in laughter, revealing your sensitivity. \u201cHAHAHA! THAHAHAT TIHIHICKLEHES!\u201d Trying to defend yourself, you jerk your left arm down, but Chae uses this opportunity to switch armpits, causing you to laugh even more. The thirty seconds feel like five minutes of tickle torture, but then the guard pulls the feather spear out, letting you rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are very ticklish, human,\u201d Shaiya observes as you get a break. \u201cChae, the human\u2019s ribs will be the next target.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thirty-second break, the Kichi takes her feather spear and puts it on your ribs, waving it around. \u201cNAHAHAT AHAHAGAHAHAIN!\u201d you yell, as your ribs are just about as ticklish as your armpits. The feather tickles all over your bare ribs, which highlights your sensitivity. Enjoying her control over you, Chae keeps the feather spear waving at a very quick pace, and your laughter increases in pitch significantly until the tickling stops at thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am definitely looking forward to tickling you myself, human,\u201d the princess announces after Chae takes the feather up. \u201cNow it is time to tickle that belly of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, you instinctively cover your stomach, but Chae removes your hands, placing them above your head but not holding them there. The feather spear then returns, waving over your left side and then making its way over your tummy. Extremely ticklish here, you squirm violently to try and get out of the feather\u2019s path. \u201cNOHOHOHOHO! AHANEHEHWHEHERE EHEHELSE!\u201d The Kichi guard quickly inserts the feather spear into your bellybutton for a few seconds, and your laughter jumps up a few pitches at this. \u201cPLEHEHEHESE!\u201d Once the feather gets out of the bellybutton, Chae uses the feather to tickle the rest of your squirming midriff and your right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you are really going to hate the tail tickling there,\u201d Shaiya proclaims as Chae stops. \u201cThe legs are next up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the Kichi moves the feather down to your legs and begins tickling your skin. You relax at this, as your legs are not as ticklish. \u201cHEHEHEHEHE,\u201d you giggle, enjoying the test finally. No matter where Chae tries to get you, she cannot find a significant tickle spot on the legs for the thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that this is a more fun tickle spot for you,\u201d the princess states right after the tickling concludes. \u201cThat might be a spot where we can tickle you for relaxation. Last but not least is the feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChae lies her upper body on your ankles, preventing you from moving your feet away from the tickling. The feather spear starts at your heels, which causes you to start to move your legs as it tickles. \u201cHAHAHA!\u201d Knowing how to control her ticklee\u2019s squirming, the Kichi guard easily keeps your feet still as the feather comes up to your soles. \u201cNOHOHO!\u201d Your wriggling gets a little bit more pronounces as a more sensitive spot is it here, and it only gets worse as Chae puts the feather in and around your toes. By the end of the tickling, you are laughing crazily and writhing in ticklish laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, human,\u201d Princess Shaiya declares as Chae ceases the tickle torture. \u201cThe next thing we will use to test you is Chae\u2019s\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Surely they'll figure out your not here to harm or spy on this Princess of theirs? You re-establish communication with the other ship. \"Kichi imperial guard, this is the human vessel Swift Feather. I am the only sentient on board, and I am willing to come on board your ship and submit myself for questioning. I have nothing to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the same stern voice of the Kichi guard on your speakers. \"We will see about that. Enter slowly, with no weapons, and without that helmet you are wearing. Make no sudden movements.\" Sighing resignedly, you comply, removing your helmet and strapping out of your seat. You move to the airlock and to the now open airway forcing a connection from your ship to the Kichi vessel. You walk on board slowly, raising your hands above your head and trying to look as non-threatening as possible. \"Here I am, I mean no harm! I come in peace!\" you say slowly, as you enter the ship. The air inside it is dry, but otherwise normal, and you can smell a vague aroma of spices. Is that how Kichi smell, or is there some kind of perfume in the air?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think about such things too long, a Kichi woman enters the room. Slithers, you could say, as her lower half undulates back and forth, propelling her forward like a snake. While this alien woman isn't wider than your torso, her body is much longer, you can't quite tell how long she'd be stretched out head to tail. Her 'upper half' looks mostly human, although it's dull gold color wouldn't be natural on anyone you've ever met. She doesn't wear much clothing, some kind of black skirt covers the area where her human-like waist ends and the snake-like parts begin. She also has a black shirt that covers her shoulders and breasts, but no more. Both garments are covered with odd symbols, which you assume are the Kichi writing system. Her torso is elongated compared to a human's, her bare stomach stretched long and taut, with a sizeable navel. Her face is also dull gold in color, with snake eyes the color of burnt orange, and jet black hair hanging from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop gawking, prisoner.\" The Kichi tells you, in the same voice you heard before. \"I am Chiy of the Imperial Guard, and you are my captive. Now I will figure out whether you are a spy or an assassin.\" You gulp, if she's already that negative on you, you don't like your chances. Still, you're hopeful this Chiy will listen to reason. The Kichi slithers closer to you, leaning her taller form over you as she lifts herself up on her tail. She reaches out to you with one hand and grabs your side, just above your hip. Whether intentional or not, the squeeze to your side managed to tickle considerably. The fabric of your suit conveyed the feel of her fingertips as if you were wearing nothing at all. You twitch in the grasp, and cough, trying to conceal a yelp of embarrassing laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't seem like you succeeded, as a wide grin spreads on Chiy's face, showing two noticeable fangs. \"Ah, I do believe I will be able to get answers out of you. Now tell me, alien, how did you learn Princess Shaiya would be here?\" You notice your other hand reaching out to grab you as well, as you struggle to reply.</span></div></div>",

It seems to be able to get through our filtration system, and your helmet. Don't breath it in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's too late. The smell of cinnamon fills your nose, and for some reason you can't muster the will to hold your breath. What's the use, anyway? You'd have to breath sooner or later. And this gas probably isn't doing anything bad to you, is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain! This gas has some kind of relaxant and psychoactive properties! I can't tell what it does, but\u2026 captain? Captain, are you ok?!\" Erin calls out to you, but you don't respond. You don't want to respond. You feel extremely relaxed and content. Whatever this gas is, it feels great. If you could just lie here for a while and enjoy it, you'd be perfectly happy. Erin keeps talking, but you stop paying attention, breathing in the cinnamon-scented gas easily. It smells nice. You feel a wide grin spread across your face, leaning back in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it's a little hard to breathe in the helmet, and it's not doing any good anyway. You take it off, letting it drop to the floor. Erin is still talking to you, louder now, but you reach up and mute her, not wanting to pay attention to anything she's saying. You don\u2019t want to pay attention to anything at all. Just the gas. But you also notice that you're starting to feel sleepy. Maybe the warp jump tired you out? Yes, that must be it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up from the most pleasant and restful sleep of your life feeling refreshed and energetic, yet you still feel very relaxed and easygoing. You decide to really lay back into the soft, plush bed that... wait a minute, where are you? You sit up and look around. You are in a rather large room, a rather... personal room even. There was a large window looking out into the cosmos that caught your eye, but you tore your gaze away from the stars to figure out where exactly you were! You saw a mirror with a large, slightly upstanding cushion in front of it to your left, there was a large vine that curled straight up, twisted tightly. The window was directly in front of you. To the right of the window was another plant, this was seemed to look more like a giant 6-foot tall Venus flytrap with a big wide mouth. Periodically its leaves would move as if they caught a breeze despite the air being still in the room. It sent a shiver of fear down your spine. To the right of that, there was a wall, and the realization that this bed was in the center of the massive room facing away from the door, and seemed to take up a sizable chunk of the massive room. Somewhere behind you, a crystalline light shone dimly on the room in a slightly red tint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realized your clothes were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon realized your were also bound loosely, but inescapably. Your arms and legs were covered with sleeves that disconnected at the joints and were made of a strange crimson, slightly luminescent gelatin-like substance. Both segments on each limb had a tube made of the same substance running into the headboard, giving you a comfortable amount of slack, but still not letting you stray too far from your spot in bed, as the connecting \"chains\" would pull you back, and the sleeves would stiffen and become restrictive to the point of immobilizing you. Your chest was bare, except for the tendril of the same material, twisted tight into a thick but soft rope, above your top rib and below your bottom rib, as well as on your waistline. You were also wearing a \"headband\" of the cloth on your forehead. The only clothing you still had on was covering your loins. Taking it all in, you started to worry as much as your still chemically-encouraged-to-relax-brain could muster up, but you didn't have too long to worry, because you heard a scraping noise from behind the bed. You were scared silent as you could hear whatever was coming get closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she came into view. Below her waist, she was a long mass of green tail, a tail which was noteworthy in that it seemed to have all manner of odd indentations on it, but above the waist was where you attention fell. Her garments were exquisitely ornate, made largely of a corset of interwoven chains of some black metal with a simple, yet elegant dark pink cloth wrapped over her ample breasts with a matching one at her waist, directly underneath the corset. Were she human, she would be a supermodel, possibly even if you didn't give her legs to replace her tail. She had long, curly red-tinted black hair that fell to her mid back in the exquisite braids she kept them in. Her skin was between mocha and olive and her face was powerfully feminine. The scariest part of her was her smile, and the scariest part of her smile wasn't her fangs; it was the easygoing, predatory nature of her smile that seemed to be universal among species. And then there were her eyes. Her slightly reptilian, yet massively lively eyes that you could just get lost in... and let your mind get cloudy while you look into her eyes... and before you can even kick yourself for forgetting Erin's warning on the Kichi, you start to fall under her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her charm taking hold of you, she smiled in a much more friendly manner and spoke, her voice light, yet sultry.<br>\r\n \"Greetings, human scout! I am Princess Shaiya of the Yoossem Dynasty, one of the major Kichi sectors. I understand your species has recently been uplifted with the rest of the galaxy, and congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were coming to you, you were understanding them, but what you were truly focused on was her beautiful voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love meeting new species! It happens quite often with the galaxy this cluttered. Us Kichi have a fun tradition. The Dynasty and the other Kichi nations actually make a contest out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer beautiful voice, her ravishing appearance, her hypnotic sway, what is it about her (aside from her perfection) that makes you want to do anything you can to please her and make her happy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much warning, Shaiya swept herself into the large bed with you. Up close, her hair, shining red in the dim light of the room and intricately laced into webs and braids along the side of her head was even more beautiful, and those eyes of hers... her wonderful eyes that seemed to sap you of all will to do anything except what she wanted you to do, they were gorgeous too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she flicked one of her wrists, and your bindings immediately tensed up, becoming as inflexible as stone on your arms and legs. With another flick of her wrist, you were gently contorted until you were sitting on your butt with your legs outstretched and your arms over and behind your head, bent at the elbow. Then she rushed forward, and the next thing you knew, she had you wrapped in her long, powerful tail with her turned to face you. The 'headband' you had on has hardened and you are looking directly in those lovely eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ticklish is your species? I've heard rumors that it's off the charts! Is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to answer her questions out of both confusion and fear. If she was planning on using you to get a baseline...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she started poking and prodding on your sides and belly with small, experienced, tortuous squeezes on your defenseless weak spots. With no chance to prepare yourself, you immediately belt out laughing. <br>\r\n\"HEHEHEY, WAAAHAHAHAIT!!\"<br>\r\nSatisfied with her findings, she lunges herself behind you, wrapping you even tighter, as she starts to run her fingers down your bare feet.<br>\r\n\"THAHAHAHAT TIHIHEHEHEHEHE\"<br>\r\nAs she sadistically traces shapes with her nails on your arches, you lose your ability to even beg through your laughter. After the longest minute of your life, she relents, and moves herself back in front of you, smiling at you while you pant.<br>\r\n\"One more spot to check to cover the basics...\" she starts, evilly. And then, evilly, she slowly reaches forward into your armpits. Even knowing it might upset the beautiful princess with intoxicating eyes (which are, like, stellar, by the way), you start to squirm as she draws out your pre-tickle anxiety by stretching and wriggling your fingers. And then she plunges her fingers into your helpless pits.<br>\r\n\"NOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" <br>\r\nYou couldn't even shake your head as the tickles seemed to radiate from your armpits throughout the rest of your body, so cruel was your bondage. Finally, after a time that would have been hellish if you weren't spending it with the princess, she relented. As you caught your breath, she leaned her head by years and whispered into your ear, \"Our Kichi tradition is to keep the first scout that new species send to explore the galaxy as a pet. I am going to keep you, human. Does that sound like fun to you? We're going to have a niiiice long soft tickly cuddle together while I hold you and pet you! Mmmm, sounds lovely, doesn't it? Is that what you want? To be the pet of a Kichi princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! She wants to keep you! You would get to spend so much time with her as she caressed and stroked you!<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Please, keep me!\" you begged, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin grew wide. She started to very lightly stroke your right armpit with two fingers, it was just tickly enough to get a stream of hearty giggles to pour from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that just leaves one question for us to answer,\" Shaiya hissed excitedly, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How about the Giglin?\" you ask Erin, pointing to the last image. As you ask, an image of one of these Giglin fills your screen. It's female, and like the silhouette indicated, has four arms. The other thing that jumped out at you was the inhumanly bright red color of its skin. But if you ignored skin tone and those extra arms, she could almost pass for human. The woman in the image had long silky hair of a purple/dark red color, reminding you of an expensive glass of wine. Her eyes were a pastel pink, and seemed to be staring right at you, despite being a rotating still image. Ah, and now that you look closely, you can also see two small antennae protruding from the top of her head, poking out through the hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was quite attractive, made all the more apparent by her lack of clothing. A small black garment clung tightly to her breasts, not tied or strapped anywhere, seemingly glued or taped to her chest in a manner which also accentuated her cleavage, pulling her full breasts snugly together. Her only other clothing reminded you of a pair of short shorts, riding low on her hips and only coming down a scant few inches down her thighs. Unless her lack of clothing was for your benefit of seeing what one of them looked like, this race wasn't one for modesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you minded at all, as it gave you a chance to ogle her form. Her hips curved enticingly around a waspish waist that went a bit beyond what human women were capable of. Her stomach was flat and smooth, with only the barest hint of muscle underneath those alluring lines, and her chest was rather impressive as well. Continuing to look up, you now noticed her burgundy lips were voluptuously full, and looked enticingly soft. Did they pick the most beautiful representative of their species for this stock photo or what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done ogling her yet?\" Erin asked you teasingly. \"This is a representation of your average Giglin, at least among the ones we have seen.\" Average? Then there were some of them that were even more beautiful than this one? \"As you can see, they don't like to wear much clothing. Then again, humans are one of the more prudish species in this regard. The Erimosi wear those robes for your benefit, you know.\" Actually, you didn't know that. Then what do they wear normally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin continues to tell you about the Giglin. \"The Erimosi haven't made official contact with the Giglin yet. They're farther away than Earth, and the Erimosi just made contact with you. But this means that humans will be able to do something before the Erimosi! Any information we gather would be very useful and much appreciated when we return.\" The idea that you might be able to do something before the Erimosi is pretty exciting. The helpful aliens have seemed almost godlike compared to primitive humans, and it was as if they had already done everything worth doing. But now they would actually want to learn from humans, from you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From isolated contacts in known space, and information from other races, the Giglin are an isolationist people, preferring to look inward to zealously pursue their own interests. So they don't interact with other races much. But we do know that the Giglin believe in following a hedonistic lifestyle, and that their culture is based on maximizing the physical pleasure of its people. And since they devote so much of their energy to that end, they are rumored to be extremely talented at what they do. I can only imagine what their parties are like.\" Erin tells you, the last bit rather flippantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so a race of beautiful aliens that just want to have fun all the time? Seems like a great mission.\" you say, before you have a concerning thought. \"But if they keep to themselves so much, how would they feel about me dropping in on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unknown, honestly. The Erimosi haven't done it, and information from the other races is\u2026 unreliable.\" Erin answers. \"However, reports seem to indicate that many who enter Giglin space do not come back. Whether because they choose not to or are somehow coerced, or even killed, I cannot say. However, we have no record of Giglin exhibiting violence when interacting with other races.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that part does make you concerned. \"I was just going to warp right into the middle of Giglin space and just say 'hi.' But if they don't like visitors, and might even be hostile, maybe that isn't the best idea. Is there any way we can make contact with the Giglin outside of their own territory?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin pauses for a moment before responding. \"Yes. The Giglin do make a minimal amount of trade with the outside. There is a trade outpost orbiting a planet-less star system where many races meet, and there have been frequent sightings of Giglin there. Also, there is also a vacation world that caters to a number of races. I'm not sure they'd let a poor human in, but you might be able to ask if any Giglin are around, and if they'd be willing to interrupt their holiday to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat does give you options. You could still do the straightforward approach and show up right in the middle of Giglin territory and hope they're friendly to you. But there's some obvious risk there. Merchants probably wouldn't be as hostile, but they also might not have any interest in speaking with you. The same goes for Giglin vacationers. Which to try?</span></div></div>",

Do we have any information on a Giglin homeworld or capitol?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, like I said, the Ermosi barely have any information as it is, and anyone who has reportedly visited has not ventured back. I hope you know what you're getting yourself into, pilot.\" Erin, although an AI, seemed rather worried. Nevertheless, your mind was made up. You had contingencies put in place if anything were to happen to you, but you were hoping this first contact would go smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's risky, Erin, but I feel this is the best way.\" You stated. \"If something happens to me, follow Protocol C24A7, and report all details in a hostility report to the Ermosi. If this is a mistake, the least we can do is help others avoid making the same one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, pilot. Setting a course for Giglin space. Please strap in for departure,\" Erin commanded. You quickly made your way to the Captain's chair and buckled in. After a few moments, your ship vibrated steadily, and before you knew it, you took off at light speed. The G-force rattled your body, but it wasn't so intense as to cause any real disorientation. The effects faded after a minute or two, and after about twenty minutes of light speed travel, your ship came to an abrupt halt, making you quite glad you were buckled up. You unbuckled and stood up to take in the view of supposed Giglin territory. You were quite surprised to see several fairly small planets. There were too many to count, and there's no telling if any of them are even inhabited. You were still somewhat far away from them, but if you had to approximate, you would say they were roughly the size of Mars. Strangely enough, they all seemed to be about the same size, and they also shared the same Burgundy color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Erin, where do we even begin?\" You questioned. There were so many planets, searching them all could prove quite time-consuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could jump from planet to planet to do a proximity scan for any signs life. Or, we could touch down, and you can search the planet on foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

Plus, whoever we meet will at least be used to dealing with other species. We might end up running into complete xenophobes if we pop into the middle of their space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye, captain! I'll get you to the trade outpost before you know it!\" Erin chirps. You feel the pull of your thrusters as the ship rockets out of hangar. While it feels like an entire extra person sitting on your chest, the unpleasant sensation doesn't last long. In mere moments, the rocket has propelled you outside of Earth's atmosphere and into the inky blackness of space. You feel a moment of pride as you think that these conventional antimatter thrusters are completely human made, needing no alien help to get this far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, engaging warp engine. This might feel weird, so hold on\u2026\" Erin says, and you obediently gird yourself. Then there's a flash, and suddenly the arrangement of the stars becomes completely different. You fight off a wave of vertigo from the after effects of the warp jump. Moving dozens of light years in a single moment doesn't come without momentary physical effects. Blinking and shaking your head, you recover yourself and start scanning the area with your instruments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to what the locals call Yvng'plych system!\" Erin tells you as you analyze. You see a red giant star looming large in the view screen, thankfully shielded so you don't blind yourself.  There are no planets, and very little debris. It looks like the star engulfed its children when it expanded into the giant phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, how about I call it 'Kronos?' That's a little easier to pronounce.\" You tell Erin. Scanning further, you notice a large space station orbiting the star at a comfortably safe distance. Ships seem to file and and out at a decent pace, and it appears to be a sizable source of economic exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\" Erin says easily. \"The builders of the station have multiple mouths anyway. I went ahead and messaged Kronos Station, and they've given us clearance to dock. Shall I take us in?\" You nod at Erin, you responds to the wordless command. The ship eases into a docking port, and it again amazes you how quickly and easily the <i>Swift Feather</i> maneuvers. All you have to do is tell Erin where you want to go, and it happens in almost the blink of an eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the pilot seat and head to the airlock. \"The atmosphere is oxygen based, so you're fine without your helmet.\" Erin tells you. \"Just remember, I can communicate with you through your translator in your ear!\" You give her a thumbs up and hop out of the ship, eager to head into the station. You're about to meet aliens no human has ever seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get out of the docking bay and into the station proper, you look around to see more alien species than you know what to do with. There must be hundreds of species here! Most seem to be humanoid, thankfully, but some of them are beyond bizarre. You can't help but gawk like a country yokel as something that looks like a cross between a giant millipede and a seahorse walks in front of you, glaring at you in annoyance as it does. Looking up, you start to think that this station has some kind of space bat infestation. But on closer inspection, you notice signs of sentience in the creatures. Bat-winged aliens no more than a foot tall glide through the air to stop at stalls and barter with their comparatively giant business partners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and focus. You can't stand around and gawk. This place might be great for running into a number of species, but your first mission is to establish relations with the Giglin. Most of these other races are probably farther away from Earth, and can wait for a little while. You try to think about your next move. It looks unlikely you'll just run into a Giglin at random here, Erin said they tend to avoid other races unless they want something. The best bet might be to ask one of the other aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a large, solemn alien manning a stall near you. He looks male, about ten feet tall, and built like a hairless grey gorilla. His knuckles rest his top heavy frame on the floor, next to tables filled with small unknown objects. You could ask him if he's seen a Giglin around, and where to meet them. They might have done business with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also see that one of those small bat-like aliens casting a few curious looks in your direction. It's perched on a railing a few feet away, allowing you to subtly get a closer look at one of them. It's female in a humanoid fashion, you can tell that much from the two piece garment it wears, a pastel yellow wrap about its breasts and in a 'v' shape covering its hips and crotch, obscuring those bits of its light blue skin. The wings are bat-like expanses of skin, and each wing has a three fingered hand at the end. It's face is relatively normal, although the ears a very large and pointed. Short, wild hair looks styled in sort of a Mohawk-like look, although perhaps that's just how it grows on this species. If you could befriend her, she could probably easily scan the crowd from above and find a Giglin for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe it's best not to rely on others. This is your mission after all, and as a human you have to admit your incredibly na\u00efve about how to conduct yourself around a bunch of aliens. You have no concept of the customs and ethics here. Maybe you should try to find a Giglin yourself while revealing as little about you as possible. </span></div></div>",

And you're pretty sure you won't commit an alien faux pas doing that much. You approach the stall, glancing at his wares. Their meaning isn't obvious to you, they all look like randomly shaped baubles or spheres. You wonder if he's selling paper weights or door stops, or if these little things actually do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my good sentient!\" His voice rumbles in a low but clear tone. While you're distantly aware that what he's actually saying is nothing like a human language, your translator muffles the original and reproduces it in your ears as flawless English. \"Can I interest you in an Aequ'ulan pleasure sphere? It is guaranteed to titillate and please to the desired effect of its owner, and the price is very reasonable. I also have an assortment of massagers that should be quite compatible with your humanoid archetype.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no</i>, you think to yourself, <i>is my first run in with an alien at a sex toy kiosk?</i> You look at his objects again with a somewhat renewed understanding, and with a flustered look he probably doesn't pick up on, attempt to get straight to your question. \"Ah\u2026 not at the moment. Actually, I was hoping you could direct me somewhere. I'm trying to meet a Giglin. I know they visit this station, and I'd be grateful if you could direct me to one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien wiggles its nose in an odd gesture that you think is surprise. \"A Giglin!\" he exclaims. \"If that's who you're trying to find, you don't need my wares, do you?\" He seems disappointed, but also it's almost as if he's looking at you more respectfully all of a sudden. Although that question makes you wonder a number of things. \"There's a Giglin ship in isolation docking level 6. No one's seen more than one of them at once lately,  so she may be alone. But you never know with Giglin.\" You thank the alien for his assistance, and begin to turn away. \"Just be careful, will you? No offense, but you don't look like a species with a ton of\u2026\" he searches for the right word for a moment. \"Stamina.\" You can't help but glare at that comment, but thank him again and head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe station is thankfully well marked, and Erin helpfully translates the alien script for you, relaying its instructions as you go. As you walk through the large station, you at least start to get the hang of the numbering system: simple horizontal slashes, then verticals, base 12\u2026 you think you're getting the hang of it. At least until it gets into triple digits, anyway. The attempt to learn the numbers keeps your mind occupied as you wander the halls, moving from the crowded alien bazaar to a much emptier area of the station. <i>Well, he did say it was isolation docking, and the Giglin apparently like to keep to themselves. But what was he implying earlier? 'Don't need my wares?!  Stamina?!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at Isolation Bay 6, you find one ship in its spacious hangar. Assuming it to be the Giglin's vessel, you look it over. It reminds you of a Ferrari back on Earth: it's sleek, curvy in all the right places, and looks expensive as hell. It's painted or made from a pitch black material, which would be almost impossible to get a visual on in space. But here in the well lit hangar, its impressive to look at, and you can't help giving it another look over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel the presence of someone behind you. Turning around, you see a figure covered in a loose black cloak, obscuring its form. However, you notice two small, red antennae poking out from the top of the cloak. A Giglin! \"What are you doing here? What business do you have with me?\" The Giglin asks you in a feminine voice. Despite the stern tone, that voice is like honey, sweet and seductive.  Something in it makes you want to answer her question immediately. Not that you wouldn't anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello!\" you say, taking a more formal stance. \"I am a human, from a planet called Earth. My people have discovered that the Giglin occupy space near our worlds.\" You tell her. 'Worlds' is a slight embellishment, Earth is really the only habitable one we have. But still, it doesn't hurt to count Mars just to get to that plural. \"I have been sent as an representative of my species in order to establish relations with the Giglin. We want to coexist with you in peace.\" You tell her this, feeling nervous at the important moment, and wait for her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to listen to you impassively. \"Relations, is it?\" The Giglin asks with what seems to be a wry tone. \"I have never heard of your people. Interesting. I shall give you what you ask.\" Her tone is short, but doesn't seem negative to you. In fact, it sounds like she's agreed to exactly what you want! You notice movement under her cloak, one of her four arms moving as if reaching for something.</span></div></div>",

A single swipe of the feather is sufficient to cover her entire midriff in fluffy tickles, and she wears down very quickly. Within five minutes, you cannot hear her laughter at all, although she is still smiling and does not appear to be having trouble breathing. You continue the tickle torture for the remaining five minutes, and then you remove the feather. Soon enough, the bat\u2019s laughter becomes audible again, and you hear her beg for mercy, even though the feather has left. \u201cHAHAHAOHOHOHNOHOHOHO!\u201d After five minutes, the alien ceases her laughter and calms down. \u201cThat was some really intense tickle torture there. So, what do we do now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually Erin, could you give me some more choices?\u201d you ask, deciding to dig a little deeper past whatever was just recommended to you. \u201cMaybe something a bit more unusual than just the next door neighbors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, if you insist\u2026\u201d Erin says, her robotic voice having a tone of reluctance to it. \u201cIf I alter some variables, there may be some\u2026\u201d Erin pauses as she re-calculates. \u201cYes, I think this conforms to your commands for \u2018more unusual\u2019 than the four nearby major galactic species. I have two different races for you, first-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alien being appears on your viewscreen. It\u2019s humanoid, but definitely couldn\u2019t pass for a human. For one thing, it\u2019s skin is a rich indigo color and has some kind of sheen to it. She, you notice humanoid female features as you examine her, has skin that reminds you of a tropical frog or something. Instead of human hair, the back of its head has five long tentacles that descend down its back. The fingers and toes also appear longer than humans, and bend in a way that looks like they don\u2019t have any joints. They too resemble tentacles more than human digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a Pentaclid. They\u2019re amphibious, they prefer breathing water but can live in the open air for a little while as long as their skin stays moist,\u201d Erin starts to inform you. \u201cYou might have noticed they secrete a soapy substance to keep their skin hydrated. Pentaclids come from a high gravity water world, and for a long time they never went to space. It\u2019s really hard to get a ship full of water out of their atmosphere, at least until the Erimosi helped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPentaclids typically don\u2019t associate with the other races in I listed earlier, preferring to remain in or near water sources. Each of those tentacles is prehensile, so sometimes Pentaclids are hired to do jobs underwater. If you\u2019re a good swimmer, you could travel to their homeworld and introduce humans to them!\u201d You think about that for a moment. You can swim fine, but having to swim in high gravity sounds tiring. The Pentaclids probably have something for you to float on, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, Erin gives you another option. The Pentaclid disappears from the screen and is replaced by a new alien. This one is humanoid too, but instead of arms it has a pair of bat-like wings. Adding to its bat-like appearance are large pointed ears, with a mohawk strip of hair running between them. The fact and body is otherwise human in appearance. This one is also female, wearing a pastel yellow wrap about its breasts and a 'v' shape covering its hips and crotch, obscuring those bits of its pale skin. As your eyes move down her body, you notice another difference from humans: her feet. She has inhumanly long toes with an opposable thumb, reminding you of a monkey\u2019s or maybe even a chameleon\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis species calls itself the Sill. The Sill are unusually small sentients, the largest are no more than 50 cm in height. They are capable of flight, and preferentially inhabit low gravity worlds and moons. Because their upper arms are wings, they use their toes are as dextrous as human hands. The Sill can hover in mid-air for short periods of time or lightly perch and use those hands as needed. For the most part, Sill technology prefers to use voice commands and other aural cues. The Sill have excellent hearing even outside human hertz ranges. Given their unique stature and small living requirements, the Sill enjoy cohabitation with \u2018standard\u2019 sized humanoids on a number of worlds. There\u2019s even a joint Sill-Erimosi colony!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about Erin\u2019s second option, these Sill aliens. It would be unusual to meet someone who can fly, not to mention an intelligent lifeform that\u2019s so much smaller than you. It looks like this Sill could easily perch on your shoulder. Erin has given you two more options, aliens in the sea, or aliens in the air? Which to choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to scout for a potential colony world. So far, all of humanity is just in one solar system. If human beings want to be taken seriously in the galaxy, we should probably have a few more planets. \"Erin, do you have a list of the best candidates for a human colony?\" you ask your AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, I'm putting four worlds on your display now.\" She tells you, and four globes appear on your view screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The closest is Alpha Centauri Bd.\" She tells you as one of the gloves becomes highlighted. \"Obviously you know about Alpha Centauri. It's the closest solar system to Earth, only 4 light years away. It's not taken because, well, it's in your neighborhood. No other race has really visited your neck of the woods aside from the Erimosi. And they just got here a few years ago. Alpha Centauri is a three star system, and Bd is the third planet around the second brightest star. Got that?\" She asks, perhaps a tad condescendingly. You nod and gesture for her to continue. You assume she can see you as well as respond to voice commands, and she proceeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bd is very Earth-like. The planet is 0.87 Earth masses, and 60% water, 40% terrestrial. Temperature is approximately Earth normal. The star it orbits is an orange dwarf, slightly dimmer and cooler than Earth's sun. But Bd makes up for it by being a lot closer. It should be the ideal place for a human colony. However, due to its three suns, there are rarely any times of night or dark. Because of the constant sunlight, there is very dense vegetation. And the lack of night may have long term psychological effects on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option two is Tau Ceti e!\" Erin continues enthusiastically, highlighting the second orb. \"This one is 11.9 light years away, orbiting a very Sun-like star. This is the fourth planet in the Tau Ceti system. It's 4.3 Earth Masses, which actually isn't that big compared to many planets, Earth is actually on the small side of normal. Don't worry, the gravity is only a tiny bit higher than Earth sea level. You probably won't even notice it after a minute. The downside to Tau Ceti e: it's really hot. The average temperature is about 100 degrees Fahrenheit above Earth normal. This world is full of jungles and steamy oceans. But the poles would be comfortable for humans, and worth exploring. The south pole of Tau Ceti e averages around 80 F in the summer, and sometimes even snows in the winter! Thankfully, there are continents located at each pole.\" Erin tells you. While a swelteringly hot world might not be pleasant, at least part of it might be a good fit for a colony. It wouldn't be so bad to have a settlement at each pole. And some people who can stand the heat might move a tiny bit farther in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option three: Kapteyn b. Kapteyn is a very old red dwarf system. So old that's its actually kind of surprising that intelligent life hasn't developed here yet. This is the closest planet to its small star, and its 4.8 Earth masses. The planet only gets a small amount of red-shifted light from the star, resulting in dark purple and black colored plant life. The mid-day sun on Kapteyn b would only look like dusk on Earth, and there's no moon for any moonlight. But other than that, it looks like a world that would be suitable to humans. Temperature readings appear within human normal, and there's no obvious toxins in the atmosphere. There actually isn't too much information on this world. The Erimosi probe sent here a century ago malfunctioned once it landed. But that means you'll get to figure it out on your own!\" Erin tells you optimistically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last but not least: Gliese 581 d. This is one of the first habitable exoplanets humans discovered on their own! It orbits a red dwarf 20 light years away, and it's a pretty big 7 Earth masses. It's on the cold end of habitable, but still has liquid water. Picture a big Earth experiencing a very major ice age. Gravity is about double Earth standard but\u2026 you're in good shape, right?\" Erin asks you innocently. The cold and double gravity make this world sound the least appealing. You certainly don't relish the thought of weighing twice as much. It's also the farthest away. Then again, maybe it'd be good to claim this one for humanity before some other species decides to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mull over your options. Alpha Centauri Bd is the obvious first choice, but in a way that makes it almost boring. Besides, having no night sounds a little weird. Tau Ceti e sounds unpleasant, but then again it wouldn't be so bad if humans only live on parts of it. That's still plenty for a colony. Kapteyn b, despite being dim to dark all the time, also seems like a good choice, and you find the prospect of learning things the Erimosi don't even know pretty intriguing. And then there's Glises 581 d... cold and heavy. It'd be an adventure, at least. Deciding, you tell Erin to set course to:</span></div></div>",

As the ship gets closer to the planet that looks incredibly similar to Earth, the computer explains a little more about your destination. \u201cAs I said before, Alpha Centauri Bd has a 60-40 percentage ratio of water to land, and its mass is 0.87 times that of Earth. You shouldn\u2019t notice a large change in temperature from Earth, but you will notice that it is very sunny most all of the time. Also, there is a lot of vegetation, which you might want to evaluate as a food source for future humans or domestic animals. The dense vegetation can also supply a more night-like atmosphere, provided that you are in the right spot. Nevertheless, most of the planet follows what I said earlier with night being rare, if it comes at all. Alpha Centauri has ten continents, more than Earth, but the oceans in between the continents are smaller than the oceans on Earth. However, there are several sources of rivers that go through different parts of the continents, and there are more of these in the Northern than the Southern Hemisphere of the planet. There are some wild animals that reside on the planet, and they mostly congregate by the rivers, although some are more dependent on the vegetation, so they live further away. If I sense that you are coming up on one that I have in my database, I will let you know. All that being said, the animals are still not very populous, so you are not guaranteed to run into them during your visit. Well, I think that is a good overview of Alpha Centauri. Where would you like to land?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sounds like a perfect place to start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll be there before you can say 'purple monkey dishwasher' five times!\" Erin tells you, and you hear the engines gear up. With the feeling of thrust pushing you back into your seat, your craft is blasted out of the atmosphere and into the blackness of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give your computer a confused look. At least, you look in the direction of a control panel and speaker, technically Erin is all around you. Or perhaps her 'place' is in the computer matrix below your feet.

It interrupts your question, and by the time your eyes can focus again, they see an alien world. There are lush green of jungles at each pole, with the equatorial regions a mix of barren rock and desert on land, and stormy hurricanes over the sea. You see a tentacle of land reaching southward from the arctic continent. \"Erin, set us down on that peninsula in the north. The poles look fine, but I want to check out how hot it gets that far towards the equator.\" Your AI obediently steers the space craft down through the alien atmosphere, and before you know it is landing gently where you instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are at approximately 64 degrees north latitude, which would put us in Iceland back on Earth. The current temperature outside is 122 F / 50 C, with high humidity.\" Erin tells you, reading out the sensor data. \"The northern hemisphere is in early summer, but the oscillation is mild, so it shouldn't get too much warmer at this spot. I'm detecting dense plant life all around, but the humidity and vegetation are interfering with some other readings. I can't tell if there's animal or animal-like life here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Erin.\" you tell her, as you head towards the hatch. \"But I'll have to figure that much out on my own. Time to start exploring!\" The hatch opens, and you step outside into the heavy heat.

I think humans could live in this, but probably not any closer to the equator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin walking into the alien jungle, you hear Erin's voice in your ear. \"I can communicate with you through the translation device.

I can't say I'll look away, but it's not like you won't already be changing in my view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noted. Not a bad idea, Erin.\" You take off the suit and throw it in the hatch, which shuts behind you. Now wearing just your underwear and a sensor device at your wrist, you head into the forest. \"Hmm, I'm not detecting anything dangerous. Nothing bad in the air, no allergens in these plants.\" You look at the large plantlife, which apparently does well in this heat. Large leafy fronds in blue-green stretch eagerly to the sky, and provide some much welcomed shade. The trees resemble giant flowers, with leaves far bigger than you, and giant buds high up. \"Erin, any good spots nearby I should check out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a source of freshwater about a kilometer south of you, it may be good to get some readings on it. The plantlife appears to be densest east of the landing site, so you could get your botany on. Or, you could head north. I'm getting some odd readings that don't make any sense.

You walk up to the box and touch it, but nothing happens. Curious, you walk around the box, and you see a lever on the right side. You pull the lever, and the left side of the box begins to slowly swing open. When the left side is fully open, you return to that side to look inside. On the rightmost quarter of the inside, there are three vertical switches. You lean down to flip the top one up, and an apparatus slowly comes out of the box. Once it is fully extruded, the apparatus covers three quarters of the left side in width and is 9 ft. long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, this seems to be an experiment container,\u201d you report back to the computer. \u201cDo you have any idea what kind of experiment could have been done in this space?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure,\u201d Erin answers. \u201cFrom what I can see through the communications, there appears to be no discernible object inside the box or on the mat you just rolled out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wondering what the contraption does, you reach down and feel it. It feels very soft as you trace back and forth along the entire length of the mat. Your curiosity peaked, you put your weight on the mat, but it does not even bend. Thinking it could be a bed of some sorts and assured that it can hold your weight, you lay down on the mat. The mat still feels as comfortable as it did when you were feeling it up, and you begin to relax. \u201cI think it could be a bed, Erin,\u201d you announce your findings. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable, and it supports my entire body weight without even bending.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is interesting,\u201d the computer responds. \u201cWhy would someone drop a bed, of all things, in the middle of this planet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d you reply, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to find out. This bed might have special features to it that would make it useful for the planet.\u201d You crawl back over to the control panel and flip the middle switch. Laying back down, you hear a whirring sound from under you, and the middle of the bed collapses in on itself. Your body falls about three inches to another soft mat, but your arms are still resting on the top layer. Suddenly, something fuzzy wraps around your wrists and holds them down to the mat. Alarmed, you try to squirm out of the bondage, but it holds your hands fast. Then feathers shoot out of the sides of the bottom layer and begin stroking you all over your exposed body. Extremely ticklish, you react by screaming out in laughter as the feathers run over you. \u201cHAHAHAHAHA! NOHOHOHOHOHOHO!\u201d Still only clad in your underwear, you feel the feathers\u2019 effect more intensely as they tease your bare skin from your neck to your feet. This tickle torture lasts a total of ten minutes before the feathers and fuzzy bondage retract. Once you catch your breath, you address Erin again. \u201cErin, that was a tickle machine. What in the universe was it doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that is a valid science experiment,\u201d Erin comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you question, shocked at Erin\u2019s announcement. \u201cA tickle machine is a valid science experiment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Erin responds, seeming offended that you did not know this. \u201cTickle machines are used to measure the sensitivity of whomever is on the planet. If no data comes from the tickle machine besides an activation alert, the experimenters proceed with the information that whoever was tickled is not ticklish. A significant number of these types of responses or a complete lack of responses in a long time yields the result that either a non-ticklish species resides here or no one resides here. I believe that the Erimosi sent a tickle machine experiment here, and it is how they were able to recommend this for your exploration, since no data was retrieved. Congratulations! You just recovered the probe, and it will be of great help to the Erimosi, as they can use it to test another planet now. To make it smaller, just flip the switch that opened it up back, and it will retract. You should then be able to wheel it back here without too much effort. We will take it back to the Erimosi when you choose to visit them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you respond, a little surprised that Erin had known this yet failed to tell you. You go over and flip the top switch again. The mat slowly retracts back into the box, and then you begin to think about how to efficiently bring the box back to the Swift Feather. Eventually, you risk flipping the bottom switch on the panel, and to your happiness, a handle comes up. You roll the experiment back to your ship, taking just over an hour to get back because of breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, I have the box with me; where is a good place to put it?\u201d you ask the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a small storage space in the right wing,\u201d Erin reveals. \u201cIt should fit nicely in there.\u201d Once you place the experiment in storage, you head back into the main cabin. \u201cWhat do you want to do now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It sounds like an adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best speed?\" Erin asks in a quizzical tone. \"Alright, but that means\u2026\" all of a sudden you feel the hyperspace engine kicking in, spending you rocketing to your destination, and completely disorienting you.

Hopefully Erin's penchant for literally obeying orders won't go so far as to do anything dangerous. \"Are there any good spots to land?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, checking\u2026\" Erin says, pausing to scan the planet with various instruments. \"There appears to be several acceptable landing zones at the edge of a forest, here in the temperate zone of the largest continent.\" Your screen highlights an area of the planet below. \"Should I take us down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Erin, land us in the best spot you can find.

Have fun exploring!\" Erin tells you, now speaking to you in your ear as you hop onto the surface. The description was accurate: the world is a dark place. You can see the sun hanging dimly at the horizon, your eyes slowly adjusting to the barely-there light. You see a forest in front of you, purple-black fronds of fat leaves hanging languidly from tall plant life. You decide not to waste any time, and start walking into the black forest. Despite your eyes getting used to the dark, you can barely see more than a few inches in front of you, and make your way slowly through the plants.</span></div></div>",

Before you can bend down to get a better look at it, the plant comes up and rubs against your stomach, creating a tickly feeling. \u201cEep!\u201d you squeak as you back away in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, captain?\u201d Erin asks through the earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, just a little surprised,\u201d you respond, somewhat embarrassed at your reaction to the tickling. You walk around the plant and keep going into the forest. Suddenly, you feel more of the plants brushing against your legs. You start to move away, but before you can get too far, something wraps around your ankle, tripping you. You land on the ground face-first and roll over, deciding to take a minute before you try and get up. While you are on your back, another vine wraps around your other ankle, and as you begin to panic, two more vines wrap around your wrists, trapping you in their grasp. \u201cErin, I\u2019m trapped! I have vines that are wrapped all around my limbs! Can you help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, I\u2019m afraid the only thing you can do is wait,\u201d Erin notifies you. \u201cIt looks like those vines that have trapped you are called tripper vines. They trip a victim and then secure them on the ground with most of their tickle spots exposed. After a couple minutes, feathery plants, called tickle flowers, reach over and commence tickling the victim\u2019s entire body. The good news is that tickle flowers only work for five minutes before they stop tickling, and trip-for-tickle vines unbind the victim right after the tickle flowers cease. The bad news is that you\u2019re going to get tickled for a little bit, and if you\u2019re really ticklish, it could be torturous. By the way, I never asked you this, but how ticklish are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that you might want to turn the volume down,\u201d you worriedly admit as you see something leaning towards you. Five seconds later, tickle flowers hit all over your body, with concentrations in your armpits, tummy, ribs, and feet. \u201cAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you scream in hyper-ticklish laughter as the flowers tickle all over your body. Since the suit you are wearing conveys touch very well, it feels as if you have no protection at all. You feel the flowers teasing the pit of your armpits, and you try to jump, but are stopped by the tripper vines. Unable to escape, your extremely ticklish body squirms around as much as the vines will allow. The tickle flowers continue their relentless work, exploiting your sensitivity and making you appear very weak. \u201cMAHAKEHAHA IT STAHAHAHAP!\u201d After two minutes, the tickle flowers go into your worst spots, your bellybutton and your toes, creating more intense feathery movements on these spots. \u201cNOHOHOHO MOHOHORE!\u201d you yell in ticklish agony. Your sensitive body can hardly take any more, and following four minutes of the tickle torture, your laughter gets so intense that it turns silent, and your lack of energy stops your squirming. One minute after this, the tickle flowers cease their effort, and the tripper vines uncurl from your wrists and ankles. Finished with the torture, you hurriedly get up and move away from the tickle site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you a little ticklish?\u201d Erin teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d you reply matter-of-factly.

Hairbrushes, feathers of various sizes, metal claws, and combs were just a few items you were able to make out before the tickling started. It was an all-out assault on your form, as feathers sawed between your toes, brushes scrubbed your soles furiously, and the metal claws scratched at your belly and sides. Regular hands did most of the deep muscle tickling, squeezing your hips and massaging your ribs one by one. Unstoppable laughter took over you and you thrashed as hard as you could, but there was no escaping these bonds. Erin simply pressed on, tickling every spot possible.

Erin picked up on the fact that raspberries were a serious weakness of yours, so she blew them much more frequently with greater intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air, you realized that Erin's tickling had ceased, at least for the moment. You wondered what she could be processing...</span></div></div>",

She moved them around quite a bit, scanning every crevice of skin, but you weren't sure what she was measuring exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, let me go... please. I can't take much more,\" you said halfheartedly. Erin simply ignored you and continued her scan. You tested your bonds once more, and they were as strong as ever. Even being naked and completely covered in sweat didn't offer any chance of slipping loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you enjoying this predicament you're in, pilot?\" Erin asked inquisitively. You just shook your head no, as you were still pretty tired from the tickling. \"I don't know much about tickling, but my scans of your body reveal a heightened hormonal state that indicates arousal.\" Erin was definitely onto you, but you tried lying anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your scans must be off then, because I'm not enjoying this one bit, Erin.\" You say somewhat confidently. Erin responded by blowing yet another raspberry on your belly button, her scanners still lingering around your stomach. You let out another forced laugh as she blows a few more. \"My scanners are not off, and my readings of your heart-rate fluctuations, tone of voice fluctuations, and breathing patterns offer an 87% chance that you are being deceptive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect you are lying in an effort to get me to tickle you more. This would explain the persistent efforts to explore unmapped space, knowing full-well I would tickle you until you change your mind.

I'd like to ask the Erimosi if they have anything interesting for us to do.\" You say, deciding that the best course of action is to consult the experts. Besides, asking them in person might reveal some missions that they kept away from the AI's helpful suggestions. Not that Erin didn't seem trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye, captain. It'll be nothing for my warp drive, barely a few light seconds away!\" She says happily, as the ship eases out of dock and moves into space. \"In fact, the trip is going to be effectively\u2026\" Suddenly you feel a moment of disorientation, as though you were suddenly in multiple places at once, and shouldn't be. \"\u2026instant! Welcome to Phobos, captain. I'll hail the Erimosi Embassy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, still feeling some lingering effects from the warp jump. It takes about a minute for your eyes to re-focus and your fingers to obey your commands once again, but it all comes back to you. You look out the view screen and see the potato-shaped moon of Phobos, most of the small surface covered in the alien architecture of the Erimosi's zero-g city. Well, less than 1% g, anyway. A decent sized Earth city would barely fit on this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obsidian face of an Erimosi fills your view screen. \"Greetings, human.\" She says in a lovely alto, her white hair floating at the edges of the view screen. \"You are the first human scout, are you not? What brings you to us? Is anything the matter?\" The Erimosi purses her lips in concern, although you know that the gesture is human, and she must be doing it purposefully for your benefit. Still, you appreciate the concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, nothing's wrong.\" you reassure her. \"I was just trying to figure out what to do for my first mission, and none of the straightforward options really jumped out at me. I was hoping I could consult the Erimosi for some more interesting options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Erimosi arches her eyebrows in another human gesture, and she seems to smile slightly. It's hard to tell her those black lips on black skin, like a starless night. But you do know that smiling and laughter mean the same thing to both races. \"More interesting, was it? Very well. I am giving your computer docking coordinates. Let us speak face to face.\" And with that, the transmission ended, and you felt your ship move into position to land on the little moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour not sure whether it's from some kind of tractor beam, or your AI slid the ship quickly into port, but in any case you've quickly landed on the moon. Getting out of your ship and bounding softly through the corridors, you see Erimosi in long loose robes walking about. In front of your ship is the same alien woman that greeted you on your viewscreen earlier. Wordlessly, she beckons for you to follow her, turning and gliding gracefully through the gravity less corridors. You move after her, your bounding gait the epitome of clumsiness in comparison. After a few dozen steps, you slowly get into a rhythm, and are able to keep up with her as she leads you to a room in which to talk. You notice as she floats effortlessly down the hall, her flowing robe ripples in the unearthly movement possible here, and in doing so gives a rare glimpse at the attractive female form hiding underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room you are brought to looks luxurious compared to the Spartan look of the space dock. A thick carpet softly hugs your boots, and vases filled with extraordinarily long feathers of various bright colors adorn the corners. You wonder what kind of alien avian could grow those feathers, longer than you are tall. The room contains two plush couches facing each other, the alien woman reclining in one and gesturing you towards the other. This Erimosi doesn't seem to be very talkative, but her wordless communication is still effective. You seat yourself in the other couch slowly, and as you do it seems to almost envelop you in the soft fabric, having a beanbag-like aspect to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.\" The Erimosi finally speaks in the same alluring alto tones you heard earlier. \"You wished a consultation with us? My name is Avallala, and I will offer what assistance I can to you.\" You see her looking you over curiously, and the way her eyes scan up and down your body feels a little unnerving. Still, you haven't ever been this close to an Erimosi before, and maybe she hasn't either. Usually only diplomats and heads of state get to spend any real time with the aliens, although now that you're the first human scout, maybe you're important enough to join those ranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\" You say, your voice betraying a bit of nervousness at meeting with her. \"The standard options I've been given are all well and good, but\u2026 as the first scout, I wanted to do something a little more dramatic than mapping a colony world or saying 'hi' to the neighbors. I wanted to do something bigger, more exhilarating, more fun!\" As you describe your feelings, your voice gets more animated, until you realize that the alien might not empathize with your human sense of adventure. \"I'm not sure if that makes much sense to you, but\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvallala smiles at you, her head tilting toward one side. You find the expression warm and endearing, and you can't help but grin in return. \"No, I don't think I do. But that's what makes you humans so interesting. Perhaps I can come up with something for you that you would consider 'big,' 'exhilarating,' and 'fun,' as you say.\" As she says this, her eyes seem to shine briefly in an odd expression, before returning to their previous shade of orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contemplate what to ask her specifically. It seems like Avallala has some ideas already in mind for you, but perhaps you could ask if there's some sort of help a human could give to the Erimosi. After all, it'd be nice to give back after all they'd given to us. Or you could try and chat with her a while longer. You find yourself enjoying her company, not to mention the comfortable quarters and the fact that from what you can see, the alien is quite easy on the eyes. You make up your mind:</span></div></div>",

Start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Erimosi scientists moves in and starts tickling your tummy with her fingers. Your suit does almost nothing to protect you from the tickling, instead making it feel like your bare belly was being tickled. \u201cHAHAITHAHA TIHAHACKAHAHLES!\u201d you break out in loud laughter. As the Erimosi scientist continues, she decides that your sides need some tickling, so she spiders her fingers over the edges, continuing the torture for you. \u201cHEHEHE NOHAHT THEHARE!\u201d you squeal as the scientist finds a particularly sensitive spot. At this, she moves the tickling back in to the front of the midriff area, and your laughter calms a slight bit. However, as the scientist continues inward, you realize where she is going to get you next. A single finger suddenly slides into your bellybutton, causing you to start thrashing around. \u201cNOAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you yell. \u201cDOHOHON\u2019T TIHAHAHCKLEHAHAHA MYHAHAHA BEHEHELLHEHE BAHAHATTOAHAN!\u201d The sensitive hole was one of the worst tickle spots on your body, and the Erimosi scientist was eager to exploit it. She started using different techniques, swirling a finger around in the cavity, then running all her fingers over it quickly, then poking it at different time intervals. Eventually, the Erimosi scientist gave you a break, withdrawing her fingers from you and leaving you in slight tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was very good,\u201d Avallala declares. \u201cOur equipment picked up similar results from the other humans we have tested for the baseline. We do have to do some further testing on your stomach now that you have had a short break. Are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to say no, but Judderdal says, \u201cCommence the tickling!\u201d At the command, the scientist who was tickling you before starts tickling your sides again, causing you to squirm and laugh as you had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon changes techniques and squeezes your sides, making you buck up and down a little bit to try and escape. \u201cNOHOHOHO!\u201d you plead, but this is ignored. Your tickler continues squeezing your sides for about a minute, and then she dives right back to the navel. \u201cNAHAHAHAT AGAHAHAIN!\u201d With the return of the navel tickling, you feel like you are being tickle tortured for information, and tears start to come from your eyes. Within three minutes, you have stopped struggling and have been driven into silent laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop the experiment!\u201d Judderdal orders, and the fingers come out from your bellybutton. \u201cWe\u2019ve collected enough data there for now. Let\u2019s take a five-minute break and then come back with a new spot.\u201d Your hands are unbound, and you are allowed to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvallala brings you a glass filled with some kind of liquid. \u201cThis is a reenergizing liquid,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt will help you recover from the tickling and regain your energy. You\u2019ll want it for the remainder of the experiment.\u201d You take the cup and drink the liquid, and you feel refreshed and reenergized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, break time is over,\u201d Judderdal proclaims. \u201cThis time, we are going to tickle the...\"</span></div></div>",

However, now that we will be staying here, I do not believe there is a reason for me to stay in my formal robes. Is it alright if I leave for a minute to get changed into my normal clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d you allow. \u201cI would not want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she graciously states before leaving for a minute. When Avallala returns, she is wearing an outfit like a human bikini, with her stomach and legs exposed to you. \u201cThis is more typical of what Erimosi wear on a normal basis. We wore the formal robes because the research stated that you would respond better to that. However, now that you are the first human scout who will explore the universe, I figure that you should know the true Erimosi. How do you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks really good on you,\u201d you respond, looking over the Erimosi form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess we should get back to your question now that I am comfortable,\u201d Avallala declares. \u201cWhen we have breaks, this is one of the rooms that my coworkers and I usually come to. With the couches providing a very comfortable place, we find it easy to relax and let go of stress. However, the real fun comes if someone falls asleep and does not wake up before we have to end the break. This has happened to me a few times and different colleagues several times. Please take off your shoes; as you can see, we don\u2019t wear them. After that, I want you to lay down on the couch and close your eyes, and I will show you what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as Avallala has instructed, and she leaves you alone for a minute or so, allowing you to really relax and start to fall asleep. Then it comes. The first thing you feel is a feather tip coming up onto the side of your belly, and then another touches the sole of your foot. \u201cHEHEHEHEHE,\u201d you giggle at the light tickles. The feathers progress to the center of your stomach and up to your toes, simply covering your ticklish spots as they go. Realizing that Avallala has put you in a very ticklish situation, you begin to laugh harder. \u201cHAHAHAHA!\u201d Avallala moves the feathers back and forth over your belly and up and down your feet, causing you to break out in hysterical laughter for fifteen minutes. When she finally lets you out of the tickling, you gasp for air for a minute. You look up and Avallala is holding two of the feathers from the vases in the corner. \u201cSo you use the feathers to tickle anyone who falls asleep?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Avallala affirms. \u201cThe Erimosi are very ticklish on our bellies and feet, and apparently, humans are too. I understand that our space experts did not introduce you to the tickling custom, but we Erimosi very much enjoy tickling, both giving it out and receiving it. There is one more option that we sometimes choose with the sleepers, and this is also done to conscious Erimosi fairly often. Would you like me to show it to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you offer the tickling-obsessed Erimosi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stand up and place your hands in the air,\u201d Avallala commands. You do as she says, and the Erimosi continues, \u201cThese feathers are very flexible, and we will frequently take advantage of that fact.\u201d She wraps the feather around you, and then she starts to press on certain parts of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the different parts are enclosed, the feather touches them and waves around in small circles, giving a strong tickling feeling. \u201cOAHAHOAHAHAHAHOHOHA!\u201d you exclaim as the different parts of your body are tickled. Avallala takes advantage of your bound state to use the feather to tickle your armpits, chest, ribcage, belly, sides, back, legs, knees, thighs, and feet. With each of these, your laughter\u2019s intensity corresponds to how ticklish that body part is. The hardest laughter occurs at the armpits, belly, and feet, as these are your most ticklish spots. Following the tickling, Avallala unwraps the feather, freeing you. \u201cThat tickled quite a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is a common way for determining someone\u2019s tickle spots,\u201d Avallala notifies you. \u201cWe have more ways of tickling each other. Would you like me to show you the different ways and places that we tickle each other, or would you like to tickle me with the ways I have shown you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You go and pick out a blue and a white feather from a vase, and they are very light, even for their size. Once you have the feathers, you guide them over to Avallala\u2019s exposed form and move them against her bare belly and feet. \u201cHAHAHA!\u201d Avallala laughs, squirming a tiny bit. \u201cTHIHIHIS IHIHIS FUHUHUN!\u201d You start waving the feathers a little faster, and Avallala\u2019s laughter increases, but she stops squirming. \u201cKEHEHEHEP TIHIHICKLIHIHING!\u201d Amazed that the Erimosi actually likes being tickled, you comply with her request and keep the feathers going on her for ten minutes.

Your fingers explore all over the bare midriff of your host, and she just laughs along, appearing to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you are getting used to having the tickling control, Avallala suddenly places her fingers at your sides and begins tickling you again. \u201cHAHAHA!\u201d you laugh, retracting your fingers and falling down to try and defend yourself.

With you continuing to look at Avallala intently, she eventually broke, \u201cAlright, I guess I can tell you. We typically involve a lot of tickling in our activities. It is a very common base for activities in Erimosi culture, and we enjoy it very much. If you would like, I can give you a firsthand demonstration of the activities, as it ought to prepare you some for what you will experience later in your exploration.

I am sure that you did not know this before, but the Erimosi absolutely love to tickle other Erimosi, as well as other species. One of the ways we express this is through the buying and selling of tickle slaves. At an auction, you would have the opportunity to see several different species of slaves, and I might just be willing to get you one.

To counter that, we will bring a security team that prevent anyone from mistaking you as a tickle slave. I must say, human, that as a unique species, you would bring in a lot of currency to your seller, and because of that fact, I want to make sure that this does not happen. However, with my security team escorting you around, I am sure that you will be safe. I will also inform the event organizers that you are my guest partner for the auction and have their security look out to protect you, which will give you plenty more protection that you could possibly need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure I\u2019ll be safe?\u201d you wonder, now a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guarantee it,\u201d Avallala reassures you. \u201cMy full security team is more protection than you will need; the event security team is just a backup to help us get rid of offenders quicker. Now, I might even be able to buy you a tickle slave there. It\u2019s not exactly standard protocol on the typical missions we help other species with, but it could be my gift to the human race.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds interesting,\u201d you declare, and with that, the two of you head out to Avallala\u2019s ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is about twice the size of the Swift Feather, and going inside, you see that it is meant for a whole crew, and apparently, there is a crew manning it. \u201cMiss Avallala, who is this?\u201d an Erimosi asks as she grabs you from behind, placing her fingers near your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKazol, release my guest,\u201d Avallala commands, and the Erimosi did so reluctantly. \u201cThis is a human. They are a species from the planet Earth, the one I specialize in. With our help, they recently developed their warp drive and have sent out the first explorer, my guest. He/she came and wanted to get to know some about Erimosi culture, so I suggested that we attend the tickle slave auction on Iiloned. Human, that is my home planet, in case you were wondering. Kazol, if you would, we would like to head to Iiloned as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Miss Avallala,\u201d the Erimosi affirms as she tried to comprehend all the information she had just been given. \u201cWe will be there in two standard hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Avallala instructs you as she heads to another room on the ship. \u201cWe need to sit down for takeoff, and then I can introduce you to the crew of the Illians. Here; this seat should be good for you.\u201d You sit down and quickly figure out how to strap yourself in; the system is very similar to the one on the Swift Feather, so it is no trouble at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot very long after you and Avallala are strapped in, you hear Kazol\u2019s voice over the ship\u2019s communication system, \u201cEveryone, we will be taking off in a minute! Get strapped in!\u201d True to her word, you soon feel yourself being pushed back and down into your seat as the ship takes off. The ship begins to stabilize a couple of minutes after taking off, and Kazol announces over the radio, \u201cWe have reached stability. Feel free to move around the cabin and say hello to our human guest. We will arrive at Iiloned in just under two standard hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s meet the crew!\u201d Avallala excitedly tells you as the two of you unstrap yourselves. \u201cYou\u2019ve already met Kazol. She\u2019s the pilot, and in my absence, the captain of the Illians. We can start by heading to the engineering station.\u201d You follow Avallala through a few hallways, and soon you come upon two Erimosi clad in only bikini-type outfits. \u201cHuman, these are my engineers. Meet Prosca and Wennelier. Prosca is the head engineer, and she is training Wennelier to help out with the ship. Prosca, Wennelier, meet this human explorer, who is my guest for this trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Prosca extends a hand. You reciprocate the move, but instead of shaking your hand, the Erimosi reaches in and tickled your armpit, causing you to shoot your arm back to protect yourself as you giggle. \u201cGood to see that humans are ticklish, too. It makes for a fun time when everyone\u2019s ticklish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso nice to meet you, human, but I won\u2019t do what my mentor did.\u201d Wennelier decides to instead just smile and wave rather than the traditional greeting. \u201cIf there is any problem with the ship itself, please don\u2019t hesitate to come to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for meeting the human,\u201d Avallala proclaims before you head off with her again. \u201cSorry for the tickle greeting; guess I forgot to tell you that Erimosi love to tickle as a greeting, so you\u2019ve got to protect any hot tickle spots. Anyway, let\u2019s go to the\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Seeing the concerned look on your face, she adds, \u201cHuman, you should know that I am not intending to put you in there or anything like that. It\u2019s just most Erimosi consider the brig one of the most important parts of the ship, and I want you to see what one is like so that you are not shocked if you ever go on another Erimosi ship. It is also a good introduction to some of the technology you will see at the tickle slave auction. As you may have suspected, given our fascination with tickling, the Erimosi have developed several technologies to assist in or perform tickling, and these are commonplace on Erimosi planets. We have some of them in our brig, and I would like to show you how these devices work so that you have a better idea of what is happening at the tickle slave auction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow exactly do you plan on demonstrating these?\u201d you ask, wondering if this is really a trap just to tickle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to have them all tested on you,\u201d Avallala responded with a smirk. \u201cOr probably even most of them. I\u2019m going to be testing some of them myself, and I\u2019ll have Izlef, our brig chief and interrogator, test the ones that I find fun on you. Of course, if Izlef happens to have someone down there already, she might just test all of them on her subject, and none of them on us. I know my belly would prefer that for sure; that\u2019s my most ticklish spot. Speaking of which, I really should ask: What is your most ticklish spot? It\u2019s practically a requirement to step on an Erimosi planet, so you\u2019ll have to say it anyways eventually. I won\u2019t have it tortured, I promise.

Got it?\u201d You both nod, and the Erimosi restrains both of you on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll start with a relatively simple testing device called the Rolling Giggler. Essentially, it will roll around the spot that it is placed and test for the most ticklish spots. At tickle slave auctions, it is used to show potential buyers where the most ticklish spots on a tickle slave are. I\u2019ll be testing this on your tummies since that\u2019s where you are both most ticklish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzlef pulls out two small, round devices with flat bottoms and places them on your midriffs. She then presses a button on top, and the device raises up a little bit, revealing a circular brush below it. Almost immediately, you feel giggles coming up through your throat as the brush begins to spin around on your stomach. Determined not to give in right away, you manage to hold in your laughter, at least until the brush begins moving up and down your abdomen. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d you break out laughing. \u201cTIHIHIHIHIHICKLEHEHEHES!\u201d Avallala did not last long either, having started her own laughing the moment the brush on her belly began spinning. To add to your torment, the Rolling Giggler explores all around your belly, finding that your bellybutton is the hottest spot on you, and the front of your midsection is also very ticklish, if just slightly more than your sides. In fact, as the tickle tool enters your bellybutton, you fully surrender to its tickling ministrations and beg Izlef, \u201cIHIHIZLEHEHEF! MAHAHAHAHAHAHAKE IHIHIHIHIHIT STAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAP!\u201d The interrogator, however, refuses to do so, allowing the device plenty of time to explore your navel and prove to anyone who has been listening that this is, without a doubt, your most ticklish spot. On the other hand, Avallala, while also having a ticklish bellybutton, is most ticklish on her sides, followed by her bellybutton, and the front of her belly is the least ticklish spot on her midriff. Once the initial testing is done, the Rolling Gigglers go back to the most ticklish spots, the bellybutton for you and Avallala\u2019s right side, and persistently tickle them, causing you both to beg for mercy for Izlef. Enjoying your torment, the interrogator allows the Rolling Gigglers to work your most ticklish spots over for five minutes before she finally shuts them down and removes them from your ticklish tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I see that the human has a hyper-sensitive bellybutton,\u201d Izlef observes, sticking a finger in your bellybutton and wiggling it around, which elicits shrieks of laughter from you and a few pleas for her to stop. \u201cAnd Avallala, have your sides gotten more ticklish since I had you in here last?\u201d Izlef conducts a quick ticklish dance over her boss\u2019s sides, causing Avallala to squeal and try to plainly say that she is not more ticklish than before. \u201cI think you are, though, but enough with me talking. We\u2019ve got more tools to test, and I think that we should tickle\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s fit this right in here.\u201d Izlef places the device in your bellybutton, with the rounded edge going inside and the rest of the device holding it in place outside. \u201cNow, since Button Teasers focus on one spot, ticklees will often try to buck them out of their bellybuttons, so I\u2019m going to place this suction around your bellybutton and over the Button Teaser.

However, she soon musters up the energy to beg for it to stop, \u201cPLEHEHEHEHEHEHESE STAHAHAHAHAHAP!

She is completely worn out by the time that Izlef actually turns the Button Teaser off. As the Erimosi interrogator removes the Button Teaser from your companion\u2019s belly, she begins to catch her breath, mixing in residual giggles with gasps for air. Finally, she eventually has enough breath to tell Izlef, \u201cThat tickled so much, and you better not pull a stunt like that on me again. If you do, I\u2019ll have you put in here; I\u2019m sure some of the other crew members would like to see how ticklish you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you asked me to demonstrate tickle tools on both the human and you,\u201d Izlef comments. \u201cYou\u2019re not done yet.

The planet is quite a beautiful one, with a lot of waterfalls and rivers in the distance, and even a river running very near the place where you land. \u201cWhat do you think so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you are unable to come up with anything coherent, so that\u2019s all that comes out of your mouth. \u201cI mean, wow! I\u2019ve seen some places like this on Earth, and this is some of my favorite type of scenery. I love the rivers and waterfalls in the distance; it just looks so pretty here.\u201d You keep looking around, and soon you see some Erimosi coming towards you. \u201cAlso, I should mention that your species is very nice looking. I\u2019m so glad you invited me here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thank you, human,\u201d Avallala responds. \u201cThat should be our security team. They\u2019ll get us a ride to the tickle slave auction and protect you there as we look around.\u201d The group of Erimosi gets closer, and you soon see that they all have what at first looks like standard weapons, but upon closer observation, does not look like anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. It must be some sort of alien technology, and you are very curious about what it does. When the security group gets within hearing range, Avallala addresses them, \u201cHello, Wokka, and your team. Thank you for coming on such short notice. This is the human I was telling you about. Human, I\u2019d like you to meet our security team. The head guard is Wokka, and here are her associates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure to meet you,\u201d you say as you extend a hand to the Erimosi who seem to be in charge. She looks at you confused for a second, but then reaches in and tickles your side, causing you to squeal and back away. \u201cHEHEHE!\u201d At this, Wokka looks even more confused, tilting her head at you and looking for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Wokka; the human has just begun her exploration, and she is still getting used to Erimosi greetings,\u201d Avallala steps in to explain. \u201cWhat she offered you was a traditional human handshake; it\u2019s how humans greet each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d Wokka replies, now understanding what you meant. \u201cWell, hello to you, too, human. It\u2019s our honor to have you here, and it\u2019s our pleasure to be working to protect you today. Now before we get going, we need to know your most ticklish spot. It will help us best protect you by making sure to prevent anyone from tickling you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my belly, especially the bellybutton,\u201d you admit, sort of sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright; that\u2019s a pretty fun spot to have tickled, at least for us Erimosi,\u201d Wokka states. \u201cBut we will do everything we can to prevent you from being tickled there, since we want you to be and feel safe here. On that note, do you have any questions before we proceed to the auction?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like those tools, I guess, that you have on you,\u201d you point towards some of the things the Erimosi guards have strapped to them. \u201cI was just wondering what they are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, these are our weapons,\u201d Wokka informs you. \u201cNon-lethal, of course, but effective. We can show you what they do, if you\u2019d like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you answer hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman, don\u2019t worry; we\u2019re not going to demonstrate them on you,\u201d Wokka announces, seeing the concerned look on your face and causing a worried look to appear on Avallala\u2019s face. \u201cYou are our guest, so we will test them on your host, Avallala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Avallala\u2019s protests are quieted when Wokka points her weapon, a small gun, at her and pulls the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a tickle gun, made by the Erimosi,\u201d Wokka notifies you. \u201cIt basically stimulates tickling sensations wherever it hits on the target while it\u2019s being fired.\u201d After tickling Avallala for half a minute with this, she releases the trigger, asking for another weapon from one of her guards. \u201cThis is a stun gun. It keeps the target stunned in place for five standard minutes; however, it does nothing to their ability to feel, so you can tickle them while their stunned. It is typically used to trap someone and then tickle them, a particularly useful skill for traveling around tickle slave markets.\u201d Avallala had begun to try and sneak away when she was shot from behind by Wokka and froze in place. \u201cNow that Avallala can\u2019t move, how about we tickle her with some of the other weapons we have? This is a tickle baton. You hold it up against a victim\u2019s ticklish spot and press this button, and it releases some intense tickling sensations on them. This is a standard first weapon for a guard to be issued. It\u2019s a Kichi feather spear. Basically, it just acts as a spear, but instead of a sharp, pointy end, it\u2019s got feathers to you can tickle others with it. Which would you rather try?\u201d</span></div></div>",

While you are amazed at the sight, Wokka and her team are all business, as they lead you to the aforementioned ID station. The head of your security addresses an Erimosi at the desk, \u201cHello, we\u2019re here to get an ID for her. She is a human, and her species has just acquired spaceflight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d the Erimosi at the desk looks at something similar to a computer. \u201cHuman? Name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still so amazed at the sight of the tickle slave market that you do not hear the Erimosi woman speak until you get a poke in the side from Avallala. \u201cHuman, I know this is a lot, but we need your name for the ID,\u201d she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d you snap back to reality. You give your name and how to spell it, and the Erimosi continues questioning Wokka for information on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the ID Erimosi wonders, \u201cSo, where would you like &lt;your name&gt; to be sold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, the human is not being sold,\u201d Wokka corrects her, prompting a confused look from the ID vendor. \u201cShe has not had the chance to get an ID yet, but she wanted to see an Erimosi tickle slave auction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an expression that you cannot quite make out, the Erimosi ID vendor\u2026</span></div></div>",

Avallala begins to guide you through the different aliens that you are seeing along the way. Pointing to a feathered alien tickle slave who seems to love being tickled, she announces, \u201cThat\u2019s an Ufu. They love tickling and being tickled. Their feathers tickle bare skin quite effectively, and they are very friendly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was a fierce-looking wolf-like woman being tickle tortured by a snake-like creature. \u201cThat tickle slave is a Yathi. They\u2019re warriors, and it\u2019s not often that they get sold as tickle slaves. She\u2019s probably been captured or made to submit, and now she\u2019s being sold as a tickle slave. The alien tickling her is a Kichi. Be careful around them. They\u2019ll lie and try to deceive you to get any advantage out of you. Also, their eyes can hypnotize several different kinds of species, which they use to their advantage frequently. You can look around them, but never look into those eyes. As you can see, they have tails, which are quite adept at tickling bellybuttons like yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed by several more alien ticklers and tickle slaves, including several Erimosi, until\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avallala turns to you and asks you suddenly, \u201cHuman, would you like to have a tickle slave of your own? I would be able to procure one for you if you wish.\u201d She says, noticing the way you\u2019ve been looking over the various aliens being tickled at the market. \u201cThe standard contract is for one Erimosi standard year, which is plenty of time to get to know your companion and all of their tickle spots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 can I really do that?\u201d You ask in surprise, not expecting to be offered the chance to have someone at your beck and call to tickle as much as you want. It\u2019s a strange but intriguing offer to say the least. You look over at some in the market that had caught your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first is that feathered Ufu. She is covered in a soft coat of white feathers that bristle as she\u2019s tickled by two Erimosi playfully tickling her, one on either side. The Ufu woman is unrestrained, and seems to eagerly welcome the tickling. Whenever the Erimosi stop, the Ufu stretches out and invites them to start again after catching her breath. One is tickling under her arms, which are clamped down but still seem to be very ticklish, while the other has grabbed one of her ankles and is tickling the sole of her foot. The Ufu\u2019s feathers brush against the underarm-tickling Erimosi and cause her to giggle, getting tickled even as she\u2019s tickling. You think that it might be fun to tickle someone who loves being tickled that much, although those feathers might end up tickling you, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look to the Yathi woman: tall, strong, and clearly ticklish. She\u2019s trying her best not to laugh, holding her teeth together tightly and resisting as she\u2019s tickled. A Kichi\u2019s fingers roam over the wolf woman\u2019s body, scritching over the short coat of brown fur for tickle spots underneath. She\u2019s doing a good job of holding it in, but its obvious that it\u2019s only a matter of time before she bursts. One of the Erimosi begin softly scratching at the firm abs just below her bellybutton, and the Yathi breaks, crumbling into snickering laughter as the tickles become too much to bear. She\u2019d definitely be a challenge to tickle, but a fun one to get giggling if you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you notice a Kichi tickle slave further down. The snake woman is blindfolded to prevent her eyes from hypnotizing any of her ticklers, which also makes her even more vulnerable to the tickling. She can\u2019t predict where the tickles come from, twitching and giggling in surprise as someone scritches her underarms or twirls around her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, which one is your favorite, Human?\u201d Avallala asks. \u201cThat Ufu you were looking at volunteered to be a tickle slave, she absolutely loves to be tickled. If you want her you should be prepared to tickle her often, or she\u2019ll start getting frisky and start tickling you! The Yathi is serving a sentence for espionage, so she needs to be a tickle slave for some time. She\u2019s a difficult one, but it is fun to make such a strong warrior weak from tickles! And finally there is that Kichi\u2026 beautiful and very ticklish, but you must be careful not to take off that blindfold and let her hypnotize you, or you might end up being the ticklee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one is your choice?</span></div></div>",

I was wondering where they come from and what they are used for. Am I out of place to ask this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Avallala responds. \u201cLike I said before, I enjoy finding what makes you humans interesting, and one of these things is your curiosity. The feathers came from my home planet. Where we live, the birds are quite a bit larger, and they shed feathers fairly often. We like to collect them for fun, so we brought some here. You said that you wanted to know what they were used for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you affirm, smiling. \u201cI am very curious about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will make more sense afterwards, but if you will allow, I am going to change into my normal clothes,\u201d Avallala proclaims. \u201cWill you excuse me for a minute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d you reply, wanting to see what the Erimosi really looks like under the robes. She departs for a couple minutes and comes back, wearing nothing but a white bikini. When she gets back in, Avallala picks up a green feather and returns to her chair. \u201cSo, what are the feathers used for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTickling,\u201d Avallala answers as she guides the feather over to you. Before you can ask her to not tickle you, the feather has reached your belly, and the Erimosi starts waving it back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHA!\u201d you laugh as you move your hands in to protect your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes someone have a ticklish tummy?\u201d Avallala teases as a few more Erimosi walk in and grab feathers. You fight to get the feather away from your ticklish midriff, laughing hysterically and pleading for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally are able to get the feather away from your belly, four more feathers come in and begin tickling your entire midsection. \u201cNOHOHOHO!\u201d you yell in ticklish laughter. \u201cIHIHIT TIHIHICKLEHEHES!\u201d Avallala\u2019s feather returns soon, and you become a ticklish mess, going into a laying position on the couch to try and escape. However, this only opens you up more, and the Erimosi take advantage of your vulnerable situation to tickle you further. A couple of the aliens decide to come over to you with rope, and they tie your hands up above your head to the edge of the couch. With your entire upper body exposed, more feathers join the tickle session, targeting your armpits and ribs. \u201cPLEHEHEHEHESE STAHAHAP! NOHOHOHOHO MOHOHORE TIHIHICKLIHIHING!\u201d You beg hysterically for mercy, but your pleas fall on deaf ears, as the Erimosi continue to tickle without slowing down at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually\u2026</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello and welcome to this sci-fi themed tickling interactive story! It features an intrepid human explorer, venturing into the unknown of outer space. But what you, brave explorer, are about to realize, is that the alien races you meet all have one thing in common: they're all interested in tickling you! Thankfully, most of the aliens you meet will also be quite ticklish themselves. So go and make first contact with these strange beings! Explore new worlds! And above all, find yourself in one ticklish situation after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-All story entries should have at least two substantive paragraphs of text. If you can't think of that much, maybe your idea needs a little work before adding it in. Also, please give some description to the tickling, and not just \"hahahaha\" laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This is a second-person story (as in: \"you get in the spaceship\"). Please try not to give yourself a name. Also, please keep the character gender neutral until having a gender is important to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you do give the character a gender, please give a branch that allows for both male and female options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This story is focused on tickling in a sci-fi setting. While plenty of other things can happen, the focus of the interactive is tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-That being said, this story is rated GC. Sex, sexual content, and romantic encounters are allowed and encouraged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Generally, I'm open to other kinds of things happening, especially if people are into that. One of the major alien races uses hypnosis. Want aliens that shrink or grow gigantic? Fine. (No vore, though). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-All that being said, I reserve the right to delete or edit any content I feel does not meet standards, exhibits poor writing, or takes the interactive in a direction I don't want it to. Hopefully I don't end up doing any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Anyone is allowed to add-on to anyone else's section. Feel free to move the story onward. That's what an interactive is for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that out of the way, here's a helpful description of some of the alien races in the story so far:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien races:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErimosi: Beautifully statuesque with jet black skin, the Erimosi are the ones who made first contact with humans, and the ones who gave them warp technology, artificial intelligence, and a host of other technology. Humanity owes them much.  As one of the older races in the galaxy, the Erimosi vowed to protect the Solar System from the other alien races until humans could stand on their own.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-View on tickling: The Erimosi have, with difficulty, restrained themselves from tickling humans. The have kept secret from humanity how much tickling occurs in the galaxy, until they can learn it on their own. But they would love to finally be able to tickle their human colleagues until they were weak and hysterical with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAI: The ship artificial intelligence is programmed to assist human exploration, and protect the new space-farers from harm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-View on tickling: An un-ticklish machine, the AI cannot fully understand tickling. But this makes it very curious about the phenomenon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUfu: Short and covered in soft white feathers on their limbs and back. A friendly and affectionate race.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-View on tickling: Since they're covered in feathers, tickling comes effortlessly to the Ufu, just brushing against them is quite a ticklish sensation. The Ufu love to make others smile and laugh, and can sometimes get carried away in their quest to spread mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYathi: An aggressive warrrior race, tall and covered in short fur with pointed ears, almost werewolf-like in appearance<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-View on tickling: The Yathi use tickling to establish dominance and pack hierarchy. Those who submit must obey their superiors in the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKichi: A reptilian race with a long tail instead of legs. The Kichi are deceptive and cunning, and can hypnotize most sentients by making eye-contact. Protective eye-wear recommended when dealing with them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-View on tickling: The Kichi often tickle in order to coerce eye-contact. They also love to use it to test the effectiveness of their hypnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiglin: Four armed and red skinned, the Giglin are a mysterious people rumored to pursue hedonism and sensual pleasures above all else.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-View on tickling: The Giglin are experts of physical pleasures and reactions, and are capable of sensually tickling others until they beg for more. Extreme caution is to be taken around the Giglin, those who are seduced by them seldom return.</td>",
