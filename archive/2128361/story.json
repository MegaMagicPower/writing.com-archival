            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Talari, a Guldarian woman dressed in a blue cloak, navigated her way through the market on Halon, the capital city of Guldari. She was there to purchase a slave, preferably a pleasure slave for herself or her husband, but if she found the stock lacking, then another worker slave always has it uses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe market was an incredibly busy place, with the Guldarians all trying to get a good look at the merchandise: sets of human slaves, shipped fresh from Earth, all lined-up in rows at different sections of the market. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing no clothing aside from shock collars around their necks, the humans were divided up by gender: males and females were kept in separate rows. There was no other distinction between the arrangements of the stock on display, with humans of ebony brown skin tones standing right along humans with flesh as white as snow. Adding the bustle of the market were recently-purchased humans being led out by their new masters while cage wagons filled with new slaves were brought in to take their place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particular human, however, caught Talari's eye: a tall, widely-built male with white skin. Talari thought this one, with his square jaw and muscular body, would make an excellent pleasure slave for her. However, once she looked down, she was left unimpressed: the male's penis was oddly small, likely measuring no more than 2 inches. His testicles were fairly small as well, and Talari realized this human was probably not the virile pleasure slave she'd been looking for. \"Oh well\" she thought to herself \"He could still make an excellent worker, or maybe even a soldier: he certainly won't be pleasing anyone with that little thing\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari's attention thus turned to another male in the same line-up: this male had gorgeous, ebony skin, and while shorter and not as muscular as the previous one, his genitals were far more impressive. Talari then walked up this slave and reached out, running her fingers along his smooth chest. The male looked down at her, fear and bewilderment in his eyes, while she met his gaze with a predatory grin. When she turned her attention to his cock and began rubbing and tickling it, he began to let out a moan of pleasure, drawing much attention, including that of the slaver monitoring the line-up. After he slapped Talari's hands away, she looked up at the slaver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands off my stock\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritated by his rudeness, Talari turned away and turned away. She then turned her head and looked over at a line-up of female humans, reigniting her interest. One of the females, a red-haired human with a thin face and luscious blue eyes, caught her attention quickly. Walking up towards the female but keeping her hands to herself, Talari began inspecting her body; the female herself had the same fearful look that the previous male had when Talari had looked him over. However, this fear was unfounded, as Talari was most impressed by what she saw: the female had a voluptuous body, with large breasts and an exquisitely round ass. Talari thought to herself: \"Once I get some time with this one, maybe I can give it to my husband as a gift\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari was not ready to make her decision yet, however, as another female caught her eye: this one had glowing black skin, with curled, wavy hair as dark as her flesh and bright green eyes. Her face and body were just as alluring as the other female, but her body was more curvy and muscular compared to the previous female. Talari was immediately captivated by the second female: even if she somehow proved unsatisfactory in the fields or in the bedroom, she looked fit and healthy enough to be sold off as a soldier. Feeling bold, Talari went up behind the second female and slapped her ass, before grabbing her by her vulva and briefly massaging it. Initially having a look of dread, the female was then overtaken with pleasure that lasted even after Talari walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari then went back to the male line-up she was looking at originally, and went up directly to the male she'd originally been considering. She frowned at the sight of his minuscule cock, but as she surveyed the rest of his body her interest began to return. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You\" she barked at the male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human then nervously turned his head towards her and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me your tongue\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male instantly opened his mouth and let out his tongue, which had to be twice the length of his penis. Satisfied, Talari then walked towards the back of the market and gave one last look at all the humans that had caught her eye: she chose to purchase...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Talari decided that she would purchase the male who had initially caught her eye; despite his disappointing cock, the rest of his body was so perfectly formed it seemed to have been carved from marble. She might even be willing to purchase him just so that she could gaze upon his nude form in her leisure time. Besides, there were surely other ways he could pleasure her without the use of his penis, and even failing that, she could surely get a hefty return price for him at the mines or the military.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping in and out of the cracks in the crowd, Talari walked up to the display line where the slave she intended to purchase was displayed. Taking a look at him again, she pulled a coin from her back and slipped it into the back of one of the auctioneers. She then signaled to the auctioneer, a tall, thinly-built Guldarian female with sharp cheekbones and her hair strung back in a long ponytail, to meet her in one of the private rooms and bring the slave with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Talari waited a few minutes, the auctioneer arrived, holding a leash attached to the slave's neck collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume that you intend to purchase this slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want him as? A miner, a field-worker, a soldier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I intend to purchase him as a pleasure slave to gift to my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion sprouted along the auctioneer's face, and she looked down at the male's crotch while the human hung his head in shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, if that's what you're looking for, then I can assure you we have much more impressive stock available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen your stock, and I have made my choice; I intend to purchase this one,\" Talari replied, firm in her decision. \"Now, would you kindly leave us alone for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding but still perplexed by Talari's decision, the auctioneer left through the door, while Talari began to approach the slave with the predatory gaze of a lion stalking a gazelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCircling around the slave and looking over his body, Talari then began to run her fingertips along the male's backside, clearly causing him discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dask,\" the male replied, clearly intimidated by Talari but trying to hide this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why I desire you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you want me to serve as a pleasure slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very good,\" Talari said, continuing to run her hands along his body before she slapped his buttcheeks with her right palm, causing his cracks to form in his stone-faced demeanor. Talari then circled back around to Dask's front and continued her questioning of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you impress me today, then you will live a life more desirable than the rest of your slave brethren could ever dream of,\" Talari made clear. \"So it would be wise to impress me, would it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stern frown then formed on Talari's face, and she slapped Dask along his right cheek. Guldarians were stronger than humans, so the pain was considerable and a bright red mark was left where her hand had hit. However, Dask resisted the urge to cry out in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, you shall refer to me as Mistress. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Talari said as her smile returned. She then kneeled down, bringing her eyeline level with Dask's crotch, and the frown returned to her face. This frown was not the stern, reprimanding one she had worn just moments before though, but a mocking, faux-sympathetic one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame that you'll be fighting an uphill battle to impress me,\" Talari said. \"But let's see what we can do about this little one,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari then pinched the tip of Dask's cock between her right index finger and thumb, but instead of hurting Dask like the slave expected, she began to rub the tip between her fingers, gently massaging it. The sensation was more pleasurable than nearly anything Dask had experienced in his eighteen years of life, and he began to loudly moan as his cock grew larger and harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing that her work was paying off, Talari asked another question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever been pleasured like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mistress. Thank you Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari, continuing to lightly laugh, released the tip and saw that Dask's now fully erect cock had grown to be at least six inches: far from remarkable but at least adequate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you must repay the favor. Lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDask obeyed, though he wasn't happy about it; the floor was cold and sent an uncomfortable, freezing feel along his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari then stood over him, her waist near perfectly aligned with his, and disrobed, revealing her naked form underneath. Dask looked on in awe, having never seen a Guldarian in such a vulnerable or exposed position before. More than that, Talari's body was a sight to behold; her long hair flowed gracefully down to her shoulders, while her round breasts perfectly complimented her slender figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Talari bent her knees and took hold of Dask's cock, sliding it inside of her. As she began to ride him, she leaned forward, touching her breasts to his chest. She then grabbed his sides with both her hands and brought him forward slightly, thrusting his cock deeper into her. This assertive demeanor, combined with Dask's completely passive enjoyment of the experience, made it very clear that Talari was the one in control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it went deeper into Talari, Dask's cock engorged, growing even larger in size and pleasuring his mistress even more. Just as Talari began to think about how she had made the right choice, Dask began to feel a sensation at the tip of his cock, which was currently thrust deep inside of Talari. He recognized the feeling from when he had fucked female humans during training sessions back on Earth, but he had been taught to end the encounter when he felt it; only follow through when the sex was for breeding purposes, and never follow through if a Guldarian had chosen you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDask was left with a choice: end the mind blowing pleasure he was currently experiencing, or obey what had been taught to him. He decided to...</span></div></div>",

Talari, who had been enjoying herself as well, felt the burst of semen detonate inside of her, causing pleasure to turn to rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis slave, this filthy human vermin, she thought, who she had graciously given the honor of being fucked by her, had dared to contaminate her? One thought flooded her mind: must be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari then stood up, Dask's still-wet cock sliding out of her, and she pounced on the terrified human with her eyes burning and her teeth bared. Grabbing his throat, she began to squeeze it in hopes of strangling him, with Dask futility wheezing in front of her. The human, however, made no attempt to fight back; he had already angered a Guldarian, a race he had been taught from birth to revere, he dared not commit an even greater sin by striking her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as his vision began to fade and his brain began to cease functioning, Talari recomposed herself, letting go of his throat and standing up. Dask began to weakly crawl to her as she went to retrieve her robe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you mis...mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! Stay there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari had not spared him out of altruism; she merely realized that if she killed him she would certainly have to pay for his remains, and what a waste of money that would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDask, still in pain, laid on the floor before Talari and the auctioneer returned; once they did, the latter kicked him in the stomach twice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry about this Miss,\" the auctioneer said. \"Usually the slaves are better trained than this. Is there anything we can do to make up for this...embarrassing incident for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes,\" Talari evilly grinned. \"I want this one castrated and shipped off to the mines. Make sure he doesn't last long. I also want to see the \"better options\" you mentioned, and when I make my purchase, I expect a discount of 50% or higher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....understood miss. I'll have some guards come and take this one away. Now, if you come with me, I can show you some of our finest stock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari shot one last disdainful look at Dask before following the auctioneer out of the room, while Dask remained lying on the floor, completely unaware of just how horrific the hand fate has just dealt him was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                *Three Years Later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDask was, in accordance with Talari's wishes, castrated before being shipped off to the nearby mines, along with many of the other humans who had been shipped to the market that very day. Upon arriving, Dask was sentenced to work the deepest levels of the mine, quickly developing lung cancer and dying at the age of twenty-four. His body was thrown in a mass-grave along with other human workers at the mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                    *THE END*</span></div></div>",

Receiving that specimen as a pleasure slave would certainly be a nice suprise for her husband. However, she wanted to give her prospective slave a trial run before committing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over the female slave line-up, she approached the slavemaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse Me, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you meet me in one of the private rooms around back: I may be interested in purchasing this one\" she responded, pointing at the red-haired female in the line-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari and the slavemaster exchanged nods as she head for the private rooms at the back of the market while the slavemaster put a leash on the female's collar and led her on the same path as Talari. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both parties were in  the private room, Talari made her request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm interested in purchasing this one as a gift for my husband...his life-day is in twelve solar cycles\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case miss, I think you've made a very good call. I can it shipped to your home on the day, or you can take it now: whichever you prefer\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was hoping to give it a...trial run before I made the purchase\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not supposed to permit that...but provided with...incentive...I'm sure I could make an exception\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari, catching the slavemaster' subtext, took gold coin out of her bag and dropped it into his palm. Winking, the  slavemaster left the private room, leaving Talari and the female alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female, staring at the floor and her body nervously shaking, was approached by Talari, who began running her hands along the female's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja...Jamara\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they teach you not to speak unless spoken to\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because believe me, you won't be doing much speaking. On your knees!\" Talari commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamara obeyed, looking up just in time to see Talari disrobe, revealing her naked form underneath. She had a waxed body, totally devoid of hair except on her head, along with large breasts and jewelry placed at certain points along her limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari raised her right leg and stretched it outwards, giving Jamara full view of her vulva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they teach you this back on Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamara nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get to it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamara leaned in and began to run her tongue along Talari's pussy, nervously attempting to stimulate her so as not to incur her anger. The human's efforts were appreciated: Talari moaned  in pleasure, grabbing Jamara by the back of her head and pulling her in closer so that the slave's tongue  go even deeper inside her. Soon, Talari's vulva became very wet, with Jamara savoring the sweet, nectar-like taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Talari released Jamara from her grip and went over to her bag, pulling out a strap-on from it. Jamara's inherent nervousness tripled when she saw Talari putting on this imposing contraption, but Talari did not care; she wanted a turn at penetration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on all fours\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplying, Talari, her rubber member in hand,  stood over Jamara's naked backside before falling to her knees and beginning the pegging. Entering the human's vagina, Talari began to become even wetter, while Jamara simply sat in quiet discomfort, only occasionally letting out a pained squeal; squeals that became louder as Talari pushed deeper inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalari then began thrusting the entire, twelve-inch dildo inside Jamara and only pulling out very slowly, and never completely, Jamara grimaced as Talari climaxed, spewing her body fluids out just as she removed the strap-on from Jamara's vagina, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Talari returned the strap-on to the bag and began to redress, while Jamara laid still on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they to this to you before?\" Talari, now fully dressed, asked \"Back on Earth, I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes. They'd have the males do it to us as-as practice, and sometimes the masters would do it too\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Talari went to the door and called the slavemaster in.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In the late 21st century, Earth was invaded by an alien race called the Guldarians. The Guldarians are similar to humans in appearance, but have an albino skin-tone and red eyes. They are also physically superior in many ways, including strength, longer life-spans, and greater intelligence. Ruled by a hegemonic government, their culture is rather militaristic, with their guiding doctrine being that the strong have an inherent right to control the weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a decade of conflict, the Guldarians eventually prevailed, annexing Earth into their empire and shipping the majority of humanity out into space as slaves. Now, 100 years later, in the year 2186, Earth is mostly barren, having been strip-mined by the Guldarians, with the few remaining habitable spots on the planet serving as breeding and training centers for new generations of human slaves. The slaves, bred through breeding programs and artificial wombs, spend the first eighteen years of their lives being trained in the numerous tasks they may one day perform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, however, they are taught subservience: humans are not permitted to wear clothing of any sort, they are harshly punished for the slightest infraction, and are taught to reverse Guldarians as gods. On their eighteenth birthday, the humans are shipped out to slave markets on Guldari (the homeworld of humanity's new owners) or one of the many colony worlds. Four distinct fates typically befall humans once they are purchased:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Workers </b>: The most common types of slaves, these humans spends their days toiling in factories, fields, or mines, performing tasks too tedious or dangerous for the Guldarians to perform. While typically kept in good health and provided with sufficient food so as not to impede their abilities, Workers are largely considered disposable, and they rarely reach the age of 50 due to the conditions they work in. The ones that do survive that long are usually sent back to Earth to participate in the breeding programs there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Soldiers </b>: The second most common types of slaves. If a human is found to be of particular physical capability, he or she may be directly purchased by the Guldarian military to serve as a shock trooper. Guldarian slave masters may also sell previously purchased humans to the military for this purpose if they prove unskilled at workers' tasks. The only humans permitted to wear clothing, soldiers' lives are otherwise unenviable: they live in Spartan conditions, suffer through rigorous training programs, and are typically used as cannon fodder during battle to limit Guldarian casualties. Male soldiers are also castrated and female soldiers circumcised to prevent their reproductive instincts from interfering with their duties, and are give testosterone-based steroids to increase their physical capabilities. Due to their life-styles, soldiers rarely make it past age 40.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Pleasure Slaves </b>: Pleasure humans are used by Guldarians for any variety of sexual purposes. While the two species cannot produce offspring with each other, they are physically compatible enough that intercourse is possible. Guldarian culture permits polygamy by both genders and all Guldarians are genetically bisexual, so humans of both genders can be sought for this role. Often-times a pleasure slave will be a former worker who has caught the eye of their owner and is thus conscripted for this purpose. While pleasure slaves are less common than Workers and Soldiers, it is widely considered the best possible fate a human can befall, due to the relative autonomy and the more favorable conditions: overall, pleasure slaves are treated by the Guldarians in a manner more akin to pets, as opposed to Workers and Soldiers who are generally treated like disposable tools. When a master tires of a pleasure slave, they will typically be sent to Earth to participate in the breeding program there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Food </b>: Undoubtedly the least common fate a human can befall, but some Guldarians purchase humans for the explicit purposes of cooking them and eating their flesh. Typically this is done for religious purposes: a subset of Guldarian society perform this act as a tribute to their god, Azavoss. However, the majority of Guldarians find the practice disgusting, and it is illegal across the Guldarian Empire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease Add Chapters.</td>",
