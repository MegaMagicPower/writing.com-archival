She woke up this morning with a huge smile on her face as she got out of bed with a smile on her face. She got dressed in her cute yellow sundress and pink skirt. She heard the doorbell ring downstairs. She opened it only to find a small box before her. She looked around not seeing a single soul around. She picked the box up and opened it only to find a small ring with a red gem in it. She liked how it looked and placed it on her finger. Underneath the ring, though, she found a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\"The Magic Ring\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\"How to use it properly: Rub the gem stone in the ring and state your wish and it will come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny scoffed at this as she looked at the ring.

Rubbing her eyes in disbelief she saw her hands weren't the only thing swelling up. Her slim arms were starting to get flabbier. Placing her hands on her flat belly she felt it growing soft as it pushed out against her hands. Jenny began to panic as her belly pushed out into a gut. Her sundress and skirt were growing tighter as her body grew fatter by the second. Her breasts jumped up a couple cup sizes while her hips and butt filled out. As her thickening thighs started to rub against each other she put her hands up to her face. Her cheeks were puffier and she could feel a second chin starting to form. Jenny began to wonder how big she was going to get as her weight didn't appear to be slowing down.</span></div></div>",
