My dad is an accountant for a local bank.  My mom died 3 years ago of cancer.  Aaron and I get along fine; but we\u2019re polar opposites in some ways.  He\u2019s into sports; while I\u2019m the more studious sibling.  He was also more popular with the girls; whereas I wasn\u2019t so popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends Patrick and Eric after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was sure I\u2019d gotten everything, I walked downstairs to find Aaron waiting at the front door.  We were both around 5\u201910\u201d and looked alike; so it was easy to tell that we were brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting in my car; we drove 10 minutes to school.  It didn\u2019t take long to find a parking spot; once we got there, Aaron and I went our separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into school, I found Patrick and Eric waiting by my locker.  The three of us had known each other since Kindergarten; we did everything together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool went by without incident; except for a humorous encounter between Aaron and Kelly O\u2019Rourke at lunch.  Aaron\u2019s had a crush on her since 8th grade; but she never gives him the time of day.  Kelly was the most popular girl in the sophomore class; along with her friends Amber Riley and Samantha Paterson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was walking into the lunch when it happened; I watched as Aaron walked over to Kelly\u2019s table and asked if she\u2019d like to go to the movies tonight.  I give him credit for trying; but when is he going to learn that Kelly\u2019s answer will always be no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being rejected by his crush; Aaron graciously said goodbye and went off to join his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce school got out, Aaron and I met up with Patrick and Eric by my car.  Looking at Aaron, Patrick said, \u201cYou want to play basketball with us, Aaron?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all got to my house a short time later.  After putting our things inside, Aaron and I joined the others in our driveway.  The game proceeded without incident; with Aaron and me leading 10-7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had the ball in hand and threw it; missing the hoop and rolling down the driveway.  Running after it, I picked up the ball just in time to hear a car\u2019s horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, the last thing I remember seeing was a truck rushing towards me.</span></div></div>",

Careful to take the IV stand with me; I failed to notice the extra weight on my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the lights in the bathroom, I saw something completely unexpected in the mirror.  Not only was my hair down to my shoulders, but I had\u2026BREASTS!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic, I pulled up the hospital gown to find that I now had a vagina.  Screaming at the top of my lungs, I barely had time to realize how high-pitched the scream was before I fainted and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up sometime later to find a young nurse, in her 20s, standing at the foot of my bed.  I felt...off; so it didn\u2019t take long to realize I was given drugs to calm myself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the nurse, I said, \u201cW-What happened to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were hit by a truck, Brian.\u201d Walking over, checking my stats, the nurse said, \u201cYour lower body was nearly crushed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did that involve turning me into a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t...much left down there; so the doctors did what they could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse turned to leave, I said, \u201cH-How long have I been here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to me, in a sad tone, the nurse said, \u201cAlmost 6 months.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Before closing the door, dad turned to me and said, \"We'll talk later, when you are able to stay calm, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I burst into tears as the door closed.

Making his presence known, Dad said, \u201cRachel, can I speak to my...daughter in private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Getting up, Rachel said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside if you need me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rachel closed the door behind her, Dad turned to me and said, \"I wanted to apologize for what I said earlier; you're still in shock over this and it wasn't right of me to call you a young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Turning to Dad, I said, \u201cI guess everything that's happened was too much for me to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand how you may feel overwhelmed by all of this; but know that everyone is willing to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may feel overwhelmed?\u201d shocked, I said, \"Dad, I just woke up from being in a coma for 6 months to find out that I've been turned into a girl.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can\u2019t fault you for acting like that. But,\u201d pulling a chair over to my bedside, Dad said, \u201cYou have to understand that I did what I thought was best for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that you had my best interests in mind when you agreed to this.  But,\" Leaning back in the bed, I said, \"It's going to take me a while to accept this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking my hand, Dad said, \u201cWe\u2019ll help you through this, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe talked for a little while; with dad filling me on everything that\u2019s happened while I was in the coma. I was happy to learn that my 23 year old cousin got engaged to her boyfriend of 3 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting close to the 7:00 when Dad decided to leave so I could rest. As dad got up to leave, I turned to him and said, \u201cWhen do you think I can leave the hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctor wants to keep you under observation for a few days.\u201d Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be out just before school starts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's just great.\" With a chuckle, I said, \"Not only do I have to adjust to being a girl; but now I'm starting my senior year as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, you won\u2019t be a senior.\u201d Looking at me, with a wince, Dad said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be repeating junior year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, I said, \u201cWHAT!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it, Brian; you were in a coma for the last 3 months of school.\u201d Pausing, Dad said, \u201cThe school feels you should repeat junior year to get what you missed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cGot any more surprises?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, there is something else.\u201d Taking a breath, Dad said, \u201cYour new name is Allison Elena Summers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad left soon after that; to give me some time to think about everything he\u2019d told me. It wasn\u2019t long before one of the evening nurses delivered my dinner; lasagna and a salad.  After eating dinner, I decided to go to bed early.</span></div></div>",

My grandparents were overjoyed to see that I was alright; although they both said they needed to get used to me being a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon found myself on the front porch with my cousins; from 5 year old Connor to 23 year old Melissa.

I may be a girl now; but I\u2019m not going to wear frilly or pink underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ran into the first familiar face when we got to the pants section; Kelly O\u2019Rourke.  I was looking at some capris when she stopped at a rack next to me.  Rather than have an awkward silence between us, I turned to her and said, \u201cHi Kelly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of pants in her hands, Kelly turned to look at me.  For a moment it seemed as if she didn\u2019t recognize me; until she said, \u201cBrian Summers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cI go by Allison now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard what happened to you; I\u2019m so sorry about that.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you\u2019re out of the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly and I talked for a few minutes before she had to leave.  Before she left, she handed me the pair of pants that were in her hands.  \u201cTry these on; you\u2019ve got a better figure for than I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but blush at that; hearing my brother\u2019s crush say I had a better figure than her.  Although by looking at her, to my surprise, I realized that I had a better figure then Kelly.  Taking the pants, smiling, I said, \u201cThanks, Kelly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, as she walked away, Kelly said, \u201cSee you at school, Allison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to look through the pants until Dad came back; having gone off to pick out some shirts for me to try on.  Putting them in the cart, Dad said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve got enough clothes for you to try on, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think we do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then took the cart to the nearest dressing room; where I went into the first empty stall and closed the door.  Looking at the shirts my dad picked; I was relieved to see that they weren\u2019t overly feminine.  There were some lighter colors; peach and cream, but nothing too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next 20 minutes trying on the clothes; occasionally stepping out to show dad.  After a while, I eliminated about 5 pairs of pants and 6 shirts from the pile; mostly because they didn\u2019t fit right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the dressing room, I put the clothes that I wanted in the cart.  Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cNow we\u2019ve just got to buy you some shoes; then we\u2019ll go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked through the store, I said, \u201cHow many pairs do I need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I learned anything from your mother; it\u2019s that a woman should have shoes to match every outfit.\u201d Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cI think 3 or 4 pairs should be enough for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were finished with the shopping a short time later; after choosing 4 pairs of shoes that I liked.  Walking up to the register, I said, \u201cThanks for doing this, dad; this is probably uncomfortable for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I ever expected to do.  But,\u201d looking at me, Dad said, \u201cYou\u2019re my daughter now; I want to help you any way I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long until it was our turn at the register.  As I was putting our purchases on the counter, the cashier reached under the counter and handed me what looked like a rather expensive purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I looked at her and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier, a girl in her late teens, smiled and said, \u201cThe store heard what happened to you; please accept this purse as a gift from us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I-I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d trying to hand the purse back, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the purse back towards me, the cashier said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to insist they take the purse back; but I soon realized that they were trying to be nice.  Putting the purse in the cart, I smiled and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Looking at me, with a smile on her face, she said, \u201cWith everything that\u2019s happened; you deserve this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for the purchases, Dad and I left the store to go home.  As we walked to the car, I said, \u201cCan I drive home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ally.\u201d Pausing, Dad turned to me and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a license yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d opening the trunk, Dad said, \u201cBrian did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I said, \u201cWhen can I get a new license?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do that tomorrow; first thing  so we don\u2019t wait in line.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Aaron stayed quite as he helped carry some bags as well; clearly uncomfortable with the idea that I\u2019d just bought girls\u2019 clothing.  He was benefiting from that however, as he was getting my old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Aaron\u2019s help, we took all my old clothes to his room.  As I turned to go back to my room, Aaron said, \u201cLet me know if you need any help, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d  Smiling, I said, \u201cI will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next hour or so putting away my new clothes; watching a movie in the process.  Once all my new clothes were put away, I sat down on the bed and gazed at my closet.  I\u2019d kept some of my favorite shirts as keepsakes; but for the most part my closet was full of girl\u2019s clothes now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather depressing; thinking about how quickly I\u2019d managed to replace all my clothing.  Instead of dwelling on that, I decided to head to the bathroom to take a relaxing shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the bathroom, I closed but didn\u2019t lock the door.  After getting undressed, I turned on the water and stepped into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the curtain shot, I closed my eyes as the water hit my body.  One of the many things I\u2019d have to get used to was how sensitive my skin was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my hair was sufficiently wet, failing to hear the bathroom door opening, I went to grab the shampoo.  When I didn\u2019t find it, I briefly wondered where it was before remembering I\u2019d left it on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching my hand through the curtain, I heard Aaron say, \u201cHere you go, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, I said, \u201cThanks, Aaron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after a few seconds had passed that I suddenly realized what just happened.  Throwing the shower curtain open, I saw Aaron sitting on the toilet with his mouth wide open and his face a deep red.  It wasn\u2019t long before I realized I was giving my younger brother the perfect opportunity to look at my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Aaron, I said, \u201cWhat the hell, Aaron!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAverting his eyes, Aaron said, \"Could you cover yourself, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping the shower curtain around my chest, I said, \u201cI\u2019m a girl now; you can\u2019t just come in here while I\u2019m in the shower!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...sorry, sis.\u201d  Extremely embarrassed, Aaron said, \u201cI-I...forgot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou forgot!?\u201d gesturing to my chest, I said, \u201cHow could you forget; when I have these sticking out of my chest!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying another word, Aaron quickly got up and left the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, after getting out of the shower and getting dressed, I decided to pay Aaron a visit.  We spent some time talking about how since I was a girl now; things would have to be different around here.  He couldn't simply come into the bathroom without knocking first; I'm not a boy anymore, so it wasn't appropriate for him to see me naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Aaron and I finished talking, I excused myself to give him some privacy.  As I walked back to my room, I realized that all of us were in for some adjustment.</span></div></div>",

After taking a shower, I dried off and went back to my room to get dressed.  The first thing I did was grab a bra from the dresser.  While most of the bras that I\u2019d bought were white; I\u2019d also picked out some black ones as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while doing that I realized black bras don\u2019t work well with every top.  I was getting my picture taken today for my new license, and I didn\u2019t want a mistake like that to follow me for the next few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done getting dressed, I walked back into the bathroom to see about my hair.  It took ten minutes of brushing to fix it; causing me to consider a shorter hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure I looked presentable, careful not wake Aaron, I walked downstairs to the kitchen.  Going into the kitchen, I saw Dad reading the paper at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him, I said, \u201cDoes this outfit look good for my photo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at me, a smile on his face, Dad said, \u201cYou look nice, Allison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I wasn\u2019t used to being a girl yet; it was still nice to be complimented.  Smiling, I said, \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I had a quick bite to eat, I said goodbye to Aaron and got in the car with dad.</span></div></div>",

Seeing me, she said, \u201cHey Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kelly.\u201d Stepping aside, I said, \u201cCome on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aaron saw Kelly, I swear his jaw dropped.  \u201cKelly!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, I said, \u201cI believe you know my younger brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Aaron.\u201d Pausing, Kelly said, \u201cHow are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPr-Pretty good.\u201d Composing himself, Aaron said, \u201cW-What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Aaron, I said, \u201cI called her; I needed someone to talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking with Aaron for a few minutes, Kelly and I went upstairs to my room while he went back to his video games.  Once we were in my room, I closed my door and sat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to me on the bed, Kelly said, \u201cSo, you nervous about school tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little bit; mostly because I\u2019m going back as a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked for a little while; mainly about how I was adjusting to my new gender.  After a while, Kelly suggested that we watch a movie to get my mind off everything.  As I went to pick out a movie, to my surprise, Kelly hit me in the back with a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, I spun around to find Kelly looking at me with a big grin on her face.  \u201cWhat did you that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve got something on my mind; I find a distraction is always a good remedy.\u201d Tossing me a pillow, Kelly said, \u201cDo you accept my challenge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin of my own, I said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before we were in a full blown pillow fight; laughing and having a good time as we hit each other with pillows.  After a while, I tripped on my carpet and fell to the floor.  Pinning me to the floor, a grin on her face, Kelly said, \u201cDo you give up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning over on my back, chuckling, I said, \u201cNever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe rough housed for a few minutes; until I got the upper hand and pinned Kelly to the floor.  Both of us were exhausted at this point; but it was then that something strange happened.  As we tried to catch our breath; I felt a weird sensation in my chest, almost as if my breasts were getting harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that wasn\u2019t weird enough; I noticed the same thing happening to Kelly.  It didn\u2019t take long for me realize what was happening.  \u201cHoly shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could anything, Kelly had sat up and kissed me on the lips.  I tried to resist; but I soon found myself kissing her back.  It wasn\u2019t long before we were making out with each other; as I started to feel wet in my pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made out for what seemed like an eternity before we stopped; collapsing to the floor as we struggled to catch our breath.  Looking at me, panting, Kelly said, \u201cThat...was...unexpected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, I said, \u201cWhat...just...happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up and resting against the foot of my bed, Kelly said, \u201cWe...just...made out...Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re both...girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean anything.\" looking at me, Kelly said.  \"Girls kiss each other all the time, some experiment by taking it a step further as we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill confused, I looked at Kelly and said, \u201cSo it\u2019s...normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d A grin on her face, Kelly said, \u201cWas it good for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit thrown off guard by the question.  Looking at her, blushing, I said, \u201cYeah...it felt good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we composed ourselves, Kelly and I went back to my room to watch a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were still watching the movie when Dad came home.  Poking his head into my door, Dad said, \u201cHello, Allison.\u201d Spotting Kelly, Dad said, \u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to Kelly, I said, \u201cThis is Kelly O\u2019Rourke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Kelly.\u201d Pausing, Dad said, \u201cI\u2019m Allison\u2019s father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Mr. Samuels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly left a few hours later; after staying for dinner.  After saying goodbye to Kelly, I went upstairs to get ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth, Dad came into the room to talk.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m going to bring you to school tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause of that doctor.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cI\u2019d feel better if I knew you were safe at school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThanks, dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging me, Dad said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, kiddo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done brushing my teeth, I went back to my room.  After getting an outfit together for tomorrow, I set my alarm and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

Waking up around 5:45 the next morning, I quickly took a shower so Aaron didn\u2019t have to wait until the last minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick breakfast, I grabbed my things and followed Aaron out to dad\u2019s car.  I was hopeful that my first day back at school would be uneventful; but that changed when I saw what looked to be a mob of reports waiting outside the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that, I groaned, \u201cOh no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, parking the car, Dad said, \u201cStay close, Allison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car, I got between Dad and Aaron as we walked towards the school.  The reports surrounded me the moment I stepped onto the sidewalk.  \u201cMiss Samuels; you\u2019re returning to school for the first time since your accident.\" Looking at me, a middle aged reporter said, \u201cAre you at all nervous about how your peers will react?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could respond, another reporter said, \u201cIs there any lady friend who\u2019s helping you through this transition?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you still date girls, having the mind of a boy, or will the new hormones change that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting nervous, I said, \u201cDad...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of here!\u201d angrily, Dad said, \u201cLeave my daughter alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a camera flashed in my face; temporally blinding me.  Before I knew what was happening, someone grabbed my arm.  I tried to pull away; when Aaron said, \u201cRelax Ally, it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron and Dad led me into school, the reporters continued to question me.  \u201cMiss Samuels, would you consider a romantic relationship in the future?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Samuels...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally having had enough, I yelled, \u201cLeave me alone!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone knew what happened, a gunshot rang through the area.  Everyone turned to see a police officer standing by his car; I relieved when I recognized him as Melissa\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a calm, but firm tone, Leo said, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask that you all disperse immediately; before I have you arrested for harassing Miss Samuels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was relieved to see the reporters start to leave; as Leo cautiously walked towards me.  He was a good guy; around 5\u201911\u201d with brown hair.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cThanks, Leo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, Ally.\u201d Hugging me, Leo said, \u201cJust doing my job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over, Dad looked at Leo and said, \u201cHow\u2019d you know to come here, Leo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa knew that reporters would be interested in Ally; so she asked me to come here and make sure she was safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all talked for a few minutes, until it was time for Aaron and me to go inside for school.  Hugging Leo again, I said, \u201cThanks again, Leo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the school, after making sure I was alright, Aaron went off to his locker.  I noticed some people staring at me as I made my way through the halls; but that stopped when Patrick and Eric appeared next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe saw the reporters outside; are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cLeo came to my rescue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking for a few minutes, Patrick and Eric went off to their first classes.  I was standing by my locker; trying to ignore the stares I was getting, when I saw 2 familiar faces walking towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on my face, I turned to Sam and Kelly.  \u201cHey guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin on her face, Sam said, \u201cFirst day of school; and you\u2019re already popular with the news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on my shoulder, in a caring tone, Kelly said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cThanks for asking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was about to say something else; when she was interrupted by her other friend Amber Riley.  \u201cWhat are you two doing talking to <i>him</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber\u2019s been known to be outspoken in school; never one to keep her opinions to herself.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not a guy anymore, Amber; I\u2019m a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not; because you weren\u2019t born a girl.\u201d  Glaring at me, Amber said, \u201cYou may have had an operation; but you\u2019re still a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, Kelly stood next to me and said.  \u201cWhat are you doing, Amber?  Ally\u2019s been through so much lately; she doesn\u2019t need this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be okay with her, Kelly.  But,\u201d chuckling, Amber said, \u201cSam and I don\u2019t want to be seen with a freak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat went right through me; causing me to gasp in shock.  I was about to say something in response, when Sam said, \u201cDon\u2019t bring me into this, Amber.\u201d Standing next to me, Sam said, \u201cAlly\u2019s a girl just like us; and I\u2019m going to help her adjust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d shocked, Amber said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to jeopardize our friendship for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring at Amber, Kelly said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be like this, I think it\u2019s time to reevaluate our friendship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing left to say, Amber turned and walked away.  Turning to Sam and Kelly, I said, \u201cI appreciate the help guys; but I don\u2019t want to destroy a friendship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please.\u201d Grinning, Sam said, \u201cIf she\u2019s going to act like that, I don\u2019t want to be friends with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly nodded in agreement; saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll help you through this, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, I said, \u201cThanks guys.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As it turned out, the three of us had our first class of the day together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I put some things into my locker, I followed Kelly and Sam through the halls to where our Chemistry class was.  The three of us walked into the classroom; with everyone going quite when they realized that I was in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was deafening; as I found myself worried that everyone was going to react like Amber had.  Imagine my surprise when they simply went back to what they were doing; as Kelly, Sam and I took our seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that a couple classmates walked over.  One of them, Kyle Rogers, was one of Aaron's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Allison.\u201d Looking at me, Kyle said, \u201cIts...good to see you\u2019re out of the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Kyle.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cIt feels good to be out of there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning went by quickly; I had a few encounters with people who weren\u2019t very accepting of my situation, but other than that it wasn\u2019t that bad of a morning.  Pretty soon it was lunch time, and I found myself heading to the lunch room with Kelly and Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked into the lunch room, I saw Patrick and Eric sitting at our usual table.  Glancing at Sam and Kelly, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting me as I made my over, Eric said, \u201cHow\u2019s your morning going, Ally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty good.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cDid you hear what happened with Amber?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we did.\u201d Glancing at me, Patrick said, \u201cDon\u2019t let her get to you, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to, Pat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to a chair, Eric said, \u201cCare to join us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I already told Kelly and Sam I\u2019d eat with them.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Smiling, Eric said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you later, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful; although it was interesting being in the same math class as Aaron.  I guess that would work well for him; as he was never good at math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the final bell rang, I grabbed my things and made my way outside.  As I walked down the sidewalk, I saw Kelly walking towards me.  She looked nervous about something.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Kelly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me, Ally.\u201d Taking my arm, Kelly said, \u201cSam spotted some reporters waiting in the junior parking lot; she\u2019s getting her car and picking us up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking Aaron up; the four of us drove to my house.  I\u2019d invited Patrick and Eric over; but they both had to work.  Once inside the house, Aaron locked the doors and turned to me.  \u201cLet me know if you guys need anything, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Aaron.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWe will.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sam and Kelly had both told me the same thing; minus the \u2018freak\u2019 part; when they tried to coax me into trying something more girly. Even though she said that I didn\u2019t need much; I still refused to use make up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought they\u2019d dropped it; but that was until this morning. Kelly tried a different approach this time; by appealing to my ego. That explained why I was wearing a knee-length skirt and a hint of make up to school this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to hide my anger and frustration as Amber continued to mock me. Fortunately I saw Patrick walk into the school at that moment. One glare from him made Amber shut up. With a smirk, she looked at me and said, \u201cSee you in gym, freak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I watched Amber walk off, I turned to look at Patrick. With a sympathetic tap on my shoulder, Patrick said, \u201cMost of the guys are envious about what you\u2019re going to do, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know how to react to that; losing my identity wasn\u2019t worth even a cheap look at girls in their locker room. Looking at Patrick, I felt I had to give him an explanation. \u201cSam thought dressing like this would get people to back off.\u201d Almost crying, I said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t Amber back off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome people are jerks, Ally.\u201d With a slight hesitation, Patrick pulled me in for a hug, \u201cDon\u2019t let her win; go in there and show that bitch who you are.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I watched as the ball rolled down the driveway; running after it as I saw Aaron out of the corner of my eye.  Before I knew what was happening, Aaron had pushed me out of the way and stumbled into the street.  The next thing I knew; I saw Aaron take a direct hit by the truck.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d crying out in my sleep, I whispered.  \u201cAaron!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">I wanted to run out to my little brother but I was powerless to move from my place on the sidewalk and could only watch in horror as a pool of blood formed under the truck\u2019s front wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could scream out in my sleep, the dream shifted to me looking at Aaron as he lay in a coma at the hospital.  Only he no longer looked like Aaron; the surgeons had made him into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at dad, I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis pelvic region was completely crushed, Brian.\u201d Holding back tears, Dad said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t have long to live...I was desperate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></i><br>\r\nI was sweating by this time, tossing and turning on the bed as I whispered, \u201cNo!  This is wrong!  That should be me, not you, Aaron!\u201d<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i><br>\r\nThe dream soon shifted to where I was standing by the bed as...Nora was told about the news.  Nora completely fell apart; just as I had.  I wanted to pull her into a hug but didn\u2019t know if it would help.  Dad pulled me out of the room as I cried in my sleep.  The dream shifted again; to Nora leaving the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment we got out of the hospital; we were bombarded by dozens of reporters, all of them wanting to ask Nora questions.  We eventually made it to the car; with the reporters hounding us the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was already crying at this point, begging to be left alone as we pulled out of the parking lot. \u201cSorry about that, Nora.\u201d Glancing at her, Dad said, \u201cIt\u2019s been all over the news since that doctor went to the papers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill crying, Nora placed her head on my shoulder.  \u201cWhat am I going to do, big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Nora was frightened and confused, I hesitantly pulled her into a hug.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay...sis.\u201d holding her, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ll work this out.\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that I woke up; finding myself in tears.  For a moment, I did not know where I was and began to call for Nora.  A moment later, I regained my grip on reality but still found myself shaken by the dream.</span></div></div>",

Walking to the bathroom, still shaken from the dream, I splashed some cold water on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at my reflection in the mirror, I said to myself, \u201cThat was one freaky dream; now I know a little of what Aaron\u2019s going through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter composing myself, I decided to go to the kitchen to get a midnight snack.  With a glass of milk and a piece of bread, I sat down at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was taking a bite of the bread, when I heard footsteps in the hallway.  I looked up to see Aaron shuffling into the room; looking as if he was half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the table, Aaron looked at me and said, \u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath, I said, \u201cI-I had a rather disturbing dream; I\u2019d rather not go back to sleep for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Aaron said, \u201cWhat was the dream about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got hit by the truck instead of me; you became a girl instead of me.\u201d  Sighing, I said, \u201cI-I felt like I had no idea what I could do for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel the same way, Ally.\u201d  Pausing, Aaron said, \u201cWhen we were younger, we always had each other\u2019s backs.  But now that you\u2019re a girl; it\u2019s like we never hang out anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>So that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering him.</i></span>\u201d Looking at Aaron, I said, \u201cJust because I\u2019m a girl doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t spend time together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say that now.  But,\u201d sighing, Aaron said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe you when you\u2019ve all your free time with Kelly and Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re helping me adjust, Aaron.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThey\u2019re also the only girls who\u2019ve gone out of their way to help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that; and I can understand why you\u2019d want to spend time with them.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Aaron said, \u201cJust don\u2019t forget that you\u2019ve got other people who care about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that Aaron was right, I looked at him and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; after school...today, we can all hang out together at the mall or something.  The 6 of us will spend the afternoon together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron and I talked for a little while longer; until we both started to feel tired again.

That was until school ended for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was going to my locker to grab my things before heading to the mall with the others.  I\u2019d told them that I\u2019d meet them there; with Kelly riding with Sam and Eric giving Aaron and Patrick a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d just finished grabbing my things and was heading to the door, when Aubrey appeared in front of me.  \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, freak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing to the mall with my friends.\u201d Realizing that I was being surrounded, I said, \u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, as a matter of fact.\u201d Stepping closer, Aubrey said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew what was happening, I was dragged into the nearby girls\u2019 room.  I was unable to do anything as Aubrey and another girl shoved me into a stall.  Forcing me onto the toilet, Aubrey grabbed a bag from another girl and pulled out a rather feminine looking outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Aubrey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Aubrey said, \u201cIf you want to be a girl; you should dress like one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was powerless to escape as Aubrey spent the next 20 minutes giving me an unwanted makeover.  When she was finished, she shoved me in front of the mirror.  I was shocked to see that I was now wearing a feminine skirt with matching top and a pair of heels.  I even had make up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Aubrey, I said, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo show everyone how much of a girl you really are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought everything was done; until I was pulled out of the bathroom and led down the hall.  Before I knew it; I was being shoved into the girls\u2019 locker room.  Closing the door behind me, Aubrey said, \u201cHave fun, Allison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling in the heels, I looked up to find that I\u2019d been shoved into the locker room just as the cheer squad was getting changed.  Fearing the worst, I was about to start crying when one of the girls walked forward.  I recognized her as Caitlyn Fitzpatrick; a former classmate of mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, she said, \u201cLet me guess; Aubrey did this to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she did.\u201d Tearing up, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019d wear this willingly, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, Allison.\u201d Gesturing me to sit down, Caitlyn said, \u201cWe all know how mean Aubrey can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pleasantly surprised by how kind the cheerleaders were; they retrieved my clothes and helped me get changed.  Once I was back in my original outfit, I said, \u201cThanks guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned to leave, Caitlyn came over to me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, Allison.  But,\u201d pausing, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the perfect body for a cheerleader.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m barely used to being a girl.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for that just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep it in mind, okay?\u201d smiling, Caitlyn said, \u201cIn the mean time; the squads got your back.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Spotting the others sitting at a table, I walked over to them.  As I got closer, I could tell that Aaron was being rather shy around Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Patrick saw me.  \u201cThere you are!  What took you so long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told them what happened with Aubrey; all of them were shocked.  Looking at me, Sam said, \u201cI knew Aubrey didn\u2019t like you; but I didn\u2019t expect her to do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what you need, Ally?\u201d smiling, Kelly said, \u201cA relaxing afternoon of shopping at the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cI thought we were doing that tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me; you need this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we all had something to eat, we got up and started to go shopping.  I was surprised when Aaron, Patrick, and Eric decided to hang around; but they said they wanted to be supportive of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting to be led into the girl\u2019s section, I was surprised to find myself in the guy\u2019s section.  \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cYou do know I\u2019m a girl now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo.\u201d Chuckling, Kelly said, \u201cDo you know how many girls wear boy\u2019s shirts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that have to do with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, Sam said, \u201cThis is the best place for you to start making your new look; with something you\u2019re familiar with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Eric came over holding a shirt in his arms.  \u201cI found this in the girl\u2019s section; I thought it was appropriate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the shirt, which said \u2018Tough Princess\u2019 on the front, I blushed and said, \u201cSorry Eric; that\u2019s not my style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Kelly handed me a shirt; which said \u2018<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>What Are You Looking At?</i></span>\u2019  Smiling, Kelly said, \u201cHow about this one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shirt in hand, I went into a nearby changing room.  After putting the shirt on, I went back outside to get an opinion.  The minute I walked over to the group, Eric and Patrick started to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at them, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill chuckling, Eric pointed to my shirt.  \u201cTake a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to a nearby mirror, I saw why they were laughing.  Because the shirt wasn\u2019t made for my new body and figure, \u2018<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>What Are You Looking At?</i></span>\u2019 was positioned over my chest.  I couldn\u2019t help but start laughing at that; the first genuine laugh I\u2019ve had since waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on my face, I said, \u201cI think I like this shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that humorous moment, I changed back into my other shirt and joined the others.  Once that was done, we picked out some other shirts before moving onto the girl\u2019s clothing section.  We spent some time in there; picking out some more skirts and, to my embarrassment, a few dresses and bikinis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during that time I realized how awkward this must be for the guys.  After discussing it with Kelly and Sam; we each picked out the least feminine shirt for them to try on, so they\u2019d feel involved.  They were mortified at first; but relaxed when they saw that I was laughing again.  To make them feel better, I even decided to buy the shirts for myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent over 2 hours at the mall by time we finally left; as we left, I found myself admitting that it made me feel better after what\u2019s been happening at school.  As we walked to where we\u2019d all parked, Kelly said, \u201cYou guys feel up to some pool time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d pausing, Eric said, \u201cWhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a pool at my house; how about we all meet there in a little while to relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Kelly.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not ready for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Kelly said, \u201cCome on, Ally; you need this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Realizing that I wasn\u2019t getting out of this, I said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, we all agreed to meet at Kelly\u2019s house in 45 minutes.  After taking a bathing suit from the bag, I asked Aaron to bring the rest of the clothes to my room once he got home.</span></div></div>",

While I still wasn\u2019t used to having a figure, the bikini did a good job of showing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing myself, I walked back to Kelly\u2019s room just as she\u2019d finished getting changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, blushing, Kelly said, \u201cYou look amazing in that, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great too, Kel.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cBut we\u2019re hardly wearing anything; I feel so...vulnerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to the beach, Ally.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Kelly said, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to my backyard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the guys?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cHow do you think they\u2019ll react?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Eric and Patrick will be surprised by how attractive it makes you look; but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll see you any differently.\u201d Pausing, Kelly said, \u201cAaron\u2019s going to be surprised though; deep down I think he still sees you as his older brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Kelly.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI-I guess I\u2019m just a little scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer, a smile on her face, Kelly said, \u201cLet me help you with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kelly kissed me on the lips; followed by me kissing her back.

What\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, I broke the kiss and stepped away from Kelly.  Looking at Sam, blushing, I said, \u201cH-Hey Sam; w-we didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see why.\u201d Shocked, Sam said, \u201cIs there something going on that I should know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to me, Kelly said, \u201cWe\u2019re just experimenting, Sam; it\u2019s normal for girls our age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about that, Kelly?\u201d  Glancing at Kelly, Sam said, \u201cAre you really sure that\u2019s the reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning pale, Kelly said, \u201cSam, please...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a quick glance to me, Sam turned back to Kelly and said, \u201cWe both know you had feelings for Brian and Aaron.\u201d Sternly, Sam said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t act upon those feelings because you didn\u2019t want to divide them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by that, I turned to Kelly and said, \u201cY-You had feelings for me and Aaron?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly ignoring me, getting defensive, Kelly said, \u201cBrian woke up as a girl; she\u2019s going through so much.\u201d Sighing, Kelly said, \u201cShe called me, needing support, and one thing turned to another...it just happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is just as much my fault, Sam.\u201d  Stepping next to Kelly, I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t push her away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Aaron ever sees the two of you experimenting you\u2019ll both break his heart.

I was the first to speak.  \u201cKelly, I-I think we need to stop.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cAaron\u2019s my little brother; I don\u2019t want to hurt him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked as if Kelly was going to protest; when she said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Turning to me, Kelly said, \u201cI-I guess I was hoping that my feelings for you wouldn\u2019t change now that you\u2019re a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you would\u2019ve told me you had feelings for me.\u201d Turning to Kelly, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re quite the good kisser, Kelly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, looking at me, Kelly said, \u201cYou\u2019re not too bad yourself, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the two of us, Sam said, \u201cAre you to going to be alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, I said, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing some towels, the three of us walked downstairs to go outside.  As we walked through the kitchen, I saw Aaron and the others standing in the pool.  Taking a deep breath, I walked out onto the deck.  All of three of them went silent as they noticed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, I said, \u201cHow do I look, guys?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I knew them well enough to know what they were thinking; that they should check out the attractive girl standing in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t surprised when, as Kelly had said, Patrick and Eric quickly forced a smile onto their faces as they started to act like a couple of idiots.<br>\r\nStarting to blush, Eric said, \u201cStop checking her out, Pat!  That\u2019s Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one checking her out!\u201d punching Eric in the arm, Pat said, \u201cKnock it off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said; they were acting like a couple of idiots.  It actually made me feel comfortable around them; seeing them behaving normally.  At that point, I turned to Aaron and saw that he was blushing worse than me.

Breaking the surface, he looked at me and said, \u201cAlly!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped away from the edge; afraid that he\u2019d pull me into the pool.  I failed to notice Sam and Kelly sneaking up behind me.  Before I knew what happened, they pushed me into the pool.  I surfaced next to Aaron as he started laughing.  It wasn\u2019t long before we were all laughing; having a good time in each other\u2019s company.</span></div></div>",

As I floated on a pool chair, I saw how easily everyone seemed to get along with each other; especially Sam and Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a bikini in the pool was an interesting experience; nothing like wearing a boy\u2019s bathing suit.  On top of that; it felt weird swimming and feeling the water move around my chest.  It reminded me how sensitive my body was now; especially when it came to swimming or taking a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was floating aimlessly in the pool, relaxing and soaking in the sun, when I saw Patrick swimming over to me.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cHey Pat, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing much.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cI-I was just wondering how you\u2019re doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s see.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cI get hit by a truck and wake up a girl; all things considered, I\u2019ve been better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, you look good in the bikini.\u201d  Blushing, Patrick said, \u201cW-What\u2019s it like to wear one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m barely wearing anything.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cI feel...vulnerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and I talked for a little while longer; although it was clear that Patrick was hiding something from me.  I knew how stubborn he could be, so I decided not to push him.  We all spent a little while longer at Kelly\u2019s house before we decided it was time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next was a surprise to me; Kelly had asked if Eric would take a picture of us girls.  Once that was done; we took two more pictures; one with me and the guys and one with everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed in the bathroom, I walked to the stairs just as Aaron and Kelly were finishing a conversation.  I watched as Aaron walked away; leaving a frustrated Kelly standing by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned, I walked down to her and said, \u201cKel, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense, Ally; but your brother drives me crazy sometimes.\u201d Sighing, Kelly turned to me and said, \u201cWhen it seems like he wants to say something to me; he\u2019s either too shy or can\u2019t stop shaking when he\u2019s near me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe gets like that when he\u2019s not sure how someone will react.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cHe was like that with me after I got out of the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head in frustration, Kelly said, \u201cHe knows I don\u2019t bite, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, in a teasing tone, I said, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s got a crush on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Him having a cr-crush on me?\u201d giving a nervous giggle, Kelly said, \u201cHe-He\u2019s too immature for me; no offense, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d Shrugging my shoulders, I said, \u201cI know from experience that he can be immature at times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What should I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could always ask him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d shocked, Kelly said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t ask him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you ask him out, Kelly?\u201d smiling, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s the 21st century; girls ask boys out all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what.\u201d Steeling herself, Kelly said, \u201cI-I\u2019ll ask him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched from the car as Kelly talked to Aaron.  I wasn\u2019t able to hear them; but I knew things went well when both Kelly and Aaron smiled.  Kelly looked at me with a smile on her face; as Aaron got into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, as I pulled out of Kelly\u2019s driveway, Aaron said, \u201cThank you, sis.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know why I did that; considering I had no interest in exploring, as one insensitive jerk at school had suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to lie down in bed; my mind telling me that I was tired from swimming.  Aside from gym class, that was the first real exercise I\u2019ve had since the hospital.  It was certainly the most enjoyable; getting to relax with my friends in the privacy of a backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to grab my laptop; when I noticed my reflection in my mirror, my hair flowing down over one shoulder.  It was at that moment that I found the answer to a question I\u2019d been asking myself since I woke up; \u201cYes, I can live like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing my laptop, I turned it on and walked back to bed.  I was about to sit down when I heard a ringing coming from it; someone was calling me on Skype.  Seeing that it was Melissa, I quickly decided to put on some pajamas before answering the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, I lay down in bed and answered the call.  I was immediately greeted by Melissa with a big smile on her face.  \u201cHey cuz, how was your day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mel.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cIt was fun, I spent some time at a friend\u2019s pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d grinning, Melissa said, \u201cDid you wear a bikini?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cI did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did it feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI felt a little vulnerable; but it wasn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019d expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked for a while before Dad called me down for dinner.

Walking into my room, I placed the bags by my desk just as Aaron knocked on my door.  \u201cHey Ally, can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Praying he didn\u2019t see the dress, I said, \u201cCome on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came into the room, I saw that he was holding a wrapped package.  Seeing the look on my face, he said, \u201cI got you a little something; as thanks for talking Kelly into asking me out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the package and unwrapping it, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re my little brother, Aaron; you didn\u2019t have to get me anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did; I wanted to show that I support you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point, I\u2019d finished unwrapping the package to find a diary.  Tearing up, I turned to Aaron and said, \u201cAaron...thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging me, Aaron said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen how much you\u2019ve been writing lately; so I thought you could use something to collect your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing myself, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll start using it right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, weakly, Aaron said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron turned to leave, having sensed something, I said, \u201cThis must be really difficult for you, Aaron; me becoming a girl.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m always here if you want to talk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I was so afraid after the accident; wondering if you were going to survive.\u201d Turning to me, tearing up, Aaron said, \u201cThen dad said they\u2019d be making you into a girl; I didn\u2019t know how to handle it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may be a girl now.  But,\u201d gesturing towards me head, I said, \u201cI\u2019m still a guy up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as I said that, I thought back to how I\u2019d just purchased a rather feminine dress.  Looking at me, Aaron said, \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Pausing, Aaron said, \u201cAfter seeing you in the bikini, I was worried you were starting to think like a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron left a moment later; leaving me standing in the middle of my room.  Aaron\u2019s words echoed in my ears; making me wonder if I was starting to think like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by uneventfully; save for Sam calling to tell me that Eric had asked her out on a date.  I spent the afternoon indoors due to rain; which gave me time to watch some Netflix.  After a nice dinner with Aaron and Dad, I went to bed around 8:30.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d heard about that project; and I wasn\u2019t surprised when dad said Aaron could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling out of bed, I heard the front door close; meaning that Aaron had just left.  \u201cGuess that means it\u2019s just me and dad; wonder what he\u2019s got planned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the phone rang and I heard Dad answer it.  Focusing on getting dressed, I didn\u2019t pay attention to the conversation.  A few minutes later, there was knock on my door.  \u201cAlly, honey...are you dressed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah; come on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad opened the door; looking concerned.  \u201cI hate to do this, Ally; but I just got called into work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, dad.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m a big girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still weird hearing that from you.\u201d Looking at me, dad said, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy or girl, I\u2019m not a kid anymore.\u201d Patiently, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, sweetie.\u201d Kissing my forehead, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dad left; I went to the bathroom before returning to my room.  As I closed the door, I found myself looking at the closet.  My mom\u2019s words echoed in my head; as I eyed the dress hanging in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m home alone for the day; who\u2019s going to see me?\u201d a smile forming, I said, \u201cMaybe now\u2019s the right time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to feel both excited and uncertain as I grabbed the dress from the hook.  This was a new experience for me; and I wondered if I should wear pantyhose with it.  I decided against that; in the event that I had to get undressed quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing I wouldn\u2019t get another opportunity like this for a while, I placed the dress on my bed before getting undressed.  Taking a deep breath, I picked up the dress and slipped into it.  Once I was all set; with the dress zipped up. I looked at the mirror.  \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect fit; it seems to hug every curve.\u201d Smiling, as I pulled my hair back, I said, \u201cI like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that I spotted Kelly\u2019s travel makeup kit on my vanity; realizing that I\u2019d gone this far, I decided to go to the next step.  <br>\r\nBelieving that I had the entire day, I took my time as I made certain to do a good job with the makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the mirror, seeing my handiwork, I had to admit it wasn\u2019t bad for my first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into a pair of three inch heels that I\u2019d gotten with the dress, I realized I had to see the complete look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the hang of walking in heels, with butterflies in my stomach, I slowly walked down the hall to dad\u2019s bedroom.  Going <br>\r\nup to a mirror that my mom had used, I was astonished by what I saw.  I rose a hand to my mouth in shock; smiling at my reflection.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe that\u2019s me; Kelly and Sam would faint in they saw me right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so caught up in my reflection; that I failed to hear the front door close, with dad\u2019s footstep coming up the stairs.  Had I been paying attention, I would\u2019ve noticed his shocked look in the mirror before he docked around the corner.<br>\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>I can get used to this; at least every now and then.</i></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of dad\u2019s bedroom, I bumped into dad in the hallway.  \u201cDad!\u201d shocked, I said, \u201cI-I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be home so soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was blushing so brightly, feeling as if I\u2019d been caught with my hand in the cookie jar.  I was tempted to run to my room, tears streaming down my cheeks, when Dad lightly touched my shoulder and said, \u201cYou look so much like your mother, sweetheart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d shocked, I said, \u201cYo-You\u2019re not upset?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I be upset; you\u2019re a girl now.\u201d Looking at me, softly, Dad said, \u201cIt\u2019s only natural for you to wear a dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Dad.\u201d Wiping tears, I said, \u201cI-I\u2019m going to get changed now; before Aaron comes home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you do that; let me grab the camera and snap some photos.\u201d Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cI want to remember this moment.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As we walked to Chemistry class, I told them how I'd asked Patrick to the dance.

Stopping outside of her closed door, Sam turned to me and said, \u201cI apologize about the mess; I haven\u2019t had much chance to clean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, I said, \u201cYou forget I used to be a boy, Sam; I\u2019m used to messy rooms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, Sam opened the door and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been warned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside Sam\u2019s room, at first I thought I\u2019d stepped into my room; there were clothes on the floor and sticking out of her dresser drawers.  That wasn\u2019t the biggest surprise; I noticed she had an Xbox 360 in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her, astonished, I said, \u201cI always pictured you as more of a neat and tidy person, Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, a girl can't be messy?\" Feigning offense, Sam said, \"You sound like my mom; always trying to get me clean my room and all that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continued like that for a few minutes; until we started working on the project.  While that happened, the conversation inevitably turned to what had happened the night before.  I was reading a book about the Battle of Midway; when Sam said, \u201cPenny for your thoughts, Ally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the book down, I said, \u201cI modeled the dress for my dad and brother last night; they thought it was nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so gloomy then?\u201d looking at me, Sam said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did like that; I guess I\u2019m becoming more like a girl in that sense.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m starting to appreciate when people say I look nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are you so upset?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceeded to explain how after I\u2019d changed out of the dress, I went downstairs to find dad and Aaron watching the baseball game.  \u201cBefore my accident, Dad would\u2019ve asked me to join him as well.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m starting to wonder if subconsciously they\u2019re starting to treat me like a girl; as if I wouldn\u2019t find baseball interesting anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see how that would upset you.\u201d Pausing, Sam said, \u201cHow about you talk to them about your feelings; reassure them that you still think like a guy even if you\u2019ve got the body of a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Sam.\u201d In the hope of changing the subject, I spotted a photo of Sam and Eric on her nightstand.  \u201cHow are things going with Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d blushing, Sam said, \u201cHe\u2019s a really sweet guy; I\u2019m glad I got a chance to know him better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a giggle, I said, \u201cAre you guys going to get serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Giggling, Sam said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s not a possibility.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sam had an amused look on her face when she saw that Kelly was giving me a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Sam said, \"What are you doing, Kelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've found that massages are a good way to reduce tension.\" Working on my shoulders and upper back, Kelly said, \"Given the tension she's been under, Ally could really use one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" With a grin on her face, Sam said, \"Try not to enjoy yourself too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, do you think Aaron would be jealous if he found out?\" giggling, I said, \"Maybe you give him a massage next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing brightly, Kelly said, \"O-Only if he asks first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Kelly.\" Joining in on the fun, Sam said, \"I'm sure he'd love a massage from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly didn't respond as she continued to massage my back; working her way down towards my waist.  I giggled several times when she inadvertently tickled me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, she stopped and said, \"Okay, you can put your bra back on.\" Sitting back, Kelly said, \"It's time for the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to what Sam had said when she came in, I started to wonder if perhaps Kelly was enjoying this.  I was about to say something when Sam's bedroom door opened, revealing her younger brother Carl.  \"Hey guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl stopped mid-sentence when he saw my bare back lying on the sleeping back.  Looking at Carl, Sam said, \"What do you want, Carl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww!!\" Turning to Sam, Carl said, \"Why didn't you tell me you were girl bonding!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey twerp, we're girl bonding!\" getting up, Sam said, \"Get what you need and get out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I at least get something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just raid the fridge like you always do.\" In a softer tone, Sam said, \"We've got a bit of a crisis here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking worried, Carl said, \"Anything I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's a girl thing.\" Pausing, Sam said, \"Thanks, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Carl left, I sat up and put my bra back on.  Looking at Sam, I said, \"You've got a nicer relationship with Carl than I do with Aaron, Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't always that close, Ally; it took a lot of work.\" Looking at me, Sam said, \"You have to be patient; you're rebuilding your relationship with Aaron from the ground up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sam got up and walked out of the room; going to grab a movie for us to watch.  Once she was gone, I lay down on my back to allow Kelly to continue the massage.  This was something I never expected to happen; getting a massage from an attractive girl...while being a girl myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massage continued for a little while until Kelly said, \"I think that's good enough; how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel much better, Kelly.\" Sitting up, I said, \"Thanks for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Ally.\" Pausing, Kelly said, \"That's what friends are for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, I realized just how much I valued Kelly as a friend; she was one of the first people outside my family to accept me for who I was.  Before I knew what was happening, I leaned forward and kissed her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly simply sat there for a moment before kissing me back.  We kissed for a few moments before I broke the kiss; happy to see that our special bond was still there.  Both Kelly and I started blushing as we looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath, I said, \"I won't tell Aaron if you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Nodding, Kelly said, \"Sounds like a plan to me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a rather enjoyable girls' night at Sam's house, I was in a much better mood.  It was nice to know that although things were different now, I could still count on my friends.  Walking into school the next morning, I saw Aaron talking with a few friends of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cautiously waved to me; hoping that I'd come over and talk.  I simply smiled and walked down the hall to my locker.  As I walked down the hall, I accidentally walked into a guy walking down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry.\" Pausing, I said, \"I should've been watching where I was going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" Blushing, the boy said, \"It was my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued walking down the hall; unaware that the boy was watching me as I walked off.  The rest of my day passed by uneventfully; except for the several times that I saw that guy again.  It was as if he was following me everywhere; starting to freak me out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school ended for the day, I grabbed some things from my locker and went to the door.  As I did, I saw the guy walking down the hallway again.  Determined to put a stop to this, I turned the corner and stopped.  I waited for the guy to appear; and when he did I pulled him into a nearby stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving him into the wall, I said, \"Why have you been following me around all day!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was-wasn't following you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you were; I saw you in the library, the hallway and the cafeteria.\" Looking at him, I said, \"Did you just want to get a good look at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, it's nothing like that.\" Blushing, the boy said, \"I-I was just wondering if you'd like to go on a date with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped back when he said that; not expecting that at all.  Confused, I ran a hand through my hair and said, \"You're doing this to mess with me, right?\" pausing, I said, \"I mean, you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being serious!\" blushing even more, the boy said, \"I-I think you're attractive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ego kicking in, I said, \"R-Really?\" pausing, I said, \"Why are you telling me this?  I used to be a guy; so what makes you think I'd date one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're a girl now, right?\" looking at me, he said, \"What difference does it make?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it, do you?\" looking at him, I said, \"I may look like a girl, but that doesn't mean I act like one.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just thought that since you used to be a guy; that things would be...easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I understand what you're getting at. But,\" getting frustrated, I said, \"Here's the thing,  I...Am...Not...Interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, the boy said, \"O-Okay, I-I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as the boy slowly picked up his things and walked out of the stairwell; with a disappointed look on his face.  As he left, I suddenly found myself feeling horrible about what I'd just done.  As a boy I never had much luck with girls; so I could understand where the kid was coming from.  Now that I was a girl, I was suddenly on the other side of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning against the wall, I said to myself, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>I can't believe I just did that.</i></span>\"</span></div></div>",

After walking inside, I said hi to Aaron before heading up to my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the room, I closed the door and sat down on my bed.  Grabbing my laptop from my bedside table, I turned it on and started my homework.  I worked on that for about an hour before deciding to take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the bed, I opened my bedroom door a crack to find that Aaron had his bedroom door closed with his music playing.  Closing the door again, I took of my shorts and sat back down on the bed wearing only my top, a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to see what Kelly was up to, I logged into Skype and called her.  She answered after a few seconds, her image appearing on my screen.  \"Hey Ally; what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much; I'm taking a break from doing homework and thought I'd call you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin on her face, Kelly said, \"I heard you had a little excitement after school today; some boy asked you out on a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, I said, \"How did you hear about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Ally.\" With a grin, Kelly said, \"You of all people know how quickly news travels in our school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I forget; the rumor mill never ends there.\" Sighing, I said, \"I couldn't believe it when he asked me out; I thought he might've been playing a trick on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would make you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious, Kelly?\" pausing, I said, \"I'm a girl who used to be a guy; why would anyone ask me out on a date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever stop to think that it's because you're attractive?\" smiling, Kelly said, \"I've seen how the stares you get at school; from boys and girls alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great; that's all I need.\" Sighing, I said, \"I'm having a hard enough time adjusting already; I don't want people flirting with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all bad, Ally.\" Giggling, Kelly said, \"Give it a chance after a while; you may like the attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, I don't know.\" Pausing, I said, \"I don't want to think about that right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what.\" Turning serious, Kelly said, \"Sam's going away this weekend for a family reunion; so how about the two of us have a sleepover at my place.  Think of it as a way to unwind after a hectic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea to me.\" Smiling, I said, \"I'll tell my dad that's what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" smiling, Kelly said, \"I got to go; I need to let my dog out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter logging off from Skype, I went back to doing my homework. </span></div></div>",

Aaron was the first one to speak.  \"Okay, like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you guys have been acting around me, for starters.\" Sitting down at the table, as dad served the dinner, I said, \"I get that you both got used to not having me around for 6 months; but is it too hard to ask that you include me in your activities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why that would upset you, sweetheart.

Kelly and Sam could tell I was depressed during lunch; they tried cheering me up after I explained why I wasn't in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school finally got out, I said goodbye to Kelly and Sam before quietly grabbing my things.  As I walked through the parking lot to my car, I was surprised when Dad pulled up next to me.  Looking inside the car, I saw Aaron sitting in the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little curious, I walked to the front of the car as Dad rolled the window down.  \"Get in, Ally; I'm taking you both someplace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I have plans with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't a request, young lady!\" getting serious, Dad said, \"Get in the car; or I'll drag you in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly feeling frightened, I quickly got in the front seat as dad drove off.  \"Where are we going, dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before we arrived at the cemetery where Mom was buried.  \"What are we doing here, dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dad led Aaron and me to mom's grave, he said, \"For the same reason I come here every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at mom's tombstone, I said, \"You come here every day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was my wife, Allison; I loved her more than anything.\" Turning to me and Aaron, he said, \"I love you two with all my heart; and nothing will ever change that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back, I said, \"Dad, you're scaring me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised your mother I'd always be here for both of you; and I have worked very hard to keep that promise.\" Pausing, Dad said, \"Aaron and I will work harder to involve you in our lives; but you have to meet us halfway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I said, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know who your friends are anymore; you hardly talk about them or what you do in your free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I thought what I did with Kelly and Sam would bore you, dad...\" pausing, I realized what Dad was getting at. With a sigh, I said, \"Okay, I get your point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Dad said, \"You can spend time with your friends, Ally; but I hope you remember we're here as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure to spend more time with you too.\" Pausing, I said, \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good; that's all I wanted to hear.\" Turning to Aaron, Dad said, \"Is there anything you want to add, Aaron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there is.\" Turning to me, Aaron said, \"I hope you realize that I still love you, Ally; even if it seems like I've ignored you since you came out of the coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I know that, Aaron!\" pulling Aaron into a hug, I said, \"I love you too; you're my little brother and that will never change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stayed at the cemetery for a while longer before we left.

Once she'd walked off the porch, Amanda came over and said next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, Ally.\" Looking at me, Amanda said, \"Those doctors did a really good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, I turned to Amanda and said, \"A good job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they did a good job.\" Gesturing to my chest, Amanda said, \"Your breasts are almost like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by that remark, getting annoyed, I said, \"Thanks, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be getting a lot of attention from the boys at school.\" Looking at me, Amanda said, \"A girl with your figure is something boy's pay attention to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to the moment when that guy had asked me out, I said, \"I've had a few guys flirt with me; but I wasn't interested.\" Sighing, I said, \"To be honest, I'm don't really like the way they've been treating me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever thought about going on a date with one of them?\" pausing, Amanda said, \"That way you could see what it's like before you decide you're not into guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even for a second.\" Turning to Amanda, I said, \"I may have a girl's body; but I still think like a guy.  I'm not going to go on a date with a guy; because I don't go that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, realizing that she was getting on my nerves, Amanda said, \"I didn't mean to get you upset, Ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Amanda.\" Sighing, I got up and walked over to the porch railing. Taking a deep breath, I turned to her and said, \"I'm still learning to deal with everything that's happened; I mean it's not every day that you wake up to find you've been given a sex change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up to walk over to me, Amanda said, \"I can understand why you feel that way; having your gender changed would cause anyone to have doubts about who they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, especially since I didn't ask to be turned into a girl.\" Leaning against the railing, I said, \"I guess I can't fault my dad for doing what he thought was best; but it would've been nice to have a say in the decision.  After all, he's not the one who has to adjust to a new gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa walked back onto the patio at that moment; with some drinks in her hands.  Handing a glass to me, Melissa said, \"I heard you guys talking from the kitchen; what were you guys talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing how Melissa felt about Amanda's inability to think before speaking, I decided not to go into detail.  Taking a sip of my drink, a Sprite, I said, \"We were just talking about how I was coping; and if anything interesting has happened at school since I got back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s good to hear.\" Chuckling, Melissa said, \"I'd hate for you two not to get along; considering you'll both be bridesmaids at my wedding.\"</span></div></div>",

Walking into the main room, I recognized a few of them from when I was younger; they were Melissa's best friends.  After they'd greeted Melissa and Amanda, much to my dismay, they turned their attention to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one, a Hispanic girl named Grace, came over and gave me a hug.  Looking at me, Grace said, \"I can't believe that's really you, Brian.\"<br>\r\nUnable to keep myself from blushing, I said, \"Its Allison now, Grace; but you guys can call me Ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...Ally.\" with a smile, Grace said, \"Why don't you join us for a little chat?  We'd all love to hear how you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again I spent the next 20 minutes or so telling Grace and the others about what I'd gone through since waking up.  They were all sympathetic towards my ordeal; even though none of them had any clue what I was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just finished talking when there was a knock at the door.  I watched as Melissa walked over and opened the door to reveal...\"Rachel!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, a smile on her face, Rachel said, \"Hi Ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to Rachel, I hugged her and said, \"Wh-What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a fellow bridesmaid.\" Hugging me back, Rachel said, \"Melissa and I were roommates in college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Rachel and me, Melissa said, \"How do you two know each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Rachel, I said, \"She was my nurse when I came out of the coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Melissa turned to Rachel and said, \"Why didn't you tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was I supposed to know you two were cousins?\" with a grin, Rachel said, \"You never really talked about your extended family very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking for a while, we all gathered on the patio to discuss the plans for the wedding.  I was a little confused by what was going on; so I ended up sitting in the corner as the others talked about designs for the bridesmaid dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI occasionally glanced over at the ones they were looking at; seeing how feminine they were made me wonder if being a bridesmaid was a good idea.  I was looking over one of the catalogs when Amanda turned to me and said, \"Which one do you like, Ally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the catalog Amanda was giving me, I looked through for a few minutes before stopping on one that I liked.  It wasn't as feminine as the others in the catalog; but I'd rather wear this one (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wellbridal.com/2013-bridesmaid-dresses/2013-bridesmaid-dress-017.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wellbridal.com/2013-bridesmai...</a>) instead of something pink and frilly. Turning to Amanda, I said, \"I...like this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the dress, with a chuckle, Amanda said, \"For someone who used to be a guy; you've got a great sense of fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I guess.\" Blushing, I said, \"I guess my girl friends are having an effect on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter deciding on the bridesmaid dresses, we ordered pizza and watched movies for a while.  I appreciated the fact that the girls included a couple action movies for me to choose from.  The evening eventually died down around 9:30; and I said goodbye before going home.  After all; tomorrow was a school day.</span></div></div>",

I still don't understand why she hates me; but I doubt I'll find out anytime soon.  Once school ended for the day, I met up with Kelly and Sam outside.  As I walked over to them, Kelly said, \"You ready for our girl's weekend, Ally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am.\" Chuckling, I said, \"I could really the time to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so jealous of you two; getting a chance to do nothing but relax and hang out by the pool all weekend.\" Sighing, Sam said, \"Meanwhile, I'll be dealing with old relatives who can't stop saying how big I've gotten since they saw me last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Sam, I said, \"I'm sure you'll have a great time, Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know.\" Chuckling, as she gave Kelly and me hugs, Sam said, \"I'm just messing with you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Sam, Kelly and I walked through the parking lot to my car.  As we got in, she said, \"Do you have everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I packed last night.\" Gesturing to an overnight bag in the backseat, I said, \"I've got everything I'll need for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" smiling, Kelly said, \"Let's get this weekend started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to Kelly's house a few minutes later; just as Kelly's parents were packing their things into the car for their weekend away.  Looking at us as we got out of the car, Kelly's mom said, \"Hello girls, how was school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, I said, \"It was okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's mom had been best friends with my mom throughout their childhood; they'd known each other since they were in kindergarten.  In fact I spent so much time with them growing up, I thought of Kelly's parents as my second family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying hello to Kelly's dad, I followed Kelly upstairs to her room where I placed my bag on the floor.  Turning to me, Kelly said, \"Now let's get changed so we can go to the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kelly, shocked, I said, \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Ally; did you think we weren't going to spend time in the pool this weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know, Kelly.\" Pausing, I said, \"I'm still not too keen on wearing a bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, since when?\" looking at me, Kelly said, \"I seemed to recall you actually enjoyed wearing them after you got used to it the last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that's different.\" Getting nervous, I said, \"I-I was with friends that I trusted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that any different then right now?\" looking at me, Kelly said, \"Unless I'm mistaken, I'm pretty sure we're friends and that you trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i-it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're grasping at straws and you know it, Ally.\" Handing me a bikini, she said, \"We'll try some on until you find one you're comfortable with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the bikini, I said \"Okay, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next 20 minutes or so trying on various bikinis; while Kelly patiently waited for me to choose.  \"Are you almost done, Ally; I'd like to get into the pool while we're still young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you girls wear these things?\" wincing, I turned to Kelly said, \"I feel naked in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin on her face, Kelly said, \"You seemed to like seeing girls wearing them when you were a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's because I didn't think I'd ever have to wear one myself.\" With a pleading look on my face, I said, \"Can I please wear a one-piece?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kelly's mom entered the room.  \"Still feeling shy about wearing a bikini, Allison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like I'm not wearing anything at all.\" Blushing, I said, \"It's...not something I'm entirely ready for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've come a long way since you woke up from the accident, sweetie; but there's still plenty of time for you to adjust to everything that comes with being a woman.\" With a smile on her face, she said, \"I know your mother would be proud of the brave young woman you've become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I said, \"Yeah, well I'd rather be a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately that's not possible, Allison.\" Pausing, she said, \"I can tell you that being a girl isn't that bad; besides you've turned out to be a very attractive girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI failed to notice Kelly blushing at that comment; as I blushed as well.  \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a thought; why not wear a t-shirt over the bikini top.\" Pausing, Kelly's mom said, \"That way if you decide you're ready; you can just take it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving it some thought, I decided it would be best if I sucked it up.  Looking at Kelly and her mom, I said, \"I think I'll just go with the bikini; just to get it over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice, Allison.\" Pausing, Kelly's mom said, \"If you don't mind, I'd like to speak with Kelly in private for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Turning to Kelly, I said, \"I'll be out by the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked downstairs just as Kelly's dad walked into the house.  Looking at me, he said, \"You look lovely, Allison; I find it hard to believe you used to be the young boy who'd chase Kelly around the backyard with a hose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've changed a lot, haven't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you have.\" Pausing, Kelly's father said, \"But simply look at this as another adventure in life; I know you'll do fine.\"</span></div></div>",

With a sigh, she looked at me and said, \"So what's with you lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, I looked at her and said, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day you're fine with being a girl; even wearing a bikini.\" In a serious tone, she said, \"Then the next you back to hating everything about being a girl; avoiding anything remotely feminine as if it were a disease.  So I'll ask again; what's with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, okay.\" Getting frustrated, I said, \"There are days that I feel okay with everything; but then I have days that I miss being a boy and wish this was all just a bad dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not at all healthy, Ally; you can't live your life in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a reassuring hand on mine, Kelly said, \"Going from boy to girl is a major adjustment; but you've got friends who are willing to help you if you let them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of me died when I woke up a girl, Kelly!\" tearing up, I said, \"What's worse is I've been treated like a girl from the start; I'm having trouble gaining some normalcy even with my own family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, Ally; I'm sorry that you've had to struggle to find yourself again but it could've been much worse.\" Patiently, Kelly said, \"Anyone else in your shoes would've ended up completely crippled or dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do!?\" crying, I said, \"This is very hard for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll drive yourself insane if you keep holding on to the life you had before all this; you have to take a deep look at yourself and decide what you want to do with the rest of your life.\" Pausing, Kelly said, \"There's an old saying that goes, 'If you have it, use.'  You've got good looks, intelligence and charm...I suggest using them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking to myself for a few moments, completely oblivious to the fact that Kelly just said I was good looking, I turned to Kelly and said, \"I-I guess you're right; I have been living in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\" Smiling, Kelly said, \"I'm not saying you should completely forget about your old life; simply find a way to combine that with the life you have as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, I said, \"Thanks, Kelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Ally; that's what friends are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly never finished her sentence; as I surprised her by tipping her into the water.  I had a mischievous grin on my face as she came to the surface. \"I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunging for me, with a grin on her face, Kelly said, \"You're in trouble now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly and I spent the next 15 minutes or so having fun and laughing in the pool; only stopping when I swallowed some water and started coughing.</span></div></div>",

We only went inside when we heard the distant rumble of thunder.  While Kelly used her bathroom, I made use of the main bathroom to wash up and get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was inside the bathroom, I closed the door and walked over to the mirror.  As I looked in the mirror, I thought back to what Kelly had said about me having good looks.  I'd been so caught up in trying to continue living the life I had prior to the accident that I hadn't realized that I was indeed an attractive girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weird as it was to admit, I guess that I explained why so many guys at school were hitting on me; although until now I thought they were just trying to annoy me.  After looking at myself in the mirror for a few minutes, I finally got around to getting undressed and stepping into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next 15 minutes or so in the shower; careful to get all the chlorine out of my hair.  It dawned on me as I rinsed my hair that I was starting to become obsessed with my hair like a normal girl; making sure there were no split ends or that it wasn't a tangled mess before leaving the house.  While I didn't spend a whole lot of time making sure my hair was in the latest style, I still wanted my hair to look nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was reasonably sure I was all rinsed off, I got out of the shower and dried off.  After that was finished, I hung my bathing suit in the shower to dry off while I got dressed.  It wasn't long before I was finally dried off and fully clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bathroom, I went downstairs to find that Kelly was already downstairs watching TV.  Looking at me, with a grin on her face, Kelly said, \"For someone who used to be a boy; I can't believe you took a longer shower then me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were in there for almost 25 minutes, Ally.\" Chuckling, Kelly said, \"I've been a girl my entirely life and I've never taken that long of a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I've got to be careful with my body.\" Sitting down, Ally said, \"The doctor's tell me that my skin is going to be sensitive to certain chemicals, like chlorine, for a while and that I should be careful to ensure that I've gotten it all off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" With a chuckle, Kelly said, \"Here I thought being a real girl was tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea, Kel.\" Sighing, I said, \"So what do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to me, Kelly said, \"I thought we'd watch some movies before ordering take out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Feeling a little hesitant, I said, \"What kind of movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel about watching all of the Final Destination movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" With a smile, I said, \"I'll get the popcorn.\"</span></div></div>",

We were sitting on the couch; wrapped in a blanket and eating popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was reaching for a handful of popcorn when one of the main characters fell and was killed by a nail gun. Kelly started screaming and grabbed a hold of me; causing me to scream in surprise as I dropped my popcorn. Still screaming our heads off, the two of us grabbed hold of each other and didn't let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took us a moment to calm down; although I felt like I was having a heart attack. Even as we calmed down, neither of us let go of the other. I looked at Kelly with a confused look on my face; mainly because I was starting to feel...weird in her embrace. Before I knew what was happening, Kelly leaned forward and kissed me on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my momentary shock, I should found myself reciprocating. Kelly and I kissed for what seemed like an eternity; during which time came to a surprising realization. While I greatly enjoyed the times Kelly and I kissed in the past; I couldn't help but think that this time there was more passion to it, almost like this was more than 2 girls experimenting with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we kissed, I started to become aroused; my breasts hardened, my heart beat faster and I started to feel wet in my vaginal area.  Despite all of this, I still continued to make out with Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe kept going for what seemed like an eternity; when I suddenly felt Kelly's hands on my back, working their way up to my bra.  Realizing what was going on, I broke the kiss just as Kelly undid my bra.  Bringing my hands up to my breasts to keep them from moving around uncomfortably, I looked at Kelly in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to find my voice, I simply got up and walked out of the room.  I made my way to the bathroom and walked inside; making sure the door was locked so no one could come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the mirror, I did my best to calm down as I took off my shirt.  Placing it on the counter, I rearranged my breasts in the bra before hooking it shot again.  Once that was done, I stared at my topless reflection in the mirror; wondering what had gotten into Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes before I was calm enough to leave the bathroom; putting my top back on as I opened the bathroom door.  Walking back into the room, I saw Kelly sitting in the same position I'd left her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, she started to say, \"I'm so sorry Ally, I-I guess I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Kelly; I'm not angry.\" Sitting down, I said, \"Let's just get back to the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course; w-we should finish the movie.\" Blushing, Kelly said, \"I-I mean that's why we're here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but feel like Kelly was hiding something from me; as if I'd hurt her feelings by breaking the kiss. Pushing those thoughts aside, the two of us returned to watching the movie.</span></div></div>",

Waking up the next morning, I was confused by my surroundings when I suddenly realized I was lying on the pull-out couch in Kelly's family room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to get up, I was surprised to feel something wrapped around me.  Turning around, I saw Kelly was sleeping with her arms around my waist; holding me as if we were cuddling.  Not wanting to wake her up, I slowly pried her arms off of my waist and climbed off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked upstairs to take a shower, I found myself thinking about how strangely Kelly had been acting over the last day or so.  During gym on Friday she'd insisted that I be her partner when our teacher had us doing trust falls; something I didn't mind until she kept trying to feel me up whenever she caught me.  Then there was last night as we were making out; in all the other times we'd done that, she'd never tried to undo my bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the bathroom, I couldn't help but get the idea that perhaps Kelly was attracted to me in some way.  I just had to figure out if she was attracted to me because I'm a girl now; or if it's because I used to be a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got undressed, I decided it would be a good idea for me to talk with her about all of this.  \"I don't want to jump to the wrong conclusion; that might jeopardize our friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got out of the shower about 20 minutes later; quietly drying off and walking across to Kelly's room to get dressed.  I'd just put a pair of shorts on and was about to put on a shirt when Kelly walked into the room wearing nothing but a towel.  Judging by her damp hair, I figured she'd used her parent's bathroom to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, quietly, Kelly said, \"Morning, Ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on my face, I said, \"Morning Kelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, want to apologize for what happened last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to apologize, Kelly.\" Putting on the shirt, I said, \"It was just 2 girls making out while watching a movie; it's not like there were any feelings behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right.\" Pausing, Kelly said, \"I guess it was just 2 girls making out; nothing more.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour later, I began to notice Kelly acting rather strangely around me.  It got to the point where I started to get a little self-conscious; wondering if there was a hole in my clothes or something in my teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it was time to get to the bottom of things, I confronted her in the kitchen.  \"What's gotten into you the last few days<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly turned to me as she put the dirty dishes from breakfast into the dishwasher.  \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you were feeling me up every time we did those trust falls in gym; then you tried to unhook my bra last night.\"  Getting serious, I said, \"Is there something you're not telling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked as if she was going to say something else for a moment; until she put the last dish in the machine.  Turning to me, taking a deep breath, Kelly said, \"I-I like you, Ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you too, Kel; we're best friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's more than that.\" Sighing, Kelly said, \"I'm finding myself physically attracted to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to let on that my hunch had been right; so I simply said, \"For how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It started after the first time we made out.\" Pausing, Kelly said, \"I thought I was going crazy; wondering if I was attracted to you as a girl or if my lingering attraction to the boy you used to be was seeping through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were friends, Kel.\"  Shocked, I said, \"Why didn't you tell me about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are friends, Ally; which is why I wasn't sure I wanted to tell you.\"  Blushing, Kelly said, \"I've seen the looks you get from the boys at school; I was afraid that if I admitted I liked you that you'd say you were into boys now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, you don't have to worry about that.\" blushing myself, I said, \"I mean I like the fact that they're attracted to me instead of thinking I'm some freak; but I'm not going to suddenly be attracted to boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look of relief on her face, Kelly said, \"So, uh, what should we do about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping closer, I placed my arms around Kelly's shoulders and pulled her closer.  With a smile, I said, \"I have an idea about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kelly could say anything; I leaned in and kissed her on the lips.  It wasn't long before we were making out; not caring that the neighbors could see us through the kitchen window.  As I kissed Kelly, it dawned on me that I had to become a girl in order to get a girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

The other worry of course was the inherent danger of being a teenage woman on her own. I looked around again, but found no evidence of a note or explanation for their departure. They always told me were they were doing if it involved leaving the house. I picked up my cell phone which now had a soft pink cover over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sneered at the ugly, effiminate cover that kelly talked me into putting on after I pleaded her not to do it because she knows I cant resist her puppy dog eyes. I hoped it had nothing to do with my kiss with Kelly. I took a breathe and I dialed Aaron. \"Come on, little bro!\" I whisper. The dialing tone quickly gave way to message. I hung up angry that he wouldn't pick up. Why was he so inconsiderate? I dialed Dad's number. hoping to get an answer. \"Hi Ally!\" \"Dad! Where are you and Aaron?\" \"No need to worry, Ally! We are at Mel's fiancees bachelors party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n and explained that they were having it six months early because this was the only way to get a discount amd said that they didnt tell me becauae they thought I would feel left out again. fter thati deided that if their going to leave me out and not even tell me about it then im going to do the same and throw a party while their gone. I oulled out my pink phone again and got patrick eric and kelly since sam wasnt there there was no point in calling her so I told the reat to invite as many people as physically possible. The idea was genius because who better at throwing a party than me I know what boys like and what girks like because ive lived both lives. I took out tostitos chips, salsa dip, nacho cheese, and rootbeer for the boys and salad, corn nuts, gummys, and dr.pepper for the girls and finale something everyone will like pizza, hamburgers,  and corndogs. When patrick, eric, and kelly finale got here they said that I looked amazing probably because I was wearing the dress, jacket, and high heels i bought from jc pennys I had my hair curled from moms old curler and I had on a lught touch of makeup. I have never wore this much girl before. When they stepped in I could swear I caught eric and patrick staring at me, but I brushed off that thought and simply said thanks to their earlier complement. Patrick said that \"the rest of the guest are on their way\"then kelly said \"even ambers on her way\". We waited and chated for a while; when the guest finale showed up we were talking about me and patrick going to prom together and we all shared a few laughs about it wxcept for patrick. The guest were about done showing up about an hour later and I must say it was one hell of a turn out because the entire school was here and a few kids from other schools that kelly invited I didnt expect what happened next.</span></div></div>",

The nurse who I now recognize as the one from when I woke up said \"We didn't know about it, sir. We can assure you that we will make sure that that doctor award you compensation fee for his actions.\" Aaron retorted \"What he did was illegal! He had no right, to place a uterus inside her during the surgery without our fathers permission!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse took a deep breath before explaining \"Technically he did have your fathers permission to make him into a girl! And girls do have a uterus. While I don't see the problem in Ally having one, I can see your frustration. The only thing she will experience is a period, which seemed dangerous and painful purely for the reason that it was her first. She will be far better prepared for the next one. I suggest you go on out and buy her either some pads or tampons whichever she feels is best for her\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their discussion, each of them turned in my direction. Aaron looked uncomfortably when he realised that I had been awake for the whole discussion. Aaron took a breath before exclaiming \"Hey Ally, which do you want tampons or pads?\" His face was flushed but even he could tell that I was even more embarrassed. The thought of wearing one was unappealing, but I knew I had to respond. \"Umm pads\" The nurse just giggled so I turned to her and gave her the drop dead look in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recalled then that she said something about compensation fee. I waited until Aaron left before enquiring as to the amount. She responded the hospital would pay me $____to keep my mouth shut.</span></div></div>",

The juices continued to flow into my mouth, as I enjoyed every second of it, as did she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to unclasp her bra, when I held myself back. I'm going a little too fast, let's just savour the moment a little more. Ah, screw it. The bra was thrown across the room and I immersed myself in the mountains hidden within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several hours, we continued rolling back and forth, giggling in excitement as we delved deeper and deeper. We eventually got up after the exhausting ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for the stupid meds. I pulled out a syringe out of my purge, awkwardly manoeuvred it over a vein, and injected it into the blood vessel. I'll never get used to that sting. I'm always worrying about injecting it into the wrong place, but it's gone well so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Female hormones to keep up this appearance, although I'd rather just go back to normal,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they made you a full girl,\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. They offered to, but I'd like to avoid dealing with periods or potential pregnancy,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... True, good point. Do you really want to stick a needle into your arm for your entire life though?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that. If they implant the organs, there's no telling when my body will start rejecting them. At that point, I would have to inject myself with immunosuppressants anyway. Heck, I'm running that risk with the vagina, but it's not like anyone cared at the time. More organs would make it even likelier,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that does make a lot of sense. Be careful with those drugs though, you should know what happens if air gets into the syringe or it gets contaminated in another way,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Note: Sorry for those expecting a more saucy scene.

After you guys went on your date, he was totally different, you know. He's happier around you especially when you want to be with him. I don't want to be the reason his heart is broken all because you want to be with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying Ally?\" Kelly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying that as much as I want to be with you, I can't because I can't do that to my brother. He wants you to be his girlfriend and I won't be able to live with myself if I prevent him from being with the third girl he's had feelings for\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third? Who were the first two?\" Kelly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our mother was first, then me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" Kelly said, obviously disappointed from me letting her know that I can't be with her. \"You know, before your accident, I had a secret crush on both you and your brother. It's just now that I'm getting to know you again, I'm more confused than ever. So what now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I guess we put our feelings for each other behind us and get on with our weekend\" I said. \"There's no reason we can't be friends still and hang out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right\" Kelly said. \"So you wanna go play a game or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" I answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about an hour or so we played old board games, that was until my cell phone went off. Looking at who it was I saw it was Aaron. He told me how dad was called into work and all of his friends were doing things and was wondering if he could come over. I asked Kelly and she said it shouldn't be a problem. He said he would ride his bike over and be here in no more than an hour and a half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he arrived, I looked at Kelly and said \"remember what I said Kelly, and don't tell him anything. I don't want him thinking that if you don't work out that it's because of me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Ally\" she said. \"Maybe you could give me some ideas for dates, or help me get inside his head and figure him out. Maybe you can be my spy\" she said with a funny grin on her face, just as the doorbell wrung. She let Aaron in and he joins us with our board game. After a few games, we decided to go for a swim. Kelly and I went to her bedroom, where she gave me the bikini I had used yesterday, and she had grabbed a pair of her older brothers trunks he had left here when she said \"Let's see if we can get Aaron to wear a bikini\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" I asked, a tad bit confused by what she had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's tell Aaron that the only swimsuit that will fit him is one of my bikinis. We don't have to make him really, just tell him is see his reaction. I bet it will be priceless.\" She explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking to myself about how Aaron and I would always pull pranks on each other when we were kids and how as we grew up we slowly stopped, I said \"Sure, why not\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that we found Kelly's most feminine bikini we could find in her closet, ultimately choosing this one ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.kohls.com/kohlsopenapi/productmobile.html?productID=c38042\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.kohls.com/kohlsopenapi/productm...</a> ) and brought it to Aaron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Aaron\" Kelly started, \"we couldn't find a swimsuit for you so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your gonna have to wear one of Kelly's\" I said finishing her sentence as Kelly took the bikini out from behind her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\" Aaron said, taking a step back. \"There's no way I'm gonna wear that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want to swim you don't have a choice\" Kelly said. \"How's it going to look to my parents if my new boyfriend is walking around their house with no underwear on because he swam in them and they are on the deck drying\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care wha..\" he started. \"Did you say boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, is there a problem with that\" Kelly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, well\" he said looking at the bikini Kelly was holding. \"If it's my only option I guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it's not your only option\" I said tossing him the pair of Kelly's brothers swim trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny\" Aaron said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Kelly said. \"It was hilarious. Maybe not for you, but for us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Aaron went to the bathroom to change, and Kelly and I went out to her pool and started swimming. \"So\" Kelly asked, \"have you thought about joining any school teams at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've got a much more, athletic, body than before the accident. So I'll ask again. Ally, have you thought about joining any school teams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I think about doing that\" I asked in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look at it this way\" Kelly started. \"When you were a guy, you liked to check out girls right?\" I nodded my head up and down. \"Didn't it ever occur to you that most girls, at least the ones with good looking figures, do something to keep in shape. I mean, Sam and I play softball every spring so we have a reason to stay in shape\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear what your saying. But maybe I'll join you guys with softball come spring time\" I said, but stopped as Aaron walked outside. \"Maybe if I'm on the team Aaron will have no excuse to not go to the games\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" he said as he heard his name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison here is gonna join the softball team next Spring and your gonna be expected at every game\" Kelly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You serious Ally\" he said as he sat in and inflatable chair in the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yea\" I said, paddling over to him. \"I gotta keep this figure and it's months away so...\" I flipped him out of his chair so had I kept speaking he woulda never heard what I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for\" he shouted as he broke the surface of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted me to include you in what I was doing. This is me including you in my activities\" I said with a smile on my face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe swam for about a hour and a half before we headed inside and dried off. I went to shower and get all the chlorine washed off. Walking downstairs, I saw Aaron and Kelly watching some comedy movie, and there was very little space between them. I was about to go join them when my phone went off. Looking at the caller ID I recognized my dad's phone number and answered the call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison, listen I've got a problem\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you to dad. What's up?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" he started, \"I'm leaving the office and walk back to my car when I find out that three of my car tires have gone flat and someone crashed into the back of the car. It's gonna be in the shop for a few weeks and I need you to come get me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't they just give you a rental or something\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all out but can get me one by Monday morning at the latest. But for now I need you to come get me and drive me home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at the auto shop on Jefferson and 83rd street\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's like two blocks from school right\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I should be there in less than 20 minutes\" I told him before hitting end on my phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I told Kelly and Aaron where I was going and when I should be back, and left. </span></div></div>",

Before that topic got to far we arrived home and I said goodbye to him and drove back to Kelly's. Aaron was getting ready to head home when I got there, and being late Sunday afternoon, Kelly and I didn't really do much for the rest of the day. We did however, discuss what we should do about homecoming dresses, which surprised Kelly a tad bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting tired, we went to bed around nine o'clock because it was a school night after all. But while lying in my sleeping bag on the floor of Kelly's room I came to a serious realization. I had gym class third hour and I didn't have clean gym clothes. \"Hey Kel\" I said in the darkness of her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" She asked in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just realizing that I didn't pack any clean gym clothes for class Monday\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the reading light next to her bed she said \"no problem. Just use some of my stuff\" getting out of bed and walking to her closet she pulled some clothes out and said \"here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up to look at them, she handed me a pair of purple running tights that went down to just above my ankles, a black under armor shirt, and a black sports bra. \"Need anything else\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" I started. \"I did leave my running shoes at home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" she said and picked up a pair of black and white Nike's. \"These should fit fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" I sad. And with that I fell asleep until Kelly's alarm went off Monday morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday itself went by rather uneventfully. During gym class we played tennis outside and I ended up taking my shirt off. I felt weird at first, but I eventually got over it because it lead to me winning a few matches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days real excitement came after school. I was scheduled to go to the hospital for a check-up so they could make sure everything was fine. I got a feeling however that everything wasn't fine when after they ran all the tests they said they were going to run the doctors didn't come back into the examination room for almost half an hour. Dad was getting frustrated and was about to go see what was takeing so long when two doctors entered the room, a man and a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison\" the man said. \"I'm Dr. John Clark\". Gesturing to the female doctor, he said \"This is my associate Dr. Autumn White. I'm afraid we have some bad news\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Dr. White started. \"It seems that the hormone shots you were given to turn you into a girl were stronger than we initially anticipated\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean\" dad asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Dr. White started, \"it would seem that they are turning you into a 100% 16 year old girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't they suppost to do that?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Dr. Clark said. \"They are only suppose to make you look like a girl. It would seem that the hormones have started to create a female reproductive system inside of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, I practically screamed \"can you stop it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on our tests there is nothing we can do that wouldn't require surgery\" Dr. White said. \"And even then, it would just happen again. We would like to have you stay here as a precaution, but mostly so we can make sure that it is fully finished without causing you to much pain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will the process be completed\" dad asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We figure two days at the latest, but as soon as tomorrow afternoon\" Dr. Clark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will there be any side affects?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Dr. White said \"You'll get the monthly visitor all girls get. The hospital will be sending a nurse to help you get thought your first few periods. There may also be some mental effects though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what\" I asked, getting scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple put, you'll start thinking like a girl. You may be more prone to showing off your body or start liking attention you get from boys and even possibly start liking boys yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll check you into a room like the one you woke up in and have sedatives ready if the changes are painful\" Dr. Clark said. \"Once the changes are completed we'll make sure your 100% healthy and you can go home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that they brought me to a room almost exactly the same as the one I was in after weakening up from my coma. Nothing really happened while I was there during the day. I was aloud to leave my room and talk with other people in the recovery rooms. I mostly talked to older people who's family was either to busy or lived to far away to visit them. However, there was one person my own age there. Her name was Amy, and she was in the hospital because she broke her leg playing softball and then it didn't heal right. She went to a school a few miles outta town, basically a rival school. We talked a little about our schools, but we mostly talked about sports. She was all around a nice person and we talked until I had to go to my own room for bed. Just before I left Amy said \"It was nice to meet you Allison, your the first person outside of my family I've talked to in weeks\". That made me feel good inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't sleep easy that night. And my dream was really weird. Most nights when I'd have a dream it was like something that happened during the day or something that was on my mind. But tonight, I was shopping with Sam and Kelly for homecoming dresses and I was all in. Like, I was looking at buying a really girly dress and high heels and all that stuff. When I finally woke up the sun was shinning through the window and there was a nurse in my room holding a clipboard. \"Good morning sleepy head\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha\" I said in a very groggy tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I come with good and bad news\" she said, \"What do you want first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this\" I said, \"give me the bad news first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems your change happened even faster than we predicted at first. As of last night you became 100% girl, both inside and out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the bad news\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be able to leave after a few exams today to be sure your in good health. I predict around 2:30ish\" she said, setting the clipboard down on a small table in the room. \"Doctors Clark and White will be here soon to administer the tests and while we are waiting for the results we will be letting your father know he can come pick you up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't he have to be here before you can do the tests\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, yes. But he gave us written permission to do the tests without him present because he needed to be working today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" I said, \"when do we start\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you've had breakfast\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo once I'd eaten a plate of eggs and some toast with peanut butter on it we got down to the tests. I tried to stay as calm as I could, which was hard because Dr. White was examining a newly formed vagina which I wasn't even supposed to have in the first place. The tests went on for about two and a half hours, and the hospital called my dad around one o'clock to say they were waiting for results on the tests and he could come to pick me up. He showed up around 1:30 and we waited together for about ten minutes before Dr. Clark entered the room. \"Allison, from everything we can tell you are now a fully healthy teenage girl. You free to go but we do ask that you continue coming back around every mouth or so for about four or five mouths\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do doc\" I said as I got up to leave with dad.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dinner was, awkward, to say the least. Dad and I had to go through the process of explaining everything that the doctors had told us. Needless to say, he was just as shocked as we were. Especially because this little accident would take even more of the little bit of me that was essentially still me. The rest of dinner was more or less an awkward silence as everyone continued to process everything. But eventually we all finished our meals, and I volunteered to do the dishes. As I placed the dishes in the sink and turned the water on, I heard someone approach behind me. I turned around to see Aaron standing there, clearly unsure about what to say. \"What's up bro\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trying to process this is all\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, the doctors basically said that any mental changes were a definite maybe, not a sure thing. There's a chance that all that comes from this is I will be able to push a baby outta myself way down the road\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if more than just that happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm still the same right now. And I trust that no matter what happens to me your still going to be my younger brother that I'll always love and care for\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, Aaron had his arms wrapped around me giving me a big hug. \"Thanks Ally, I think I needed that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night went by rather quickly and uneventfully. I finished all my homework and was in bed around 9:30 or so. Then the next morning came. I woke up early like always and took a quick shower before getting ready for school. Once I had dried off and gotten dressed I went downstairs and threw together a bowl of cereal for breakfast. Then Aaron and I went to school. Aaron went and joined his friends, while I went to find mine. I found Patrick and Eric first and decided I'd catch up with them. \"Hey guys, what's up\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Ally\" Eric said as he noticed me first. \"Not much. How about you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, same old same old I guess\" I lied, not wanting to tell them yet about my doctors visit quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where were you yesterday\" Patrick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hospital, the doctors thought there was a strange result from one of the tests they ran from my monthly check and wanted to hold my for a day just to be safe\" I said. While it was partly true, I didn't want to worry them by telling them the whole truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" Patrick asked, clearly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on Pat. They wouldn't let her come to school today if something was wrong with her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" Patrick said, but I had a feeling he knew something was up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us continued talking until we were joined by Kelly and Sam. Then the talk turned to a date Sam and Eric were planning for this weekend. Before I knew it the bell was ringing and Patrick and Eric went their separate ways while Kelly, Sam and I all went to our first class. But not before making plans to all eat lunch together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My first class wasn't anything special, and neither were any of the other classes before lunch. I met up with Kelly and Sam sense they were in classes not far from mine, and we walked together to the cafeteria to meet up with Patrick and Eric. The 3 of us got a table, and I stayed behind because I had brought my own lunch today while Kelly and Sam went to go get a school lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't alone for more than 2 minutes before someone behind me asked \"Is this seat taken\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around to see a boy my age standing there, brown hair and blue eyes. He was probably 6 feet even and 170 pounds. I didn't recognize him, but it was a big school. \"Not at the moment\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a seat next to me and said \"Thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My names Michael Evans\" he said as he stuck his hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison\" I replied as I shook his hand. \"You new here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My dads in the Navy and he just got orders to the naval support facility up in Saratoga Springs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing here. They've got their own school over there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our new house is about halfway between the 2, and from what my parents could tell this school is better. A couple of school of choice forms later and me and my twin sister are going to school here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head a tad in acknowledgment, then asked \"So, where were you guys living before you came here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most recently Pearl Harbor. Before that Portsmouth in Maine and Newport Rohde Island the time before that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, must have been hard to leave Hawaii\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we'll get over it. It's not like we're not used to living in this part of the country\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked for a minute before my friends started showing up. It seemed like for the most part everyone really liked Michael. About halfway through lunch his twin sister, Rebecca joined us. She, like her brother, was a pretty cool person. The 8 of us talked all the way up to the bell that signaled that lunch was over and we needed to go to class. Surprisingly, Rebecca had the same schedule as me after lunch. We had just arrived and taken our seats when Amber walked up. \"How's it going, freak\" she said, clearly addressing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Amber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saw you hanging out with the new girl me though I'd save her from hanging out with a freak like you and offer to personally show her around\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, the new girls got a name\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure I'll learn it in due time. But for now why don't you just come with me and we can leave this freak alone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bout not. I've literally know. You for a minute and I can already tell your a world class bitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes, Amber said \"Whatever. See if I care\" before storming off to her own seat and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her problem. It's almost like she's out to get you or something\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda hard to explain. And I've grown used to it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind telling me the story\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for about it for a second. \"After school, it's kinda hard to explain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of school went by without any other incidents. And before I knew it, Rebecca and I were waiting for our brothers by the student parking lot. \"Ok Allison, you told me that you'd explain why that Amber chick hates you so much after school. It's after school now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One second\" I said as I waved over to Aaron who was searching through the crowd for me. Once he got to where we were standing, I introduced him to Rebecca. \"Ok, so Amber\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's her deal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" Aaron said. \"What did she do now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing new\" I replied to him. Turning back to Rebecca, I said \"Almost 8 months ago now, I got hit by a truck while playing basketball with Aaron, Patrick, and Eric. The ball went into the road and I got hit by a truck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hates you because of that?\" She asked with a quizzical look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she hates me because of what happened while I was there. You see, Allison Samuels didn't even exist when I was admitted to the hospital. I was admitted as Brian Samuels  You see, my entire pelvic region was crushed and I required a lot of surgery and these experimental hormone shots so that I could live a normal life. Amber believes that because I was a boy that became a girl that I'm some sorta freak that should be avoided at all costs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was silent for a moment as she processed everything. \"Oh, my, gosh. I can believe anyone would treat you that way for something you've got no control over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Michael found us. I proceeded to tell him what I had told his sister and he had more or less the same reaction, except for the fact that he did t know about Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Becca, I just got a text from mom. She wants us home ASAP so we can help with unpacking the boxes that arrived today. See you two tomorrow\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" she said acknowledging him, before turning back to me. \"Hey, listen, I don't have much in the way of fall or winter clothes. Would you be interested in going to the mall with tomorrow so I can pick up some stuff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll run it by Sam and Kelly and see if they wanna come with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I love shopping with groups more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca\" Michael shouted as he continued to walk to their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming\" she shouted back at him. \"See you guys tomorrow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there with Aaron for a second in silence before he said \"You shoulda gotten hit by a truck years ago. 2 months after waking up and you've already tripled how many hot girls you have as friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carful baby brother. Your already dating one of those friends\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day was rather uneventful. I went straight to my room when we got home and began knocking out my homework after texting Kelly and Sam to see if they wanted to go to the mall with Rebecca and me (which they both quickly replied that they'd love to go)  while Aaron spent most of his afternoon watching tv and Skyping his friends. Dad got home around 6:30 or so and made chicken breasts for dinner. The three of us talked about our days, I told dad about Rebecca and Michael, and how I was planning to go to the mall with Kelly Sam and Rebecca. After dinner, I went upstairs and took a quick shower before heading to my room and watched a movie until I decided to go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day I woke up to my alarm and went through my morning routine. After going to the bathroom I went downstairs for some breakfast. As I walked into the kitchen I saw my dad already dressed for work, drinking a cup of coffee and reading the paper. \"Morning dad\" I said as I wiped the sleep from my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Ally\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing up so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just have an early meeting today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Is it important\" I asked as I got a bowl of cereal and sat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. My bosses just want a more detailed report of what's been going on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, well, good luck with that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sweetie\" he replied as he pulled me in and kissed my forehead. <br>\r\nI decided to let it go sense I was starting to get used to being treated like a girl. Even at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us sat in silence for a minute before I said \"hey dad, could I have some money for after school. I'm willing to bet Kelly and Sam are gonna try and get me to buy something at the mall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" he said as he pulled out his wallet. \"Here, take my debit card. Just promise me that you won't go crazy with it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise\" I answered as I took the card. Dad sat at the table with me until I finished my breakfast before he left for work. As he went out to the garage, I headed back upstairs to get dressed for the day. As I stripped out of the clothes I had worn last night to sleep in and put a clean bra and pantie set on. Then I stood in front of my open closet for a minute before I picked out a pair of jeans, a grey New England Patriots shirt and a light blue hoodie. Then I grabbed my backpack and went back downstairs, where I saw Aaron eating his own breakfast, already dressed and ready for school. We talked for a bit while he finished eating, then we both went to my car and left for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI met up with Kelly and Sam before class and Sam told us about her hectic day at work yesterday. As we were talking Rebecca eventually joined us, but right before the bell signaling it was time to go to class went off and we all went off our separate ways for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first half of the day was rather boring and tedious, but eventually lunch came around and I met up with everyone. As we ate, Rebecca began asking about the homecoming dance in a few days. We told her how Kelly was going with Aaron, Sam with Eric, and me with Pat. Rebecca, not wanting to be left out, decided that she'd go to even though she didn't have a date. But seeing as she didn't have a dress yet, Kelly suggested that we put that on a list of things we look for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day after lunch was just as uneventful as the first half. But soon enough the time came and the four of us were in my car headed to the mall. As we were walking in, Rebecca said \"So, where do you suggest we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Kelly started. \"We got Ally's dress from JC Penny's. That's probably a pretty good place to start looking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go then\" Rebecca said enthusiastically. The four of us quickly walked to penny's and began our search for Rebecca's dress. After a few minutes of browsing, Rebecca approached me and said \"Hey, Ally, what does your dress look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around at the various around me, before saying \"it's actually this one right here\" and pulled an identical dress to the one I bought with Kelly and same off a rack ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenney/DP0811201617070878M?\" target=\"_blank\">http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenney...</a>$product_pdp$ ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I bet that looks great on you\" she said as she looked it over. \"What kinda shoes are you wearing with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't think we ever bought any when I got the dress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bought any what?\" Kelly asked as she approached us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally says when you three came here and got her dress you didn't buy any shoes to go with it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh\" Kelly said as she placed her hands over her mouth. \"I can't believe we forgot about some shoes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Kelly, why don't you take Ally and go look for some shoes and Sam and I will meet you over there in a little bit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's go Ally\" Kelly said as she grabbed my hand and pulled me with her. I barely had time to put the dress back on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, Kelly had led me back to where all the shoes were. And more specifically, high heels. \"Ok Ally\" Kelly said as we walked into the shoe section. \"We gotta find you a pair of heels that'll go good with your dress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do they have to be heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's just what girls do for dances. Don't worry, a lot of  people take them off for a majority of the dance anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I said giving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us wandered around looking at shoes for a few solid minutes, with Kelly occasionally having me try on a pair she'd found. While I have to admit they weren't as bad as I would've thought, I couldn't let Kelly know that. After taking off the most recent pair she had me try on, something caught my eye. It was black with a crisscrossing pattern that would go over the top of my foot, stopped below the ankle, and had a short zipper on the back ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenney/DP0628201620334537C?\" target=\"_blank\">http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenney...</a>$product_pdp$ ). As I picked it up and examined it, Kelly walked up behind me and said \"That's perfect. You totally have to try those\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the display shoe down, I found a pair in my size and was about to try them on when Rebecca and Sam walked up to us. \"Hey guys\" I said as I saw them. \"Find a good one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Rebecca said showing us what she had picked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And on the way over here I noticed a pair of skinny jeans on a clearance rack that I liked. But they didn't have my size but they had yours Ally so I thought I'd come show them to you\" Sam added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sam. I thought we were here for Rebecca\" I said, trying to get out of wearing the jeans in Sam's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you could use some more clothes to. You have like four pairs of jeans and they're all basically the same. These can add some variety to your wardrobe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got a point Ally\" Kelly added. \"Why don't you take the shoes to the changing room to and try them both on and come back here. That way you can get a better feel for if you like them or not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I approached the changing room with jeans and shoe box in hand, I couldn't shake this feeling from the back of my head. The thought that wearing these jeans would be like me taking yet another step away from Brian and towards fully appreciating that I am Allison from now on. I took a deep breath as I opened the door, stepped in, and locked the changing room door. I slowly untied my shoes and took them off, followed by quickly sliding my jeans off. Turning my attention to the skinny jeans, I carefully took them off the hanger and began to put them on, having to do almost a little dance to get them up over my butt. As I buttoned them, I looked in the mirror. As part of my mind screamed that this felt so wrong, another part though that the girl in the mirror looked good in these jeans. Knowing what I needed to do next, I proceeded to slip the heels on. As I stood up, I couldn't deny the fact that these weren't as uncomfortable as I previously thought. I unlocked the door and stepped out of the changing room only to see Kelly, Sam, and Rebecca standing outside waiting for me. I looked at them for a second, before asking \"So, what do you guys think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm seriously wishing they had those in my size\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Kelly added. \"Those both look really good on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should totally get those\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely\" Rebecca answered. \"Those shoes will look great with your dress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you gotta have some skinny jeans\" Kelly added. \"They just add so many more outfit options\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them continued to complement me about how the jeans and shoes looked on me for another minute or two before I finally relented and said I'd buy them. After I changed out of the jeans we wondered around the stood for a few more minutes before deciding to pay for what we had and move on. Then, Kelly wanted to go and check out Macy's. Walking in, we began wondering like we had been at Penny's, pulling various articles off racks and looking them over. There were a couple of shirts that I liked, and even a pair of black leggings. Eventually we ended up in the back half of the store, where all the shoes were, and Kelly and Rebecca had a field day while trying on almost everything in their size. Sam and I would occasionally look at one pair or another, but there wasn't much catching our eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally\" Kelly said approaching me with another pair of shoes she was trying on. \"Go put the jeans you got at JC Penny's on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I just to see you in something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A surprise, ok. Just please do this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I said and went to put on my new skinny jeans.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I quickly made my way to the changing rooms and stepped into a stall, where I quickly changed into the jeans I had already bought. Figuring Kelly wanted me to try on a pair of shoes, I put my shoes I had been wearing in the bag from JC Penny's along with the jeans I had been wearing. I was about to open the door and walk out when I saw the tags out of the corner of my eye and removed it. Then, I quickly walked over to my friends. While most everyone probably just saw a teenage girl walking around the store in skinny jeans sweatshirt and without her shoes, I felt like I was walking around as someone else. Which I kinda was in a way. As I rejoined the group, Kelly approached and handed me a shoe box that contained what she wanted me to try on. I opened the box, only to have to give Kelly a dirty look as she wanted me to try on a pair of boots with a somewhat sizable heel ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://slimages.macys.com/is/image/MCY/products/3/optimized/3676051_fpx.tif?op_sharpen=1&amp;hei=434&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">http://slimages.macys.com/is/image/MCY/p...</a>$filterlrg$ ). \"I'm not wearing these\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just please try them on. You don't have to buy them, unless you like them. I just thought that they'd look really good on you and I wanna see if I'm right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep sigh as I thought about it. After a second, I said \"Fine. But I'm only trying these on because your both my friend and my brothers girlfriend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down and proceeded to put them on. Once they were both all tied up I stood up as Kelly looked at them. \"They look good, but can you fold the bottom of the legs up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fold the bottom of the legs up so they aren't in the bootie and you have a little sliver of skin between the two\". I looked at her for a moment as I tried to decipher what Kelly's end goal was here. All the while, Sam and Rebecca knew exactly what Kelly was doing. \"Please\" she begged. Giving in, I began to fold the bottom of the jeans over like Kelly had asked. Once I was done with that she took me over to a mirror. \"What do you think\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think about you wearing them\" she said. \"Just look at the knees and below. Does the guy part of your mind like what it sees\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took in the mirrors reflection for a moment, before answering \"I do like it a little\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Now when you walked over here what did you think\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it felt a little weird. I mean I've never worn heels before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but were they comfortable\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down and shifted my weight from one foot to the other and back, then looked at Kelly and said \"I guess they are kinda comfortable\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I wanted to hear\" she said. \"You can go take them off now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat back down and proceeded to take the booties off as Kelly and Rebecca went back to browsing the shoes. As I was putting them back in the box, Sam sat down next to me and said \"she did the same thing to me when we first met\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly opening your mind\" Sam answered. \"Before I met her I was more or less like you. I dressed in a lot of loser fitting clothes and only wore tennis shoes. Then when I met Kelly in middle school we came here and she did almost the same thing to me. She got me to admit that it wasn't as bad as I made it out to be. And look at me now.\" Looking over at her, I had to admit she was right. \"And I can tell it's having the same effect on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried about what Aaron will say. He still looks at me as his brother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He always will see you that way. Nothing will change that. Even when your in your cousins wedding, standing there in a bridesmaids dress, he's still gonna see his big brother. But you cant let your worries about him interfere with you embracing your own life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking a smile, I said \"Why are you guys doing this to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting me to embrace this crap hand I got dealt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're your friends Ally. And as bad as things have been, think about all the good things that have come from it. You've got new friends who are always here for you, your brother finally went on a date with his crush, and one of your best friends is dating a girl how probably would never have talked with him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess your right\" I said. I looked at the shoes Kelly had me try moments ago for a second. \"I think I'm gonna buy these\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of us continued looking through the shoes for a little while longer after I had changed back into my original jeans and put my own shoes back on until Kelly and Rebecca pretty much tried everything on. Then we moved on through the rest of the store. As we browsed the rest of the store, something caught my eye. We were looking though some jackets and I pulled one off the rack. As I examined it, I noted that it was basically a green (sage according to the tag) vest put together with a grey sweatshirts sleeves and hood ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://slimages.macys.com/is/image/MCY/products/3/optimized/3828767_fpx.tif?op_sharpen=1&amp;hei=434&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">http://slimages.macys.com/is/image/MCY/p...</a>$filterlrg$ ). I took the sweatshirt I was wearing off and put this jacket on, checking to see if Kelly or Sam was watching. They weren't, they were to busy with something Kelly found. As I finished putting the jacket on, I heard Rebecca say from behind me \"you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around, startled that she saw me trying this on, I replied \"Actually, I do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks good on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at the jacket again, then back at Rebecca. \"This is so weird\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday I would have looked at this at best. Kelly does her mind game and all of a sudden I'm buying a pair of heeled boots and I'm looking at this jacket thinking about buying it to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I can't imagine to start to understand what's going through your head. But it sounds to me your friends got you to accept what's happened to you. And it seems like you've taken a big step forward\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and I continued to talk while the four of us continued browsing the rest of the store. In the end, everyone ended up buying some stuff. As for myself, I bought 3 shirts, a pair of leggings, the shoes and the jacket. We then all headed to the food court where we got some snacks and just enjoyed the rest of our afternoon before we left the mall. Arriving back at school, I dropped off Kelly and Sam at Sam's car while I drove Rebecca to her house. Once I dropped her off, I made the trek back to my house.</span></div></div>",

But we need to talk about that kiss!\" you reply. \"You said you weren't angry!\" she responded, somewhat upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a breath before responding. It was important that Kelly understood what I was trying to saying. She was my dearest friend and I really wanted to be with her. But I couldn\u2019t be just an easy lay then dumped by this wonderful girl who I cared about so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I like you! I...I like like you! Like I want to be your girlfriend in a lesbian way! B-But I can't be some kind of sexual experiment! And I am not easy either! I mean...if you want to be with me...then be with me! Officially, like tell your parents and everything. If you don't want to be my official girlfriend then tell me now. In that case, we can forget the kiss. But if you feel like I do...that my feelings for you are romantic...then I want to be your girlfriend! Your full, open girlfriend who you take on dates and say to people, this is my girlfriend Ally!\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses before kissing me again. I knew that I shouldn't let this happen, she hasn't given me an answer and I always liked Kelly that way even when I was a guy. It feels so nice, just melting into her arms. But the doubts resurface and I separated from her. A tear runs down my face. I felt a burning pain in my chest and I felt the tears on the verge of falling down my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you feel anything for me?\u201d I cried; tears running faster and faster down my face as the dams burst. She held me as I bawled, more doubts in my heart. \u201cI like you too! Please stop crying!\u201d she pleaded. \u201cYou-you just think I\u2019m an easy lay!\u201d I wailed. She pulled my face to hers. \u201cI love you! Please stop crying! I panicked because you\u2019re hot and I want you\u2026but I\u2019m not a lesbian! I liked you when you are a boy, I like you even more now that you\u2019re a girl. I am so turned on and confused around you\u2026I just want to explode! But I never, ever thought of you as some sort of a sexual experimentation partner. I couldn\u2019t do that to a friend, I had such strong feelings for. So if you\u2019ll still have me, I want to be your girlfriend officially! But I still want to sleep with you! But I am prepared to wait, because I don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m taking advantage of you!\u201d she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sniffled and held her close. \u201cI am so in love with you too! And I am totally not saying it, just because you said it too! I\u2019m saying it, because I do!\u201d I said, kissing her tenderly. We spent some time, just kissing and holding one another. I didn\u2019t know what would happen next, I just knew that this is where I wanted to be. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We said nothing would happen between us!\" expressed Kelly. My eyes suddenly widened and I started shaking. \"Ally! What's wrong?\" she gasped, holding me tight. \"Aaron's going to hate me!\" I bawled. She held me tight, rocking me a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't be happy, but we will explain it to him! I will find him another girl! He will mad for a bit, but he will be ok! Try not to worry, babe!\" she explained, pulling me tight. \"Being with you is the only good thing about being a girl! I mean being friends with Sam is great; but I love you! I hate that I'm hurting my little brother! I...I just need you so badly!\" I confessed. She kissed my forehead and rested my head against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter my little freak-out, she put on another movie. \"We'll tell them tomorrow! But for now honey, we should rest!\" she concluded. \"I love you!\" I said again. She beamed at me. \"I love you too Ally Samuels, you beautiful baby!\" she cooed, holding you in her arms. She suddenly grinned. \"Poor Patrick is going to be devastated when he finds out; I'm taking you to the dance. He really likes the new you!\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver. \"He knows I'm straight!\" She looks at you, giggling. \"Ally, you're a girl who likes girls! There is a term for a girl like that and it isn't straight! You, my darling, are a lesbian! I'm not sure what I am...bisexual I guess!\" I giggled too. \"I guess I'm a lesbian then!\" That makes her giggle. I cuddle further against her when my new cell phone goes off. The number looks familiar. \"Hello?\" I answered. \"Hi Ally, It's Patrick! Listen we have to talk, like right now! It's super important!\" \"OK Pat, calm down! What's so important?\" I asked. Kelly smirks in the background, testing my ribs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to shake her off with a shush, though I still laughed a little. \"Hurry get here and find out!\" he babbled excitedly, before the phone suddenly went dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patrick? PATRICK! Kelly, Patrick wants to talk to us at his house. He says it's important!\" I reveal. Kelly gasped. \"He knows about us!\" \"How can he, Kel? I didn't know till tonight!\"  I pointed out. \"Well it's not to ask if you're ticklish, because he should know the answer is yes!\" she reported, attacking my ribs. I quickly caved, in my new body; I'm one big tickle toy! She stopped suddenly, kissing me tenderly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patrick can't have you, you're my girlfriend!\" she declared, fiercely. After another pointless protest from me, Kelly got us tight shorts to wear, insisting I wore the minimum. I caved again after her finger found my navel. \"Are you going to tickle me all the time to get your way?\" I demanded. \"Yes!\" she responded. I didn't fight it, though this was not welcome news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to Patrick's house was long enough that we discussed at length what it could be that was so important. Kelly was certain that Patrick liked me. She was also clear on her response. I was equally clear that she was my girlfriend whether Patrick felt that way about me or not. I hoped it wasn't, remembering that boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at his house and knocked on the door. A brown haired girl around 5 foot 9 answered (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1861496-Garage-Sale-of-Change/map/11112121122112212122111221112112221121221\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>). She was wearing a revealing bikini though Patrick's house didn't have a pool. She was jumping up and down; it seemed excited to see us. \"Ally Samuels Kelly O'Rourke! Wow, you guys look so cute or hot, I'm like not sure because I want to like licking you both up! Oh Ally, you're like going to have go stag or take Kelly, because Pat's take me to the dance!\" she began rambling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, I am so jealous of you both. Ally, you are totally sexy and so are you, Kelly. Pat is so hot and sexy, it like totally makes me forget how much I want to see you two n**** or whatever! Aren't you dating Aaron, Kelly? Oh my god, are you dating both of them? If yes, I totally want to date Ally too! I totally like that option and stuff! OMG, we could like lesbian kiss each other and stuff, it would be like totally awesome and stuff! Like we could have an orgy or whatever with all the n**** girl places and stuff! That would be like you know totally wicked and cool plus totally yummy with the working it and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly cut off the babbling girl by asking \"So you're Patrick's girlfriend?\" \"Yeah, Pat's taking me to the dance!\" she explained. \"Cool, can we see him?\" She giggled and nodded, grabbing both our arms and dragging us both to his room. \"Oh, I'm Brianna, Brianna Wallace. I totally had like a major crush and stuff on both of you. And after Ally came back to school or whatever, I like totally had a way bigger crush because you are like smoking hot as a girl! Especially your a** which is like totally luscious! So Kelly's, are you two like okay with like the three of us doing n*** stuff? You know Ally, you should...\" \"So you're in Patrick's grade?\" asked Kelly, looking at me worried about my reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly this weird girl was confused me more than anything. Granted she was very pretty, but what was Patrick thinking dating such a weird hypo girl? Then again, that answered its own question. \"Yeah, even though people think I'm 16 and stuff, I like in truth totally younger than that. But my lesbian big sister Rose said I had to keep the truth like a secret and stuff! Do you know my lesbian sister Rose Jean Wallace? (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1861496-Garage-Sale-of-Change\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>). She and her girlfriend Jenny totally are like the most awesome lesbians and everything! Rose totally helped me be like the smartest girl in school or whatever and that's it ok to be bisexual and stuff. I think that I like girls way more than guys, that's why I was totally excited when I called you guys, pretending to be Pat!\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was Patrick who called us, not you!\" I exclaimed. Brianna giggled then impersonated Patrick's voice perfectly. \"Hi Ally, Its Patrick! Listen we have to talk, like right now! It's super important! You and Kelly need to come to my place now! Hurry get here and find out!\" You stare stunned before you remember she didn't actually say you and Kelly the last time she called, though you had for some reason assumed she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like totally good at that. Like I'm a witch or something! Which I am but I'm not! Because I don't do the broomsticks or cauldrons because that's lame and stuff! Also I totally...\" \"So where's Patrick?\" I cut Brianna off mid sentence. She giggled, letting go of our arms and pointed to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached for the doorknob and opened it. I gasped when I saw a girl that looked like him from the back, her head buried in the pillow. I suddenly realise that Patrick hates being called Pat, but Brianna kept calling him that and not once said he, him or his!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patrick, is that you?\" I asked, not sure I wanted to know the answer. The girl lifted her head, tears running down her face. \"PAT! Baby, why have you been crying?' screamed Brianna, dropping to Patrick's bed, wrapping her arms around her. The girl Pat mouthed \"Ally, Kelly, help!\" Kelly clapped her hands over her mouth, while I stared, unable to understand what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl was clearly Patrick, though how this happened I had no clue. Pat relaxed and stopping crying, facing the two of you. Brianna moved her hands to Pat's shoulders. \"Pat Baby, who were you crying?\" asked a confused Brianna. \"I don't want to be a girl, Bri! I want to be a guy again!\" Patrick squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt like that, Pat!\" I exclaimed, immediately regretting it. \"Why would you want to be a guy, Patty? Ally's happy, she has a sexy girlfriend in Kelly and she is way hotter as a girl! Being a girl rocks, except for the periods!\" remarked Brianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick shivered at that. \"I...I'm Patrick!\" she managed to say. \"Umm...no! Now you're Patricia, because you're a girl and it's a girl's name!\" pointed out Brianna. \"Bri, you got to turn me back!\" exclaimed Patrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" asked Brianna. \"I...I...well how did you turn me into a girl?\" he demanded. \"I don't know! But it's great, now you can go in a great dress and everything!\" she commented, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cut Patrick off, taking Kelly's hand. \"Brianna, Patricia doesn't have any proof of who she is!\" I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna looked at me, before catching on. \"Oh yeah, driver's licences, birth certificate and stuff! Well we should go to my sister Rose! She can use her magic to fix that...oops! I wasn't like suppose to reveal that!\" she exclaimed, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go to Rose's tomorrow! It's very late!\" observed Kelly. Patrick squealed, shaking her head. \"Why not tonight?\" she gasped. \"Well it's like 1 am!\" pointed out Brianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick dissolved into tears and Brianna comforted her again. \"When you were 12 and we thought we lost Aaron, I covered for you so we could find him! I never told anyone what happened, not even Eric! You owe me, Ally!\" stated Patrick. \"Well that removes any doubt that you're Patrick!\" I replied, remembering that terrible event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patricia!\" declared Brianna. \"Could you call your sister and see if she and her girlfriend are available?\" suggested Kelly. \"Ok!\" replied Brianna, reaching for a cell phone from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all stared at her and she giggles. \"Its' a trick my sister taught me!\" she explained. She begins dialling a phone as we waited. \"So you two are dating?\" Patrick managed to ask. Kelly and I both nodded. \"Aaron will be pissed!\" Kelly squeezed your left hand as you waited.</span></div></div>",

Really, really awful and I need your help!\" he exclaimed. \"Of course, what's up?\" I enquire. Brianna was still talking on the phone, which I took as a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I slept with Amber Riley! Things between me and Kelly haven't been going well and I don't want to be with her anymore! But I don't want her to hate me or Amber! Ally, can you help us? I mean I know you have been crushing on Kelly forever too! Maybe you could ask her out, so I don't have to be the bad guy? I know its horrible but...a few time she called me Ally when we kissed. Please help!\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a range of emotions, some good, some bad. I had no idea what to do, especially since Patrick had been turned into a girl somehow. \"I...I kissed her today! I'm in love with Kelly! I'm so sorry, Aaron!\" I replied. There was a pause that made me whimper. What if I lose my little brother, I couldn't handle that! Kelly squeezed my hand, encouragingly. \"You've been through a lot! You were honest enough to tell me, Ally! So don't sweat it! Can you tell Kelly that I accept the two of you and that we are through?\" he asked. \"I'll tell her that you two are through!\" I responded, delighted at this turn of events. Kelly breathes a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we ok?\" asked Aaron, nervously. \"Yeah, of course! Why wouldn't we be? I mean I kissed your now ex-girlfriend and told her I loved her! If anyone should be mad, its you!\" I answered, confused. \"I mean because I know Amber and you haven't gotten along. And I told Aubrey Mitchell that I would kick her a** if she came anywhere near you! I mean I only said it to make me feel better! I know you can defend yourself and stuff!\" he added, quickly. \"I really like Amber, but I don't want to lose my brother over it! I mean lose my...\" \"You won't lose me over that, Aaron! But as you know I am having a sleepover with my girlfriend and you need to tell her!\" I interrupted, handing the phone to Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly and Aaron talked while Brianna gabbed to her sister. Patrick looks on the verge of collapsing. \"Take it easy, Patrick! We will get through this!\" I told him. \"I'm sorry, Ally! I...before I met Brianna; I...\" I shook my head. \"I'm a hot lesbian! It's confusing! Besides your girlfriend said the same thing!\" I remarked. \"What?\" he gasped. Brianna stopped for a second to blow Patrick a kiss, her smile still wide, before resuming her conversation. \"Sounds like you really like her!\" I whispered. \"She's cool and hot! But she turned me into a girl! How can I trust her?\" she whispered back. \"Because it was an accident!\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly turned off the phone and handed it back to me, a smile on her face. \"Amber and Aaron! Well, they will be a cute couple!\" suggested Kelly, wrapping her arms around me. I melted in her arms again. \"Eric will be shattered, he always liked her!\" remarked Patrick. \"He'll live! He also has a crush on that cow Aubrey Mitchell!\" I added. \"Rose can see us! She says we should wait here until she and Jenny can pick us up! She also like wants to know, why your parents totally aren't here and why I'm like wearing a bikini and stuff, but you have like totally no pool at all and stuff!\" babbled Brianna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looked worried, but at this moment, I wasn't worried. I had Kelly; my brother was dating my enemy Amber and my buddy Patrick had a girlfriend. All that needed to happen was to set up Sam and Eric, possibly with each other and our group would be complete. I giggled despite myself, things were working out. \"What's funny, ticklish girl?\" teased Kelly. \"Don't you dare!\" I articulated firmly. \"Is it your ribs?\" she continued. \"Don't!\" I stated firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys know that my girlfriend Ally has ticklish ribs?\" she continued. I pulled away from her, angrily. \"Kelly, I said no!\" She nodded, pulling me to her with a tongue pleasing kiss. \"I love you, Ally! Forgive me for teasing, you are just really hot when you get mad!\" she opines. Another kiss makes the irritation of the kissing go away. \"Bri, you understand that I don't want to be a girl, don't you?\" asks Patrick. \"I understand that you don't want to be a girl right now, Patty! But I know I can convince you! Boy or girl, you're hot! But you're way hotter as a girl!\" I was too busy getting kissed by Kelly to focus on their conversation. A knock on the door, put pay to my enjoyment of Kelly's soft lips.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Patrick pulled close to Brianna as I reluctantly stopped kissing Kelly. \"Ok, it could be Rose and Jenny or Patty's parents! Since Patty's parents know Kelly, we will answer the phone; while you two new girls stay here!\" suggested Brianna. I bristled a little at being called a new girl. I was as much a girl as them, or I appeared to be at least. \"Patrick's parents don't know me, but they know Ally or at least they have seen her since it happened. So we should all go and explain the situation to them, if possible!' suggested Kelly as the doorbell rang again. Kelly insisted on holding me which was very weird, since I'm taller than her. Though based on the pinching, it may have been an excuse to tease me. Nevertheless we opened the door to find a tall blonde woman holding on to a smaller redhead. 'Rose! I love your hair! Hi Jenny!' declared Brianna, giving the redhead a quick hug. The redhead sister and her girlfriend greeted her in return, before the tall blonde let the redhead down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna went up to her sister and gave her a hug. 'So tell me what happened, little sister?' asked Rose. 'Well I came over in this super hot bikini to chill with my like totally smoking boyfriend Patrick! Patrick is now that super sexy babe over there!' she exclaimed, moving towards Patrick and expressing her affection with a quick make out. I could see that Rose looked distinctly unimpressed. Her tall blonde girlfriend Jenny wrapped her arms around her. 'Behave or I'll tickle you to death!' she whispered. It seemed to me that lesbians really like to tickle each other. 'It sounds to me like they have the right idea!' Kelly whispered into my ear. I shook my head, annoyed. 'Could you please stop with the tickling talk?' I hissed. 'Never!' she teased. 'Patrick, where are your parents?' asked Rose in an authoritative, overly protective voice. 'Um'they were, I mean they are out!' she replied. Rose's eyes narrowed as Kelly finally put me down. 'So you invited my little sister to your house. Even though you knew your parents would not be home! And how exactly can I help you if they aren't here since you are a minor?' she asked, coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, what?' squealed Patrick. 'How can I provide you with medicine without your parent's permission? There are rules about that sort of thing! So I suggest you call your parents and tell them what and how this happened!' pointed as Rose, the tone of her voice was glacial. 'Sweetheart, could you tell your beautiful big sister, the last thing you remember doing before Patrick changed?' suggested Jenny. Brianna paused to think about it. I could see how protective Rose was, of her little sister. She had her arms crossed, looking decidedly angry. I was worried for Patrick, who looked like she was about to cry. I knew what she was going through. 'Maybe you could cast a spell?' I proposed. Rose looked at me as if I was crazy. 'What are you talking about? And may I ask who you are?' she questioned me. 'It's Brian Summers, except now she's the totally hot Ally Summers!' answered Brianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose went a little pale and muttered an apology. It seemed I was always going to be the talk of the town. 'I am undertaking a double degree in medicine and chemistry, Ally. I don't know what you mean by spell.' replied Rose. 'Ally was referring to the disappearing mobile spell that Brianna showed us!' replied Kelly. 'You mean this?' asked Rose, who showed us the so called spell. Broken down, it was clearly a clever illusion. 'Brianna meant that I practice illusions, since magic is obviously not real!' she added, looking pointedly at her sister. 'The last thing I remember was giving Patty a drink!' she revealed. 'What drink?' demanded Rose, her face pale again. 'This!' revealed Brianna, handing Rose a bottle. Rose looked like she was going to pass out. 'Rose, sweetheart, what is it?' asked a nervous Jenny. 'It's the medicine I prepared for Brianna! Bri, this is prescription medicine, designed to help you with your medical problem! You shouldn't have given it to Patrick!' she reported angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So give him an antidote or something! Or don't, because Patty is a sexy girl!' giggled Brianna. Rose squeezed Jenny's hand, looking like she was about to explode. 'Brianna Wallace, there is no antidote for this medicine! It's permanent!' explained Rose. I gasped, turning to Patrick who screams at the top of her lungs. \"Patty, this is like totes awesome! Now you can stay this way! It's not like your parents can object now!\" expressed Brianna. Patrick started shaking, before bursting into tears. Brianna held her, massaging her back. Rose rolled her eyes cruelly. I was starting to really dislike her. \"I'm turning 17 in a month! I don't want to spend it as a girl!\" wailed Patty. \"Don't worry, Patty! I will give you like the most awesome birthday present ever!\" declared Brianna. \"Isn't there anything you can do?\" I asked Rose, Kelly holding me tight. \"If anyone can undo this, it's my girl, Rose!\" declared Jenny. I suddenly picked up that they look just like a redheaded Thea Merlyn-Queen and Felicity Smoak respectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not a little, I mean near identical. \"Even if Patrick's parents consented, our locum doctor would never agree to help. Our laboratory is not equipped for dealing with sixteen year old transformations. And the last time something like this happened, we were unable to reverse the situation. Although, that did take place years ago!\" she explained. \"But you can't just leave him like this without ID or ability to cope with becoming a girl! Believe me, it isn't easy going from a straight guy to a gay girl!\" I countered Rose's argument. I was so annoyed at her lack of enthusiasm, just because Patrick was dating her little sister. \"There is nothing I can do! I lack the authority or ability to undo this! Patrick must take responsibility for his actions as must his parents who are legally at fault for leaving their minor child at home on his own!\" she replied, indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that's enough, Rose!\" exclaimed Brianna, angrily. That shut Rose up and stopped Patrick's crying. \"You started dating Jenny without her parents' ok! And I am pretty sure you were my age then! I remember that you were all upset and stamping your feet because you afraid you might lose Jenny. But Mum, Grandma and Dad not only supported you, but gave you money, a house and straightened things out with Jenny's parents. You were a frightened little lesbian, all terrified of losing Jenny and nobody gave you a hard time! I'm sixteen, big sister! Same age as you were then. You think I have the maturity of like a 9 year old! Then tell me how mature you were when you had your temper tantrum? You don't like that I came over to make out with my boyfriend, well that's my right! It's not like I was happy that my big sister left me at 16 to live with Jenny, you know! But I accepted it because you're so in love with Jenny and she makes you happy! Well now Rose Jean Wallace, you can do the same for me!\" she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy respect for Brianna rose really high, practically to the sky. Rose looked both shocked and contrite. Jenny didn't say anything, she just held Rose. \"Well we should call Patrick's parents! Do you have their cell phone numbers?\" asked Kelly. Patrick nodded and handed her phone to Kelly. Rose nodded as Kelly rang the number of Patrick's father. \"Hello, Mr Sullivan? This is Kelly O\u2019Rourke, Ally Samuels\u2019 girlfriend! Ally Samuels who remains a close friend of your son\u2019s? She, Eric and Patrick are often together? Yes, that\u2019s Ally Samuels! Listen sir, something has happened to Patrick while he was entertaining his girlfriend Brianna. He is ok, but you need to come home right away! It\u2019s not something an ambulance can deal with, sir. He can\u2019t come to the phone now, but I can ensure you its\u2019 quite urgent. Thank you sir, we\u2019ll see you and Ms Sullivan when you get here. Sorry to interrupt your night!\u201d concluded Kelly as she stopped the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Dad sounded pretty unhappy. I could hear your parents playing Barry White in the background!\u201d revealed Kelly. As awkward as it was hearing the exchange between David Sullivan and Kelly about me, I could see how distressed Patrick looked. Brianna held her tight as Kelly motioned me away. \u201cThis needs to be about Patrick and Brianna! It\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t care what Patrick looks like, she clearly likes her from her personality! Something she and I have in common!\u201d I blushed at Kelly\u2019s comments. \u201cHoney, we will be there for Patrick, but from what I heard, MR David Sullivan will be REALLY pissed, when he finds out what happened to him! It will fall to us to help Patrick and Brianna convince Rose\u2019s company to help. I\u2019m sorry about what I had to say about you to Mr Sullivan! It makes no difference to me what you look like because I love you!\u201d she declared, pressing her lips against mine. I held her tight, my emotions as always, threatening to overwhelm me. This girl was so wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026girls? We like totally need you and junk!\u201d interrupted Brianna. After an internal sigh, we joined the 3 other girls, all of whom were having an intense discussion. \u201cWhat if my Dad paid them? Would they help then?\u201d expressed Patrick. \u201cThey won\u2019t want any liability, Patrick! I cannot see a situation where they would agree! I fear gender reassignment when you turn 18, may be your best bet!\u201d stated Rose. \u201cBut that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d \u201cDude, what\u2019s up?\u201d I asked. \u201cRose doesn\u2019t think I can go back! She thinks I should get some freaky sex change!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI was simply expressing my expectation of what will transpire. My company will engage their attorneys to shield them from liability. Those \u2018legal\u2019 practitioners will paint Mr and Ms Sullivan as irresponsible parents who were neglectful in their care of Patrick. They may even use their influence to ensure social services remove Patrick from his parents!\u201d revealed Rose. \u201cWhy don't we just watch some TV, the 6 of us, until the Sullivans get back!\u201d proposed Kelly. The suggestion was adopted, immediately.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Halo and Abra Kadabra faced off with the fate of Starling and Central City in the balance, the doorbell rang. The TiVo paused as Kelly lifted me to my feet. I was a little unnerved by her newfound strength. \"Time to answer the door. Rose, we need you to come with us!\" Kelly stated. Rose looked unhappy as she got off Jenny. She was a dead ringer for a long haired Willa Holland except her hair was red, not brown. I knew that Brianna and Rose weren't really witches, but Rose sure was acting like one. Nevertheless, Rose opened the door as we faced the Sullivans. \"Where is my son? Who are you girls?\" He demanded. \"I am Rose Wallace, Mr Sullivan. And seeing that you and your wife allowed your son to stay unsupervised in this house with my underage sister, I suggest you moderate your tone!\" responded Rose, her voice indignant and icy. Mr Sullivan was taken aback by Rose's comments. Not surprisingly, he elected not to respond. \"Where is Patrick?\" interrupted Ms Sullivan, looking fearful. \"Hello, Mr and Ms Sullivan. I'm Kelly, we spoke on the phone? I am afraid that Patrick has had an accident.\" she began. \"OH MY GOD! What happened to my son?\" cried Ms Sullivan, tears falling down her face. \"Ms Sullivan, I'm Ally Samuels. I was Brian Samuels before... I was in an accident.\" I paused as both their eyes were on me. I refocused, taking a deep breath. At least, Ms Sullivan was crying. \"Patrick was entertaining Ms Wallace's sister Brianna. She's Patrick's new girlfriend. There was a slight mix-up. Patrick wanted a drink and Brianna accidentally gave him something containing her medication. Patrick doesn't need an ambulance, because he isn't in pain. But something....important has happened to him. So we called Ms Rose Wallace to help as this is her field of expertise.\" I continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Mr Sullivan, trying to keep from yelling. I took a moment to breathe again. Kelly squeezed my hand, reassuringly. \"Well..the end result of what happened to me...has happened to him, chemically.\" I concluded. Mr Sullivan looked at me for a moment, trying to decide if this was some kind of prank. Ms Sullivan simply burst into the house, looking for her son. \"OH NO! PATRICK!\" she screamed. Mr Sullivan followed, the three of us behind him. Ms Sullivan was clutching Patrick, bawling even louder. Mr Sullivan stared at his son before turning to me. \"What happened to my son? What kind of medication was this? What did he drink? How quickly can you undo this mess? Who...\" \"Mr Sullivan, you should calm down! My sister's medication contains a variety chemicals such minute traces of atrazine, batrachotoxin and phytoestrogens. These have shown to have the effect of strengthening a woman's immune system despite the fact larger doses can be dangerous even lethal to girls and women in general. However the effects on young men has been such, that the company that develops it has made it VERY clear that no-one with a Y Chromosome should imbibe this medical treatment in any capacity whether orally, digitally or in any manner handle this with their bare skin or organs. It is especially dangerous for minors. I am not sure if this is even reversible. The last case where this happened, the former boy now girl, both couldn't be reverted back to male AND her parents lost custody of her. Patrick is a minor.\" interrupted Rose, speaking with her cold demeanour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" expressed a frightened Ms Sullivan. \"It means that the company won't turn him back and if you threaten legal action, they will use their high priced attorneys to strip you of Patrick's custody.\" explained Rose. \"Wait a minute! So they won't turn me back and they'll take me away from my mum and Dad? They can't do that!\" exclaimed Patrick. \"You could live with me and my parents as my girlfriend!\" offered Brianna. Ms Sullivan held Patrick tighter as Mr Sullivan swayed as if struck. \"Can't you do anything?\" asked Mr Sullivan to Rose. Rose shook her head. \"I can try to get him into an appointment with the head of the division. But they will expect you to sign a legal waiver, removing them from all responsibility if they agree to turn him back! Actually they'll probably expect you to sign one, just to get the meeting.\" observed Rose. \"Mr and Ms Sullivan, you don't need to worry. I know my big sister is acting like her usual cold, overprotective self and all, but I promise to be a good girlfriend to Patty! I'll protect him from any bullies and I'll get him something nice to wear when we go to prom!\" offered Brianna, again. Mr Sullivan turned to Brianna. \"You've caused enough problems for now! I need you all to leave immediately! I need to talk to my family, now!\" he roared. \"You don't need to tell us twice!\" declared Rose, reaching for Brianna. Brianna stood her ground. \"I am not leaving this house unless Patty wants me too! She needs me!\" she reported. I tried to interrupt both Mr. Sullivan and Patrick from upsetting Brianna and Rose further; but Patrick spoke first. \"Leave Brianna! Just leave!\" declared Patrick. Brianna reeled as if stunned. \"Fine, let's go big sister! I am sure Patrick and her family will need to talk before she starts dating BOYS!\" she responded, angrily, following Rose and Jenny out. Kelly and I said goodbye to Patrick and left. \"Poor Patrick!\" I exclaimed. Kelly nodded. \"Without Brianna and Rose, it will only get worse for him.\" she agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weird day, the next day as I had breakfast with Dad and my little brother. Aaron was in a really good mood. The fact that he was dating Amber filled me with both relief and dread. I couldn't deny that while Aaron's happiness meant a great deal to me, my secondary tormentor being my brother's new girlfriend was equally not the news that I wanted to hear. \"So Ally, do you think you and Kelly might join me and Amber to the mall, today? I mean it would be nice, you know.\" I didn't hesitate in my reply \"I'll call Kelly now to confirm that. Sure, you want your big brother ruining your date with your girlfriend?\" I asked him. \"Nah, it'll be cool! Besides Amber has really missed Kelly!\" responded my little bro. \"Then let big sister arrange everything!\" I declared, dialling Kelly's number. \"Thanks big sis!\" he replied. \"No prob\" I answered, surprised that I actually referred to myself both as big brother and big sister in the space of 5 minutes. This was getting complex. \"Ally, my love! How is my tickly girl?\" \"You saw me last night, hon! And do you have to call me that all the time?\" I expressed, a little annoyed. It was like, my newfound ticklishness was going to be shoved in my face, no matter what. \"I can't help it that you are SO ticklish. In fact, I was hoping we could talk about a little fantasy I have where I tormented your bound, beautiful body?\" I turned scarlet at that. Kelly was really keen on making clear to the world and to herself that I was hers. \"We can discuss that soon, Ally. Um...Aaron wants us to join him on a double date with Amber. Is it cool? I...only want to do it if you are cool with it. Is it? I love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could have kicked myself for agreeing without checking with Kelly first. My father was intent on eating his toast as loudly as possible. He was very clear in not wanting to hear this. \"Will you be ok? Because if Amber makes one crack, they will never find her corpse!\" she exclaimed, a crackling fury in her exclamation. I knew I had a lovesick happy face on. Honestly I didn't care. \"She won't, can't wait to see you again!\" I replied. \"See you at 12, my ticklish darling. Love you too. Kisses!\" she responds, send me a kiss through the phone. I blushed before kissing back. The phone called ended, I nodded to my brother. \"Um...Ally, are you like the girly one between you and Kelly? Cause with all the blushing and girlish voice, you sounded like a little girl!\" he remarked, grinning before he clamped her hands on his mouth, realising what he just said. \"I'll show you, girly!\" I answered, grabbing him in a headlock and unleashing noogie after noogie. He tried to free himself, but my grip was too strong. \"Ally, let go of your little brother!\" demanded Dad. I let him go with a smirk. \"Soft headed, little kid!\" I giggled before raced up to my bedroom. I dug through my new wardrobe, somewhat embarrassed by what I had. Nevertheless I chose a pink tank top and denim blue skirt to impress Kelly. I wasn't happy about putting on the red lacy bra and panties, but contented myself to how turned on my girlfriend would be. Being a lesbian made me happy. I don't know how I would have handle going bi or straight. It would have destroyed who I am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to apply my makeup, taking the time to make sure I looked nice. A quick application of lipstick and I was ready to thrill my honey. I could see why girls took so long getting ready. All the rituals and choosing was necessary to look your best. I hoped Kelly would like my decisions. A photo caught my attention. I almost slapped my forehead, before deciding against it. I needed to call Patrick, not reapply my blush. I dialed the familiar number, waiting for a response. \"Brianna, baby, is that you? I am SO sorry my sexy...\" \"Patrick, it's Ally!\" I interrupted. \"Oh. Hi, Ally!\" replied Patrick, flatly. \"Happy to see you too, Patrick!\" I replied. \"Dude, I screwed up with Brianna! I need her back!\" he cried. \"Patrick, man, calm down.\" I tried to calm him down but I used the wrong word. \"I'm not a man! I'm some freaky creep's sick fantasy! Brian, help me! Help me, man! How can you stand it? I...I had my period, last night!!!!!\" she screamed. \"Whoa, man, that's awful. I'm SO sorry to hear that, buddy! Look, why don't you come to the Freeway Mall with me, Kelly, Aaron and his new girlfriend? It will be more fun there with you, pal!\" I hoped I could convince Patrick to join us. With Kelly, Aaron and me, he would be among understanding friends who could help him. </span></div></div>",

You think so?\" he squealed. \"Only one way to find out.\" I remarked. \"Be there in 20!\" he replied. \"See you then!\" I responded. I have to be honest, I felt relieved that Patrick was coming. I was worried about Amber, though. I hoped that Amber wouldn't make him uncomfortable. Of course that got me thinking about Eric, who still didn't know about him or that I was now Kelly's girlfriend. I took a moment to further adjust myself. I couldn't help but sigh as I stared at my reflection. I looked so female and sexy that it was getting freaky again. But I wanted to look by best for Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking the boring women's magazine I picked up, I nodded. I was ready to look my best for the woman I love. I ran downstairs to wait by the door. I really didn't care how that sounded. What I didn't expect was a gasp from my little brother. \"Bro? Are you ok?\" I asked him. \"Al...Ally! Shit, you look like a hot chick!!\" he gasped. \"Well I can hardly look like a shit one for Kelly, can I?\" I began to flare up, before I realised how weird it must be for him. \"I'm still me, Aaron! But I have to make a change for the woman I love, just like you do for Amber. It's part of being in a relationship. Just try not to drool, ok?\" I teased him. He went bright red. \"Dude, settle down! It's not a big deal!\" \"Ally...I just h-had a hard on thinking of you and Kelly!\" he whimpered. I took a breath, knowing that me being as revolted and disgusted as him wouldn't help. \"Forget about it, Aaron. Just think about Amber!\" The doorbell interrupted us to both our reliefs. I opened it to the sight of the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. \"I want you now!\" whispered Kelly in my ear. I can't describe how hot, Kelly looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi Kel.\" stammered Aaron. I should have figured how weird things might be between them. Kelly showed how awesome and cool she was, by shaking his hand. \"So where's Amber?\" she asked, wrapping her arms around my waist. I had to bit my tongue, she deliberately put her fingers in a sensitive place above my hips. \"Oh she's on her way. She....ummm...well she will be glad to see you and stuff!\" stuttered my brother. Fortunately Amber arrived quickly, though Kelly teased me by whispering \"I know that tickles. Wait till I get you on my own!\" I swear that girl was determined to make me wet my panties. Which naturally was her goal. \"Hi Kel!\" she began, tentatively. \"Amber.\" she replied, a little stiffly. \"Hi Ally. How are you doing? sorry about...everything!\" I nodded, offering her a shaking hand. She shook it, before grinning. \"Kelly! Are you tickling Ally?\" \"Maybe.\" offered Kelly, a big grin forming on her face. Aaron gave me a weird look, I just wrapped my arm around Kelly, trying to keep in the giggles. \"If she keeps squealing and wetting herself, I can't apologize to her properly!\" pointed out Amber. \"Fine!\" she declared, releasing that sensitive area. I sucked in air as I slumped a little on my haunches. \"Don't worry, Ally. We girls have to stick together!\" added Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew Amber was overcompensating for her earlier behaviour. But I still thanked her. \"So Aaron, shall we take our sexy girls out to the mall?\" proposed Kelly. Amber giggled at that as I frowned a little. \"We have to wait for Patrick. He is still upset about what happened between him and Brianna.\" \"I heard that Brianna turned him into a girl through medicine or something? Not that that's a problem, I mean it's totally cool and I hope she's ok and everything!\" babbled Amber. Kelly took her hand. \"Breathe, Amber! So long as you are nice to me and my girlfriend, we're cool. And you accept us both, Ally as a lesbian and me as a....I guess also lesbian?\" I kissed her neck, making her moan. \"Straight, bi or lesbian, I love you all the same, Kelly!\" \"Sis, that was so queer!\" remarked Aaron. \"I'm a lesbian, Aaron! I am queer, remember?\" I pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Patrick is coping with his transformation?\" enquired Kelly. \"It would be easier, if he had Brianna. He really loves her.\" \"Brianna's a pretty intense person. But the way, she stood up for her against her mean, older sister that was awesome!\" stated Kelly. \"Whatever happened, we're all friends now. Right?\" asked a nervous Aaron. \"Friends!\" I replied. \"Absolutely!\" agreed Amber. \"Ticklish friends!\" quipped Kelly, torturing my ribcage. I exploded, squealing my guts out. \"I don't remember you being such a tickle baby, Ally!\" noted Aaron. \"Just for me, Aaron! Only for me!\" declared Kelly as she finally let me breathe. \"Maybe we should have a tickle fight, while we wait?\" proposed Amber. Naturally, I whimper at that. \"Yeah, the only one who will be tickling this hottie is me!\" fiercely exclaimed Kel, wrapping arms around my waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does Sam or Eric know about Patrick?\" asked Amber. I shook my head. \"We still have to tell Sam about us. Unless you already have?\" enquired Kelly. \"I haven't spoken to either of you recently. I am so hoping that Sam will forgive me!\" \"She will, Amber. I forgive you. Kel forgives you. We are all good. Other than Aubrey Mitchell, that is!\" Amber nodded at my comments. \"She has always been a mean bit**! From the first time, we met her; she is just a slut**, condescending cow!\" expressed Amber. \"Totally agree!\" added Kelly, kissing my neck. I couldn't help the moans that came from me. The warm feeling of those gentle lips pressed against my neck was intoxicating. It was as if some ice I didn't know was afflicting me had been banished away. \"Get a room, you two!\" teased Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe settled on watching Supergirl. Though I hadn't like the character at all, Non's accidental death was very poignant as Astra held her husband, the sword still in his back. The look of pure hate she gave her niece, niece's sister and father figure was haunting. Kelly surprised me by pressing herself against me. Naturally that was the part I found most enjoyable. \"I love you!\" she whispered. \"I love you too!\" I whispered back.</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that Kelly was teasing my missection. With my forced ticklesmile, I opened the door knob. \"Hi Ally!\" declared Sam. Kelly let go of my quivering belly as we pulled Sam into a threeway hug. \"Sam! You're back early!\" I cried. \"Yeah. Apparently there was a business thing that needed fixing urgently!\" declared Sam. We beamed at her, before Sam noticed Amber. \"Hi Sam.\" she said in a small voice. \"We're all friends again and she's dating Aaron!\" I explained quickly. I immediately regretted telling Sam as it was Amber's right not mine. \"You stole Aaron from Kelly?\" gasped Sam. Amber shrunk a little before Kelly piped up. \"I'm coming out as bi. Aaron and I broke up amicably. I'm dating a really cute girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam noticed Kelly's hands returning to my waist and my blushing expression and smirked. \"I knew you liked Ally! I totally knew it. So now I'm the only single one?\" expressed Sam with a fake exasperated sigh. \"Eric is still single. And Patrick and Brianna broke up. I suppose you could date one of the three of them?\" I proposed. Sam pulled a face and we all laughed, especially me as Kelly deliberately tormented my sides. \"Do you tickle her a lot?\" asked a surprised Sam. \"Every chance I get. She's all mine. The love of my life!\" I moaned as Kelly ended her statement with a kiss to my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! You two are so cute! Like two Barbie dolls!\" she teased. Kelly stuck her tongue out in response. \"So, we're heading off or....\" \"We're waiting for Patrick. He is going through a rough time!\" I explained. \"Yeah, Brianna might be weird, but she is hot. I feel bad for him.\" \"Oh, maybe you should ask out Brianna?\" proposed Kelly. Sam pulled that same face to everyone's amusement. We settled back in front of the tv as Supergirl continued. \"Man, that Mehcad is lazy! Why doesn't he even try to act?\" declared Aaron. \"Maybe he think because he looks like that, he doesn't have to?\" posits Amber before wrapping her arms and her lips around him. This prompted Kelly to do it to me, while teasing my tickly hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, still single here!\" pointed out Sam. Amber and Kelly both stopped kissing us. They looked at each other before sticking their tongues out at Sam. \"Very mature!\" was the response they got as they giggled as did I when Kelly went after my navel. \"K-Kel! I'm g-gagahahahaha to peehehehahaha!\" I squealed. \"Then I will help you clean up!\" she replied, goosing my belly button and grazing my ribs. I dissolved in silent laughter as Sam, Amber and Aaron treacherously encouraged Kelly to keep going. Fortunately another interruption kept me from wetting my panties.</span></div></div>",

Sam's here too!\" I could hear Patrick's breath quicken. \"Does she....does she....\"We didn't tell her. It will be ok, she is very supportive.\" I assured him. He nodded and followed me in. He was wearing jeans and a tank top. No-one would have known if they hadn't met him before that he wasn't always a woman. He looked like any other teenage girl. We walked into the living room, where the others were waiting. Sam, Amber and Aaron wore the confused looks on their faces that Kelly and I had. However Kelly calmly approaching him. \"Hi Patrick, how are you doing?\" \"Ok, I guess.\" he replied. \"Holy crap, Patrick! What the hell happened to you?\" I glared at Aaron, while Sam and to my surprise Amber wrapped their arms around Patrick, who promptly lost it. \"I'll never be a guy again!!!

Your life is not over. Do you want to tell us what happened?\" offered Sam. \"I miss Brianna!\" I decided to venture saying something. \"Look, we are here for you, Patrick. Whatever you need!\" \"Do you think Brianna is at the mall?\" I bit back a sigh, knowing it wouldn't be helpful. \"The only way to find out is to go there!\" \"Ally's right, Patrick. It's the best chance of finding her, if that's what you want.\" advised Kelly. \"Ok, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive there involved Patrick being a little glum, while Kelly tortured me with tickling the whole time. Naturally Sam encouraged her to do so. Amber was being extra encouraging to our sad buddy, while Aaron sat in the back on his own, bemoaning the fact that he wasn't driving the 7 seater. The fact that only Patrick and I had licences didn't deter him. Of course, Patrick's licence was for the male him; but we let him drive anyway as he loved driving. At some point, I knew I needed to have the talk with him; but that would have to wait. Patrick's mood improved as we left the carpark into the mall. I cuddled up to Kelly, I was still worried about Aubrey Mitchell. Patrick squealed when he saw someone ahead. \"It's Brianna!\"</span></div></div>",

Audrey glared hatefully at me before stating \"Don't get comfortable, he-she! You can't hide behind your little brother, forever!

She had been held back due to frequent absences related to an ice addiction.

He will be safe!\" I pulled her into a hug, pressing my lips against her. I didn't care about anyone, drooling over lesbianism anyway. \"Sorry\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed at me. \"Why are you sorry that I got to make out with the hottest girl in school? A very ticklish girl!\" Of course with her long left middle finger's nails in my belly button, all I could do was laugh. She quickly showed me mercy however and embraced me. I knew then as I have since, that Kelly was my world. Holding hands, we resumed our search; to find ourselves at Taco Bell. And something unexpected and unwarranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Eric were having a disagreement and it was getting louder. \"It's not my damn fault that you look like this now! How was I supposed to know you had been turned into a hot lesbian? All I saw was a sexy babe, it's not like I did anything!\" My heart sank at this. This was bad. \"You were leering at me like I was a piece pf meat! I am a human being after all and...\" \"Are you?\" Patrick's eyes widened and I gasped. Kelly held me tighter. \"So now both of you are lesbians! And you got yourself a pretty girlfriend, eh, Brian? Oh, I'm sorry, Ally now!\" \"Ally is my girlfriend's name! Just like Amber is Aaron's! And who we date isn't your concern!\" sneered Kelly. \"So every time we are around you, something happens. Aaron gets dumped, Patrick's a girl, what's next? I am not hanging around, 'Ally' to turn into someone else. See you later, freaks!\" He spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare...\" \"Yeah, yeah, get super-Emotional, girly! I'd say something about periods, but you're the only girl who doesn't get them! I bet your mum died of shame!\" I slapped him hard, causing Eric to reel back. That was a crack too far. \"My mother taught me not to hit girls. I guess you qualify for now, you both do! Bye, monsters!\" I watched as Patrick burst into tears as Eric stomped off. Had we really had a civil conversation, not a few hours ago? A conversation where I told him about me and Kelly as well as Aaron and Amber? \"He is a colossal jerk. Are you ok, Patty?\" Patrick perked up a bit before flinging himself into Brianna's arms. He bawled several apologies, expressing his undying love for her. Kelly just held me as a crowd I hadn't noticed began to disperse. This was not good.</span></div></div>",

It felt like I was having a weird dream or something. Light flickered on and off as I just stayed still. I woke up in an unfamiliar room. I looked around and Kelly, Aaron and my Dad asleep on chairs. I was in the hospital, again. \"Ally?\" whispered a hazy Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's eyes were red as if she had been crying. \"Kelly...what happened?\" I asked. \"You...you passed out, after we kissed again.

I love you!\" cried Kelly, hugging me tightly. \"I love you too, Kelly! What about Patrick? Did Rose help her become a guy again?\" I asked. \"Sorry sweetie, I don't understand!\" she answered. \"Didn't Patrick's girlfriend Brianna call us because she accidentally turned Patrick into a girl?\" I enquired, worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, you have clearly been on some very strong drugs! I don\u2019t know who Brianna is, but I can tell you that Patrick is still a guy!\u201d explained Kelly. \u201cB-But we went to his house!

She nodded. \u201cI told him that I kissed you and you passed out. I admitted I am still in love with you. He took it....less than spectacularly, though he blames me rather than you! He...suggested that I might have exploited you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't! I...\" \"Honey, relax!\" she declared, kissing me again. I relaxed against her touch. \"Sleep now, my darling!\" she exclaimed as I felt weariness take over me and closed my eyes again. When I opened up the next morning.... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My dream was unpleasant: I dreamed I was being assaulted, restrained, and physically controlled against my will into being girly by various feminine things. It was all a blur; and I soon woke up in a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the clock, I saw it was midnight, but I knew I wouldn't be able to get back to sleep. And...something just felt wrong. I remembered Aaron's words from earlier about \"... starting to think like a girl...\", and it hit me. I wasn't acting like myself. Sam and Kelly had been helpful in trying to get me to adjust to being a girl, but by going along with it so easily, I wasn't acting like myself. Why had I gotten that dress? Why did I get those accessories? I didn't want them; I had just been talked into it by the salesgirl. Why did I let Sam and Kelly get me skirts and dresses I had no intention of wearing? Why did I let them get me a bikini when I could have insisted on a one-piece swimsuit? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a decision, I spent a couple hours gathering together all the feminine stuff I had gotten and been given, except the basest necessities, and put them together in a large box, which I put downstairs, and marked \"<i>To get rid of</i>\". All the makeup and other cosmetics went straight into the garbage; and the diary Aaron got me went onto the bookshelf. Finally, the feminine products that were absolutely necessary, that I couldn't get rid of, were put away in the bathroom in an empty drawer (which I labeled \"<i>Ally</i>\") so I'd only see them when necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, I went back to my room, only to find Aaron waiting. \"Ally?\" he asked, \"What are you doing?\" I smiled gently and sat on the bed next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right,\" I said. \"I didn't realize it, but I was letting others convince me into acting like a girl and I hate it. It's just not me. I...I'm a girl physically but I'm still me, and I think I was forgetting that. But not anymore. I got rid of the girly stuff and everything. I'm still <i>me</i>, and I'm <i>not </i>going to let this change who I am. I can just be a tomboy so I can still be myself; I won't be a girly-girl, not <i>ever</i>.\" I knew as I spoke that I meant every word. Being a girly-girl was not something I could ever be, and if I <i>had</i> to be a girl I would much, much rather be a tomboy. I resolved to tell Sam and Kelly that the next time I saw them; I appreciated their support, but I just <i>could not</i> be a girly-girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Aaron seemed to accept my explanation. \"I'm glad you came to your senses, Ally,\" he said. \"You just seemed...not you. I'm glad you're still yourself.\" And with that settled, we both went back to bed. Having finalized my decision to not be girly, and having gotten rid of the girly stuff, I felt better, and slept easier.</span></div></div>",

I just didn't feel like dealing with all these people at once, knowing it would only lead to awkward conversations. I didn't know how I felt about Melissa's proposal either. Being a bridesmaid isn't something I was ready to do, and I was tempted to say no, but then I reminded myself that the wedding was months away. I'd probably never be a girly girl, but hopefully by that point the mere idea of wearing a dress wouldn't make me sick. Also, Melissa had always been there for me, whenever I needed someone to talk to who was mature without being my father. I couldn't possibly refuse her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how long I sat there, trying to fall asleep, without success due to all the noise from downstairs. All these people didn't seem to mind that I wasn't there with them. It's hard to tell whether they realized I needed to be alone or if they just didn't care. I decided on the former. Suddenly, I heard footsteps going up the stairs, followed by two voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure she won't hear?\" Dad's voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she said she was tired, that she'd go to bed early.\" Aaron replied. \"She must be asleep by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was partially right. If I wasn't asleep, it wasn't for lack of trying. Knowing that they didn't want me to hear this only made me more interested. Getting up as quietly as I could, I walked to the door and pressed my ear against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we break it to her?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just tell her directly. It's for her own good, she'll understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, Dad! Ally's not stupid, but there's no way she's gonna be okay with that! We erased her entire life. No more Brian, that guy never existed, and you think she's just going to accept that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be angry at first, but it was necessary. She'll forgive me eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have doubts about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd heard enough. I didn't even know what exactly they'd done, but I knew it wasn't good. They erased the person I use to be. They forced me into becoming Allison without even giving me a choice. And I wasn't going to stand for that. A few tears streamed down my face as I opened my window. There's a tree right next to it that I always used to climb down whenever I wanted to get out without Dad knowing. As silently as I could, I jumped through the window and grabbed on to the tree. Then, I began my descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just ran, I don't know for how long. I eventually reached a park that I'd never been to, and sat on a bench, before breaking down into tears. They never even gave me a choice! To them, it didn't matter how I felt, they just decided everything for me. Well it didn't matter to me if it was for my own good. I had a right to make my own choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, a car stopped nearby. I recognized it as Melissa's car. Sure enough, Melissa got out of the car and sat right next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's where you've been!\" she said, relieved. \"Everybody's looking for you. We thought you might have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me.\" I replied. \"I'm just... really pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't! I've lost everything! My own family made sure to erase all traces of my existence. My entire life has been literally destroyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is hard for you, but you have to go back home. It's not safe for a girl to wander alone at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a girl! And I'm not going back there. Not with... them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still not safe out here. Listen, if you can't deal with your family, you're welcome to come home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that'd be better. Thanks, Melissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just let me make a phone call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out her cell phone and dialed a number I recognized as my father's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found her... Yeah, she's safe... No... No, she doesn't want to come back... I know... She'll stay at my apartment for now... Alright. Bye.\" She hung up. \"It's okay. Your dad's worried, but he'll let you stay with me for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I hope I'm not too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I have more than enough room. You're welcome to stay with me as long as you want. Now get in the car, it's getting cold out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Melissa into her car. We both stayed silent for a few minutes, as she drove toward her apartment, but she eventually broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Ally.\" I cringed at the name. \"I know you don't want to be a girl, but you can't keep denying it either. You're a girl now. Your name is Allison, and that's not going to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best to help you adjust. Frankly, I'll probably do a much better job of it than your dad would. But you've got to work with me, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try. Just... nothing too girly, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't promise you that. You see...\" She stopped when she noticed my frown. \"Okay, I promise. Nothing to girly.\"</span></div></div>",

Dad was supposed to take me shopping tomorrow, but it looks like that's not gonna happen, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you shopping. Besides, who would you rather have help you choose clothes, me or your dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled. And then I looked down. \"I just don't have any money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem. It's on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I need an entire wardrobe, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and my offer still stands. Unless of course you'd rather go ask your dad for money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point... Anyway, I think I'll go to bed early. I'm really tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. You can use the shower if you want. I'll set up the futon for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to the bathroom and started taking off my clothes. I then got in the shower and started cleaning myself up. During the past few days, I'd gotten used to having a female body. I didn't like the idea, but it didn't constantly bother me. But now, it angered me. It reminded me of how I was never given a choice. How Dad had erased the person I was from the face of the world without even asking me. I just wanted to finish this and go to bed as soon as possible. I think at some point I heard the door open and close, but I didn't really pay attention to it. I finally got out of the shower and noticed some pajamas laying, neatly folded, on the floor. From the looks of it, they were the least feminine pajamas Melissa could find in her wardrobe. After drying myself, I slipped into the pajamas. They weren't a perfect it fit, as I was an inch taller than Melissa, while she was slightly bustier than me, but thankfully they were loose enough to be comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering my clothes, I exited the bathroom to see that Melissa had already set up the futon and put some blankets on it. As I walked towards the makeshift bed, Melissa got out of her own bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to got to bed too.\" she said. \"So, have a good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Melissa went back into her bedroom, I got into bed and quickly fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

I washed the outfit you wore yesterday, but you'll need more clothes than that, and you'll never fit into mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, I definitely needed clothes. But I always hated shopping. How can girls spend hours doing that? I decided that I'd go along with it, for the sake of necessity. Who knows, I might even enjoy it... Just a little... Actually, the entire experience would probably turn out to be pure torture. I quickly got up and dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, are we going now?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" Melissa said, staring at me like she'd seen a ghost. \"You can't go out like that. Look at yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa grabbed my hand and dragged me into the bathroom, where she placed me in front of the mirror. I saw the same reflection I'd seen for the past few days: a normal girl, with more than a passing resemblance to the boy I used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that is my reflection. So what?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Your hair is a mess! If you won't fix it yourself, at least let me take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave myself a good look. Melissa was right: my shoulder-length brown hair was a complete mess. I hadn't paid any attention to it earlier, but now that Melissa had mentioned it, it was hard to take my eyes away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can fix my hair. I don't have a clue how to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa grabbed a comb and started working on my hair. For some reason, it felt like she was actually enjoying it. I sure wasn't, though. However, when she was done, I could tell that I looked a lot more attractive. Not that I wanted to, but I wasn't going to complain either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, perfect.\" Melissa started. \"Now maybe a hint of makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push your luck.\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Ally, I'm just messing with you. Now come on, let's put a smile on that pretty face of yours. It's not good to be grumpy all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about Melissa's attitude that really helped cheer me up, even though she could be annoying sometimes. I couldn't help but oblige when she asked me to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, much better. Now let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Melissa into her car, and we left for the mall.</span></div></div>",

Melissa had gotten a salad while I was eating a burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get fat if you keep eating stuff like that, Ally.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I care?\" I replied, before taking another bite. Not liking the sound of my own reply, I quickly swallowed before adding: \"Mel, I know you mean well, but you have to remember that I'm a guy. I doesn't matter that I look like a girl, you can't just ask me to think like one. Besides, it's just one burger, it can't be that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just looking out for you. You said it yourself, you don't know anything about being a girl. I'm here to teach you these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, but maybe we should stick to the basics. You know, stuff that's necessary to my survival. I don't plan on letting this change everything about my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Let's just finish this and get started on the shopping. Where do you want to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then let's get the boring stuff out of the way first. We'll buy you some hygiene products, and then some underwear, and then we'll start getting you some outfits. I just need to call your Dad first.\" Melissa said, grabbing her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. I'll take care of this. I just need some information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dialed Dad's number and raised the phone to her ear. \"Hello... Yeah, it's Melissa. Listen, I'm at the mall with Ally and... No, it's okay, I'm taking care of that... Alright, thanks. I just need to know something. Would you happen to have Ally's measurements? I need to know what size she'll wear... Okay, thanks. Bye.\" She hung up. \"Thankfully, your doctor took your measurements and gave them to your Dad. He's gonna email them to me, so that should spare you some embarrassment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know. I wouldn't want to ask some store employee for my bra size\" I said, before taking the last bite of my burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I was thinking. Now I'm guessing you don't want to spend your entire day here, so let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing we did was get me a few hygiene products. Shampoo, deodorant, that king of thing. At first I wasn't sure about buying girl products, stuff that smells like flowers, until I figured that I didn't really care what I smell like. We then moved on to getting me some new underwear. Thankfully, Melissa having received the email from Dad, I didn't need to try them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what kind of underwear do you want to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean there are different kinds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oookay. Let's do this differently. Just pick some that you think look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it really matter? I just want something that's not too girly. Is there a 'regular underwear' option?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, never mind. I'll pick for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa proceeded to select multiple sets of bras and panties. She apparently listen to what I said, as most of what she picked was white and plain. She still chose a few that were a little too frilly for my tastes, but I didn't complain, since at least I didn't have to do it myself. After paying, we moved on to the next item on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa insisted that I needed new shoes, despite the obvious fact that I already had some on my feet. She managed to convince me however, by saying that running shoes aren't appropriate for more formal events. At least she didn't insist on buying a thousand different pair. Since I was still not really interested, I let her pick some sandals and a pair of dress shoes, which, to my dismay, turned out to be high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a trip to the car to drop off some of our purchases, Melissa decided that we needed to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally, I know shopping is not your thing, but you could at least give me some input. Right now, you're just letting me pick everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just not really interested in this. You're asking me to actively participate in choosing underwear and shoes. No one even cares about that stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised... Still, now we're going to buy you some actual outfits. Maybe you could be a little more enthusiastic? I'm not asking you to like this, but at least try to help me choose. You're the one who's going to wear these clothes. Try to find some outfits you like, or at least tell me what kind of clothes you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. And maybe if you participate more, you won't find it so boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't so sure about that, but she still made a few good points. We headed back into the mall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as we were back in the mall, Melissa and I headed straight to a clothes store. I didn't bother checking the name of the place, but Melissa said she went there all the time. We quickly started shopping; Melissa selecting clothes, and me giving my approval. Or my disapproval, actually. Melissa seemed hell-bent on choosing clothes that were way too feminine for my taste. We did of course keep a few items, but for half an hour of shopping, it wasn't much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this one?\" Melissa asked, holding a piece of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wear dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't gonna work.\" a visibly annoyed Melissa stated. \"You know, when I said you should participate more, this isn't exactly what I meant. At this rate, we'll be in here forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe you should just pick all the clothes. I won't complain, I swear.\" I said, fully aware that I'd probably regret it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa paused for a moment. \"How about this? We split up, and each of us picks ten item. Then we meet back here. Is that okay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and soon we were in completely different areas of the store. I started going through the pants section. I picked out two pairs of jean, paying more attention to the size than to what they looked like. Since it was still summer, I figured I might need some shorts, too. I skipped over the really short ones and went straight to the knee-length shorts, picking out two pairs. I then moved on to the tops, selecting several t-shirts of various colors that I thought looked good. Counting the clothes I was holding, I saw that I had reached my quota and headed for the rendez-vous point. Knowing Melissa, she'd probably need a few more minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd need a few more minutes she did. Melissa eventually returned, a pile of clothes in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, was it that hard?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I didn't pick anything too feminine, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect you to. Well, now it's time to try these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? We have a list of my clothes sizes, we already know they'll fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally, trying on clothes isn't just about making sure they fit; we also need to make sure they look good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. Let's just not take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we made our way to the dressing rooms, Melissa matched the clothes together, choosing the outfits she thought were worth trying on. I entered an empty stall, grabbing the pile of clothes Melissa was handing me before cosing the door. Looking through the clothes, I counted a dozen outfits... four of which were way too girly for me; there even was a dress! Ignoring those for now, I quickly undressed and put on the first outfit: jeans I had picked earlier, along with a black tank top. I wasn't sure about the tank top, but once I was wearing it, it was pretty comfortable. I stepped out of the stall to show Melissa my outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, Ally!\" she said. \"Now let's see the next one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe repeated this process several times, me trying on several outfits and showing them to Melissa, who approved all of them, making me question why I was trying them on instead of just buying them. I mostly went with the more unisex stuff: pants, shorts, various shirts, that sort of thing. It was obvious what Melissa was waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all good, Ally. Now let's see you in that dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it a little <i>too</i> girly?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep thinking like that, you'll never get used to being girl. Trust me: it's just a dress, it won't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Ally, just try it on. For me. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll do it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, I never could refuse her anything. Melissa always had that way of getting what she wanted just by looking at you. Stepping back into the stall, I held up the dress, examining it in an attempt to delay the moment where I'd have to wear it. It was a yellow, knee-length sundress with spaghetti straps. After taking off my current outfit, I slipped into the dress. It wasn't uncomfortable, actually. Looking in the mirror, I saw that it made me look very cute. There was nothing wrong with the dress per se; but the idea that I was wearing it just <i>felt</i> wrong. Reluctantly, I stepped out of the stall to let Melissa admire the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally, you look adorable.\" she said, excitingly. \"We're buying that dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it feels kinda... I don't know, wrong. I'm still a guy inside; I'm not supposed to wear this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's an idea. Instead of thinking about what you want to wear, maybe you should ask yourself what you'd like to see on a girl. You can't deny that this dress looks great on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point. Thinking that way would at least help me buy clothes that'd look good on me. With that thinking, buying that dress was an obvious choice. But still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'll probably never wear it again, right?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can buy this dress if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now let's see the rest of these clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the stall, I was relieved to see that there were only three outfits left. Of course, they were the girliest outfits of the bunch, but after that dress, they didn't seem that bad by comparison. All of them had skirts. And of course, all of them were promptly approved by Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for our purchases, we headed for the mall's exit. That's when I saw a familiar face: Kelly O'Rourke. She was a girl from school that my brother always had a crush on. She always ignored his advances, but they still got along well, and I got to talk to her several times. She was a nice girl. Almost on reflex, I greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Kelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, uh... Excuse me, but, have we met?\" she replied, confused. She proceeded to examine my face. \"Wait... Brian Samuels? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard what happened to you... So, how are you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still getting used to being a girl.\" I answered. \"The rest I'd rather not talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Well, it was nice seeing you. Glad to see you're out of the hospital... I should go now, I kind of promised Sam I'd meet her, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Nice to see you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was awkward. As she walked away, I could feel that Kelly was slightly uneasy around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who was that?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a girl I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Are you ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there's something else I want to do while we're here.\"</span></div></div>",

I was having a really nice dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dreams can wait. You have school today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'm coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly got up and pulled out a cardboard box from under the futon. Due to a lack of storage space, all of my wardrobe had been stored in boxes under the futon. Not an ideal solution, but it worked. I proceeded to choose an outfit: knee-length jeans and a black spaghetti strap tank top. I would have preferred a standard t-shirt, but over the last two days Melissa insisted that I try wearing skirts. I managed to talk my way out of it both times, but I didn't feel like arguing today, so I instead went for a compromise. Thankfully, Melissa seemed satisfied with my choice of outfit, and it didn't bother me too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got in and out of the shower as fast as I could, before getting dressed and fixing my now shorter hair. Back at the mall, I decided to have my hair cut. Of course, Melissa didn't think it was a good idea, but we finally agreed on the chin length bob cut I now sported. I originally wanted even shorter than that, but Melissa made a few good points against it, and I had to admit that she was right. Besides, this style kinda grew on me: it looks good and is easy to maintain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick breakfast, Melissa and I were in the car, driving towards the school. I had to admit that I was nervous. I was going back to school as a girl, and it was a safe bet to assume that a lot of students already knew about my condition. Part of me felt like they were going to laugh at me, even though I knew it probably wouldn't be the case. However, they would ask me a lot of awkward questions or avoid me like the plague. Either way, I wouldn't have many friends. Sure, Patrick and Eric would be there, but they'd be a grade above me. There was Aaron, too, but I didn't want to deal with him at the moment. I'd probably spend most of the day alone, trying to avoid lots of unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, Ally?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just nervous, that's all. I'm not sure how the other students will react to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to lie to you. Some of them will be mean to you. Most of them probably won't care, though. They'll leave you alone after a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. I'm not planning on being the center of attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you better be ready, because we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a few seconds to realize that the car had been stopped for the last minute. Sighing, I got out and started walking towards the school, while Melissa took off. She worked as a teacher at the elementary school two blocks away, so I knew she wouldn't be far if I needed her. I rapidly disappeared into the flow of other students pouring into the high school. Right back into a teenager's personal hell.</span></div></div>",

Almost miraculously, I managed to spot two familiar faces and started pushing my way to them, while cursing myself for not waiting until the mob dissipated before entering the school. With much effort, I finally reached my targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it feels like a zombie apocalypse in here. Right, guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it sure does. I've always said that high school students have much in common with the living dead.\" Eric said. \"But, um... Who are you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're joking, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I think he's serious.\" Patrick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for God's sake... It's Ally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I resisted the urge to slam my palm against my forehead, Eric stared at me wide-eyed.

And new clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have a great sense of observation!\" I replied, sarcastically. \"How the hell did you not recognize me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not very good with faces. Honestly, I kind of expected you to look exactly the same as three days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to interrupt this very important conversation, but can I talk to you in private, Ally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh... I'll just stay right here with the zombie crowd.\" Eric quietly said as I followed Patrick into an empty corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we had reached quiet area, Patrick looked at me. He seemed very serious, and a little frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Ally?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm at school, obviously, and right now I'm talking to you. Got any other stupid questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean. You disappear for days and don't call anyone, and now you're acting like nothing happened. Well it doesn't work like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm staying at my cousin's apartment. I assumed Aaron would have told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he did. Yesterday. He also told me that you refused to talk to him or your dad, and that I probably shouldn't bother trying to call you. Now, I'm gonna ask you again: why are you doing this? What is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's none of your business. I know you're worried about me, but this is between me and my family, and I'd appreciate if you don't bring it up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not just going to sit around and pretend everything is okay when clearly it's not. If you want to hide from your problems and cry in a corner, by all means, go ahead. Just don't expect me to watch you do it.\" Patrick started waking away. After a few steps, he tuned around. \"When you want to talk, come see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Patrick went back towards where we left Eric, and away from me, I finally broke down. I just sat there on the floor, tears pouring across my face, as contradicting thoughts fought inside my brain. Part of me agreed with Patrick. He was right: I was just running away, avoiding my problems instead of facing them. But the rest of my mind was screaming that I had every right run away. Had I not suffered enough? Could I really be expected to face my family after what they did? They lied to me, and I clearly wasn't capable of confronting them about it, not after everything that happened before. Sure, I was just hiding, but it was the only thing to do, and I had no obligation to talk to Patrick about it either.</span></div></div>",

You're right, I need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI definitely did need to talk. Patrick was right about that, but I certainly wasn't going to crawl back to him. At least, Samantha didn't try to force me to talk, so if someone had to hear what was on my mind, it might as well be her. It was either that, or waiting until I blew up. Samantha came back and sat down next to me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't take this anymore.\" I started. \"I feel like I can't trust anybody anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her everything. I told how I overheard Aaron and Dad talking about having destroyed my previous identity and how, unable to deal with them, I ran away. I went over my staying at Melissa's place, and her constant attempts to get me to act more like a girl. And finally, I talked about my fight with Patrick. Samantha didn't say anything. She just listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think that's everything.\" I said. \"Thanks for listening to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem. I'm happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that's it? You're not gonna tell me that I should forgive everyone or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I just figured you needed to unload a lot of stuff. I'm not gonna tell you what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since I woke up at the hospital, this was the first time someone said the words 'I'm not gonna tell you what to do' and it was precisely what I needed to hear. I needed to feel that I still had some control over my life. Barely able to hold back tears, I hugged Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Samantha. I really needed this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, I'm happy to help. So, are you ready to go back to class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. We both stood up and started walking through the empty corridors of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, just call me Sam.\" Samantha added. \"I don't really like my full name either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we entered the classroom, every single student stared at me. A menacing glare from Sam was enough to make them stop, but one of them kept looking at me: Aaron. Avoiding his stare, I quietly walked to my seat and sat down. The teacher continued his lesson, but I wasn't listening; after all, I'd heard all that the year before. I was too busy thinking about what I'd tell my brother when he'd inevitably come talk to me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bell rang. As everybody got up to leave the class, I did the same. I had managed to avoid my brother at the end of the first class, but of course he was in the second one as well. Still hoping that Aaron would understand that I didn't want to talk to him, I followed the other students, trying to hide inside the crowd. My hopes were crushed, however, as soon as I crossed the door, as I felt a hand grab my arm and was dragged away from the safety off the crowd. I turned around to see, of course, Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you avoiding me?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I have no idea. Nice outfit, by the way. You know, you're looking more and more like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was definitely not my intention.\" I replied, coldly. \"When were you going to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what? You know, Melissa was really unclear over the phone. All she said is that you were severely pissed at me and Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard about a guy called Brian Samuels? Of course not, because he doesn't even exist anymore! According to all official records, he never existed! I heard you and Dad talking the night I came back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what it's all about?\" Sam said, sighing. \"I told him it wouldn't end well... Listen, Ally. You have to trust me on this: it was for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what else is for the best? Me, leaving. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was silent as I walked away. I soon noticed that Sam was still here, laying against the wall. She seemed to be waiting for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you still here?\" I asked. \"I thought you were having lunch with Kelly and, um... that girl whose name I keep forgetting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber.\" Sam replied. \"And with what you told me I figured you probably don't have anyone to hang out with at lunch break. So, I thought I'd invite you  to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? We barely know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but you seem like a nice girl... guy... whatever, and you probably need some friends right now. You know, we could be friends, you and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we could.\" I answered. \"Alright, I'm coming. I just need to go to my locker to grab my lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was Sam so nice to me? We barely ever talked to each other. She was a friend of a casual acquaintance of my brother. There was absolutely no reason for her to feel the need to help me. And yet... Maybe she was simply interested in my case. What better way to examine the boy turned girl than to befriend her? If that was the case, then I was nothing more than a freak, a thing people want to study as a curiosity. Or maybe I was just being paranoid. That seemed more likely. Sam probably just took pity on me. I didn't really like that idea, but I didn't have any friends left either. Better just trust her for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving reached my locker, I grabbed the paper bag containing my lunch and headed to the cafeteria. Looking at the dozens of students already eating, it took me a while to spot Sam's table. Sam spotted me first, actually, and waved her arm to attract my attention. On my way there, I of course just <i>had</i> to pass by Patrick and Eric's table. Patrick simply ignored me, while Eric stared at me questioningly. It was awkward. I finally reached Sam's table, where she, Kelly and Amber had already started eating. As soon as I sat down, Amber stopped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Amber.\" Sam intervened. \"I told her she could come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Amber replied. It was painfully obvious that she wasn't pleased by my presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Kelly's attitude was much more inviting, though still a little awkward. \"Hi Ally. Good to see you again.\" she said. \"I uh, I like your new style. You look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. It's good to see you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still doing okay? With all that's happened to you, and having to adjust to being a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I survive. I wouldn't say I'm okay, but I'll manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What difference does it make anyway?\" Amber said. \"Even if you look like a girl, you're still a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was tempted to thank her, as she perfectly summed up how I felt, but there was something I didn't like in the way she said it. Kelly didn't seem to notice that detail, but she clearly didn't like the comment itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her past doesn't matter.\" Kelly stated. \"Ally is a girl, now, just like any of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Kelly's comment was actually more offensive to me than Amber's. Of course, in that case I knew she didn't mean it as an insult and decided to keep my mouth shut. Sam, however, didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you stop, both of you? Ally can decide if she's a guy or a girl. Either way, there's no use fighting over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just leave, now.\" Amber said, getting up. \"By the way, Ally, you <i>can't</i> decide what gender you are. You're still a guy, so don't bother pretending you're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all sat in silence as Amber walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I go?\" I asked. \"I don't want to cause any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Sam said. \"Amber didn't really mean it. She's just pissed because she lost the argument. She'll come around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, trust me. I know her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, I unpacked my lunch and started eating.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hi Ally, how was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've always hated that question. When someone asks you that, they never really want an answer; they just expect you to say \"fine\" and end it there. However, my day was anything but fine: I could probably write a twelve page essay on why it was terrible. And of course, this is Melissa I'm talking about. Put those two together, and I'll spend the next three hours talking about what went wrong, something I must avoid at all cost. So I just went with the easy answer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine.\" I said. \"Most of the students just ignored me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a lie, of course: after lunch, my classmates became a lot more interested in me. Thankfully, Sam was there to rescue me before I was overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it went well.\" Melissa replied. \"Ready to go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around to see two girls running towards me: Kelly and Sam. After telling Melissa I wouldn't be long, I went to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were wondering if you'd like to go to the mall with us.\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We always go there after school.\" Sam added. \"Either to shop or just hang out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, going to the mall wasn't my favorite activity. I tried to be diplomatic about it. By lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys, I can't right now. I already had something planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked disappointed, but Sam knew I what I really meant. She didn't say anything, though. That's when I realized that they didn't care about going to the mall: they just wanted to include me and let me know that they wanted to be my friends. I felt bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But maybe some other time.\" I added. \"How about tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. That'd be great!\" Kelly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye, I joined Melissa in the car and we left for her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, after we were done eating and washing the dishes, Melissa and I started wondering what we should do for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could watch a movie.\" Melissa suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My DVDs are right next to the TV, just pick whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started going through the pile, which turned out to be pretty small. There were about a dozen movies, most of which were chick flicks. There was one, however, that caught my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have Scott Pilgrim vs The World?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it at random at a gift exchange last Christmas. Haven't watched it yet.\" Melissa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're watching that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was grabbing the DVD box from the pile, the doorbell rang. I put the disc in the DVD player while Melissa went to answer the door. Soon after, I heard the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's for you, Ally.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor me? Who would come all the way here at this time just to talk to me? If it was Dad or Aaron, I didn't want to talk to them. It couldn't possibly be Patrick. Maybe Kelly and Sam? Nah, they wouldn't come here this late. Then who? I walked to the door, only to see Eric. I joined him outside and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here? It's getting pretty late.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I was supposed to be here a while ago, but then I got lost. Twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before my palm hit my forehead. Classic Eric, no sense of direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, and you didn't just call me because?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I hate phone conversations. You can never really tell what someone is thinking when you can't see their face.\" Eric explained. \"So, what I came here to say is: I'm not with Patrick on this one. Well, he's still my friend, but you're my friend too. We can still hang out, even if Patrick is pissed at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know I don't want to lose you. Neither does Patrick. I don't think he realizes he's not helping. He can be pretty dumb sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he is. I guess he'll come around, eventually.\" I said. \"Do you think you can get back home on your own, or do you need a map?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine. I think. Anyway, see you tomorrow at school, Ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric left, and I went back inside with. Then, I sat down with Melissa and we started the movie.</span></div></div>",

I'd just sat down for lunch with Kelly and Sam, when Amber suddenly appeared.  \"What do you want, Amber?\" Sam coldly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Sam, I'm just here to apologize.\" Amber replied. \"What I said yesterday was out of line, and I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all good, but... I think you're apologizing to the wrong person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" She turned to face me. \"I'm sorry, Ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. You're forgiven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't really sure if I wanted to forgive her, but I did want to avoid unnecessary conflicts. Too late to back down now, anyway: Amber was already sitting down at our table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you came back, Amber.\" Kelly said. \"It wouldn't be the same without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation soon shifted to more normal topics, some of which I had a hard time getting interested into. I still made an effort to comment once in a while, just for the sake of being part of it. Amber quickly reintegrated the group, which seemed to please Kelly. Sam, on the other hand, didn't seem as thrilled by Amber's return, but she didn't show it too much. Soon, lunchtime was over, and we went back to class.</span></div></div>",

Maybe you'll even enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you don't, well... At least you'll understand girls a little better afterwards.\" Amber added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did have a few good points. Maybe if I looked at things differently I could end up enjoying shopping. I just didn't really see how. To me, shopping has always been that thing I do when I'm almost out of presentable outfits. I just go in, get what I need and get out. The major difference here is that, while I go shopping because I need clothes, these three girls (along with many others), do it for the shopping itself, as if it were actually enjoyable. And now they're asking me to not only understand that, but take part in it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll try. Just don't be surprised if it turns out I don't like it. Remember that I'm not actually supposed to be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could have sworn I saw a grin on Amber's face as I said that. Then again maybe I was just paranoid. I didn't really trust that girl. No one else seemed to notice though, not even Sam, so I guess it really was just my imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the next half hour going from store to store, looking at tons of different clothes. While the others, Kelly in particular, seemed to be enjoying themselves, and bought a few outfits, I quickly realized that I could not get over my boredom. I tried to hide it and pretend I was interested, but it was useless. As I should have already learned, Sam could easily see right through me. She grabbed my hand and pulled me away from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the effort, Ally, but it's obvious that you're not having fun.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I tried, but I just can't enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, maybe you'd have more fun if you actually bought something.\" Sam suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I sort of... don't have any money. I'm totally broke. I just came here to hang out with you guys, wasn't planning on buying anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's the problem, don't worry about it. Just pick something you like, it's on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer, but that's not the only problem. I'm just not really into clothes, or shopping. I still can't figure out why you guys enjoy it. Shopping has always been a chore to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam paused for a moment. Judging by the look on her face, she was trying to think up a solution, as if I was a puzzle that could just be solved. Then the metaphorical lightbulb appeared over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying. Shopping isn't always a chore to you. It just depends on the circumstances. Tell me, do you like video games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play once in a while, but not that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, just casually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she hit her target. I did have a soft spot for cinema, and owned a sizable movie collection. And suddenly I knew where she was going. I liked buying movies. There was a certain thrill to be had searching through piles of Dvd boxes, and finding that one film that had been missing from my collection at a low price. Sam was right, everybody did like shopping, it just depended on what they were shopping for. If girls liked clothes the same way I liked movies, it suddenly made sense that they'd spend their free time at clothing stores. But there was still one major flaw in Sam's argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get your point.\" I said. \"But movies and clothes aren't the same thing. And I'm only into one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't like shopping either, but Kelly and Amber are my friends, and I do like hanging out with them. If you don't like clothes, at least you can enjoy the company. You're alone here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's good to know that I'm not the only one who's bored here. At least... Wait a sec!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, what did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam froze, and for the first time since I met her, I could see through her as well as she could see through me. And I knew that she'd slipped up and said something she didn't mean to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I mean... Shopping! Yay!\" Sam said, awkwardly.</span></div></div>",

You're pretty much right about the rest. But look, coming here was Kelly's idea. I didn't object because... Well...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not talk about it here. There are some things about me that Kelly and Amber don't know, and I'd like to keep it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I understand that. It's still kind of surprising. I never thought you were the tomboy type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, don't get me wrong. I love being a girl, I love wearing girl clothes. I just don't like shopping for them. That and a few other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure I understood. Why was she so ashamed of not liking shopping? Plenty of girls don't like shopping. Obviously, it wasn't the only reason. I'd have to talk to her about it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we've been talking for a while now. Kelly and Amber are probably wondering what's taking so long, so we should probably get back.\" Sam said. \"My offer still stands, by the way. See anything you like, it's on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got back to the rest of the group, Sam immediately started smiling again. She looked genuinely happy as we resumed our shopping, but I knew better. She was faking it. It was actually frightening how easily she could slip into a role like that. Of course, I'd attempted the same thig earlier, but Sam was infintely more convincing. Makes you wonder how much of her is real, and how much is an act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing myself to ignore my worries about Sam, I did eventually find an item I liked: a nice jacket that, somehow, represented me perfectly. It was a light blue color, simple, nothing frilly, but it did make me look... cute, I guess? Point is, it looked nice without looking overly girly, which is exactly the look I was going for. And it was inexpensive too, something Sam's wallet was thankful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, we were all ready to go home. However, before we split up, Sam asked me if I could come to her place the next day after school. I accepted of course. It didn't take a genius to know what it was about.</span></div></div>",

Sam opened the door, told her mother that she had a friend with her (which seemed to surprise her), and then led me upstairs to a door at the end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And this is my room,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't told me why you wanted me to come over,\" I pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that. I just don't really know where to start. I guess it's better to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn these words, Sam opened the door to her bedroom... revealing absolutely nothing I hadn't seen before. The room was a mess, with a pile of dirty clothes on the floor in the corner of the room, but otherwise there was nothing special about it. It looked pretty much like my own bedroom. I followed Sam inside, and that's when I started paying attention to the decoration. Like a normal girl's room, the walls were covered in posters... but they weren't the usual posters of celebrities. Rather, there were posters of various video games and horror movies. A quick look at her desk revealed a Alienware desktop that looked much more powerful than my own pitiful computer. In another corner was a small TV with a PlayStation 2 hooked up to it. Next to that, a pile of games and movies that looked far more interesting than what I'd seen at Melissa's apartment. And then I understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never let Kelly and Amber inside your room, have you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I always managed to find excuses to avoid it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? I didn't even know you liked video games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of the idea,\" replied Sam. \"I don't want Kelly and Amber to know that I like video games, or that I'd much rather watch a gory horror film than a chick flick, or that I don't really like shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why don't you just tell them? Why can't you just be yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sat on her bed, and I could see something was wrong. it brought back memories of that day in the hallway, when Sam found me crying. Except now our places were reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already tried that. Before high school. I was a total nerd, and, well... the other girls didn't understand why I'd rather play Final Fantasy than talk about boys, and the guys wouldn't hang out with me because I wasn't one of them. I didn't really mind, because that meant I had a lot of time to myself. But then they started picking on me, and it didn't stop until high school. At that point, I realized I had to change. I became just like the other girls, I met Amber and Kelly, and I haven't had any problems since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just going to keep lying to them? You never feel the need to be yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do! That's why I keep my room like that and never let anyone else in. That's why I'm telling <i>you</i> all this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you barely know me! We've only been friends for a few days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet you told me all about your problems back at school. You trusted me, and now I'm trusting you. You know, I met Amber pretty much the same way I met you: I found her crying in a hallway, but she never told me why. And Kelly just never talks about her problems, I'm not even sure she's ever had any. You're the only person who's ever really opened up to me. Of course it's not the only reason I'm telling you this...\" Sam paused. She looked straight into my eyes, and it felt like she was \"reading\" me. \"I know I can talk to you because you're the same as me. You know what it's like to not be like the other girls, to not really fit in. You can understand better than they can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm touched that you trust me that much,\" I started. \"But I can't let you do this to yourself. You can't keep hiding like that forever, you'll go crazy! I know I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made it this far didn't I? I'm a pretty good actress. And I can keep track of who I am on the inside. Look, it's not a big deal, I can deal with all this. I just need one person I can talk to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you can talk to me. But I'm sure Kelly wouldn't ditch you if you showed her all this. She's been your friend for years, you can trust her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really so sure about that?\" asked Sam. \"What about Amber? I've known her for years too, and yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. I couldn't say how Kelly would react to learning her best friend wasn't who she thought she was. And Amber, regardless of how long she'd known Sam, really didn't seem trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that's pretty much it,\" concluded Sam. \"It... feels good to get all that off my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around Sam's room, staring at the movie posters on her wall. She didn't like the same movies I did, but she certainly didn't have bad taste. She seemed to have a fondness for cult horror films. I looked at her pile of DVDs, where movies and games were mixed without any sort of organization. Titles included the likes of <i>Dead Alive</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i>, <i>Army of Darkness</i> and <i>Fatal Frame</i>. I wondered; if Sam was such a huge gamer, why didn't she upgrade to a PS3?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice collection, huh?\" said Sam. \"I really like horror movies. Like, a lot. I'm also a huge fan of old-school survival horror and JRPGs, but... they just don't make them like they used to, so I switched to PC gaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh. That sure is impressive.\" By which I mean there was easily over a hundred DVD boxes in that pile. \"You know, a lot of these movies are on my to-watch list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we watch one right now?\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that would be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just.. sorry about the TV, it's really old.\" It looked like it came from the 90s. \"I've been saving up for a new one, but I spent a bunch of money on a new video card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, just pick a movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just like that, it suddenly felt like Sam and I would get along much better than I previously thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been fifteen days since I woke up back at the hospital. Fifteen days, and yet it felt like months... I missed the way things used to be. Living with Dad and Aaron, hanging out with Patrick and Eric, being a normal guy. The thought of forgiving them and going back home had passed through my mind a few times, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Besides, my new life wasn't so bad. Living with Melissa was nice, as long as she wasn't insisting that I should be more feminine. I had new friends now. Kelly, Sam and Amber. Sam in particular was a lot of help. Over the past five days, we'd spent a lot of time together. We really understood each other. Things were finally starting to look up. Well, except for one detail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you could have avoided this if you'd just do your laundry,\" said Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't think about stuff like that,\" I replied. \"Come on, can't I just borrow a pair of pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not the same size, it wouldn't fit right. And it won't be so bad, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" I said, sarcastically. \"I'll just get laughed at by everyone who sees me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're exaggerating, Ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe they won't laugh, but they'll still comment on it, and it'll be awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took another look at my rapidly dwindling pile of clean clothes. It had gotten to the points where I didn't have any pants left to wear, so I'd have to wear a skirt. I knew I'd regret letting Melissa buy these. It seems like every day I get drawn a little further into femininity. Not much I can do about it, I guess. With Melissa clearly not inclined to help, I'll have no choice but to wear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you win, I'll wear a skirt. You happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to stop making such a big deal out of everything, Ally. You'll be much happier if you stop worrying about what people think of you. I'll let you get dressed, now. Just hurry it up a little, I'm gonna be late for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI settled on a denim skirt and a black t-shirt, and soon we were on our way to school. Once there, I half expected everyone to look at me and simultaneously burst out laughing, but of course it didn't happen. Why would they? My short lived celebrity had faded within the week, and now I was back to being just another high school kid. No one cared what I was wearing... and yet I still couldn't get the fact that I was in a skirt out of my head. It felt different than pants, and it kept bugging me throughout the day. I managed to deal with it until lunch break, when I had someone to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Ally,\" said Eric. \"It's been a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We talked yesterday,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was on the phone. It doesn't count as a real conversation. I haven't seen you since last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both sat in the staircase, which was located at the opposite side of the school from the cafeteria. A favorite spot of ours when we wanted to eat lunch without the ambient noise. It had been a while since I sat here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's Patrick doing?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. He didn't say anything about you... Why are you wearing a skirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it. I knew it would happen eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault. Well, it is, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only thing you had left?\" he asked, interrupting me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, not important. I don't know why you make such a big deal out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't... I don't make a big deal out of it! I didn't even mention it! And why did you ask me if it's not important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep looking at it and tugging it down. Looks like it makes you uncomfortable. I was just wondering why you're wearing it if you don't like it. But it makes sense if you just didn't have anything else, so it's not important. Anyway, back to Patrick: he didn't say anything about you, but he doesn't talk much these days. It's like he's constantly in a bad mood. I told him he should talk to you, but he doesn't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think I should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should talk to him,\u201d Eric deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After what he said to me last time? He tried to get involved in my personal problems. Things that are none of his business. I don't owe him anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rolled his eyes, trying to make it as obvious as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I figured as much. But... what did you want to talk to me about, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. I know we haven't talked much lately, and I feel kinda bad about it, so I figured we should hang out sometime. Also, I want you to meet my new friends. Well, mostly one of my new friends. One I think you'll get along with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that? Past experience has taught me that I don't get along with most people other than you and Patrick. But I'll trust you on that. Anyway, how about today after school? I've got nothing then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, how about we just ditch school?\u201d I suggested. \u201cI\u2019ve got PE this afternoon, and I don\u2019t plan on actually going there. Been skipping it since school started, and the teacher hasn\u2019t said anything. Let\u2019s just catch a movie or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat works for me. It\u2019s not like I ever learned anything I class. I\u2019ll just read the textbook later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical Eric. How that guy isn\u2019t failing is beyond me. Then again, he always gets better grades than I do. I looked down and noticed that I hadn\u2019t even touched my lunch yet, despite being awfully hungry. I quickly gobbled my sandwich, after which Eric and I slipped out of the school unnoticed.</span></div></div>",

As the last class of the day came, gym class, I slipped away during the passing period and met up with Eric and Sam at our prearranged meeting spot. It was just an ally where we could avoid the schools cameras so they wouldnt know we were leaving the school grounds to skip class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to the mall sooner than we would have wanted to. But Eric has been known to have a bit of a lead foot. But the movie we were thinking of watching wasn't even going to start for another hour. So, we decided we'd walk around a bit and see what we find. Walking past a video game store, I asked \"you guys wanna see if theres any good new games out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with it\" Eric said. \"What about you Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing taking a swig from a water bottle, Sam said \"oh, I'm more than ok with checking out some games\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her a weird look, Eric said \"ok then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all went into the store together, but pretty soon after I split off from Sam and Eric. I was looking at the newest model of Call of Duty and was thinking of buying it at some time, when I heard Sam and Eric. I looked over at them to see them both laughing about something. Seeing as there was nothing more I had an urge to look at and that I'd unintentionally set something in motion, I stepped out of the store and took a seat on one of the benches outside of the store. After sitting there for about 10 minutes, Sam and Eric came out of the video game store, still laughing about who knows what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I said \"I just gotta know one thing. Whats so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing Ally\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally catching her breath, Sam said \"He's just, so funny. And we even like the same games\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, funny\" I said. \"You were never funny around me Eric\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know I was this funny myself\" Eric replied. \"So, you girls ready for the movie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, what about you Sam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a minute\" she said as she whiped a tear from her eye. \"Alright lets go\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As we walked out of the movie theater as the credits were rolling, I found myself thinking hard about the last two hours. The movie wasn\u2019t as good as we were hoping for, but I was almost more entertained by how Sam and Eric were acting. The two of them bought a large popcorn and drink to share, and they were quietly giggling throughout the movie as they whispered in each other\u2019s ears. While I don\u2019t think they would call it a date, by high school standards it might as well have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us wondered around the mall for a while, occasionally going in a store to look around, but eventually leaving in the very late afternoon empty handed. After dropping Sam off at her house, Eric and I began the short drive to Melissa\u2019s apartment. Along the way, I looked at Eric and said \u201cMind if I ask you a question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d he replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like Sam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh course I do. Your friends are my friends. Besides, she gave me her gamer tag\u201d he said, clearly misunderstanding what I had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant. I mean, do you like her\u201d I said, trying to put as much emphasis on the word like to get my point across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, um\u201d he stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh. You  do like her\u201d I shouted, a little bit of surprise in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s a cool person and all that. Plus we like a lot of the same stuff\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are you going to ask her out?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d he answered. \u201cMaybe. After I get to know her better. Can we talk about something else please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d I replied. We spent the rest of the drive talking about school, namely a project Eric had where he was going to have to do a bulk of the work if he and his partner were going to get a good grade. It wasn\u2019t long before we were pulling into the parking of Melissa\u2019s apartment complex and I told Eric that I would see him Monday at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my backpack over one shoulder, I made my way up the stairs that lead to Melissa\u2019s apartment. It was on the third floor, so there was quite a few stairs that I had to ascend. While I climbed the stairs I thought about what I should do this weekend. Melissa had told me that she planned on making the invitations for her wedding this weekend, so it was probably inevitable that I\u2019d be helping her with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took out the key that Melissa had given me when I moved in, but discovered the door to be unlocked already. \u201cMel, I\u2019m home\u201d I shouted as I walked in. I was immediately greeted by a sight that I both didn\u2019t want to or expect to see, as I saw my father sitting on the couch with Melissa. \u201cWhat are you doing here\u201d I said as I stopped in my tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came to talk to you\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to apologize\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApologize for what\u201d I asked. \u201cFor completely erasing the person I used to be from existence. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to accept that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it\u201d dad replied. \u201cAaron told me what you said at school and I wanted to apologize for how you found out about your new identity. You deserved to be told to your face rather than hear it through a closed door. And I wanted to apologize for all the pain and anger it caused you. You\u2019ve been given an amazing opportunity through this second chance and so far you\u2019ve spent most of it angry with me\u201d. He paused for a moment to see if I had anything to say before continuing. \u201cNow, if your willing I want to take a chance to explain what it is you heard that night\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to explain\u201d I nearly shouted. \u201cYou erased who I was from the face of the earth\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Allison. That\u2019s not at all what I did\u201d he replied. \u201cEvery paper and document that identifies you as having once been Brian is still there. But while you were in the hospital I began the process of having your new identity connected to your old one. Your birth certificate still says you were born Brian Samuels, it will just be in a folder that says Allison now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, your saying that you didn\u2019t completely erase who I used to be\u201d I replied as I took a seat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t erase a thing\u201d he said. Suddenly, and unexplainably, I had a massive urge to hug my dad. I could feel tears forming in my eyes. I had effectively kicked my dad and brother out of my life over a misunderstanding. Without warning I threw my arms around my dad and broke down crying. I\u2019m not sure how many times I said I was sorry for the way I had been treating him and Aaron the past few days. He in turn told me he completely understood given what I thought I knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stayed at Melissa\u2019s for a few hours more as we packed up the few things I had there and said our goodbyes. Once we left I had a fairly lengthy conversation. While Aaron had been keeping dad somewhat up to date with how I had been doing in school, but he still had no idea how I'd been handling the change. Once we arrived at home and brought my stuff in the house I instantly went looking for Aaron, finding him in his room playing video games. I knocked on his door, and once he paused his game and saw me standing in the doorway his jaw nearly fell on the floor. To say he wasn't expecting to see me was an understatement. I was surprised he was as willing to accept my apology as he was, given how I'd been treating him at school. His only condition on accepting my apology was that we get as caught up this weekend on all the video game time we missed while I was in the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us played games late into the night. Sometime around 1:30 in the morning we began getting tired, so I decided that it would be a good time to go to bed. After stripping out of my clothes, I grabbed one of my old shirts that were hanging in the closet and a pair of my old boxers. The shirt was for all intents and purposes a dress on me now that I was so much shorter, and the boxers were stretched out more than they were used to thanks to my much larger butt. But I was able to put that out of my mind as I crawled in between my sheets given how tired I was. However, as I lye there I couldn't help but think about how much more comfortable my bed was compared to the futon I had been sleeping on at Melissa's.</span></div></div>",

And why do you need to keep injecting me with more of the stuff?\u201d I asked the nurse in both anger and confusion. I was a guy damn it! I didn\u2019t want big tits unless they were on my girlfriend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hormones are a part of a series of a new type of genetically manufactured super medicine that is being financed by the government.\u201d Rachel answered as she looked at me with a smile, \u201cAs you know when you came in you were in really bad shape, so bad that the hospital made a deal with your family that in exchange for the right to try the medicine for free they would not have to pay for the treatment and they would allow us to study you to see how the hormones have affected you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 I\u2019m a lab rat now?\u201d I asked not really sure about how I should react to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. We at no point in time plan to inject you with anything else, to do so would corrupt any data we might gain from you, instead once every three days we will take out a small bit of blood to search for any anomalies while at the same time making sure you stay healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that doesn\u2019t sound too bad\u2026\u201d I replied I could understand where the doctors were coming from; they just wanted to make sure that I stayed healthy. \u201cBut still\u2026 why a girl? And why do I need more of the stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for you being a girl\u2026 That wasn\u2019t really our choice\u2026 you becoming a girl was one of the effects of the hormones you received.\u201d Rachel explained, sitting down next to me and wrapping an arm around me in a comforting hug, \u201cYou see the hormones you received was a special regen-hormone that was being developed to help people who lost limbs by increasing the body\u2019s natural growth abilities to help re-grow the limbs that were lost.\u201d As she said this she pulled back the gown I was wearing, showing off my soft legs, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s funny that despite losing your both your legs, and your pelvis, in a horrible crash\u2026 your new legs don\u2019t have any scars on them at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at my legs I had to agree with her, if I wasn\u2019t flat out told that my legs had been totaled I wouldn\u2019t ever think that I had lost them judging by how they look right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are lucky you know.\u201d Rachel said again, \u201cEven with the treatment the doctors predicted that there was still a ninety percent chance of you dying, as most people\u2019s bodies tend to reject this brand of hormone. You on the other hand had the highest acceptation rating for the hormone, at ninety-three percent compared to the forty-seven percent average. I\u2019m not going to lie to you; others have died taking this treatment. I heard one story of a guy whose body rejected the hormones so much that his body lost integrity and he became a blob monster thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 joking right?\u201d I asked when she told me that last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rachel said as she stood up, \u201cAnyway, you are going to be in the hospital for three more weeks, getting a shot of hormone once every three days, while we study you\u2026 after that you will be free to return to your family, but you are expected to come in for a free checkup once a week so that we may record any changes we might observe. There are two reasons why we are still injecting you with the hormones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel held up one finger, \u201cThe first is to help you recover muscle mass, as we doubt you want to spend the next two months going through physical therapy.\u201d She held up a second finger, \u201cThe doctors have also noticed that your body has started to naturally create a diminished form of the hormone and hope to study it to see if it might be the missing link needed to help the Regen-project, the name for the collection of special hormones and chemicals used in the making of the medicine, along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound so bad.\u201d I said, as I thought about what she just told me. \u201cAnd\u2026 I guess I could be worse off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stood up and moved to the foot of my bed, \u201cNow then\u2026 are there any other questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought very hard about if I should ask or not but finally the curiosity got the better of me, \u201cYou said earlier that my breast are going to keep growing\u2026 just how big are they going to get?\u201d I asked shyly while looking away from the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel laughed at that and I felt my face go red, \u201cWell\u2026 first off, your breasts don\u2019t grow over time like a normal girl\u2019s instead you have growth periods were you breasts rapidly grow in size, if the predictions are correct than you should be having another growth period in a few days. So\u2026 right now you\u2019re about a C-cup by the time you leave the hospital you\u2019ll be about a DD-cup, not bad for someone who is only sixteen\u2026 does that answer your question\u2026 young miss?\u201d Rachel said, stressing the young miss part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, leaving me in shock over what she just said, Rachel left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Growth period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three weeks you finally go home.

Waking up in the middle of the night to pee I can't count how many times Ive forgotten to remember to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I received my next hormone shot as they told me of some of the expected side effects. While my hair was getting even longer passing past my shoulders now, the rest of my body remained perfectly soft and smooth. Rachel explained to me that I would probably never have to worry about shaving I would just have to get used to regular body and hair maintenance. They also said my figure might change more as well as the hormones would try to balance out my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  That night I went to bed like normal feeling as well as I could considering the circumstances...Sleeping in a simple pajamas they had given me I rolled over onto my side only to be woken up with a sudden jolt in my chest. I leaned forward in bed from the light pain as I rubbed my chest feeling my breasts as another sudden jolt ran through my spine that made my toes tingle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" I thought to myself. While I hadn't had any real opportunity to...\"explore\" my new assets yet I knew this feeling wasn't normal as they seemed much more sensitive than before. Walking over to the mirror as I turned on the light I wasn't focused enough yet to notice my hair which seemed to be a little straighter and longer than before. Looking at my chest I lightly cupped my breasts taking a deep breath first. Moving them around another jolt of pleasure rushed through me as I quickly pulled my hands away. Rachel said this was going to be a growth period for me so I decided I needed to finally bite the bullet and examine my new...\"friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling off my shirt I looked at my chest as my eyes widened...\"Damn...\" was all I could say in my new female voice as I had to admit I was beginning to look well...sexy. This morning my breasts were light C-cups but now they looked like full C's pushing even a D. They were perfectly shaped, round, perky, with two cute little pink nipples. Running my hands over them I felt how hard they were as I suddenly let out a little gasp, not realizing I had just let out my first female moan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my temptation to explore further grew I suddenly greeted with a sudden pain that hit my stomach causing me to fall over. It like I had just got punched in the gut and like someone pulling my hips out from the inside. I cried out in pain for looking down as best I could past my generous assets as I could make out what looked like lines forming around my stomach would looked like ab muscles...It felt like my hips were widened as well as a popping sound came from my hips. The pain only lasted a few minutes before subsiding, however the exhaustion from the changes caused me to pass out that night on the floor. When I would awake the next morning little did I know this was just the beginning of what was to come...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up the next morning was no picnic...I felt groggy and lightheaded as it took me awhile to even stand up. I almost stumbled a bit as a new weight on my chest immediately brought my eyes down to my two new good friends. This growth period was no joke as they were now at least D's or bigger as I was amazed at how well formed they were turning out to be. However the oddest thing that caught my attention was my stomach as I remembered the pain last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down I noticed my formal stomach had flattened out quite considerably...there was also traces of ab muscles like those of an experienced jogger...My hips also were a bit wider as I noticed I was developing a more hourglass figure. Several dirty thoughts began to creep into my mind as I realized I was fantasizing about myself..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my head I walked back into my room only to be greeted by a man standing there waiting for me....He was tall, wearing a tight blue shirt and grey shorts with semi long dirty blonde hair. He was well built and looked like some kind of trainer as he looked over to me. \"Hello Miss I'm you're new growth trainer.\" He said to me in a deep voice as I was a bit caught off guard not realizing I was standing there were my shirt wide open...My eyes quickly widened realizing I was giving off quite the show as turned around quickly to button up. The man only smiled and chuckled. \"There is no need for that...for your growth massage you will be nude anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around it took me a moment to process what he just said. \"Excuse me?\" I said not really processing his comment. \"Whats a growth trainer?\" The man stood there with a soft smile before speaking. \"Well first you can all me Isaac. Second, my job is help your body adjust to the growth period over the next couple days. Right now your body is rapidly reproducing the hormone we put into your body causing more drastic changes to your body. I'm here to make sure you adjust appropriately and acclimatize well to your new form.\" I turned around looking to him. \"What part of that involves me receiving a nude massage?\" I said in a hot tone as I began to think this was all a hoax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac walked over to me patting my shoulder lightly. \"You can trust me...I'm not here to hurt or take advantage of you. Rachel recommended me as she thinks my special kind of therapy will be better for your body rather than going through any physical training or additional hormone injections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure if it was the hormones or just the way he spoke but something about this guy relaxed me as I sighed and nodded my head. A few hours passed as I showered and dressed in a just a robe and slippers as I was directed to another room in the hospital. Inside Isaac was waiting for by a massage bed as he told me to undress and lay down flat on my back. The nervousness rushing through me at this point was something I couldn't begin to describe. I wasn't simply being nude in front of a stranger, it was also a deeper darker feeling that something deep inside me was telling me that I liked it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath I slowly disrobed and laid flat on the bed. \"Are...are you sure about this? Shouldn't this be done by a woman?\" I asked nervously. Isaac smiled to adjusting me on the bed. \"This is a medical procedure, so it needs to be performed by a specialist, which in this case is just me. Its okay I won't hurt you.\" Isaac said reassuringly, as I began to think that wasn't the thing I was most worried about now...</span></div></div>",

Isaac kept up the small talk during the massage doing a good job of distracting me from how awkward this must be for me. We talked like a couple buddies awhile chatting about sports and TV joking about some of our favorite shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the massage my whole body tingled as I didn't even notice the changes to my body as my hair was growing again as my hips widened a bit and my ass began to fill out more. However when Isaac's hand began massaging my growing breasts I couldn't ignore it any longer...Jolts of pleasure were rushing through my body as I began to unintentionally let out little moans of pleasure. I couldn't help myself as I swore I could almost feel them growing in his palms until he stopped looking down to me with wide eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" I said nervously looking down. Isaac just looked at me before saying. \"You're fine...I just wasn't anticipating such a...strong..reaction from the hormone oil\" Terrified I stood up rushing over to the nearest mirror as what I saw shocked me...The oil had mixed with the hormones causing an increased effect to my growth period. Looking down my breasts were defiantly larger. Full DD cups perky and round sitting from my chest. My figure had turned into a perfect hourglass shape with long legs, wide hips, and a perfect tear drop ass. My hair was now past my mid back touching the top of my ass as it had turned into a perfect wavy sandy blonde color. The oil also had another reaction to my skin tanning it giving me a perfect tanned look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I could think of was how I looked like my own dream girl. I looked like something out of a wet dream or magazine. Even my face had changed giving me perfect features. The only thing that resembled my old self were my eyes, my dark blue eyes....Turning around to Isaac I only looked at him stunned...\"You're perfect...\" Was all he could manage to say stunned himself at what he saw. </span></div></div>",

I slid on the panties and dress as I looked to the high heeled sandals she gave me. I almost refused to put them on but I knew she wouldn't accept no for an answer.

After finding the most modest set of bra and panties I could finally settled down. Food was delivered to me several times but they made no human contact with me at all. I wasn't sure if this was punishment or fear I might try to escape again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was watching TV for most of the day trying to get my mind off things as I found myself more and more turning to soap operas and reality dramas. Something seemed to entice me more about them as I shook my head realizing it was probably just the hormones affecting my head...Passing around the room again and again I began to feel hotter all over...I tried turning up the AC but I was still sweating as I went to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed and I was still burning up...I peeled off my clothes leaving myself totally nude as was panting soon. My dark brown hair still was there or what was left of it after my little adventure with the scissors. Reaching my hand up to brush my hand through it as I did a clump of hair suddenly fell to the ground...My eyes widened as I touched my hair watching as more clumps of my leftover hair fell off. Running my hands through it soon it was falling off in handfuls and in a mere few minutes I had a perfectly bald head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure at this point if I was excited or terrified as my body didn't seem to be getting any cooler I looked down to my hands as I felt a pinching feeling in my fingernails. I had been trimming them since I changed in my attempts to save some partial sliver of manhood. However right before my eyes my nails were growing longer! They began growing out until they reached a decent length as I soon felt a prickling feeling in my head. My now bald head didn't look to be staying that way for very long...I saw new hairs beginning to grow out of my scalp as I soon saw that the hair was a different color. It was a bright platinum blonde color. It almost looked silver as the hairs soon passed my ears I looked down and saw my skin felt so hot. It was getting darker turning from a pale white to a nice tan like I had been laying on the beach all day. My now bright hair was tickling my shoulders as I realized something as I felt my body getting warmer...I was getting turned on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to realize the hormone shot they gave me was doing more than regrow my hair....It was making me more and more feminine as my hair cascaded down my shoulders as it still continued to grow. I was struggling to not get turned on looking at myself in the mirror however my hands were beginning to tremble as I brought them up touching my breasts lightly as I held back a light moan...Thoughts of looking sexy and showing off for boys were popping into my head and what scared me most was I was starting to like it...My hair was now touching the tip of my ass and still growing as I began to cave in exploring my body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all that could be heard from the bathroom was moaning and cries of pleasure as I soon fell backwards passing out as my hair now touched my ankles before it finally stopped growing as fell asleep both excited and terrified...</span></div></div>",

I awoke in a dark room, my panties soaked, my nipples hard, my utterly female body covered in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cried, an utterly female cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came. A nurse brought me food. \"How is my pretty little princess this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you.\" I shoved the food away with my utterly female hand, the massive tits on my chest jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that is quite unbecoming of a pretty girl such as yourself. You have a big day ahead of you. Your training is about to be set into overdrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left me clothes. Surprisingly modest and non form fitting. Loose gray clothing and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lead me into a room with a machine in the middle. It had a visor and cords coming out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to hook you up to this machine. It will assist you in your education.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was forcibly escorted to the machine. They hooked the diodes to my head and forced my blonde head into the visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned it on, and a series of images flashed on the screen. High heels, lip gloss, what I was pretty sure was a penis. After what seemed like a few seconds I was done, slightly dizzy. What did I just see?<br>\r\nThey removed me from the device. I looked down at my body. This clothing was absolutely dreadful! These shoes were totally not cute! No make-up, hair a mess! I felt sick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to lead you to a waiting room for a bit,\" the nurse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lead me to the room. Upon entering, I couldn't help but notice all the cute clothes hanging up. The vanity in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat me down and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes scanned the room. Cute shoes, cute tops, cute skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did I feel the urge to dress up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I dress up or resist?</span></div></div>",

Being a girl might not be that bad.<br>\r\nNow that I think about it, I suppose it was my male pride weighing me down, but I'm still mad about them trying to forcibly change me. How do they think they are?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's awfully quiet today. They're probably backing off now that I'm what they want. Let's take a look in the mirror. I... Kinda like this new body... But... Something's wrong. Shouldn't I feel some attraction to it? Does it mean I like boys now? It'll be hard to tell until I'm out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's this...? Some left some clothes for me on the bed. Oh my, what a cute dress. Let's try it on. Wow, I look amazing in the mirror. So cute. Shouldn't it feel... weird? Why is it so easy? Is it because my male pride was pushed aside? Weird, what's that sound? Are they... Sirens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out the window to find there were many police cars around the hospitals and several news helicopters. I ran out of the room to find Rachel pinned to the floor by a police officer and various other doctors being arrested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officers said, \"You're under arrest for illegal human experimentation. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to remain silent.\"<br>\r\nWhy was this happening? Was it because of... Me? Sure, they went a little far last night, but surely this is overdoing it? I need to accept my new existence after-all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked down the hallway, a police officer taking note of me and escorting me down. He looked kinda handsome. Wait. I was right. I am attracted to men. And, I don't think I mind at all.<br>\r\nHe said, \"Don't worry, we'll get you away from these sick freaks. Scientists like this make me sick, thinking of humans as no better than lab rats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said that I had no rights and that I was their property until they got me a new identity,\" I said.<br>\r\n\"Is that the nonsense they've been feeding you? It's a pack of lies. They say that to every patient they transform to make them into more obedient dolls. Take a look, he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral stunning beauties were escorted out of various rooms, some who had mental breakdowns from not knowing whether they were male or female. Some of whom lost their sanity entirely. <br>\r\nI was absolutely horrified at the sight, as I could have been one of the lunatics raving ceaselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What they do is brainwash their patients to the point where they're so happy with their new selves that they don't tell anyone what's up. As for the ones they fail in brainwashing, they quietly kill them off and say that they couldn't survive the procedure due to compatibility or some nonsense,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took me down the stairs into a small police car and drove down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" I asked. And he replied, \"The nearest police station. Your father is waiting for you there, he already knows about the situation. We might also need you to testify in court once we file the case against them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in a remote corner of the hospital, a figure sat in a sports car, talking to someone on the phone. He said, \"Yes, our tip off worked just as expected. We exposed the hospital's wrongdoings, so the police came in to investigate. After the police seize the data as evidence, we'll steal it from them and use it to beat our competitors. Umbrella Corporation will reign supreme in this field,\" he explained and his boss was extremely pleased.</span></div></div>",

Dad had decided that since I was a girl now, Aaron and I should have our own rooms, and as such had decided to buy a house. He already had the money for it, putting down a sixty percent down payment on the thing, but had never had the heart to because mom had left, instead thinking that the apartment that the three of us all shared was good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is our new house.\u201d I stated as I looked at the impressive looking two story building, while secretly wishing that I could pull the strawberry-patterned silk panties that Rachel had got me, out of my crack but feeling far too self-conscious to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, being the only girl I could talk to at the time had volunteered herself in the task of getting me some fitting clothes. My father and I, not knowing the first thing about woman\u2019s clothes, had of course accepted her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI later learned my mistake when she brought my first new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got me a tight, blue V-neck t-shirt that showed off some nice cleavage, the strawberry panties and a matching white DD-cup bra, a pair of very tight short shorts. Due to the fact that summer was right around the corner I could see why she bought me a pair, I don\u2019t think I would have the ability to by something like that yet. Finally she got me a packet of socks and a pair of woman\u2019s jogging shoes. The outfit was what many would call sexy looking\u2026 I just thought that it was embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed as I looked down at my chest. Rachel had been right about the growth period as two days after I woke up I started feeling a horrible pain in my gut that quickly spread through my body, it was so bad that I ended up falling to the ground in pain as tears came out of my face and a scream through my mouth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn the end they had to drug me and put me under before I did something that could be considered self-destructive\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2026Like trying to rip out my own eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the universe was trying to screw with me, I ended up walking up the next full of energy, as I felt like I could do anything, and, despite my efforts, I couldn\u2019t stop the warm pleasurable feeling that seemed to come from every inch of my body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Or my body\u2019s natural reaction to the pleasure. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe doctors of course told me that this was all normal and that the reason for the sudden pleasure was because my body was creating an excessive amount of Dopamine, a pleasure hormone, to combat and numb the pain I was feeling.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs a B+/A- student I luckily understood what they were talking about after they explained it once or twice. (I might be smart but I was only a few months into my sophomore year when the accident happened.)<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSpeaking of school, I was told that since I missed so much of it, I was going to have to restart the year after summer vacation ended, which meant that I would be in Aaron\u2019s class once summer was over in a few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing I was dreading about school was the fact that we went to a good private school, our grandparents having a very good relationship with the Headmaster, and owner, and were able to get us in for free, as long as we kept up the good grades that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is, private schools mean private school uniforms.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd, like all female uniforms around the world, the female uniform of Charles Redstan's Academy would require me to wear a skirt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was safe to say that I was dreading going back to school.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou coming, Allison?\u201d Dad asked, using my new name, as he held open the front door to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cComing~\u201d I called out with my new voice. It was much softer than my male one, no duh, and I was told many times by people, who didn\u2019t know who I was, that I had a very beautiful voice and that I should take up singing\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2026 Or try and become a model.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know how to react to that so I just politely thanked people before trying to get away.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI missed my friends damn it, only family members were allowed to visit me at the hospital, due to the fact that I was in the research ward and they didn\u2019t want any accidents, so I haven\u2019t seen any of them in what felt like forever, about seven months really.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI walked into the house and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooked around before going out to shop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, try and enjoy the summer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you know how distracting that is!\u201d he screamed back at me. \u201cAnd for that matter, why the hell are you wearing clothes\u2026 like those! It\u2019s like you WANT people to stare at you!\u201d He took a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d I began before I stopped; he had a point after all, the clothes that Rachel had gotten me was a little on the provocative side and while they could still be considered casual for most people, especially for an area like ours where the summer temperatures are always around the high seventies or the low nineties! To most people, I probably just look like a girl who was wearing her summer clothes a bit earlier, not really a big deal. However, when you add the fact that I\u2019m a guy who became a girl due to a freak accident of fate\u2026 to my family it must seem like I\u2019ve become a bit of a slut or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook\u2026\u201d Aaron began looking to the side, \u201cThis has been hard on all of us\u2026 and I guess that I still have trouble seeing you as a sister\u2026 you were in a coma for six months and had to stay in the hospital for one more\u2026 and now you suddenly come home in a new body. A female body! And you look so different then what I remember that I forget that you are my\u2026 sister now.\u201d Aaron bowed his head, \u201cI really am sorry about looking at your\u2026 your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ass.\u201d I finished for him and watched as he looked away again in embarrassment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Playing video games with Aaron cooled what bad blood remained from the spat in the kitchen. I enjoyed yelling at the screen, trying to beat my brother to the best gun upgrade, shooting him down and tea-bagging his space marine character with glorious laughter, all like I was still a sixteen-year old, immature boy, not a curvy, teenage girl some nurses had mistook for a grown woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dad got home, I dawdled in my room, catching up with my friends' lives through Facebook. My name, profile picture, and personal information still listed me as Brian, but I figured I'd change it another time. I'd traded out Rachel's ultra-femme outfit for some of my old clothes, which I begged Dad to bring just in case, they might make good pajamas or something. I wore a <i>Black Sabbath</i> t-shirt that wouldn't fit except my breasts compensated for the thinner torso, and boxers as long as fall shorts. I'd thrown the bra and panties on the floor, and while my nipples sometimes brushed the cotton and stung, it felt worlds better. Rachel told me to wear feminine clothing every day my first month to break the prejudice and help me get comfortable; I wondered what she'd say if I told her my brother eyed me like a wolf. How about those feminine clothes now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround nine I figured I should wash myself. I didn't want Aaron to see me undress or naked so I checked the bathroom lock before disrobing, then turned the water pressure really high so everywhere in the house, you could tell someone was about to take a bath. There would be no misunderstanding, no knocking on the door, saying, \"Oh! I didn't know you were in there!\" and catching a peek of my cleavage. Even I'd grown wary of looking at my body; I stared ahead while undressed and avoided the mirror until I got in the bath. Then I stretched out in the water till only my head was visible. Admittedly, the water tickled my nether regions in a way I slightly enjoyed, I won't stress it too much, but it helped me close my eyes, blow bubbles with my mouth, and forget the day's troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen someone pounded on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" I snapped, splashing everywhere, disturbed from my zen-bath. I gripped the edges to lift myself, but a grumbly voice said, \"Don't move! You can keep washing, I got the keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI settled back in. It was my dad. The doorknob jiggled while he put the key in, then the door swung open and Dad walked in, tie hanging like a scarf on his neck, dress shirt unbuttoned, and specks of salsa around his lips. <i>Good ol' Dad,</i> I thought, <i>Don't change after work, just kick back and watch the tube, eating nachos.</i> I didn't think this in a negative way. I loved my dad, laziness and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind me, uhh... Alyssa.\" He nodded to himself; yeah, he'd said the right name. \"I won't be long, but I wanted to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sank deeper. You could only see me from the nose up. \"Mmhm?\" I gurgled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron told me about what happened with you guys earlier, when you were doing dishes and he, looked from behind--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Dad, I know what happened,\" I said, treading water with my left leg. I refused to make eye contact with my dad; not while we discussed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me he apologized, and you accepted it. I hope you really did, but that's not why I'm here right now...\" Dad took a deep breath. I finally looked at him, and saw he was straining to say whatever he intended to tell him. \"It's a good time to ask yourself, now that you're out...\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, I did just leave the hospital. There's really no need to have bad blood between the two of us so quickly. He is my brother after all. \"Like what you see baby brother?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play stupid\" I said as I turned away from the dishes to face him. \"You've been starring at my butt ever since I started the dishes. I've caught you every single time. So I'll ask again, do you like what you see.\" As I spoke I walked over to him, intentionally exaggerating the natural sway in my hips now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, it's just really distracting. I mean, your butt is practically hanging out of those shorts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" I said as I leaned on the table. \" I didn't chose to wear these. Dad and I are going shopping for more clothes tomorrow, but until then I'm stuck with these. Aaron was clearly nervous, trying his hardest not to get caught staring at any of me. \"Hey, eyes on me\" I commanded. \"Look, I get it. It's been just you and dad for a while now. And then, poof, I come back here as a sister you've never grown up with. And while it bothers me to have people stare at me, all I can ask of you is you get better at hiding it. Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now that that's settled, why don't you go finish studying in your room, and I'll head up there once I'm done here and I'll kick your butt on the Xbox\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seriously doubt that. I've gotten a ton better sense you were admitted to the hospital\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be the judge of that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me all of maybe 15 minutes to finish the rest of the dishes. I quickly made my way up to Aaron's room, although I had to stop at the mirror in the hall. He had been right, my butt was practically falling out of these shorts. I didn't dwell on it for long though because I knew I needed to do something normal just as much as he did. The two of us spent the next few hours until dad got home killing each other on the Xbox. And while Aaron was right when he said he was better now, I still beat him in every match. Once dad got home though he made us shut down the Xbox, so we watched a couple of the new Marvel movies so I could catch up with what had happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, those were some really good movies\" I said once the last end credit scene had played. \"Wish I could have seen it in theaters\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it wasn't the same watching them without you\" dad added. \"Why don't the two of you turn in now. We have a long day of shopping ahead of us tomorrow\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I set my alarm to go off at 7:00 because my dad wanted to get to the mall early and beat the crowds. Waking up in my bed for the first time in 6 months, I found myself wishing I could just stay here. But I knew that wouldn\u2019t happen, since I only had 1 girl outfit to my name. After washing my face and getting dressed, I went downstairs to find that Aaron and Dad already awake and eating breakfast. Seeing me, Dad said, \u201cGood morning, Allison. How did you sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess. It was nice to be able to sleep in my own bed again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s good to hear. Have some breakfast and we\u2019ll leave shortly.\u201d Dad said before getting up and putting his cereal bowl in the sink and heading to his room. Aaron and I talked for a few minutes until we both finished our breakfast and went to our rooms. I was on my computer for only a few minutes before dad knocked on my door to see if I was ready, which I was. And before we knew it Aaron, dad, and myself were driving to the mall. After the short drive we pulled into the mall parking lot. Luckily we got a really good parking spot because we were some of the first ones there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking in the mall, the 3 of us made our way to Sears. Once we got there, we decided the first stop should be the underwear section. Best to get the most uncomfortable part over with first. As we looked through selection of bras to find ones that fit, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder who was more embarrassed by the present situation. Me, my brother, or my dad. It didn\u2019t take long to realize that dad was the most embarrassed, due to having to buy bras and other woman\u2019s clothes for his former son. After we found out what size we needed and picked out about 15 different bras that fit, we moved on to panties. Once we had the same amount as bras picked out we purchased them and dropped them off in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked back into Sears to look for clothes we heard a girl behind us say \"Aaron, Aaron is that you? And, and Brian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned around to see Kelly O\u2019Rourke and Samantha Paterson walking up behind us. \"Kelly?\" Aaron said. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam and I are shopping with my mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you hear about me? My dad said nobody knew\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\" Sam asked. \"We're in high school. Something like a student getting hit by a car is bound to get out. So how have you been holding up Brian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its been hard. And its Allison now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 5 of us continued talking for a few more minutes until Kelly's mom joined us. It was then that I could tell that Aaron was getting a little nervous standing there and talking with his crush so I said \"Well, we should get going. We have to buy me new clothes so we should get back to that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you join us?\" Kelly's mom suggested. \"I'm sure the girls would love to help you with finding new clothes and if your dads willing I love to buy a couple things for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'd love to help you\" Kelly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, dad asked \"Well, whatcha say Allison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they do know more about girls fashion than any of us. A little help could make this go faster\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me\" Sam started. \"There's nothing fast about Kelly and shopping.\" This comment caused me to smile a little, which Kelly and Sam seemed to like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we headed towards the clothing section of the store I caught Aaron walking towards the men's section out of the corner of my eye. I was about to say something when my dad placed a hand on my shoulder and whispered in my ear that while he doesn't expect me to buy an extremely feminine wardrobe it would be nice if I bought a few of the  things that the girls suggested since they were willing to help me out. Then, he went off with Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had been shopping with the girls for about an hour and some change before my dad and Aaron rejoined us, and I had to say I was surprised. I had about 20 shirts right now, and Sam and Kelly had convinced me to try several that I probably wouldn't have looked at had they not been here. As the five of us headed towards the section of the store with women's pants and shorts I handed a few of the shirts to Aaron for him to carry. He sent me a worried look as some of the shirts I had handed him were probably a little bit more feminine than he would have liked, but he decided not to say anything. At least, not yet. After about another hour I had about 12 different pairs of pants or shorts. A couple different pairs of comfortable (not skinny) jeans, and several pairs of shorts. As we were purchasing everything, Kelly asked \"Hey, Allison, have you bought any shoes yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good with these\" I replied as I looked at the gym shoes on my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you have?\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go get you a few more. It's important to have options\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful\" Sam whispered to me. \"She loves shoe shopping. She can spend a whole day doing it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*What do you do*</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know about you two but I\u2019m starting to get hungry\u201d as she looked at my dad and Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you mention it, I am starting to get a little hungry from all this walking around\u201d dad said as he placed his hand on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kelly Sam and I went into the next store while dad and Aaron joined Kelly\u2019s mom at the food court. After we measure my feet and were walking around for a few minutes and hadn\u2019t found anything I liked Kelly said \u201cMind if I say something?\u201d I just shrugged my shoulders, so she continued. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve noticed about all the clothes you seemed to like was that for the most part they were pretty gender neutral. And right now you\u2019re walking around one of my favorite places to shop with a certain mindset as to what your looking at\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I mean is your walking around and looking at everything as if\u201d she said before pausing and picking up a high heel. \u201cAs if it\u2019s this high heel. Your thinking that everything in here is foreign to you and you can\u2019t find anything you like because of it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you suggest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, wait here a minute and I\u2019ll show you what I mean\u201d she said before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think she\u2019s going?\u201d I asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats me. I\u2019ve never been enthusiastic about shopping for shoes. I\u2019d prefer to just wear one or two pairs until they fall apart\u201d Sam said, trying to sound supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t to long before Kelly was back with a pair of plain black flip flops in her hand. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking is we start by finding things similar to what you\u2019re used to wearing. A simple pair of black flip flops are always a safe thing to wear when it\u2019s nice and warm out. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve worn flip flops before\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right about that\u201d I said as I took the flip flops from Kelly. We resumed looking at shoes, and with a new mindset I was at least a little more considerate of what Kelly and Sam (but mostly Kelly) were suggesting. After a few more minutes of looking, I ended up picking out a tan pair of boat shoes. It was something I\u2019d seen both guys and girls wear, although these were clearly made for girls. But at least it was something I was comfortable with wearing. I also picked out a second pair of gym shoes, and a pair of converse sneakers that stopped below my ankles. \u201cSo, you think this is enough?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now\u201d Kelly said. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably need a few more pairs as situations arise\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this is enough for now\u201d Sam said interrupting Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick phone call to our parents and we were paying for the last of what I needed for a new wardrobe. As we approached the exit to the mall I turned to Kelly and Sam and said \u201cthank you both for all the help today\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem\u201d Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus\u201d Sam added. \u201cIt was kinda fun for us. It\u2019s not everyday we get to help someone look for a whole new wardrobe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were about to part ways when Kelly said \u201chey do you wanna maybe hang out with us this weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking of doing?\u201d I asked, unsure of what my answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just going to hang out at my place, probably swim in the pool and just relax before school starts\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, alright\u201d I said. I really didn\u2019t want to go but with all the help they gave me today I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say no. Kelly was obviously excited about getting to hang out more as she gave me her phone number. After we parted ways I asked dad if I could drive but he told me I couldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t have a drivers license. When I tried to remind him that I did he told me that because I\u2019m a girl I need a new license, which we could go get tomorrow morning.</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed like a bad dream; why was I turned into a girl? Was the damage to my body that great? I might have been able to adjust to not having any 'male plumbing' but to be turned into a real girl? My thoughts were interrupted by a female doctor walking in with my dad and my little brother, Aaron. The doctor, holding a large file, spoke briefly with the nurse while dad pulled a chair up to the side of the bed and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sport.\" almost whispering, he said. \"I guess you would like some answers right about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, what did you do to me!?\" crying, I asked. \"Why was I out for six months!?

He had only minutes to decide and signed the papers, allowing me the go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" still frightened, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nanites were injected into several places in your body.\" flatly, Dr Torres said. \"They repaired your body with incredible speed, it was remarkable to watch.\" she then sighed. \"However, I only had minutes to program the nanites that would rebuild your body.\" she winced. \"I accidentally set your gender to female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can the nanites turn me into a girl?\" shocked, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not invent the nanites or the procedure.\" shaking her head, Dr Torres replied. \"All I know is that they scan the patient's DNA and rebuild the body, following that 'blueprint' and the areas we program in to be repaired or rebuilt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when you accidentally set my gender to female...\" turning pale, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Torres gave me a guilty look as she replied, \"The nanites made the appropriate 'corrections'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turned out to be too much for me and I fainted where I sat in the bed.

I turned to see the bed bar up, keeping me from rolling out of bed. After a slight struggle, I managed to get it to go down and threw the covers off of me and saw a small tube running into the gown I was wearing. <i>\"What's this thing?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, I gave it a yank but winced, feeling a twinge of pain in my nether regions. It was then I realized it was something that allowed me to urinate while I was out cold, judging from the urine that was seeping out of the tube. \"Ew!\" tossing it aside, I complained. \"That was in me all this time!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling the urge to urinate, I pushed my legs over the side of the bed and slipped off. I had every intention of simply walking to the small washroom but, having been in bed for six months, my legs immediately crumbled under me and I fell flat on my face. <i>\"Ow...\"</i> I struggled to get back up my arms were not strong enough to lift me and there was nothing I could use to lift myself a little at a time. I turned to the call button and found that it was resting on the bed, far out of my reach, as I was lying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get up or get some help.\" tearing up, I said. \"Why am I so weak, does it have to do with being in bed so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had to be it though that revelation came a bit too late to save me from my embarrassing predicament. There was no way I was going to be found lying on the floor by dad, or worse, my little brother so I used what muscle and energy I had and dragged myself to the bathroom. Being so weak, I did not make it to the toilet, another embarrassment. I managed to reach the bathroom and was glad to see a number of sturdy towel racks, built into the wall. Making use of them, I slowly pulled myself onto my feet and somehow managed to stay on my feet even though the entire event exhausted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since I'm here, I might as well get a look at myself.\" noticing a full length mirror on the door, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully, I got the gown off and turned to the mirror. Staring back at me was a petite, slender teenage girl; a few inches shorter than I was before the accident. I found that I now had fair skin with long soft blond hair and deep blue eyes. Tears began to fall as I stared at myself. \"I- I look like... mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crumbled back onto the floor in a heap, crying until someone entered the room and found me.

I, uh, have to use the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of waiting, I had my very first experience going to the bathroom as a girl.  Once I'd made sure to wipe myself, the nurse came into help me to my bed.  Careful not to grab hold of my breasts, the nurse said, \"By the way, I'm Rachel; I've been your nurse since you arrived 6 months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rachel, it's nice to meet you.\" Pausing, I said, \"Appearances aside, I'm Brian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to officially meet you, Brian.\" Smiling, Rachel said, \"I've heard a lot about you from your brother and father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd arrived back at my bed by that point; with Rachel's help I got back under the covers.  Turning to her, I said, \"Do you have any idea when I'll be getting out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more than a few days; the doctors want to make sure you're in perfect health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was a knock on the door; followed by my dad poking his head inside. \"Rachel, could I speak to my...daughter in private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Kevin; come on in.\" walking over to my dad, Rachel said, \"Be gentle with her, okay?  She's still in shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently watched the exchange between my dad and Rachel; surprised when I noticed Dad giving her an affectionate squeeze on her hand.
