Also, Izzy didn't realize a glitch in the program. Normally when a Digimon gets stronger, their attack power increases and they can say in higher forms longer than before.

Izzy and Tentomon decided with the free time they had, they would spend it on gathering data in the digital world. Since Izzy promised he would stay home and clean the house, he sent Tentomon to the digital world with a camera so Izzy could communicate with him at home.<br>\r\n\"All appears peaceful in this part of the digital world.

He had been fighting hostile Digimon for about a week now.<br>\r\n\"There could be some leftover data from the control spires that could have infected them. But I need more data to confirm. The hostility in these Digimon could also just be in their natural data. We need to make sure it isn't anything serious.\" Izzy said while moving some boxes in his house.

Izzy had picked a huge box with one arm, and if that wasn't impressive enough on it's own, he was taller than Joe and his shirts were tight on his bulging muscles. \"So I was able to install the program into your Digimon last night. I need to discuss some occurrences in the digital world\" he said as he walked into his room with the box.<br>\r\n\"Izzy, what happened to you?\" Matt asked panicked.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" He ask while unpacking the box he was carrying.<br>\r\n\"Izzy, stand up and look at us.\" Matt ask concerned. Izzy stood up to his full height and looked <i>down</i> at his friends.<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Was all Izzy could say. He looked at himself over, at a loss for words on his current appearance. After the shock of Izzy's appearance died down, they discussed what was going on in the digital world.<br>\r\n\"So you want us to go check it out?\" asked TK.<br>\r\n\"No problem, piece of cake!\" Said Davis. Tentomon had already came through the gate before Tai and the others left.<br>\r\n\"You really have no idea what caused your current appearance Izzy?\" Tentomon asked, concern for his partner.

He felt he was too young to move on to boxers, and he liked the feel of whitey-tighties anyway. He lazily ate the chips and drank the soda while watching his favorite cartoons. To his surprise, he had already finished the chips and soda. It had only been an hour and TK typically did not eat that much. <br>\r\n      He looked in the mirror to find that he had a tiny potbelly with a few crumbs on it.

He cleared the furniture out of his parents' room, and he emptied the boxes into it, filling the room most of the way up the walls, with food pouring out the door, and he filled the freezer with the ice cream. He even bought a soda dispenser commonly used at fast food places, and he bought a few dozen refills. He was quite proud of his work, and he was glad that all of the food that he bought would last a while. Even all of that food only dug into half of the money his parents gave him.

Gatomon!\" yelled the four boys as they ran to hug them.<br>\r\n\"How did you find us?\" asked Tai.<br>\r\n\"The smoke coming from the food\" answered Kari.<br>\r\n\"Where are the others\" asked Agumon.<br>\r\n\"We don't know\" said Gatomon. \"Matt, Joe, Mimi, Izzy, and Sora, and their Digimon must be somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n\"What's this food?\" asked Kari.<br>\r\n\"Don't eat that!\" yelled Tai. \"Look what happen to TK.\" She then looked TK over and saw that he was Taller than her now.<br>\r\n\"I'm eating Puggy Apples to get bigger and taller than Matt.\" TK said to her.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about Kari eating them\" said Gatomon. \"Puggy Apples only effect <u>boy</u> Digimon and Humans. It has no effect on girls other than they taste disgusting to us.\" Kari exhaled in relief.<br>\r\n\"You want to help me eat them Kari?\" asked TK.<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" She said,<br>\r\n\"Just remember\" said Gatomon. \"Normal Puggy Apples with only grow the consumer a little bit, cooked will double that. But soggy apples will shrink the consumer a little, and burnt and rotten apples will shrink a whole lot, but no more than the consumer's original body mass.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad there is a way to reverse this if it get's out of hand\" said Tai.<br>\r\n\"You sure do know a lot about Puggy Apples' said Patamon.<br>\r\n\"Sure! When I was working for Myotismon, I was the only girl Digimon, so I had to learn all I could to make sure <u>I</u> would come out on top of guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\nDo they start to feed TK?<br>\r\nOr do we skip to Matt and Joe who are forced to work and a restaurant aross the lake by a Digitamamon because of his tricky co-worker Vegiemon, and Tai, Kari, and (much bigger) TK come to the rescue?</span></div></div>",

He, Joe and their Digimon got stuck working for Digitamamon in his restaurant since Vegiemon keeps messing them up. Burning the food, tripping them, anything to make them look bad. Gabumon was busy serving the custermers, Joe was cooking, and Matt was moving the new shipment of food into the kitchen. Gomamon was lucky enough to escape the work, for now. Every time they try to make a run for it, Digitamamon attacks them, so does Vegiemon. Gomamon had to figure out how to reveal Vegiemon's shenanigans so Digitamamon will let them leave. Gonamon was hiding near the lake, behind the restaurant, in a clearing not too far from it. Looking at his reflection in the water, he saw Tai and the others coming towards him in a swan pedal boat. After the relief of finding his friends, Gomamon explained the situation at the restaurant.<br>\r\n\"So how can we get them out of there?\" asked Tai.<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can ask nicely?\" asked Kari.<br>\r\n\"That was the first thing Joe tried\" answered Gomamon. \"Acually, he was begging.\"<br>\r\n\"Could we sneack them out?\" asked Patamon.<br>\r\n\"No, Vegiemon will know as soon as we try it\" answered Gomamon. TK wasn't part of the conversation since he was eating some Puggy Apples. They had brought them with them, and TK was HUNGRY! He ate only 3, and already a head taller than Tai and a belly exposing his bellybutton.<br>\r\n\"Gah! Wh- What happed to TK?!\" Gomamon asked panicky.<br>\r\n\"He's been eating the Puggy Alpples we got\" answered Gatomon. Tai then had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Tai's idea?<br>\r\nWas it to send TK in the restaurant to distract Digitamamon his his appetite while the rest take care of Vegiemon?<br>\r\nOr did Tai start rapidly eating the Puggy Apples to grow big enough to rip the roof off of the building and grab Matt, Joe, and Gabumon out of there?</span></div></div>",

Takato sat back down on the couch and continued to watch TV. Rika started to love to cook a lot and made sure her family was well fed. Since she had started worrying about Takato\u2019s weight, she tried to fatten him up. He didn\u2019t eat a lot and kept losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTakato, the foods ready.\u201d Rika called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato went into the kitchen and saw a ton of food filling the table and counters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you make all this so fast?\u201d Takato asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have been cooking for my family for a while now and I had a ton of practice.\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato sat down and started to eat. Rika watched him and was happy he was eating more than he usually does. When he was full, he looked at Rika and tried to eat more. He didn\u2019t want to disappoint her for all the food she had made. She was happy that he was eating all he can and doesn\u2019t want it to go to waste. When he couldn\u2019t eat anymore, Rika rubbed his belly with one hand and fed him with the other. When his belly started to vibrate under Rika\u2019s hand as it rumbled as it was at its limits. Takato told his friend that he loved her food but couldn\u2019t eat anymore. Rika kissed him and started to put everything away. He looked at Rika and watched her work. He felt something that he didn\u2019t understand.</span></div></div>",

Takato loved him cooking now and got some of it out and continued to eat. He made sure not to wake Rika so she could get some rest for worrying about him all the time. Takato ate as much as he can and felt his belly getting fuller and fuller. He pushed himself to eat all he can before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, Rika is cute and could cook.\u201d Takato said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika moaned a bit and rolled over on the couch behind her. He checked on her and she was still asleep. Takato kissed her and went back to eating. He loved her food now and felt like his skin was going to come apart if he keeps eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo make Rika happy.\u201d Takato<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTakato, why is all this food still out? I thought I put it all away.\u201d Rika said groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato told her why the food was out and she liked it. She put her friend in a cage and tied him down. She didn\u2019t want him to escape while she spoon fed him everything. She called him a piggy the whole time and made sure he ate everything on the spoon. Takato started to cry as his belly rumbled in protest from all the food. He pleaded for her to stop but Rika kept feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter how much you lead, I will make you a nice, juicy, super fat piggy.\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed Takato\u2019s belly and felt how taut it was. Takato\u2019s shirt was about to rip off so Rika rolled up off his belly. She kissed her friends drum like belly and started to feed him again. Takato kept crying and struggling to get out but Rika had bound him tight into the cage. When almost all of the food Rika had made him was inside Takato\u2019s packed belly, it rumbled fiercely letting them know if he eats anymore, it will explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a good little piggy. When you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll come back to feed you the rest.\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed his belly one last time and went home. She didn\u2019t untie Takato from his cage for she plans on returning to do the same thing tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

She saw that the food she made was eaten and Takato was missing. She looked around a bit before she found Takato asleep in his bed. Rika watched his belly slowly raise and lower with every breath. She put her hand onto his belly and rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wake up. Wake up you smelly PIG!\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato woke up with a shook and looked at his friend. Rika smiled and dragged him back to the kitchen. Takato was still full from her feeding yesterday. He had one hand on his belly hoping he doesn\u2019t burst. She then tied him up in the cage again. Rika looked at him again and smacked his large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you ate everything and escaped my cage.\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t escape and I didn\u2019t eat it all. I fell asleep with it all out and was woken up by you in my bed.\u201d Takato said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore reasons for me to stuff you up to a bigger pig you already are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika started cooking some more food for Takato as he struggled to get out. He didn\u2019t want to move too much so that Rika hears him but he ended up hitting the cage. She looked at him and tightened the ropes on him. Takato gave up trying to escape and accepted his fate. If Rika wanted him to be fat, then he will eat all he can for her. When she finished making all the food, she started to feed him by the spoon full stuffing him more and more. Takato kept eating until his clothes were as tight as they could get on him. Rika wanted to see his shirt and pants burst off him so she pulled his shirt as far down his belly as she could see it happen. She kept feeding Takato until his clothes gave and ripped off. He was left sitting in his cage only in his stretched out underwear. Rika thought he had enough and let her little \u2018pig\u2019 out. Takato struggled to get up but he wasn\u2019t fully adjusted to his new weight yet.</span></div></div>",
