Some powers she already had recognized as her owns. She was able to levitate, although not for long periods of time, she could also move objects with her mind and was now trying to master the spells which would grant her the ability to induce someone else to do as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was no master in any of these spells, so she couldn\u2019t trust on them not to fail if an emergency occurred. That was why her parents had given her a familiar, which she always left at home<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nYes, she knew perfectly that a slime demon was something of the most hard to kill and perfectly capable of protecting its owner, but\u2026having a slime on your shoulder wasn\u2019t just what she wanted to do at her previous school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, she thought, here it will be cool to have one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she waited, and waited. And waited. Until, suddenly, she felt a little tap on her shoulder and, turning around to inquire,  she smiled in happiness seeing who had interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her there were in fact three girls that she knew already, the three of them were her oldest friends, which she had lost when she and her parents had moved to another city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two are twins, even if nobody else could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaihera, a Wood Elf, and Faihera, a Dark Elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaihera is a young elf full of vitality, her lithe body always ogled when walking around, especially for the two large orbs of flesh she\u2019s sporting on her torso. She actually wears skin tight clothes to even enhance her overgrown bust, reveling in the sensation of being ogled at. She has the body, and the brain, of a real bimbo, even though, thanks to her sister, she had really began to become smarter and smarter as of late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaihera instead has a dark complexion, as all of her true species, and an even darker mood. Completely opposite of her sister she has a muscled body structure, with almost no feminine traces except for  little A cups on her chest and her dark purple long hair. More rigidly controlled than her bubble-head sister, she is more often than not the one who places herself in danger to help her \u201cBig Sister\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third one was the one with which Cindy had always best related to. Her name is Namyria, a green skinned plant woman, with a body perfectly balanced with an almost unnatural hourglass figure. She\u2019s  a dryad, which always bring with herself a little potted plant for reasons of her own. Always timid and silent, she relate very well with Cindy for their love of nature and its beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls? You\u2019re coming too, to the new school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCindy!\u201d Kaihera shouted while jumping in place, causing several boys around to fall on the floor due to blood loss from their noses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s, like, so much time I don\u2019t see you, Girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Duh! She wasn\u2019t in this country, Kai. How could she come here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...You see, Cindy? Fai is also happy to see you\u2026She spoke a full sentence!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark elf snarled toward he sister, before acknowledging Cindy with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls stayed there talking and remembering, while unaware of the troubles that were going to befall on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school bus was arriving but, if someone had taken any attention, they would have felt some kind of disturbance coming from it. But all the students were blissfully engrossed in joking, talking or greeting with their fellows so not one of them realized the danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the bus stopped, its doors opened and the driver, a red skinned, clawed and fanged, fella looked at them with a strange glint in its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll Aboard, People! School\u2019s awaiting ya! Wouldn\u2019t want to arrive late?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What seemed strange to some, but they didn\u2019t spoke in fear of being ridiculed, was that each student had to identify himself by saying his name and his nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the students simply thought that the management wanted to know who could make an issue and who couldn\u2019t, so nobody thought of making any issue of it. Nobody seems to notice as the driver took note of everything, placing here and there some strange marks as each name and identification was given to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as everyone was on the bus, the driver smiled to himself, chuckling softly, thinking to his cargo and their final destination, then he started the engine and slowly moved  the bus on the road toward one of the portals that would bring them for, at least, a semester away from home, toward the institute that would have taught them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA few minutes later, after the bus in which the Cindy and her friends were in has passed the dimensional gateway,  the True School Bus arrived at the bus stop but realizing there wasn\u2019t anyone there, it quickly drove off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was seated near her three friends, all of them talking and discussing of the incoming semester at the New School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, anyone knows where it is or what\u2019s its name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d said Kaihera \u201cI don\u2019t know either but\u2026They told me that is on the Moon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKai? Please, don\u2019t believe to whatever someone say to you. It\u2019s degrading for us elves. We\u2019re not all pretty bimbos, like you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls?\u201d Said Namirya  softly, always too timid to raise her voice to more than a barely audible whisper \u201cI heard from my plant that this isn\u2019t where\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019re you, like, calling a Bimbo\u2026err\u2026Bimbo? \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKai\u2026You know I love you. But don\u2019t try to outsmart anyone. You simply can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of the discussion and the pathetic warnings from the Dryad the bus stopped and all the students had to leave and admire their new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe college-like building was huge, almost fantasy like, resembling a castle with turrets and ramparts. Suddenly a voice took them all out of their own reveries, revealing herself in a smallish woman, red skinned and dressed in a tight short suit that left nothing to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhm. Greetings to you all and Welcome to our institute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following months you all will reside here at the Demonatrium High School for the Talented Non Humans. I\u2019m Miss DMentia but, you may call me simply Mentia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to process everything with the correct procedure, my assistants will divide you all in small groups, and lead you to your rooms, giving you also a brief tour of the Institute. You\u2019ll have this weekend to relax and prepare yourselves for your first lesson day, on Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn each and every floors there will be a Floor Representative, a Senior, who\u2019s going to guide you around the institute, giving you advice and directions. Now, Boys and Girls, once again, welcome to DHSST, Demonatrium High School for the Special Talented.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, as the assistants moved through the crowd of students, Cindy found herself alone with five other, confused, students as the assistants led them inside the building, while her  friends were quickly divided as well .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Do you want to follow someone in particular?

She obeyed of course, and went and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short wait later, she was greeted by a buxom red skinned woman, dressed with a complete chef attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello dear, you\u2019re one of the new students eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh oh oh\u2026No need to call me Ma\u2019am. I\u2019m DVour. You may call me simply Vour, all right Sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Ma\u2026Vour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman moved closer to Kaihera, looking at her with a clinical eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, Poor dear. You\u2019re so skinny..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI..I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely you can see it for yourself. Oh no, that just won\u2019t do. After all, you surely know that They recommend at the very least six full meals per day. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do? Really? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman curiously looked at the girl in front of her, realizing that it wasn\u2019t only appearances in her to look like a bimbo. She truly was a bubble-headed bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d She continued \u201cWhy, how many meals you ate at home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree per day\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! You must be severely undernourished. No, I will take you under my wing, dear. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll prepare you a diet that you must follow. You\u2019ll see how healthy you\u2019ll become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, come inside and have some cake, let\u2019s put some health on your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaihera knew that there was something strange but, the woman was so kind and gentle, that her words had to be true. In that moment she remembered her sister words, about the fact that she hadn\u2019t to believe to anyone since she was a bimbo and so, too stupid to understand a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grimaced for a second turning then her expression in a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She thinks I\u2019m too stupid eh? I\u2019ll show her, who\u2019s the stupidest\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she followed Vour inside her room, seating at her table as the woman gave her a huge quarter of  a thick chocolate coated cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere child, start with this. When you finish just whistle to me and I\u2019ll bring you more, while I finish to prepare a more\u2026 substantial meal\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaihera licked her lips as she looked at the quarter cake in front of her. She had rarely the chance to eat something as sweet and tasty as that treat for her mom always had special care in what her daughters could and could not eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo tell the truth, she felt a little naughty, but after a forkful of cake, she felt herself brought to a different plane of existence. <br>\r\nThe taste was divine, the consistence perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly put her jaws to work and, almost literally, gobbled the cake up. As soon as she had finished her mouth was covered in crumbs and smeared in chocolate, while her dress was feeling just a bit too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had barely burped away that Vour was quickly at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you poor little thing, you surely had to be hungry. Since you liked it so much, why don\u2019t you take the rest as well? I think it will take some time still to finish preparing, so you can eat on, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, the girl didn\u2019t care about the feeling of her clothes until she had completely cleared the treat. Only then, she unconsciously opened her skirt button, letting her growing belly to flop onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Vour seemed to appear from thin air, moving closer to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome Child, first, I\u2019ll show you the uniform, then you can have your first real meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai hadn\u2019t the force to counter the request, slowly and helped by the woman, she moved toward a dresser and rapidly changed her clothes. She had to admit that, as strange as it was, it was good to get out of those skin tight clothes and into more comfortable ones.<br>\r\nShe only looked worried when Vour gave her a small bikini thong and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, dear, that, of course, is not your uniform.  But I thought would be better to wear it while you have your meal, so that you can be comfortable. Later on you can put on the real uniform, what do you say? \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai hadn\u2019t thought about it in that way but, she had to admit that it was a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she was wearing the small bikini top, her breast, not compressed from her clothes, were completely covering the visual of her belly, which was slowly, but surely, growing fuller and more bloated as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVour didn\u2019t wait a second to usher her to the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, child.

Here, let\u2019s start with these appetizers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVour left in front of the girl a dozen plates, each one full to the brim of fried onions, friend tomato, fried bacon strip, and so on and so forth. The elven girl couldn\u2019t delay any longer and, while the woman kept bringing her more, she simply dived in that ocean of delicious food, cleaning plate after plate, letting her gut grow larger and larger, rounder and rounder and soon, softer and softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVour looked at the elven bimbo with a satisfied look in her eyes, the hunger spell she had casted on the food was doing its part and, for good measure, she also casted the flash food-to-fat conversion spell into the youngling, so to let the new arrival start growing nicely and not feel out of the group. This girl, however, was something else as she stared at her consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This girl was really enjoying her meal, without realizing yet how big she was becoming. Already her ass-flesh was beginning to overlap her chair, while her belly drooped down a little on her legs and her arms began to faintly jiggle with the extra flesh in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she was something else and Vour couldn\u2019t wait to see her reaching her maximum potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai was having the time of her life, she was enjoying all kinds of junk foods she had only dreamed of, knowing that it was making her healthier and healthier. She grabbed a huge five decker hamburger, easily the size of a round plate and , slowly, she managed to pull it to herself as she began to take huge bite out of it. She couldn\u2019t believe how hungry she was, she would have never realized it if not for that gentle woman of Vour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gulped down another bite of the ginormous hamburger, pulling closer to her a chocolate cake next to it, she promised herself to thank the kind woman as soon as her meal was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDVour, Demoness Vour, kept refilling the table where the now rotund elf was still eating away at her hearth content. The demoness was pleased in seeing such a devotion to gluttony, still was almost sorry that it was only the very first day and couldn\u2019t interact with this new, wonderful, succulent young elf. Almost sorry since she knew that, with an appetite like hers, she would grow to be a much richer morsel if she gave her the time. DVour, lost herself in these thoughts, didn\u2019t notice immediately that the room was suddenly eerily silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and cooed in awe at the young elf, seeing her struggling to reach for the last piece of cake still on the table, which was closed off to her by her own engorged body.  The small elven girl was definitely rotund now, her whole body puffed up by both the hunger spell and her own freed gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you enjoy you meal, my dear?

Still, she turned around and began what she felt like a long trek toward her room, all of those thirty meters tiring her more and more. Not even for a second she thought that before her arrival in the school she would have been able to run there in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally she managed to reach her room and went inside to meet her roommate, which was busy sitting on the bed while eating what appeared as a sort of goop out of a huge bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!

Sheesh, learn some self-control, as I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie turned around and, slowly, rose from the bed revealing her almost freakishly huge hourglass figure to Kaihera, while bringing the strange bowl half full of some strange blueish goop with her. As the red headed Jessie paraded her figure closer and closer to the chubby elf,  the latter couldn't fail to notice that her roommate body seemed tight packed, as if it was nothing more than a water balloon ready to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot an inch of saggy, flabby fat on me. No sir. My wonderful body is just as it was when I came here, still fit and trim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kai watched the seemingly southern girl parading around the room with her overinflated body, she couldn't fail to notice that for every time jessie moved, something inside her seemed to be sloshing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got this to give my thanks to\u201d She proffered the bowl full of blueish goop \u201cI made a pact with one of the kitchen guys, he gave me this goop, that will satisfy my hunger without making me fat, and in exchange he only wanted to come in here daily to watch me.

Help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness jumped and landed on the smooth surface of Jessie\u2019s body, sitting there cross legged watching calmly as the scene evolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp you? Why should I? You\u2019re the <b>D</b>emon around here, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m only a fool, an old fool as you told me long time ago. Well, this old fool still has aces in her sleeves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie had never felt this kind of hunger before so she continued to swallow the tasty morsel between her lips. Even when DFeat was dragged along , and his body began to disappear behind her lips she never stopped, until the entire demon was completely swallowed. Only then, she felt the hunger cease and managed to get back to her consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026What\u2026just..happened..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVour moved and went toward the face of the bloated purplish girl, looking at her firmly in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tried to cheat me of my rewards. You wanted to be an anorexic stuck-up bitch, you didn\u2019t want to be Healthy. So you made a pact with a senior from the kitchen staff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-DFeat?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cYes. Only, now he is inside you. He\u2019ll keep on giving you all of your favorite goop, and you won\u2019t have the possibility to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, dear. Trouble is he was changing you in something else, something he could use in his kitchen. Now, as he\u2019s inside of you, you\u2019ll continue your transformation into a gigantic blueberry, growing and growing until you reach total fullness, until you\u2019ll be ready to pop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you Will pop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie began to cry as she felt her body beginning to stretch larger and larger, as she felt herself being filled by her beloved staple, the goop of DFeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can feel it, can\u2019t you? Your body throbbing from all the liquid, your skin tightening as you grow bigger, your tendons stretching to contain you, while at the same time you can feel them all failing you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie began to cry harder as she felt her body grow to greater heights, feeling her skin tightening, knowing that there couldn\u2019t be much more space that her body could find to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can only end in  one way, Jessie. You pop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026no\u2026please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026There could be another way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Anything\u2026Please\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll remove every memory of this accident from you while, at the same time, I\u2019ll condition your body to be the perfect piglet, you\u2019ll maybe manage to resist me and defy me for some time, but you\u2019ll fall.

Suddenly the door behind her opened and she was pushed away, she barely had time to see a male-ish shadow disappear onto the next floor, when Vour and Jessie arrived to her, the latter one trailing behind the demoness with a defeated look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t come back, or I\u2019ll report you to the Grand Master!

In this explanation she finally understood why they were asked for their names and capabilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe School itself arranged each student to its own best study course, basing their estimation on their students information  database. She felt a little sorry for her sister and her friends, since she couldn\u2019t yet move freely in the school, but Miss Vour pointed to her that as soon as the first month of \u2018probation\u2019 was off, she could readily go and meet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, instead she had to wake up early, at least for the school standard, for she had her first lesson at almost 09:30 AM, and considering the time to spend on breakfast she realized she could be late if she didn\u2019t speed up. She rushed through her meal, eating as fast as she could, and was plaeasently surprised when she noticed that a fitting uniform had been left in her roomr by Miss Vour, with a little note on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good Morning Kaihera.<br>\r\nJust passed to give you your daily uniform, until your name isn't added to the laundry services of the floor.

The poor elf stared at the huge treat with a little tendril of drool coming out of her lips as the Teacher moved closer to her and began whispering in her sensitive ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it may taste delicious but it\u2019s not going to bite you. Have some of it, have all of it. Eat your fill and be happy. Think how happy Miss Vour will be in seeing you so healthy. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final encouragement Kai couldn\u2019t stop herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hands and began taking big chunks out of the cake with her bare hands, bringing morsel after morsel in her greedy mouth, all the while ignorant of how her body was faring. In fact, as per every morsel that traveled down her throat and into her stomach, her whole body seemed to grow larger, while her clothes, her uniform, grew tighter and tighter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer shirt, already at its limits, began to creak as more and more fat flesh formed beneath of it and the same was true for her skirt, which began to be uncomfortably tight. Kai seemed oblivious to these changes, as she was solely focused on the cake in front of her, which, without her notice, began to regenerate itself under her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor every layer she managed to consume, another one seemed to grow right out of thin air, forcing her to try harder and harder to finish it, without never being able to even place a dent on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher looked at the Elf with lust in her eyes.

As she let herself slouch on the chair she noticed something with the corner of her eyes, some kind of unnatural movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her curiosity piqued she turned around only to find herself, face to face, with a huge, drooling and gaping, mouth that was there ready to engulf her in one bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome by terror, she did the only thing she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer loud and shrill scream seemed to pierce the walls around her, but the mouth of DKay stood frozen only for a moment, then it lunged forward, engulfing the head and part of the shoulders of the victim. Kaihera\u2019s vision turned to deep pink walls, a tunnel of some sort, with humid and fetid air that blew on her face, making her choke as she tried to scream. The Elf tried valiantly to free herself from that prison, but in vain as DKay strong throat muscles kept on sucking her in, moving her closer and closer to the gaping hole that led directly to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness was moaning uncontrollably, the taste of that tender flesh was just too much, the elven girl was really a delicious morsel and the thought of DVour losing that prize was just as good. She tried to push her prey farther in, as swiftly as possible but, due to the girth of the same, and her deliciousness, she realized she just couldn\u2019t.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, only the flailing legs of Kaihera remained outside of her mouth, and her body was already under the grip of gravity, being pulled by it toward her stomach, so DKay didn\u2019t worry too much, until she suddenly felt that the prey had stopped descending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes she looked around and began to tremble in fear as she saw the incandescent burning gaze of DVour on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing\u2026to one of MINE\u2026students?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s going to happen between the two lascivious Demonesses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Will DVour manage to save her precious Elven butterball?

Swiftly she pushed Kaihera into one of the desks, and began the tedious work of re-arranging her memories, as to make her think as if she had a long and cruel nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDvour then moved to her own desk and seated, concentrating to appear as calm as she should have been, if the owner of her life hadn\u2019t showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt the shift of time, as the souled beings in front of her began to breathe and feel the shift of time once again. The buxom demoness, a book in one of her hands and the other near the board with a piece of chalk, twirled around and, feigning surprise, looked at the slumped form of the Elf, still unconscious from her original ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classroom had fallen silent, seeing their Teacher and Floor Representative, move down the desks, until she stopped near that foolish girl who dared to fall asleep in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018If only they knew what she has endured\u2026\u2019 thought Vour with a mental sigh.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cKaihera? Are you\u2026Sleeping in my Class!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kai woke up with a scream and, under the confused stare of her classmates, began to cry as if in pain.

Don\u2019t go yet, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students, slowly lumbered and waddled away, in the classroom remained only the Demoness, the hugely obese Nymph, and Kaihera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vour turned once again toward the trembling elf, and began soothing her, while trying to ask her, as gently and politely as possible, what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI..I don\u2019t know, Miss Vour.

As soon as we saw you enter we checked our list and brought to you your respective meals. For you Wood Elf, Kaihera right?,  four double cheeseburgers each with its complimentary of fries and a whole apple pie, which is in the oven as we speak, just to keep it hot and ready for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you my healthy Nymph, instead, there is  your usual dozen fried chickens with their complimentary six pounds of nachos.

Kai looked at Jen, feeling jealous of her Healthy body as the hugely nymph kept swallowing entire burgers as if they were only tiny morsels.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nKai couldn\u2019t see herself very well, but if she could have, she would have realized that she wasn\u2019t so far behind as she thought. Her face was now quite chubby, her prominent double chin was already changing, giving off the hint of a third one coming along. Her torso was much larger than what she had when she had entered the school, with stacks of back fat rolls that pushed her tight bra upward and partially submerging it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer breast were inflating like crazy, changing from the two perky balloons she once had to two jello like flesh sacks which trembled at her every movement and that began to be pulled toward the ground due to the gravity. Her arms and legs were also packed and much softer, her thighs especially were going to touch each other as soon as she would have stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was her belly that had to be the center of attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge, dome shaped, temple dedicated to gluttony, as full as she was it had to be at least beach ball sized and, as more food was shoveled inside her maw, it still grew larger and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uniform had ripped out hours before, unable to contain all of that flesh, leaving her with only some rags that completely failed in covering her undies, which were covered instead with her belly fat.<br>\r\nThe Nymph instead didn\u2019t change that much but, after all, she had entered in the mess hall already at her almost maximum potential. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she now needed a lot of food only to feel slightly sated and the imps were more than happy to oblige the huge quivering form with all the food they could grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two growing girls kept eating, one of Kai\u2019s little helpers noticed the lustful glances that the elf was shooting to her friend body and, feeling joy in serving her, wanted to help her as much as he could. Alas, there wasn\u2019t much food left so he had to come up with a different solution. Slowly he turned around looking for anything that could give him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a nearby table he saw a group of fattened up Fairies, so big and juicy that their wings were now purely ornamental. Under his stare he saw them blindly stuffing themselves at a meal that would have been rather large even for a full grown human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he was observing them, he noticed that some of them were so full that they had slipped into a food coma like sleep, their bodies resembling more a ripe, juicy orange than the lithe body they had to have in the past. Moreover, he observed that the other fairies seemed unconcerned about their sleeping friends, abandoning them behind as they kept on glutting themselves, until they reached the same point of fullness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He made to warn the other imps about that discovery when he realized, from his vantage point atop Kai\u2019s torso, that the huge door that led to the fridge was open and unguarded. It could have taken the three of them less than a minute to snuck inside and steal some of those fattening sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stare moved from the Fairies to the Fridge, as he pondered on his options and on the best solution to help their temporary Master.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whispering to his companions, while Kaihera was rubbing her full and tight gut, burping away to make some more space, two of the imps jumped and moved swiftly toward the table of the Fairies closing in on the two of the first small-ish students that they encountered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two were as similar as they could be, only difference between them was, apart from their eyes color, in the fact that the first one was all belly stuffed, while her friend was completely apple shaped. The two Imps grabbed the weakened preys and, albeit slowly due to their weight, they managed to bring them across the table, toward their Temporary Master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kaihera found in front of her eyes one of her helpers who was gesticulating something, the elven girl while not very bright, understood after a few times what the little creature was trying to tell her and, slowly, she turned toward her friend, which was almost asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh? Oh\u2026yes, Kai?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cum\u2026there is one of the\u2026helpers here. He want me to\u2026swallow something\u2026er\u2026is it safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. They will never\u2026harm you\u2026Maybe he found some\u2026hard candies that\u2026would break your teeth\u2026if munched on\u2026Go ahead\u2026.it will\u2026be worth it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese Elf turned her staring eyes at the imp and slowly nodded, opening her mouth as wide as she could, while looking at the ceiling. She heard the creatures move on her body, as she felt a hefty weight being transported and soon enough something began to be pushed against her lips. As Kai felt the unknown object being pushed she tried her best to keep her mouth open as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of her sight, however, the imps had brought the first ball-shaped and orange-sized fairy just in front of their Temporary Master mouth, trying to let the stuffed creature enter the gaping wet depth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they realized that it wasn\u2019t going to be easy, as the fairy full body was slightly bigger than Kaihera\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t stop them from pushing and pushing until, with a small *pop*, the first Fairy passed between the elven lips and stopped in her mouth. At this point the Head Imp moved in front of Kai\u2019s eyes and motioned for her to close her mouth and swallow, while his two  companion, took positions around her throat, massaging it, trying to ease the passage of the rather big morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kai had heard the small sound she was greeted by a sweet and sparkly taste on her tongue, she tried to determine what it was by moving her tongue around it but it only seemed to her a ball shaped something. As she saw the signs from the creatures around her, motioning to her to swallow the elf closed her eyes and began trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the morsel, whatever it was, was too big for her to send it down in one step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to spit it out when she noticed the Head Imp pushing on her own cheeks and, at the same time, she felt the other two trying their best, kneading and massaging her throat to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Strengthened by this  communal effort she decided to give it another try and, slowly, she began to feel as if the morsel in her mouth was moving toward her back throat. Kai pushed with all of her might, trying to move the big snack until she finally felt it slosh in her throat and finally land in a splash-like noise in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt hilariously happy, as if the morsel just swallowed was nothing more than a bundle of happiness and joy, wrapped in some delicious tasting covers.  The imps gathered around her chubby face glancing at her with an inquisitive look, as if asking if she was ready for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai had never felt better, she still didn\u2019t know what that snack was but, it had been so delicious that she, almost, begged for more, causing a wave of happiness in the imps surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of them remained there to distract her, the other two rapidly formed a chain and began moving the stuffed out spherical fairies from their table to the one where the engorged belly of Kaihera was resting, producing strange grumbling sounds as the food inside of it was being digested and converted into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough almost all the fairies were relocated near the almost stuffed to the brim elf, which was still trying to recover from that last snack. Burping a little, Kaihera turned her stare on Jennifer , noticing that the nymph had fallen asleep and her helpers were milling around watching her curiously, almost as if they were wondering if they could join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai was feeling pretty full and tired, by this point, but still she felt some kind of hunger for those, oh so tasty, snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she really ready to indulge again and eat until full or was it better to stop now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Imps had really done their job for her, asking the support of the other three and forming a quick moving chain, through which they moved each of the stuffed fairies until they were brought to Kaihera\u2019s mouth and, finally, to her apparently bottomless stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost one hour of this the Imps realized that there was only one last Fairy on the adjacent table, problem was that not only she was the biggest of the lot having reached water melon proportions, but it was still awake and eating away at the huge amount of food that she was now left alone with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imps looked upward, toward Kaihera, which was visibly under the effect of consuming many fairies, as she was feeling euphoric and full of joy. Of course she didn\u2019t know that that was a common side effect of digesting fairies, but as happy as she was she could have cared less. She lay on her now creaking chair, stroking her hugely engorged belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even notice the fact that she was practically nude, without counting her bra, which was overflowing breast flesh, and her undies, now practically invisible on the front due to her engorged gut. Still Kaihera didn\u2019t move or ask to stop, she simply lay there too dazed to do nothing more than passively wait for the next morsel.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nThe Imps wanted to feed their Master to the fullest, and that implied that last fairy, but they were worried in regarding to her size and for her lack of a food coma like sleep.  Some of them tried to approach it from behind but, every time they came near her bloated form, the fairy began growling like a feral beast, forcing the imps to retreat in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head imp scratched his bald head as he watched the bloated creature as she kept on gorging on the food she had around herself, grunting every time she tried to reach something that was just too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment the solution to one of his problem came to his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf his companions began to feed the fairy, she would probably let them come closer to her, so much so that it would be easier for them to snatch her away from the table and bring her to their Temporary master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main problem instead, would only get worse. If the little, once flying, woman got fatter, she would have gotten bigger and it would have been even more difficult for them to fit her inside the Master mouth. Still, with nothing better to do he gave the order and the other five imps scurried over to the adjacent table, each collecting whatever left over that had been out of reach to the bloated little woman, offering it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fairy, hearing the scuttling of little feet turned around as much as she could, growling in anger, until she realized that those imps were there offering food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile plastered on her face she opened her little mouth, accepting eagerly those offerings and gulping down whatever was placed in there. The Imps, by their side, found that it was truly easy to satisfy that little master and redoubled their efforts, bringing more and more to the fairy which never refused anything or lost time in munching, seemingly able to gather all the offerings in her mouth and then simply swallow them, helping her form to grow rounder and fatter with every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Head Imp looked at the situation with depressed eyes, how could he solve this situation? How could he stuff that hugely bloated fairy in her Temporary Master stomach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as his imps were so happily stuffing her full he could simply let it go and let Kaihera fall asleep to digest her already humongous meal, or he could ask for the assistance of one of the Waitresses, but those never did something for free.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Temporary Master had already fallen asleep, digesting her humongous meals and those prey\u2019s that had been pushed inside her. Turning around he saw that also the fairy was reaching her fullness, seeing as she began to slow down in her consumption of the food offered by his imps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sensation of a job well done he began gathering his minions to leave the mess hall but suddenly something in his gut clenched in fear. He slowly turned his head and saw that one of the Demons that lived there was watching him intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew them all, they were his true masters afterall, and knew which one was dangerous and which wasn\u2019t. Trembling with fear he realized that one of the oldest and most powerful one was the one observing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDVour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp bowed low to the demoness and moved swiftly to kneel in front of her, his eyes casted low as he waited for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness looked at the scene in front of her, she saw Jennifer Nymph, with her bulbous girth crashed on the floor, in a deep slumber, after what it seemed to be a glorious stuffing for the once lithe nymph. Beside her, a few feet of distance, there was the forms of Kaihera the Wood Elf, her newest addiction  and a prime target for The Grand Master. Only then she noticed that there was also a seemingly perfect sphere of fat on the table, with a pair of partially transparent wings that , surely, were now purely ornamental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of the Demoness focused on the Head Imp, still kneeling in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou. What have you done, here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Imp began chittering in his native language, stuttering with fear as he reported each and every action they had taken to serve the two fattened up young women, adding then that at the end they had also performed a similar service also to the Fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWel, well\u2026Seems to me that someone in this building has some brains and knows his place. A very good job\u2026Fool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Head Imp beamed at the compliment and seemed to stand even taller than he was at the Demoness mention of his True Name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He garbled something about his duty to be performed and began moving away when the sharp tone of the Demoness stopped him in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I told you, you could leave? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you\u2019ve done a good job and managed to please me with your actions, so I will grant you a boon, this time for the audacity of walking away without my permission. Now, are you sure the Elf wasn\u2019t aware of what was she eating at the end?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFool, the Head Imp, nodded vigorously, as he chittered about the precaution they had taken to avoid any kind of issue with their temporary masters. Quickly followed by the rest of his gang, which had gathered behind him as if he could protect them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, I suggest you to pick your minions and go to Miss DMentia Office. Bring her this chit\u201d she said as a small chit of paper appeared between her fingers as she gave it to the small creature.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs she continued, Fool, brought the paper chit to his eyes, while keeping it in both hands questioning quizzically the Demoness for its purpose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis chit is a permit from me giving you free access to the Material World for you and yours. A list of preys will be given to you and you\u2019ll be able to do whatever you wish to your designated prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll have a month to enjoy yourselves and, if you manage to corrupt and / or freak out your target\u2026I will see that it will be taken to you for your \u201c direct\u201d custody. Now go, and leave me alone with my precious students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the imps scuttled away, the demoness turned toward the two fattened up masses of quivering flesh asleep in the mess hall and couldn't keep a soft laught from escaping through her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're growing so healty, my dears.

With a gentle touch she checked how good was the growth of her two prized \u2018students\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer Nymph was almost at her maximum potential. The once almost anorexic cheerleader had turned, under her precious care, in the jiggling and wobbling mountain that now stood before her.  The demoness smiled at the vision of the soon to be immobile nymph, she would enjoy watching her struggle to move, while being anchored to the ground by her own weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yes\u2019 she thought to herself \u2018 Soon the nymph will be ready to be sent to her Grand Master. I just hope she does give her back to me. I would love to have her as my assistant\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she simply turned on her heels, facing the other mound of jiggly fat in the classroom. Kaihera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDvour almost hovered off the floor as she assessed the gain of the wood elf, touching and measuring with her own eyes at the girth of the young bimbo. She  smiled when she reached her conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the Elf wasn\u2019t, yet, the mountain of fat that Nymphy there was, she had also grown hugely in the few days she had been with them. Largely was due to the enchantments she herself had casted on the girl, but there was also this\u2026this gluttony, this unending hunger that young Kai showed during her misadventures, which placed her just below the nymph in the top ten of the favorites for the demoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thought caught her attention. Dvour realized that of all the students under her \u2018care\u2019 these two were by far the best she had seen in that year and the thought of losing them both began to prey on her. Sure, there were many others that were just as ready to blimp themselves up for her but these two were something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that thought in mind she assessed the situation and, after verifying to be literally alone with them she reached her decision.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer Nymph was far too gone to be saved from the meeting with the Grand Master, she had to go even though it break the Demoness desire to see her masterpiece without knowing if it would be given back, or in which condition it would return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kai was a different matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Elf was so new and yet had managed to impress her for both her appetite and her luck. After all she had survived two encounters with the demons who ruled the school without, almost, any repercussion. No, she had to try to slow down the young elf and keep her for as long as she could and there was but one action that she could do. Dvour brought forward her hand, toward the rock hard gut of the elf until it touched that tight as a drum surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She could almost feel the essence of those fairies that were being digested inside Kai\u2019s body and that thought almost sent her over the edge but, she managed to calm herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, her hand began to erupts tiny purple flames, which seemed to dance on the engorged gut in front of her, until they revealed what seemed to be a simple tattoo but were, in reality, the two enchantment she had casted on the elf, to let her grow faster and fattier than what could have been possible. She knew that Her Master would have felt the change but she hoped that offering her the Nymph she could please Her enough to let her keep Kaihera for a while more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDvour dig her purple flamed claws in the elf gut and, as if she had torn away a sheet of paper, the tattoo slowly vanished. For some minutes everything seemed quiet in the mess hall and the demoness was almost releasing a satisfied breath when, suddenly, she heard her Master voice in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Kaihera awoke she found herself in her room, she had hazy memories of what had happened in the mess hall, she remembered though how those little creatures had helped her to grow healthy. As she turned her jiggling bulk in her bed, she noticed suddenly an envelope on her bedside table. Curious she began to rose, sitting in the bed and only then she noticed what changes her body had gone against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she noticed immediately how her breast had grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled when she tried to lift one of them with her chubby hand, smiling in seeing it so big that it was completely engulfing her hand in breast-fat, hiding it from view while enveloping it in its pull by the gravity. Then she noticed, or to say the truth she felt with her free hand, her belly. It was so soft and squishy that another round of giggles escaped her lips as her hand closed down on one of her two belly rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she had really grown healthy under Miss Vour diet, but still the thought of having grown fatter never entered her little mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she wanted only to give her most deep thanks to her Floor Rep. for the advices and for bringing her on the right path to Healthiness.  It was at that moment that, even though she could smell something delicious coming from the kitchen, she remembered of the envelope and, hastily she opened it to read its content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Envelope there were three letters, the first one was signed as \u2018J. Nymph\u2019 and so had to be from what she considered as her first best friend in the Demonatium School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She wanted to read it immediately but decided first to check the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she checked them out she noticed they were both from Miss Vour and so, noticing the official paper they were written on she began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Kaihera, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is with pleasure that, in the name of Demonatrium High School for the Talented Non-Humans, I notify you that, due to recent recommendation from both your Class Representative, Miss Jennifer Nymph, and from your Floor Representative, Miss DVour, your \u2019one month probation from exploring the School grounds\u2019  has been revoked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now entitled to move between the various wings of the school, while wearing the included medallion that certify this approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you, once again, our congratulations,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss DVour, Teacher &amp; Floor Representative of the Health and Fitness Wing of the Demonatrium High School.   \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kai had finished reading she felt ready to explode from the joy and happiness she felt. Not only her Best Friend Jennifer had vouched for her but also Miss Vour!  The day, she thought, couldn\u2019t start in a better way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai was already planning to rise from the bed and see how her old friends were doing when she remembered the other two envelopes.<br>\r\nThe first one, still from Miss Vour, left her with a strange feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a notification that she was soon going to have a new roommate and classmate with a final note that she wasn\u2019t sure she understood. Something about saying goodbye to a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second letter turned her strange feeling in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Dear Kai,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m Jennifer and I\u2019m sorry if I couldn\u2019t come to salute you personally but when I came you were sleeping so peacefully that I didn\u2019t want to disturb you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that reason I\u2019m writing you this letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though we\u2019ve known each other for just a few days, I\u2019ve felt instantly a connection between the two of us and I would even be so bold to say that  we could have been the best of friends together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas the time for my trip with Miss Vour  for the Campus Examination test has come and I\u2019ve got to go there to proceed with my studies here at this school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was like you, freshly arrived, I was insecure and shy of everything but, thanks to Miss Vour I\u2019ve discovered a world I didn\u2019t even know it had existed. You\u2019re so joyful and fun to stay with and I hope that you\u2019ll stay that way so that when I get back we can start again with our friendship, wouldn\u2019t be fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a word of caution, there will be people who will try to convince you that you\u2019re something that you\u2019re not or that will try to make you feel useless by calling you with names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust ignore them and follow the advices that Miss Vour will give you. Do that, follow your hearth and everything will be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hug,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer Nymph \u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kai recovered she felt sad for the departure of her friend but still, she was sure that they were going to meet again and so that placed a smile on her chubby face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a low growl erupted from her belly, at which she chuckled before commenting with a \u201cWell, since I\u2019m awake I could go for some Breakfast, I still need to follow Miss Vour diet\u2026.or Maybe I could go and check for my twin and the rest of my friends from old?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With her slow waddle she left her bedroom and soon had crossed the living room toward the small kitchen they had in their apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she froze as she saw who was the owner of that marvelous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing some chairs to help herself up, the improvised cook moved quite swiftly, considering her rounded form at least, between the pans and the raw ingredients that awaited on the counter near the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was none other than the Fairy that the Imps, during the feeding session in the mess hall, had fattened up and left alone instead of stuffing her down Kai\u2019s gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl didn\u2019t remember much of what had happened at the mess hall, in fact she was sure of having gone there with some of her friends but since then she had found herself alone and transferred to another room, in a different wing of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still was mulling on what the two Floor reps had said to her, at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one, Miss DSpair, was her formet Floor rep. and she had told her that in spite of her nature as a Fairy and the abilities she had, it seemed that she could perform better for another teacher. And here came her current Floor Rep., Miss DVour, which seemed to have been impressed with the Fairy culinary skills and wanted to take her under her wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl itself was aware of her capacities behind a stove, for she was usually the one providing food to her group of friends, enjoying every inch of extra flesh that managed to appear on said friends but, from here to impress a teacher? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never known to be so able and so,  she had agreed to switch to the Health and Fitness wing of Demonatrium High school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she recalled those recent memories her hands never stopped moving, preparing a veritable feast until she realized and turned around to prepare the table. As soon as she had done so she found at the doorframe a veritable chubby elf that was staring at her as if mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026Hi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh! You\u2019re so cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai had never seen a Fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew they existed and had seen some of them on the television but, due to the generally reserved nature of these creatures toward the rest of the inhabitants of earth, she had never been able to meet one in person. And now, standing in front of her there was one that, as per Miss Vour Health standard, was well on her way to being very healthy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Thanks? I-I\u2019m Wendy\u2026er\u2026Nice to meet you..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kai wasn\u2019t used in meeting a Fairy, so Wendy wasn\u2019t used in meeting something that it wasn\u2019t one. Sure the school personnel was nice and gentle but it had always been awkward for her to relate with others, and that was the reason for which, Fairies usually traveled around in packs and not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, she was caught off guard when the Elf answered her in a girlish voice, as she moved toward her until she kneeled, slowly and with apparent fatigue, near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re so cute, and those wings of yours? I would love to have some just like them! I\u2026I mean, sorry\u2026I\u2019m Kaihera, but friends just call me Kai. You\u2026You\u2019re my new roommate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Wendy, after the initial surprise, seemed to feel at ease, especially when the Elf moved closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if there was something of Fairies origins into this girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she realized, she seemed a good girl, even if she was a Huge One. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Wendy, wasn\u2019t referring to Kai\u2019s weight but using instead something like an archaic expression created by the Faeries to describe those of Humanoid constitution. Considering also that Kai was the first Elf she had ever seen she thought that her body form was supposed to be so\u2026\u2019fluffy\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and look. I\u2019ve prepared a little breakfast for us to enjoy. It\u2019s not so much but it should help us tide over until we go to the mess hall. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai stared at the table in the kitchen admiring the food that was there and her belly, just then moaned her approval for the idea. The fairy just chuckled and shooing Kai out of the kitchen, began moving the plates from the kitchen to the living room. She had never worked her charms on an Elf before but, if it had worked on fairies, why shouldn\u2019t work also for the other races?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she let her roommate start her pre-breakfast she had to admit that the girl she had been paired with seemed really nice and so, she couldn\u2019t stop from feeling a tinge of guilt knowing that she was going to let this girl grows just for her own pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai awaited as long as she could and, when Wendy gave her the signal, she launched on the \u2018small pre-breakfast\u2019 as if she was starving.  She seemed to enjoy so much the meal that she didn\u2019t even notice the small, but crucial, fact that Wendy wasn\u2019t eating any of the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy was sitting calmly on a chair, awaiting for the space to be made on the table in the living room, in order to move the remaining of the meal toward her new roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf didn\u2019t seem to mind as she kept bringing food from the table to her mouth, lost in deliciousness of the sugary and fried foods that was left in front of her. Only an hour later she, finally stopped herself, feeling definitively sated, if not full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai looked then at Wendy and smile dazedly as she began to unconsciously rub her full and distended belly. The robe, which was barely sufficient to cover her before, now was completely useless as her full belly pushed against the cord that the Elf had around it to keep it closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled and managed to distract her roommate with some small talk, long enough to clear the table from the debris of the meal. In order to avoid for her new friend to find out how much she had been really eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUff. That\u2019s better, won\u2019t you say so, Kai?\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrg\u2026Y-Yeah\u2026Like\u2026*Urp*\u2026Totally\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, let me clean a few things up and, after dressing ourselves we can go to the Mess hall for the real breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai, even though was all aboard with Miss Vour diet to eat massive amounts of food at every meal, was feeling pretty stuffed and tried to excuse herself without appearing like she didn\u2019t wanto to go with her new friend, after all, Wendy seemed so nice and she had also offered her that nice snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well\u2026I-I think\u2026I\u2019ve got some\u2026oof\u2026Some class to attend to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClass? You\u2019ve got class on the week-ends?\u201d said the fairy looking at her with an arched brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai could have given herself a slap, how could she have forgotten that it was already the Week-end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, time for her had passed quite differently than for the others inhabitants of the school. After the massive feast she and Jennifer Nymph had fallen prey to on their first day of actual lessons, Kaihera had been left temporarily suspended in the nursery, as DVour and the Head-Nurse DCeive managed to remove from her the enchantments regarding her appetite and her digestion, while keeping her stable and alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, even though she had done truly only part of the first lesson, for all the others she was already a week old in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe as it may, Kai didn\u2019t want to offend her new friend but, at the same time was feeling quite full and didn\u2019t know if she was up to a real breakfast in the Mess Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she went to her room to change she passed in front of her mirror and stood there watching herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds she began to pose in front of the mirror, enjoying the reflex from the same. She didn\u2019t seem to realize how heavy had she become, as she grabbed her thick love handles and jiggled her full paunch. With a smile on her chubby face she began again the long trek toward her room, where she almost collapsed on her bed, without any breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long hour later both girls emerged from their own rooms, both wearing the uniforms even though Kai\u2019s one was tighter than she remembered.  She dismissed the thought, giving the fault to the laundry\u2019s drier and tried, huffing and puffing, to keep the pace of Wendy as the fairy moved toward the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the truth, Wendy was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure she had fed her roommate all that food but, in the ecstasy of the moment she hadn\u2019t grabbed anything for herself and now she felt an almost feral hunger in the pit of her, not so small, belly. <br>\r\nAs soon as the two entered the mess hall Kai stood on the door wordlessly, while watching dozens of teens  hungrily eating out of huge mounds of breakfast foods. While, at the counters, there were the oldest students which were balancing more than one tray on their fat, jiggling bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls quickly moved through the  mess hall and began to fill their trays with their breakfast. Kai\u2019s was taking only a little, since she wasn\u2019t feeling all that hungry, but Wendy was really outdoing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fairy was grabbing lots and lots of fried eggs, bacon strips and waffles, placing them all in her tray, until the weight of the tray itself became a burden for the shorter humanoid.  Kai, which was following her roommate closely, saw her struggling and moved to help her, remaining surprised at how heavy her friend tray was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still the two managed to reach an empty table and began their Real Breakfast.

But when it was only a foot or two away from the chubby blonde, it suddenly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure could be seen by other students, looking around as if deciding what to do,  without moving forward anymore but instead as if rooted in place.

Right. Wendy, this is Faihera, my little sister. Sis? This is Wendy my roommate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them greeted each other while thinking very different thoughts about each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFai couldn\u2019t stop herself from thinking that it had been fault of the round fairy if her sister had grown so large in such a short time. While Wendy could only think that, not only the standard size for the elves had to be that fluffy one, but that with both the elven girls around she could try and make of them her new pets project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially considering that while her roommate, Kai, was all over chubby, her sister, while being nowhere near thin herself, seemed to concentrate all of her wonderful fat in her badonkadonk ass and her globular boobs, making her a huge hourglass figure.<br>\r\n Wendy was initially mesmerized by the dark skinned elf, she was so strange with her indigo skin and yet, watching her jiggling fat ripple at her every movement was turning on and on the rotund fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaihera was big and was a pretty big eater but, this Faihera had to really be something else. As the two sisters were busy, Wendy let her keys drop under the table and quickly she lowered herself and again she was stunned in silence by the lower body of the Dark Elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much jiggly cellulite, rippling and trembling at her every breath, so much skin pouring over the tight confines of the short shorts she was wearing. Drool began to fall from Wendy\u2019s mouth as she imagined herself swimming in that sea of cushiony ass fat. But as she collected her keyes and rose she found a similar scenery up top. The knockers of Fai were as big as her ass cheecks, if not bigger, and just as her ass they were all composed of drooping, jello-like fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her every movement they bounced and jiggled, as if they were alive and busy in performing a tribal dance ceremony, as if she was actively trying to entice her to jump right in that jiggly cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the two sister seated at the table, eating and chatting together, Wendy began fidgeting under the table, trying to decide what to do with the two Elven girls. She had to do something about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sure it will be fun\u2026We could do sleep-overs, movie nights,\u2026what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaihera smiled at the proposal of her roommate, while thanking the gods for a roommate so friendly and supportive to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I\u2026For one\u2026*Urp*\u2026think is\u2026a wonderful\u2026idea. Fai?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark skinned elf was slowly falling in a food coma. She knew she had eaten way too much but, to be near her Big Sister, she would have done it again and again. Still, the idea wasn\u2019t so bad. Afterall, her Floor Representative had given her that badge that gave her access to the other parts if the school, so it was totally doable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sure\u2026*Urrap!*\u2026ugh\u2026.S-Sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, the three girls were in Wendy and Kai\u2019s room, the two bloated beauties crashed on the couch, denting its surface with their heavy bodies, while Wendy was in the kitchen officialy cleaning it out. In truth she was preparing some snacks for the two elves, wishing to start out a routine pattern of constant snacking when they were all three in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she prepared and cooked and cleaned, Wendy could hear the two girls chatting and getting updates on the other one. A particular detail caught her attention and she stopped to listen it, if she wanted to let them grow she had to know everything about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaihera felt full, not completely full but, pleasantly so. In this state she let her sister update her and was truly surprised when Fai actually answered to her, and even more when she kept talking! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Fai, how\u2019s the school treating you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Kai, it\u2019s actually pretty good. The section I\u2019m in has a pathetically easy classroom to follow, and most of my fellow companion are mostly\u2026\u201d Fai wanted to say the truth, that all of her floor mates were stupid bubble-heads but, she didn\u2019t, choosing her words carefully. \u201c\u2026well\u2026very\u2026Cheerful? Sometimes they can be quite\u2026a distraction\u2026but the teachers don\u2019t seem to mind. <br>\r\nActually, tell you the truth, I think I\u2019m enjoying a little bit too much their company\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, apart from the fact that I\u2019m acing every test they\u2019re giving us, I\u2026Well\u2026\u201d Fai looked around conspiratorially, as her voice became lower, almost like a whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone but I\u2019m enjoying the sleepovers with them, talking about boys and fashion and, and stuff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fai confessed her true feelings toward those activities she had always shunned, Kai\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s hilarious! I\u2026I can now tell you\u2026You\u2019re growing into a nice little girl, finally!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kai kept on laughing and giggling, Fai became beet red as her stare began to turn from embarrassment to anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, usually, Fai would start insulting her sister and, as she would reply, the two of them would be bickering for at least a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai was finally starting to breathe again as she noticed that Fai had her hands curled in fists and her head was kept low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly worried she struggled to rise, to get nearer to her sister but, as soon as she had moved, Fai\u2019s head rose and Kai could see the tears streaming down her twin face as she cried looking at her in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFai\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?

Sure, Kai had been cruel for laughing at her but, she had to remember that Kai wasn\u2019t as attentive as many other to the etiquette or manners in general. In addition to all this, the fact that she couldn\u2019t see her sister, quite chubby, face cringing in shame, made Fai to stop crying and move toward her twin, hugging her fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh\u2026it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s fine, Kai, really it is. You\u2019re not a bimbo. You may act as one, sometimes, but you\u2019re not a stupid bubble-headed bimbo.

Wendy managed to restrain herself from straight jumping into them to feel their squishiness, and instead slowly approached them giving to each of them, their own trays with snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, ladies. As I was cleaning, I realized that after all this time after lunch you might be getting hungry so I prepared a little something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth, Kai and Fai, accepted the trays even if for different reasons. Kai was indeed growing a bit hungrier, while Fai didn\u2019t know how to politely refuse. Soon enough tough, both elven girls were digging into their respective trays, it had been enough to nibble a bit on the brownies and both felt as if they were hooked to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai was downing them two at a time, messily covering her face in chocolate and crumbs, Fai instead was trying to appear more polite and gentle, and yet she consumed them at a rapid pace. As the two elven fatties gorged on the food, Wendy made sure to go back into the small kitchen to check how the rest was coming along, but only to return in the main room with two large milkshakes which were left ear the tow fatties for them to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry girls\u2026I\u2019ve got something more coming, Just a few minutes and more is coming\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that the elven girls had both different reactions. Kai, as she swallowed the last pieces of brownies, simply massaged her gut a bit in anticipation, before going for the milkshake left near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore? Good Job Wendy! This was barely an appetizer\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFai instead, seemed to come out of her trance, with some crumbs from the brownie she was eating, still on her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-More!? B-But\u2026I\u2026I mean\u2026I woulnd\u2019t want to\u2026I-Impose..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy simply smiled as she returned into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone taken. Now sit back and enjoy, we will celebrate our first sleepover and, also, your reunion! Double Celebration Party Incoming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the afternoon and for a long part of the evening, Wendy continued to bring out more cakes and sweets, always leaving them nearby the two bloating elven girls, letting them free to indulge in them. Kai didn\u2019t had any problem with that and she quickly filled her plates up to the brim, stuffing herself full of food in the process. Her belly, already quite big and wide, began to bloat out more and more until it ripped the shirt she was wearing. The bubbly elf didn\u2019t seem to be fazed by this as she simply kept eating, muttering something about \u2018finally being free\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaihera, meanwhile was slowly falling prey to the delicious taste of whatever concoction Wendy seemed able to produce. If she was making a fuss about eating at first, she soon let down all her worries and simply let herself being taken by her gluttonous side. Soon enough in fact, as she quite messily had began scarfin down her maw a large cake, using only her bare hands, she began to feel constricted. Without her notice, in fact her clothes were getting tighter and tighter. Until her gown gave up the fight and popped the button that was keeping it closed up to that moment. For a moment she seemed to awaken herself from her daze but, before she could do anything Wendy appeared out of nowhere, leaving on her thighs a huge burger cake thingy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026*urp*\u2026what is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s, Fai, is my very own Burger cake! It\u2019s basically an hamburger made with the size of a cake in mind. Hope you like it\u2026I\u2019ve got a few more to bring out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFai, before she could say anything, felt herself attract immensely by the huge treat. For an instant she looked at her sister and realized that she wans\u2019t going to receive any help from her, as Kai was already munching hr way through half of her own burger-cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stop herself, Fai, soon found herself taking a bite of out of the humongous dish and began smiling in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT was almost dinner time and the two elven girls laid on their own seats completely wrecked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai, was breathing hard, her huge belly jutting out monstrously as she tried to not explode right there. She felt stuffed to her limit, and yet, although she had eaten way more than her fair share, she still could smell the delicious aroma\u2019s coming from the kitchen. And something told her that, no matter how full she could always go for something more. Fai was in a similar heap on her own seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had glutted away all afternoon, eating way more than she usually did and was now feeling exceedingly full and bloated. Yet, he couldn\u2019t say it had been a bad thing. Everything the little fairy had prepared had been delicious and she realized that she was going to miss her cooking as soon as she was back in her own dorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to this thought, as she pushed herself upright, she saw no harm in indulging a little more before gog back to her own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Ehi\u2026Kai...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2026*Urp*\u2026Yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was\u2026wondering if\u2026you were ready\u2026for round 2?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai smiled in hearing those words, slowly she craned her neck and saw Fai smiling to her. It was a good thing that they had made peace for that afternoon together was a bonding experience unlike any other she had ever had with her own sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sure\u2026W\u2026Wendy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy, which had her own fill as the two fatties stuffed themselves full, appeared at the doorway of the kitchen. \u201cYes, Kai?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you\u2026have anything\u2026else? We\u2019re\u2026*uff* we\u2019re ready for round 2\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, once more had to cross her legs to restrain from coming right there. The two of them had eaten all afternoon, and now they were ready to eat even more? It was a feeder dream coming true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sure, Kai! A couple more snack coming your way in a few!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two bloated elves waited, they both soothingly caressed their bloated bellies and body, until they hear Wendy coming toward them and bringing\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This...\"School\" was considered one of the highest achieving places among the entire world. Every student, bad, or good, came out with solid grades and a can do attitude that seemed a little...off, but nobody questioned it. It was considered an honor to be hand picked to join them in excellence. but honestly, that was bullshit to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew what they did. And he didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bus stopped at it's drop off point, students began filing out of the bus, enjoying the fresh air and finally glad to stretch their limbs from the long bus ride. Alex stood among them, his face hidden away within a hoodie. They stood in front of the school gates, which honestly felt like a prison had a three way with a school and a haunted castle, producing this monstrosity. The place was huge no doubt, but the amount of security is what really caught Alex's eye. There was a camera in every corner you looked, and a fence with barbered wire on it covered the school perimeter. The fence seemed to be also electrocuted, but he didn't want to test if it was truly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome future meals- I mean students, to Demonatrium High! Were your needs come first!\" Standing beside the school gate greeting them was a red skinned Demoness. She wore a black buttoned up shirt that struggled to contain her fleshy orbs, while her skirt barely covered most of her thighs. Alex's conclusion? Cougar, or too lazy to buy bigger clothes. Most of the guys, and some of the girls stared at her in lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you all are excited to explore your new home until your graduation! Because I certainly am!\" She seemed a little too peppy for Alex's taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am Madam Elendrum, but you may call me Elen!

Alex wanted to desperately look away, but he couldn't help but find the sight before him alluring. The \"Chubby\" Dragoness wore a pair of tiny shorts that struggled to hold her ever growing hips. Her black shirt, which Alex recognized as an Avenged Sevenfold T-shirt, struggled to contain her belly as the band's name was stretched against her fun bags. Every part of her clothing threatened to tear apart against her growing mass as her body jiggled from her constant belly shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex should probably say something...or maybe give her some time alone.

They are simply the best that the Underworld can offer for your education. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, here we go, in this interactive you\u2019ll find a typical High School setting but in a different kind of world. The world you\u2019ll find is one in which Humans and Non-Humans coexist, almost, peacefully. Sure, sometimes some cheerleaders could end seduced and, consequently, drained of their blood by an hungry vampire, or some innocent bystander could soon find a new home in the stomach of one of the many predators that roam the place, but it\u2019s peace, nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn our case, you should be following someone, male or female, young or old, as it prepare him/herself for a life in the world wide famous \u201cHigh school for Talented Non-Humans\u201d but someone change the cards on the table, for there are many forces who could gain lots of power by enslaving the new generation of Non-Humans, sending them instead to the Underworld Demonatrium High School for who knows what purpose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice will only be yours\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, some rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know it will be an unpopular decision, but it will be required, to avoid deletion and/or correction, to follow the below listed bullets:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tDecent grammar and decent sized chapters.  Chapters composing of only two or three lines will not be accepted, except for special cases as the need to list for multiple choices or for Respawn choices (Example: The main character is a prey and will be devoured), if in doubt send me a note and we will see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tDo not end the story. Keep it going or simply let a Respawn point  be there and start( or continue) another one, if you don\u2019t want to proceed with the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t  No Scat, Poop and any other related fetish involving dirty activities with urine and feces and /or similar, unless is in a <b><u>VERY</u></b> mild manner . A general Slobbines can be accepted but, again, only in a generalized way. Sorry, I\u2019m a devious man with many fetishes but, even I\u2019ve got my limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t  There will be, almost, no limit in growth/gain/stomach capacity/\u2026 as far as I\u2019m concerned but, please, put some effort into it. Don\u2019t let the main character ( or whoever else) gain hundreds of thousand pounds of weight/muscle/ height/...  in just one sentence.  I\u2019m the first that prefer quantity over quality, but even I describe the action, a little bit at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tTry to stay in character or use a justification at least ( example: A bimbo will never fight a monster unless she\u2019s been cursed /hexed to act against her nature). There can be an endless supply of characters, choose the one that better adapts to your ideas or create it if there isn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tLeave always a choice, it is an interactive after all. Do not force the reader to follow your path, give always a way to change or twist the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- This is a fantasy setting, the laws of reality don't apply here. There can be magic, weird ray guns, all kind of fetishes ( as blueberry, shrinking, vore, ...) and whatever comes to your mind (as long as it doesn't break the previous rules), just put some effort into it, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Sex is allowed, just try not to be too graphic about it or to focus too much on it. No gender limitations either, just give a warning if things are going to be Hot in the chapter  ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you want to create your own character in this settng, be my guest, just follow the rules and don't change the main setting/focus of the story.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n- I ask you the favour to not update the first choices of each chapter (storyline 1-1-1-1-1) so that I can keep on updating the \"Real Story\" as I have first envisioned, thank you  :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not the least, have fun, enjoy and I\u2019ll try to keep my Dictatorial Ways leashed.   ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy! <br>\r\n</td>",
