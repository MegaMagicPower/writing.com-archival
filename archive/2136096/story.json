Not today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the Lakeside High School. You're tired and have no interest in being there, for you stayed up almost all night studying for the damned test in English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking you're way towards the hallways, you feel an eerie tightness in your skin and insides. You nearly collapse, and in the midst of it accidentally run into the back of your Ex-Girlfriend \"Kasie's\" backpack, causing her to drop her books. She immediately turns around, and when she finds out that it's you, she gags in disgust, and picks up her books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asshole\", she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't respond, you're too shocked by what had just occurred. Still, you have a class to get to, and decide to pass it off as some effect from your lack-of-sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Class are you going to?</span></div></div>",

She's wearing her Fall Clothes: A T-Shirt, Jeans, and Cowgirl Boots. You don't want to let her down, you're one of her favorites. The Quiz was very brief, your eyelids are getting extremely heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Guys, good luck\", she says as she passes out the final sheet of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the first question, place your pencil upon the test paper, and scribble down a few words. You get that eerie feeling inside and outside of your body again. You can't take all of this pressure and tiredness and stress all at once. You practically pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell has rung, everybody is out of the classroom, and you're still asleep with the pencil grasped in your hand. Ms Brooks approaches your desk, and brushes her fingers through your hair. Immediately, you shoot up from your nap, and look up to see your teacher. A chill runs down from your head to your feet. Luckily for you, Ms. Brooks is more understanding than most other teachers in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't like you\", she says in a concerned tone, \"Why don't you come back after school and finish this up for me, or you could come during your lunch hour, alright bud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, and apologize a dozen times. She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I'm just glad to see that my boots put a little extra height on me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou level up with her. She's right, those boots have put at least 3 more inches on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when will you finish your test?</span></div></div>",

You start working on your test immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, fate isn't on your side today. After a few minutes of working on it, you pass out. When you wake up, it feels like your entire body is sore. You get up and look around. At first, you think you're dreaming, everything, including your teacher, was huge! You stand up and notice that most of your clothes didn't shrink, you're currently in your underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026 where did he go?\" Your teacher asked. Ms Brooks got up and walked over to your seat. Perfect, hopefully you could get her attention. Once she got over to you, you suddenly realized just how much taller she was.

She had her glasses tipped down to the end of her nose as she reads a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lecture starts, and your teacher speaks of wise money choices. Think about your purchases. What joys can they bring you? What consequences might they obtain? After the lecture, you and your class are ordered to place up stands around you so cheating on the test will be prevented. You do so, just trying to get though the class, maybe you'll secretly get a little more sleep behind the barriers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour now in the middle of a test, nobody is able to see you. You briefly fall into a rest, but the shoot your head back up. You drop your pencil, and reach to grab it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" you say. It rolled to the middle of the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on the floor, you reach to grab the pencil, and at this moment, you begin to feel that same exact feeling as you did before you ran into your Ex, only worse. The tightening in your chest and skin is unbearable! You try and let out a scream, however your vocal cords feel as if they have shriveled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, the unbelievable happens. You shrink to the size of one and a half inches! The size equivalent to a Lego figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around in complete awe. You know that this is not a safe place to be in. You look around the table (this is one of the stretched out tables that can seat about eight students at once), and see two of the people you know best. Lesley, whose wearing those Birkenstock Sandals, is probably your best bet, for you know her the best. However, you know her enough to know that she DESPISES bugs. Natalie is your second best option. She's wearing black Converse shoes, one of the laces untied. You don't know her as well, and only have had a few conversations with her. Who knows how she'll react? Everybody else are practically strangers to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know your choices. Who'll it be?</span></div></div>",

You pull out your sketch book and your numerous pencils as everybody else gets up and races to each other to be partners. Alexis is also struggling to get her stuff, and by the time your both ready, everybody else has a partner. You both shrug. Looks like you two are going to be spending the next hour and a half with one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you make your way toward one of the empty rooms in the school. As you set up your equipment and supplies, you both engage in conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for Fall Break? Alexis says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just love staying up every night for a test to only fail it the next day\", you say sarcastically. \"Yes, I'm ready for break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first half hour passes, the two of you sit across from each other and both have a fairly good sketch. Your only problem is that you can't get the nose quiet right. You erase, and erase, and erase furiously. Eventually, the paper tares, completely ruining the sketch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!\" you shout, and shove the sketch book out of your sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis laughs, \"If I have a dollar for every time I did that\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even hear her, for the tightness in your chest and skin from before has came back, and is worse than ever. You fall to your knees, groping at your chest. Quickly, Alexis stands up and kneels beside you, her hands shaking as she places them on your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on? What's happening!\" she asks hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unable to answer. You see your very hands getting smaller. Your insides shift from one place to the other and your bones and flesh begin to feel as if they're melting. Before you know it your the size of an action figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain has gone away.

I won't hurt you honey, I just- I, I'm shocked. I don't know what to make of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" you ask. You're eager for an answer for whatever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I don't know. Your the size of one of my old Ken dolls\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis you've got to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis sits down. The sound of her buttocks hitting the floor is comparable to the sound of an earthquake. She begins to sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, It's fine, it's fine. I'm fine, Alexis\", you say. You go up to her foot and pat it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\", she says, \"I'm not good under stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let anyone see me like this\", you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", she starts, \"I have an old dollhouse in my basement you could use, is that fine with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Oh God yes Alexis thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wipes her tears, and holds her hand out for you to step onto. You do just that, and she raises you up to her eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she says, \"Your pretty good at Chemistry right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay at it\", you tell her, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can help me out with a little test I'm taking?\" Alexis asks, \"I'll give you a little treat if you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?</span></div></div>",
