Only uninhabited planets and ruins of ancient civilizations. In the midst of this rush for colonization, many Earth Corporation have sent their fleets to the most obscure sectors of the universe, each trying to find something that could help them in beating their adversaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are one of the billions of people who work for the largest of these corporations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Weighland-Youthani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Corporation had been one of the largest and richest in the entire universe but, after a drastic failure in the Robotic Market, due to some issues with their latest Android series, the Corporation swiftly went back to the Colonization Market, beginning anew to compete with others in the same sector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You\u2019ve been re-allocated to one of its ships, one with the delicate task to start the process of terraforming a dead planet, making it able to host human life. The ship on which you have taken service is the Nostromo 101, a large space freighter that is transporting the facility needed to start the Terraforming process. It is a long trip, from the Earth Dockyard toward this unnamed planet known only as LV-4287, and for that reason most of your trip should be spent in Hyper-Sleep, with the A.I. of the ship steering on auto pilot toward your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been assigned to this mission because you\u2019re the best in your field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re the\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being a woman she had to confront a lot of prejudices but she managed showing to have nerves of steel and a conviction made of pure adamantium. Jokingly known to her troops as \u2018Major Failure\u2019, she is a strong woman who does all she can to support her troops, expecting them to do the same. With her short stature of almost 1.5 meters from head to toe, even though she hasn\u2019t an outstanding physique, she might seem innocent enough but, more than one officer made the mistake of consider her an easy target when it came to combat practice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tMore choices\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re still in the Waking room, the circular room where all the tubes are gathered by the A.I. to be woken up in batches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you watch, you see the other fifteen people of your batch, as they slowly begin to rise from the clutches of the Hyper-Sleep. Among them you spot a solitary figure, already covered in her tight yellow suit with black stripes. Just like a wasp. And just like that bug the woman start buzzing around you, checking the automated scans of your body and your reflex, until you finally manage to close your hand around one of her wrist, stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026What\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may be awake but your body still need some time to adjust. The woman smiles at you as she frees her wrist from your clutch and turn toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Well, Chief, seems that the A.I. has woken up all of the high ranking officers. I don\u2019t know yet the reason but it\u2019s no cause for an alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake your time and wake up for good. Then, we will talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply grunt affirmatively as you slowly, push yourself to stand on muscles that have been asleep for the past thirty years. Your gaze cannot leave the figure of the woman, the True Captain of the Vessel, Miranda Goddard. You\u2019ve always found her annoying with her constant cheerfulness but, even you had to admit she was one of the best in maneuvering a freighter of that tonnage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head to clear out the remaining dizziness you manage to stand up and, almost immediately, you begin exercising, doing stretches, sit ups and push-ups. The pain is excruciating, your muscles not yet properly ready for this kind of stress but, you endure it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the pain as a long lost friend as you do your routine to be ready for anything in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later you\u2019re getting out of the shower, your toned body glistening with the cold water you have used to wash you clean. As you dress yourself with your officer suit you feel pride and shame at the same time. As you dress you can\u2019t stop remembering the time when you were a Colonial Marine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure you knew you were harsh toward your soldiers but, after your training all of them were perfect killing machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Of course, you thought, there could have been a couple of deaths during the training but, to have the best you had to take out the weak, hadn\u2019t you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you were dismissed from the army.

As you looked around you noticed to be the last one in and so began moving toward the origin of the sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got nearer you couldn\u2019t refrain from identifying the moans coming from the shower stall as cry of lust. Feeling angry with yourself for having thought that something was actually happening you made to turn around and exit the room when, behind you, another cry emerged from the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back you decided you had enough, if they were actually doing something in there you would have stopped them, as in violation of the regulation on board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they weren\u2019t, you would have finally understood what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping near the shower stall you knocked politely on the door and addressed whoever was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecurity Check. Identify yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard some agitated whispers coming from the shower, until a male voice emerged, stating that everything was normal, no need for any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying it cool, you smirked as you kept the fa\u00e7ade of being just a rookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Sir, regulation have to be observed. Identify yourself and step out of the stall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Rookie, I\u2019m Lieutenant Weighland and I tell you again to get the hell out of here. There is no business here for you. This is a \u2018friendly discussion\u2019 I\u2019m having with this...this 'lady' right here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, scram.

They had debriefed you on tutoring him into a man, while treating him with a glove and giving him whatever he wanted, when he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you could hear the whimpering of the unknown woman inside the stall, probably being assaulted by the Boss Grandson. These kind of situation always sent you in a rage but, in this case any action against the young man would have ended, probably, in you losing the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How could she have survived one of the missions you had endured in your career if she was so easy to break down? How could you trust her to command the ship if a crisis was to come your way?<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, though, you had never been through that kind of pain. That kind of violation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were no fool, you knew that the human body was a perfect  machine and that the will alone couldn\u2019t stop your body reactions if external stimuli were strong enough. You thought about how could it feel to be force to that while, your brain, refused the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would you feel in knowing that as you were repelled in doing something, that same something got your body excited?

As you were there you were pleasantly surprised in seeing your assistant already at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The short woman was already at her desk, organizing the passenger list and checking their identities and their current status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched her single mindedness from the door way you were mesmerized by her composure. It was already six years the two of you were working together as Chief and Assistant, but only in the last two your relationship with her had changed somewhat. Both of you were driven by your own sense of duty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYours toward rules, regulations and orders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHers toward the only family she had ever had, the Army, and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the beginning, when she had been just a private, and you were a Sargent, she was extremely loyal to the Corp. and their officers. But, as time went on, and your training regime became more and more hard, she seemed to understand your motivations, your need of making the training so hard so that she and all the others would have been ready for anything on a battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the day came that you were dismissed from the Colonial Marines, she managed to follow you, as her emotions of loyalty and devotion to you started to become something deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you get out of the flashback, you cough loudly, making your presence noted, as you step inside and sit at your desk. Almost at the same time she stand from her own and bring to you some of the documents and checklists she had been checking earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChief, here the list of the passengers who have been released from Hyper-Sleep and the list with the status of each passenger still in Hyper-Sleep. Also, your new Lieutenant has passed from here. He seemed rather\u2026disheveled for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, there is a communication from the bridge. Your presence has been requested on Deck in one hour, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Rosalita. I guess I\u2019ll go, if there is nothing else\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stare at you for a second, as if she wanted to inform you of something but then says nothing, saluting you and returning to her station, busying herself with what work there is available. As you finish reading what papers are on your desk, you rise and go outside in the corridor, walking calmly toward the main bridge, where a special meeting for the high ranking officer has been called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get there, you see that all the department leaders are present, along with a few specialist, and so you stand near the wall of the circular meeting room as Captain Goddard explain the reason for the meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda Goddard was again in her black and yellow bodysuit, standing near the meeting table as all the officers on board sat around the table, waiting for an explanation of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, Gentlemen, I\u2019ve called this meeting to inform you of a very special situation we\u2019re facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, we are not arrived yet at our final destination.

For almost a minute nobody spoke, until the question came out, slowly and tentative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026Is it grave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFortunately, no. It\u2019s not a damage that pose an immediate threat to our welfare but, if left alone, it could become something more serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I\u2019ll pass the chair to Chief Taggart, Maintenance Crew Leader. Tag?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick Taggart rose slowly from his chair. A round bellied irish man, always dressed in some grease stained coverall and with a small black bowler hat on his head. The guy was always slow and methodical, and had always a solution for any problem related to the maintenance of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, here\u2019s the situation. We have some minor breaches in the external hull of the Terraforming facility. As they are they won\u2019t be a problem, since the Facility itself was sealed air tight for the transportation. So no loss of oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble is if we leave them as they are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now they are minor but they could grow larger with the pression applied from the Hyperspace jump and weaken the entire structure. I don\u2019t need to remind you all that if something happens to that facility, we will be stuck once we reach LV-4287. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I would like to request the waking up of my team, in order to proceed with the reparations. I must say I haven\u2019t yet been there, so I cannot say for sure, but I think at least two to three weeks of works, to get everything done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree Weeks!?\u201d The Lead researcher, Doctor Gene Raspberry, exclaimed in stupor and anger. \u201cWe can\u2019t sat here for three weeks, as the maintenance crew plays mechanics!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to take my place\u201d said Taggart \u201cBe my guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTag?\u201d The voice of Miranda Goddard interrupted the discussion between the Irish and the lead researcher before becoming more physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTag, are you sure you need three weeks? Won\u2019t two be enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to complete the job even one week could be enough. Main issue here are the breaches. If we miss even one, it will create problems later on. I guess we could try with two, pushing a little bit, with some guaranteed overtime\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what can be scrounged up, Tag. Good, if there is nothing else I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Captain?\u201d you intervened.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\u201cYes? Chief Sturm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step forward, as all the eyes turns to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am, Need to request for more of my personnel to be woken up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? I don\u2019t see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s standard procedure. I can\u2019t let anyone wander in the Terraforming Facility without supervision. Depending on Taggart teams, I\u2019ll need at the very least one of mine for each team going inside the Facility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChief, is it really necessary? We will have to use more of our stored supplies, the more people we wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am. But those are the Orders I received from the Corporation. No one, except the selected authorized personnel, can access to the facility without supervision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understand the need for these repairs but, I must follow what orders had been given to me.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, It\u2019s not my job to question you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame issue here. My orders are to prevent access to those areas from anyone, unless their access codes are equal or above Vermillion Security check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as I know, there are very few people here who have those access. And neither of you is one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry, but I must stand on this point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Chief, the entire Facility could be in danger\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that.

Identify yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard turned toward your voice, with the stun gun ready to fire, only to stop and lower the weapon slightly as she recognized your personal protection suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Commander Sturm. Private Jane Kowsky, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStatus Report, Jane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned around, resuming her duties as the lookout, began speaking slowly as she tried to be as alert as she could, while speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fast Sir. It\u2019s darn fast that thing. Team Alpha and Bravo are following it, while Charlie has been deployed to circle the area and prevent it to leave the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019re spread out thin, Commander.  And Alpha &amp; Bravo, are trying their best but they cannot follow it under the walls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Private? Have you seen it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeen it?....Yeah. Was with the maintenance team when it attacked. The guy was just welding the breach when from nowhere this\u2026 thing\u2026jumped from the ceiling and missed the guy\u2019s head for a heartbeat. Still burned through the armor like an acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor fella almost lost his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s some kind of slug, you can\u2019t miss it, Sir. It\u2019s a bright light green beast. Long at most, half a meter. It seems to be responding only to stun discharges. Fire doesn\u2019t do anything to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, still checking each of the corridors in the crossroads, didn\u2019t answer immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe maintenance guy\u2026he tried to fend it off with his welding torch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\nThat slug ran away when I zapped it with my stun gun, though. It hasn\u2019t stopped yet, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking the woman, you took out your stun pistol, basically a small pistol capable of shooting small electrical charged pellets, and entered one of the corridors, trying to out maneuver the alien form as it was pressed from the other two teams from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you proceed forward, gun at the ready, you suddenly are forced to get down, as a couple of electrical pellets explodes against the corridor wall behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriendly fire! Cease fire!\u201d you shout at the top of your lungs, as the pellets starts to get more precise toward your position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay on the floor, trying to cover yourself as much as you can, you think you  hear a muffled sound and a whimper, coming from the threeway crossing behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could get back and investigate what that sound was, but you\u2019ll leave what cover you have and will have to risk to be shot at. Or you could fire in the other corridor, showing that you\u2019re part of the crew, at least, and not the slug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you heard the Flashbang go, you rapidly move and literally grab at the first guy on your path as you tackle him to the ground, his stun gun flying away from his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Between the tackle and the flashbang, the guy is in no shape to say or do anything. Only now, as they stopped shooting, you realize who you have tackled to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour \u2018beloved\u2019 Lieutenant Weighland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, you stand from the ground, accidentally kicking him on the face, as you moved toward your team, led by one of your most experienced Non-Coms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSargent Fulkrum!

We were following that blasted thing, but when we reached the corridor entryway someone called for movement and we all started shooting, Sir. I will take full responsibility, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the man in front of you. Old and yet spry, even though there was more fat than muscles on his body, still he was an experienced soldier, one who would do anything to protect his men. Still, he was far too experienced to let something like this happen. Even with a bunch of fresh recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had happened, though, and that could mean only one thing. He was covering for his own, yes, but also for someone else. Your eyes turn toward the forms of Lieutenant Weighland, still slumped on the floor, as two men were currently trying to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSargent. Inform the men that for the next two weeks, if we are still here, there will be a ban on booze for all. Also, an additional two hours of cleaning weaponry in the armory everyday should give them all the experience they want with their weapons.<br>\r\nThat is all, Sargent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned around you noticed the recruits sending you glares with their eyes, when they thought you weren\u2019t watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fools\u2019 you thought \u2018You could all be court-martialed for what you did.<br>\r\nFor what your unit commander has started.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had reasoned it well enough, the young lieutenant was probably behind all this, especially since he had been firing himself when you had stopped him. Still, you couldn\u2019t chew him out in front of everyone. It would have been bad for the teams for that to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMen who don\u2019t respect their commanders will never perform at their best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the situation was resolved, you sent the Lieutenant away with a couple of soldiers for the med bay, as you took the charge of the teams, and proceeded to go toward the same way you had come. If they were following the \u2018slug\u2019, it was probable that it had gotten away during the little shoot-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the crossway, you immediately noticed the slumped form of Private Kowski on the ground. Her suit burned up to a crisp, leaving most of her upward torso without protection. As you kneeled near her, the rest of your guards, began taking positions around you, ready to cover you and the fallen companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check her for a pulse and you notice right away that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could have stopped it, but there were more pressing needs to be taken care of, so you told yourself to look into it later and put that information away as you concentrated on the situation at hand, while grabbing your radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Goddard?

Situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat damned slug. It pounced on us as we were regrouping. Poor Carlton here didn\u2019t stood a chance.

How could a slug be that fast? But those were idle speculations and you hadn\u2019t time to lose on those in that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Troopers! Let\u2019s get out of here. In five minutes whatever is staying behind will be locked in here for good. We will regroup, reorganize and tomorrow will be back in action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started to move toward the exit,  your eyes fell on the dead body of Private Jonah Carlton, which was going to be left there, closed in his air tight portable plastic coffin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched you seemed to notice some kind of gel around his wounds and you wanted to investigate it but, in doing so you would have to delay the lockdown sequence and that alien bastard could manage to escape the Facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise you had to leave the body behind and try to retrieve it on the following day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

About six months ago, he was given a position as an engineer aboard a deep-space exploration vessel.

The passengers are rocked around, thankful for their safety harnesses, as they ready their minds and bodies for what they will find on the surface below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, that's what you imagine is happening on the small shuttle as you watch it from your vid-screen. You're none too keen to go blundering around on such a remote and mostly unexplored planet. You feel much more at home aboard the Nostromo, surrounded by computers and machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you close out of the video feed and begin running a diagnostic of the ship's inner workings. Knowing it will take roughly half an hour to complete, you decide to head to the mess hall to grab some breakfast. Your stomach rumbles in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival, you find several other crew members have had the same idea as you. A few are your fellow engineers, subordinates on this voyage. Others are familiar to you, but not particularly close, such as the captain and the head of security. Still others you have not bothered yourself with remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a bowl of cereal, you sit down at one of several long tables, occupied only by a pair of men wearing the badge of the Research and Science team: a small green beaker over the Weighland-Youthani logo. Your own depicts a silver wrench over the same background, which you feel mischaracterizes your profession, but you assume that the two scientists across from you feel the same about their own emblem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two are engaged in a quiet but rather animated discussion, which you strain to hear. You are not, of course, in the habit of eavesdropping, but you are bored this morning, and have to admit that you are rather curious as to what the fuss is all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you,\" the first man, young and fresh-faced, mutters to his compatriot, \"The readings check out. This planet isn't uninhabited like the company thought it was! There are native life forms! That's the only logical explanation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other, an older, balding gentleman, pushes his glasses further up the bridge of his nose before grunting dismissively. \"You're probably just picking up signs from the colonists. Trust me, Weighland-Youthani doesn't settle planets unless they're sure they can sell the land to settlers. And no one in their right mind moves across the galaxy to a planet with dangerous wildlife. Even if you were picking up native creatures, they're probably harmless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger man frowns thoughtfully. \"I suppose, but still, we should send a warning down to the landing party. They need to be careful.\" He pushed himself away from the table and stood up. \"I'll go send the message.\" He walks to the nearest exit, his white lab coat swaying behind him, and steps through. The older man turns to regard you for a moment before following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething doesn't feel quite right to you about the conversation you overheard. It sounds almost as though the colonists, along with the landing party, could be in danger. And the look that the older man gave you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it's not your place to meddle in the affairs of others, and it might be kind of awkward to explain that you were spying on them, especially if this turned out to be nothing of concern. Perhaps you should just stick to what you know best and head back to the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe this is worth mentioning to the captain. You're sure that he'd want to know of any potential danger to his crew, and he might be able to help ease your mind about the issue. You could rest easy knowing that he was aware of the situation, though again it could prove sn awkward discussion when you got to how you acquired this information.</span></div></div>",

The elder of the two brandishes his blade. \"I don't know what's going on, but you two need to break it up right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one? How many of you damn things are on this ship?\" With a growl, the man lunges forward, slashing at you. You barely manage to duck as the blade whizzes over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foot slams into your stomach, knocking the air out of your lungs and sending you sprawling. In a heartbeat, the scientist is on top of you, blade pressed against your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you bleed, I wonder?\" His eyes shine with a fevered excitement as he clutches your collar tighter, and you feel the knife pressing uncomfortably into your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clang!</i> The man's eyes roll up into the back of his head and he crumples to the ground beside you. Behind him stands his younger compatriot, metal rod gripped tightly in his hand. When he's sure the bespectacled man is out cold, he extends a hand to you, which you gratefully accept. His palms are cold and sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for intervening. I don't know what got into Gerald to make him act like that.\" He runs the back of his head apologetically. \"Sorry about the trouble. I'm David Finch, from Research and Science, but you can call me Dave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"I'm Scott Lang, chief of Engineering and Repair.\" As soon as you identify yourself, Dave's eyes like up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can take a look at this vid-screen over here, see if you can get it working again. I was trying to send a message to the landing party, but it just wasn't working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance down at the unconscious form of Gerald. \"Shouldn't we do something about this guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave frowns before replying...</span></div></div>",
