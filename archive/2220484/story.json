Oddly enough it was all swimsuit and shoe magazines, but reading is reading you thought, mostly looking at the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you landed you were found by one of the likely many workers the Mine family had and escorted to the car that would take you to your temporary home. A fancy vehicle that looked like it would have cost easily tens of thousands of dollars, the body even seemed to be customized. As soon as you got in the car it became very clear something was wrong. The doors had no handles on the inside, the front and back seats were separated by what looked like an airtight seal, and the seatbelts were just for decoration. \"What's going on?!\" You asked, as a pale blue cloud of mist leaked from tiny holes in the roof of the vehicle. You tried to hold your breath and kick out one of the windows but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't remember how quickly it happened, but clearly you must have passed out because you opened your eyes and you were somewhere else. You were inside a small dark space, blindfold on your face and ropes around your wrists. The space you were in came to a harsh stop, tilted, and then you fell to the floor. A nasty, sweaty, smell assaulted your nose and a soft fabric pressed against your chin to lift your head upwards. A silky smooth hand caressed your cheek before pulling off your blindfold. Immediately you were eye to eye with your temporary family. Fujiko is likely the one who lifted your head as she's wearing her slightly musky nylons and tapping her toes in impatience. The smell is clearly coming from Miko, on the left, since even when meeting you she was still extremely sweaty. She had the decency to change her clothes, but evidently not enough to take a shower. On the right of Fujiko was Airisho, who had nothing notable about her aside from her weight and malicious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up boy.\" The eldest woman began. \"I am Fujiko Mine, my daughters are Airisho Mine, and Miko Mine.\" As she spoke she gestured to her right and left sides respectively. \"You are to refer to us as mom, and big sister. No exceptions. You came here to study and that is what you will do. You will study day in and day out, bending to our every whim. You won't learn anything you came here for, but we will teach you certain skills. We're kind enough to allow you to learn from us to become the perfect...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You've been accepted into a very prestigious program for studying abroad, a family sponsors you and the entirety of your airfare, school fees, school supplies, food, and any other fees that may come up are covered by them before you even arrive. What you haven't been told is the reason it's so hard to get in is because nobody applies. The family finds you and the program reaches out while you're looking for programs in that area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family that sponsored you is as follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFujiko Mine: A forty-one year old business woman who always seems quite cross. She's 5'11, and weighs about two hundred and thirty pounds. Everyday she comes home from work in black stiletto heels that raise her to 6'2, a short black business dress that barely covers her large backside, and nylon stockings that always smell like she's worn them a bit too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko Mine: A nineteen year old college student who is absolutely crazy for sports and athletics. Everyday when she gets home from school she smells like a highschool locker room that's never been cleaned, and is quite literally dripping with sweat. You can smell her on the other side of the house as soon as she walks through the door. Miko is 6'3, and weighs one hundred ninety pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirisho Mine: A twenty-two year old woman who does her college work from home on her laptop. The woman has a serious mean streak, covered up by the family's massive wealth. It's thanks to her that majority of the students the family has sponsored have had at least one cast while in their 'care'. Airisho is 5'9 and weigh two hundred seventy eight pounds.</td>",
