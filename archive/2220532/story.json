            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cliff was just your average 50 year old man. He was 5'10, 200 pounds with a bit of a beer belly, his average brown hair was getting a bit thin and grey up top, and the wrinkles on his face showed he'd lived an average life with the normal amount of stresses a man his age would have. He had a nice happy family with his long time loving wife Hilda, and two children, Nicole and Jackson who are both out of the house and living the college life. Nothing out of the ordinary every really happened to Cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until about a month ago. That night the craziest and most extraordinary thing happened. He was bitten by an honest to goodness vampire who he only knew as Alucard (great sense of humor on that one) who had turned him into one. Thankfully only some of the stories about the creatures of the night were true. Cliff could go out in daylight (albeit he was more likely to get a sunburn), he could eat garlic (although it weirdly tasted like soap now), and he didn't have an insatiable craving for blood (although he did prefer his steaks rare, but that wasn't new).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one feature of the vampires from lore that Cliff had vaguely knew about but never gave a second thought to was something that had become a favorite activity was the ability to change his shape. Sure he'd heard of vampires turning into bats and flying away from danger, but Cliff found he could do that and much, much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his wife fast asleep already after watching the evening news, Cliff began to partake in his new favorite pastime. He took a look at the picture in his wallet of his wedding day and concentrated. Thanks to this vampire magic he body, and even his clothes began to morph. Cliff's loose blue flannel pajamas began tighten up and fit his body as though perfectly tailored. The flimsy pjs began to grow layers and turned into a dark black and white jacket and shirt combo. Even Cliff's face changed as the thinning greying hair turned into their old glory days as a short perfectly combed hairdo magically formed just as nice as the day he first combed it for this day. Looking back in the mirror was a much younger Cliff of 25 years old just about to walk down the aisle. Cliff pulled back the cuffs of his tux and looked at his watch as he said, \"Just over a minute, I'm getting better at this. Now let's go for more of a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at his wedding picture he focused on the beautiful bride next to him. The face he saw every morning and night. This actually made it easier for him to focus on the transformation as he felt his hair turn red get much longer but put up in an elaborate bun over which a white hat a vail trailed down on a white gown that the tux had transformed into. Cliff looked down at himself, he had to admit this next part was his favorite. He was as his 25 year old fairly muscular chest softened and expanded creating the peaks and valley of his new cleavage. His perky C cup breasts were held in tightly by a corset under the dress. Cliff had no idea how Hilda put up with it way back when, but now it was his burden to bare as he finished the transformation by giving himself a pair of white heels that couldn't even be seen under the dress. Cliff shifted himself a dainty silver watch and smiled, \"Under a minute,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff twirled and looked at himself in the mirror. The last month had been fun and all trying to master this new power, but he thought it might be time for something more. He wondered to himself what he should do and where he should go with this new found power.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end Cliff decided to go check on his vampire sire, something made easier when he'd discovered that vampires could sense the one who turned them, as well as those they turn if they concentrate (well he'd discovered the former, Alucard told him the latter). So reaching out with his senses Cliff found his sire, the problem being he was on the other side of a military outpost. Sure he could shift into an animal and fly there, but that would ruin his fun as Alucard would sense him. Luckily the base itself wasn't within range of the vampire's senses, so as long as he didn't use any powers after entering he'd be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind he put his plan into action. Slipping into his backyard Cliff transformed into a swarm of bats, which all took off to a shadowy, sheltered area just before the base. Once there Cliff decided to test out something he'd been working on: shifting between forms without it being some variation of himself between them. What this meant was when the bats swooped into his hiding space, they melded and reformed, not into Cliff's original body, but a variant of his wife, that was more fitting the current situation, a grinning pink haired and braided woman, with a nice sized chest, tank top, yellow camo style pants and combat boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/1535876-leonamax2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/upload...</a>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should do nicely, but now\u2019s the best time to test it out\" Cliff hums as he gives his chest a curious squeeze, then moving to the checkpoint. Luckily with a little effort his ID could be altered to match his current form and he was let through, though it felt odd to be the one getting hungry looks directed at for once. With the face of someone who 'belonged there' it was almost laughably easy to make his way through the area, and move onto the actually hard part, a mild hike. Why someone makes a home all the way out here he'll never understand, but the vampire seemed rather antisocial for the most part so there was always that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way further from civilization the stronger his sense of Alucard became, luckily it was one way or else Alucard would sense him like a beacon and ruin the surprise. He actually wasn't THAT surprised when she found her senses leading her into a cave, it seemed like the kind of thing a vampire his age (whatever that is... besides old) would prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, to enter my domain?\" a silky voice purrs as Alucard appears from inky blackness, the long cape/cloak adding to the mystique, as much as his blood red eyes, which widen almost comically \"Hello my dear, how did you find me? And may I say you have some very nice earings there sweetie, they suit you very much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff giggles, using a low level psychic ability (mostly so the other vampire wouldn't notice) to help him know the best responses to his questions, what she would say \"Why thank you Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome, they were a gift from my husband. I tend to wear them out to show I\u2019m taken, don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m free now do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire chuckles \"True true, though it perplexes me as to how you learnt I was here, I've only been in this region 4 months\" he wonders aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's quite easy, when you can sense your location my Sire\" Cliff purrs, before her features melt away, returning body and clothing into that of Cliff, who was grinning widely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn fledglings, do you know how rarely I get a boner out here? Of course not, but you decide to ruin my day by mastering shapeshifting down to mimicking a human scent perfectly, and decide to taunt me with it. I should just shove you down the mountain for that\" he grumbles, though it was clearly just a minor annoyance rather than true anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,  I thought you'd be happy your fledgling had mastered your most interesting skill\" Cliff fake pouts, causing the elder to crack a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, if you can do more than cheap tricks and mimicry. Can you actually create someone, and make them seem real\" he taunts as a challenge<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff returns his smile and begins to work his magic, once more transforming into a pink haired girl, this time with heart earrings, a darker pink headband and crop top and skirt combo with little hearts on them, topped off with sandals and a plain gold bracelet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://postimg.cc/642139PB\" target=\"_blank\">https://postimg.cc/642139PB</a>]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A child, interesting. Very nice earings my dear, where did you get them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daddy bought them for me cause I'm his bestest girl\" Cliff chirps, letting his mind slip into what works best for his current body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They suit you, I bet your father is a lovely man\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is, daddy works a lot, but he's always there for my piano recitals and tap displays, you know, BIG things\" Cliff explains, waving his arms around widely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlucard laughs, amused by the girl's enthusiasm \"Very good. And not based on anyone, or at least not any one person?\" he asks, as Cliff shifts back to normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just what I imagined a teenage girl version of me would act like, though the hair might have been inspired by my wife, as she had been the last and most common female form I\u2019ve shifted into\" he explains to the vampire, who nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expected as much. You really are quite skilled in the art of transformation, as your sire I am very impressed\" Alucard hums, giving the man a proud smile \u201cSo what are you doing out here with this old man my dear fledgeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly to show off, but also to check up on you, you looked like you could use the company\u201d Cliff replies, surprising the elder vampire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t expect that, usually my fledglings disappear and only end back up on my radar when they don something stupid and nearly get themselves killed\u201d Alucard mumbles which a dark chuckle and sigh \u201cIt is a pleasant surprise to have someone looking out for me\u201d he muses<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

How do you make it appear so effortless?\" Alucard asks curiously, smirking as he does<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, honestly while some initial focus is required, it's more about going with the flow, letting the thoughts bubble away into what works rather than trying to force them into something you think you should say. I could show you if you like\" he offers, transforming into a young purple haired and lightly tanned little girl with a gem on her forehead and a wide sunhat \"This is beachwear Mom got me because she says I look so cute in them, while the earrings are something I got with my pocket money\" she says with audible chipperness, jostling her earrings which resembled blood red triangular gems, which also changed as Cliff alters her outfit to some pj's and a soft coat looking thing, the earrings elongating to a more droplet design \"These on the other hand came from Aunt Beatrice and Uncle Clyde, it looks kind of silly, but they're actually really comfortable which is why I love them\" the wide grin is a lot easier to see without the hat, warming the old vampire's heart as a pure smile that that wasn't exactly something he saw often<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waifu2x.booru.pics/outfiles/4d538a0dfa5fc17682fa95803f627c818d0ecc43_s2_n2.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://waifu2x.booru.pics/outfiles/4d53...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very impressive young one, anything else you want to show me?\" he asks, waiting to see what else Cliff had up his sleeve. Turns out it was a complete loss of sleeves as the last outfit Cliff forms around his girl form was quite similar to a genie, with the red droplets of her earings being held within a vaguely fan shaped golden addition<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was my Halloween costume, Dad says I'm lucky to live here rather than Ireland because then I'd have been complaining all night about the cold, or being wrapped up in a thick coat so nobody saw my cute outfit except these beauties\" she bounces around in her pom like shoes, the earrings jingling as she does so \"Your turn\" she points, pouting cutely when he tries to deny her, until her relents with a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. That pout must be difficult to deal with back home\" Alucard grumbles as he transforms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really after all these years I've more of less built up a resistance to it\" Cliff admits with a shrug<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlucard's current form resembled a blond girl with pigtails in her late teens to early 20's, dressed in matching blue sports attire as well as a shading band/visor and gloves that reminded Cliff of the ones a driver would ear. Blue and white boots followed by blue striped shorts with seemed to be joined to her top, only the darker blue belt hiding whether there was a gap, join or otherwise to the attire. She also had blue, heart shaped earrings and a calm, almost bored look on her face, probably a side effect of Alucard trying to let her thoughts just flow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waifu2x.booru.pics/outfiles/f372ddced02197021867e3d78e3cb67a0f059f58_s2_n2.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://waifu2x.booru.pics/outfiles/f372...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's physically painful for me to do this\" the vampire complains, her calm demeanor devolving into a pained grimace \"I might be too old to learn shit like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, just try boss, you've come this far. What about the earrings, they're really cute an so is the outfit\" Cliff tries to encourage her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh these? They were an anniversary gift from my boyfriend, he has such a kind soul, no idea why he puts up with me\" Alucard chuckles \"As for the outfit, it's the team uniform, well the tennis one, the volleyball team is much more... revealing\" there was a hint of mischievousness in her tone as she leans over a pinch and winks \"Want to see it?\" she asks, getting a nod from Cliff \"Ok, but only if you join in ok? You can use the previous form, that outfit suited her, was rather adorable really\" Alucard purrs as the duo ripple and transform: Cliff once more pink haired and dressed in heart covered red swimwear, while Alucard had altered her hair to a more auburn/ginger colour while retaining the style, the earrings condensing and then exploding until they resembled hanging tentacle like things with only the tips retaining their original blue colour, and the blue sportswear shriveling up into a blue bikini with several yellow bows, one at each hip and a larger one essentially framing the cleavage of her average sized chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waifu2x.booru.pics/outfiles/d2ea92beeaaba88d011461cbd53ce03de62289df_s2_n2.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://waifu2x.booru.pics/outfiles/d2ea...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look so hot in that\" Cliff squeals, bouncing up and down in joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlucard scoffs \"Of course I do, the games are so much easier when even the other girls are staring at me\" she winks and sticks out her tongue teasingly, then stops and her eyes widen \"Holy crap this was easier than I thought, and actually kind of fun\" Alucard muses as he changes back, Cliff giggling to herself for a little longer before returning to normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see why I've done it enough times to be able to naturally fall into the correct mindset, it's a lot of fun\" he grins, getting a nod from his sire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Cliff invites Alucard to come to his place, away from the dark cave he was hiding/living in. Suggesting he pretend to be his visiting cousin<br>\r\n2) All the transforming has made both vampires hungery, Alucard suggesting they have a group hunt before letting his fledgling go home<br>\r\n3) I have nothing, so free chapter for whoever shows up that isn't me.<br>\r\n3)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a night of special occasions. Not only was it Cliff and Hilda's 25th wedding anniversary, but it was also the day they finished moving their youngest son Jackson into his dorm leaving the house all to themselves. Cliff was using the newfound freedom to walk around his house naked as the day he was born without having to worry about being walked in on his kids as he waited on his wife to get back home with the wine so they could complete their celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff moved his naked parade into the master bathroom where he looked at himself in the mirror and sighed. The sagging eyes, the beer belly, the flabby arms, he finally was free to live his life however he wanted and he no longer had the body capable of keeping up with his desires. Cliff still had the spirt to go out and find adventure and have fun, but the body was no longer willing. He sighed, but then smiled, he still had his loving wife Hilda and two lovely kids who were still the most important things to him. Cliff knew he'd find new ways to entertain himself now that he was entering his mid 50s, maybe he'd take up Bingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cliff pondered potential new hobbies an older man could take up, Cliff looked in the mirror one last time and sucked in his gut thinking of what his body could be, when there was suddenly a wolf whistle coming from the doorway. Standing there just as naked as him, was Hilda. But something seemed...off. Cliff couldn't place his finger on it. Hilda's body seemed different somehow. He red hair seemed to have a few less streaks of grey. He crows feet weren't nearly as pronounced. Her beautiful C cup breasts seemed to have more natural lift to them. And she was very well manicured down below, better taken care of than Cliff had seen in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Hilda, you look amazing.\" Cliff said pushing the odd doubts about his wife's appearance from his mind. Hilda just smiled and said, \"Oh Cliff, I've been waiting for this night for a long long time, and now the time is right.\" Hilda kissed her husband hard on the mouth more aggressively than she had ever done before. It was almost like she was teasing biting Cliff's lips and tongue as she continued to kiss with force. And Cliff took it and give it right back. He lifted the lovely woman and ignoring the back pain that came with age, he carried her to the bed where he threw her down. Cliff let out a gasp of pain as he grasped his back and groaned, Hilda smiled at the suffering man and said, \"Oh, I know it's tough, but I promise you, I can make that pain go away if you just come to me and let me do my work.\" And as thought to tempt the poor man, Hilda spread her legs and tantalizingly did something Cliff had never seen his wife do, and watched her finger herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's moaning was all the painkiller Cliff needed as he climbed on his bride and made love in such a wild and passionate way Cliff thought he was a horny teenager again. They rolled and thrusted all over the bed culminating with Cliff reaching orgasm, and at the same time as Cliff was lost in ecstasy, Hilda stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving faster than Cliff had ever seen his wife move, she sat up and jumped at Cliff's neck. Hilda opened her mouth and clamped down on her husband's neck. Cliff went from the hight of bliss to screaming in pain. \"What the hell Hilda! Since when did you get into biting shit? Damn it, I think you drew blood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda finally relaxed her jaw and got off of the bed and with a coy smiled that had a bit of Cliff's blood staining it she said, \"Sorry, I couldn't resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that hurts, could you pass me the antibiotics? This stings like hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Hilda could do as she was asked, something odd happened. Cliff could hear the garage door open, \"What the hell? Jackson can't already be running home, he's been in college a whole 6 hours. And it can't be Nicole, she never visits us this late.\" As Cliff wondered who it could be, a voice came calling from the kitchen that sounded weirdly like the woman in bed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long, you wouldn't believe how long the line was at the liquor store. So many college kids getting ready for their first week, hopefully Jackson doesn't get into too much trouble his first week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff's eyes went wide as he wondered if he was having a stroke. \"Hilda? He called to the kitchen as he looked at the naked woman in bed with him who was now moving to the open window. The naked woman smiled and shrugged, \"A shame, I was hoping to spend more time with you. Maybe some other time.\" At this moment Cliff could share he saw the naked woman who looked like his wife change. The woman's hair turned into a messy black and her eyes turned into a dark red and she jumped out the window.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
