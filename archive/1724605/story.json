It was Wednesday afternoon, and the boys had just completed their weekly practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the boys, an invisible UFO was hovering overhead, watching and studying the boys. The aliens were benevolent and peaceful, and they were very powerful. They scanned and studied the boys and they were able to extract their names, their ages, and their memories by beaming an invisible ray at each of them from the bottom of the space ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aliens concluded that the boys were all good-hearted, and the aliens decided to endow the eleven youngsters with amazing powers. They were to do this as an experiment, just to see how they would react. The powers would be permanent, and they could never be taken away. Other powers and abilities could develop later on, depending on each boy. The boys would not have any weaknesses like being exposed to Kryptonite, for example. They would be completely invincible and invulnerable to any man-made weapons including bullets and knives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, each boy on the field passed out, and collapsed on the ground. Then, beams from the ship struck each boy, granting every boy unlimited physical strength and stamina, along with super speed. After a minute had passed, each boy would slowly wake up, not remembering what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sam was nice, and Jake looked up to him, hoping to one day be as big and strong as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little bro! How was practice?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good.\" Jake said, but he was really focused on what they were going to do next. Sam was going to the gym and taking Jake with him. Jake was going to get to see his brother work out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Jake drove five minutes down the street from the soccer field to the local gym. They got out of the car and Sam went straight in to start working out, Jake right behind him. Sam went over to the bench press, as his arms were his favorite to work out with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam began to put weights on the metal bar as Jake looked around at the muscular men trying to get as big as possible. Jake pictured himself as big as the men there, and he thought that maybe he could start working out too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother calling his name snapped Jake out of his daydream. \"What is it Sam?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm running out of weights, could you go find me a 10 lb.?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded and stood up, scanning the room for the right weight. Finally, he spotted what appeared to be a 10 lb. weight across the room, and without another thought, he went over and picked it up, looking at the huge men as he walked back to Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake reached out to hand the weight to his brother. \"Thanks Jake!\" Sam said, reaching out to grab the weight and put it on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Sam grabbed the weight from his brother, the weight plummeted right to the ground, as Sam couldn't hold on to it. \"What the heck?\" Sam asked to no one in particular as he bent over to inspect the weight. Suddenly, Sam had a questioning look on his face as he turned towards Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, this isn't a 10 pound weight, it's a 100 pound weight! Jake looked down at the weight and saw that he had missed a zero on the side of the weight and it did, in fact, weigh 100 pounds! \"How the heck did you carry it here?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shrugged in astonishment. He had carried the weight without another thought! Sam and Jake couldn't think of a proper way to explain the strange incident.</span></div></div>",

After all, it weighed one-hundred pounds, but his little, eleven-year-old brother Jake had casually carried it to him across the other side of the gym like it was as light as a feather!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSam, who was eighteen years old and stood just over six feet and four inches tall, just looked down at his younger brother. Was this a joke?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Uhmm\u2026 Thanks, Jake\u2026 I got it now. Just sit and wait over in the corner till I\u2019m done lifting weights, okay?\u201d Sam said to his little brother.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSure, but that\u2019s so boring\u2026\u201d Jake replied sadly. \u201cCan\u2019t I do anything?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGo to the treadmills or the stationary bikes or something! Go burn off that unused energy you haven\u2019t used up during soccer!\u201d Sam responded with a deep sigh. Sam had to think of something to keep his little brother occupied for at least another thirty minutes so that he could work out in peace.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026 Thanks bro!\u201d Jake said, as he turned around and casually strolled past all the big muscle guys who were so busy lifting weights.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJake walked to the treadmills, which were located neatly by the water fountain upstairs in the nice, newly constructed gym. Jake walked up the stairs and looked around, gawking at all the awesome workout equipment everywhere. There were also lots of rooms behind these tall, white walls, so he couldn't see everything that was there. Strangely enough, when Jake stared at a piece of wall long enough, the wall became transparent, and it seemed as if he was able to look straight THROUGH the walls, just by concentrating slightly! He saw the aerobic classes and the racquetball courts, and he was amazed by all the things that were offered in the vast recreational facility!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jake finally found a treadmill which was unused, he stepped on the conveyor belt and held on to the handle bars which were located right in front of him. He entered a simple beginner's running program on the display panel in front of him, and he started his walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this can't be too hard!\" Jake grinned, as he just started walking for a few minutes while following the directions on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the preteen boy got bored and decided to increase the speed a little. The display indicated his walking speed, which was steady at 3 MPH, and indicated the distance covered as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go faster!\" Jake grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake started a slow jog, and he noticed that the belt on the treadmill started rolling faster under his soccer shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine under the treadmill hummed at a higher pitch as jake ran a bit faster, as the display indicated a speed of 7.6 MPH and a distance covered of 9.4 miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not feeling tired or anything.\" Jake grinned. \"Let's crank it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treadmill went into higher gear as Jake went even faster. The display indicated 11.9 MPH and distance covered of 19.87 miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, the speed surged to 25.65 MPH and then to 39.77 MPH until it hit 56.44 MPH and distance covered of 176.65 miles!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vroom! I'm like a race car!!! Vroom!!!!\" Jake grinned, as he pushed on, going faster and faster, not realizing that he was pushing the treadmill beyond what the machine was made for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was passing 64.73 MPH... when all of the sudden the belt under his soccer shoes snapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNNNAAAPPPPPPP!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaa!!!!\" Jake shouted, as he leaped off the treadmill, since the belt flew off, exposing the engine underneath, which was on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Fire!\" Jake gasped, as he landed on his feet next to the broken treadmill!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake took a deep and BLEW on the treadmill with all his might!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSSSSHHHHHWWWWWOOOOOOOOSSSSSHHHHHHHH!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mighty hurricane-force gust of wind blew across the room, knocking over ALL the machines in the room, thanks to Jake's super-breath! The fire from the treadmill was put out, but the treadmill was also blown 10 yards across the room, until it slammed against the concrete wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the workers came running towards Jake, just to see if he was alright. One of the workers checked the machine. Just then, Sam came upstairs, to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Sam asked his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was running on the treadmill but the belt broke and it caught on fire!\" Jake explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the workers came up to Jake, after he read the reading on the display of Jake's treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me... You were running at SIXTY-FOUR miles-per-hour?\" the man asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... So?\" Jake shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOBODY can run THAT FAST!\" the guy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...\" Sam said angrily. \"The treadmill was broken! Let's go, Jake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood there and looked at Jake slack-jawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little brother isn't human!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he is! Your treadmill is BROKEN!\" Sam shouted back. \"Come, Jake... We're going home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry I broke the treadmill...\" Jake said sadly, as he and Sam got in the car to drive home...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're weird, Jake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the boys walked in the house, their mother got off the phone and turned to face them as they walked in the door via the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam! Jake! Can you boys start blowing some of these balloons for me? They're for Aunt Kathy's 50th birthday next Sunday!\" their mother asked them as she gave them each a small stack of balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww mom!\" Sam groaned, as he took them and walked towards his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you!\" Jake whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! How could you have heard mom from the car outside? You're WEIRD! Go to your room!\" Sam sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Jake laughed as he just stumbled into his own bedroom and closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake studied the colorful balloons and took the red one, and placed it in his mouth. He blew it up all the way, which seemed very easy for him to do. He tied the knot and was contemplating leaving it in a box in the corner, when the balloon slipped out of his fingers and started to float towards the high celing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had a large bedroom with a tall, 25-foot ceiling. the room was large, 20 feet by 20 feet, so there was a LOT of room in the big bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! The balloon! It's going out of reach!\" Jake gasped as the balloon was ascending farther out of his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake decided to leap for it, so he could reach the bottom spout of the balloon so he could pull it down in time, before it traveled any further towards the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaahhh!!!\" Jake gasped, as he leaped into the air and started hovering off the ground! Something WEIRD was going on! He was flying towards the balloon... and PASSING it and he soared towards the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA! Turn!!!\" Jake gasped, as he turned the other way, so he didn't crash into the ceiling. Instead, he starting FLYING along the walls of his room, in a wide circle, about twenty feet above the ground!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... NO WAY! I'm FLYING!\" Jake cheered, as he had his arms extended in front of his head while his face was pointing towards the ground. His feet were neatly together, as his short body was gliding through the air, about fifteen to twenty feet above his bedroom!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, get the balloon...\" he said, as he glided to the lost balloon and grabbed hold of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... Come down... Slowly...\" he said to himself as he willed his feet to touch his carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery slowly, Jake pointed his feet to the ground as he descended to his bedroom floor. Finally, his soccer shoes touched the floor and he made his landing, completing his first solo flight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I gotta try this again!\" he said to himself, full of excitement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to try the flying again, but he wanted to impress himself and show off a little for his brother.  This time he touched off the floor and starting flying past Sam's chest but when got to throat level he took his hand and grabbed Sam's shirt so as Jake started to reach the ceiling Sam was dangling an arm's reach from his little bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"HAHAHAHA look at this Sam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  HOLLY CRAP DUDE!? How are you doing this??  You can't be this strong... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I guess I'm the BIG brother now eh Sam??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sam sighed, his heart absolutely dropped, Jealousy bubbled in him greater than he ever thought could be possible, this little kid has somehow inherited a strength and power beyond his own hopes and imagination... how embarrassing will it always be that he is the older brother of... well... of superman??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"ummm... hey Jake can you let me go... this is kinda weird,\" Sam state with a more submissive tone then he had ever spoken to his brother before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh yeah of course dude i'll set you down,\"  Jake drifted back to the floor and let his brother go, still hovering slightly about a foot off the ground..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jake's expression suddenly changed to that of slight confusion, and almost as if he felt... uncomfortable. \" Whoa something is feeling kind of weird\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course something feels weird, you have super powers all of a sudden!\" replied Sam, but that's not what Jake meant.  Jake's skin became a litlte more flush and Sam noticed why Jake felt different all of a sudden... his muscles started to expand, the veins on his biceps jumped up as if he just had the work out of his life and and the t-shirt started to stretch and rip slightly at the sleeves, his chest began to expand slightly, his upper thighs, he was expanding outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"ARRGGHHH\"  this feels soooo...

Jake nodded excitedly, and rushed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out on the street, Jake got into a sprinting position and took off running. At first he was running as fast as he normally would. Suddenly, his legs felt like they had a little more energy in them, so he increased his speed. He soon passed 10 MPH, and he didn't look to be slowing down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the end of his block, Jake grinned. \"Time to kick it up a notch!\" he said, and he really pumped his legs as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt his speed increasing as he flew by the houses, bushes fluttering from the wind he was creating. His speed was still increasing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 MPH, 30, 40...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJake began to feel more and more confident and amazed. This was unbelievable!

Whenever an occasional highway patrol car would come speeding buy, he would increase the speed even more, and he would blow past a few eighteen-wheelers until he had gotten out of sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speed limit on the interstate was 70 MPH but Jake was running faster than 90 MPH, wearing nothing but his jersey, his shorts, and his soccer shoes! Eventually, Jake increased the speed to over 480 MPH, and he was roaring over the highway, crossing over the Alabama state line and then into Mississippi before going into Louisiana before finally making into Texas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoohooo! This is FUN!\" Jake cheered, as he increased the speed to 785 MPH, without ever growing tired! The super-powered boy was just liking his jog better as he was going faster, racing over bridges, fields, lakes, and long stretches of road which took him through deserts, farmland, wetlands, beaches, mountains, valleys, and canyons. To Jake, this was better than any field trip he has been on, ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few minutes of running at 927 MPH, Jake blazed into New Mexico before crossing the Arizona state line just a few minutes later. Finally, he passed over a bridge and ran through a mountain range, before spotting a sign indicating that he had reached California. He finally decided to slow down to 472 MPH, which was now considered SLOW for him, so he could enjoy the view a little bit, when he suddenly spotted the coast right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed past a sign that said \"San Diego\" and reached the end of the interstate, when he suddenly ran off the highway and ended up running on white sand before plunging head-first into the nice, warm water of the Pacific Ocean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLUNGE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowww!\" Jake laughed, as he came up from the water, swimming around near the beach. A few other onlookers stared at him, wondering where the crazy kid came running from, before he plowed at high speed into the ocean? \"I forgot to hit the brakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake quickly swam to the shore and walked out, being completely soaked, of course. All the people at the beach were staring at him. Jake looked like a muscular preteen boy, who was wearing a soccer uniform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice day for a swim, huh?\" Jake grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral kids, including a few surfers, stared at him and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came from Miami, and I decided to go for a little run. I guess that's three-thousand miles away?\" Jake chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids all looked at Jake like he was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd better get back home or else mom's gonna be mad when I'm late for supper, especially since it's three hours later in Miami than here! So, see ya later!\" Jake laughed, as he extended his arms above his head, and leaped into the air, taking off flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK!\" one boy gasped. \"That boy! He.... He can FLY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bird... It's a plane... It's a FLYING BOY!\" another man exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just grinned as he took to the air, with the wind blowing in his face as he ascended straight into the sky. As he looked down, he could see the beautiful coast become smaller and smaller beneath him, as he looked ahead and decided to bank towards the east, and go away from the Pacific Coast so that he would fly back towards Florida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'd better not get lost now or else mom's gonna be mad! Let's see if I can find the highway...\" Jake laughed, as he scanned the ground below him for the interstate. When he spotted the blue signs for I-10 from the sky, he decided to fly right over the highway, so he knew for sure that it would lead him right back to Florida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Full speed ahead!\" Jake cheered, as he blasted across the sky at 1,400 MPH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blur flashed across the sky, which was the short, muscular boy who was only 5 feet tall, with super powers. He outraced and out-flew any commercial jet, any fighter plane, any missile, any rocket, racing home from Califormia in just about 2 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! There's Miami!\" Jake cheered, as he spotted the large city at the southern Florida coast. He circled around, beating any jet plane and avoiding any other commercial traffic, landing in his own back yard, so he was just in time for dinner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Jake said, as he walked in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been, pipsqueek?\" Sam, his big brother, asked him, when he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just went for a swim in California, that's all... I jogged over there and then I flew back...\" Jake said, like it was the most normal thing in the world for an eleven-year-old boy to do on an afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just grinned as he walked into his bedroom so he could grab some clean clothes and take a shower. After all, he was dirty and sweaty from running, swimming and flying all afternoon long. It was another afternoon in the life of a super-kid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly got up, and walked back into the kitchen carrying the empty paper plate in his hand. Sam was sitting at the kitchen table, while looking over at the TV while eating at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you liked cold pizza...\" Sam, his 17-year-old brother, remarked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" Jake replied, as he opened the pizza box in the fridge and removed another slice from the box, which he neatly placed on the paper plate in his hand. \"I hate cold pizza. It tastes afwul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you ate the last slice cold! You never heated it up in the microwave, you dummy!\" Sam giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I heated it up with my---...\" Jake replied, as he stopped in mid-sentence since he almost caught himself telling Sam that he had heat vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your... WHAT?\" Sam inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Jake sighed. He had fallen into a trap. He held a new slice of cold pizza in his hand, and his older brother was wondering how he heated his previous slice without using the microwave. Jake came to the realization that he was pushed into a corner. He had to show his brother his super powers. \"I... Uhh... I just heated it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what? You don't have a microwave in your room!\" Sam stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! You REALLY want to know?\" Jake asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I REALLY want to know, little bro!\" the reply came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just looked down, staring at the slice of pizza, which lay on the paper plate in his hands. He took a deep breath, then he focused his eyes on the slice of pizza which was before him, and he imagined the pizza heating up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, red laser beams flashed from the pupils in Jake's eyes, coming down from his eyes and striking the surface of the pizza, instantly heating the crust and the small bits of ham, which had been cooked on the cheese-covered topping. The cheese even melted a bit more, almost dripping from the side of the plate, while the bits of ham began to change color as they became a little more crispy due to the intense heat rays emitted from Jake's eyes. After a few seconds, Jake shut off his built-in heat vision, leaving a delicious aroma emit from the formerly cold pizza pie and making it smell like it had just come from the hot oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't believe what he had just seen. Red, thick beams of heat just blasted from his little brother's eyeballs, and heated up the slice of pizza in his hand! That was completely amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy... CRAP!\" Sam gasped as he slowly stood up and walked over to Jake, while holding a slice of pizza on a porcelin plate. \"How... What... How the hell did you do THAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uhmm... I just look at my plate... I think about fire... And... Uhmmm... I can shoot laser beams from my eyes!\" Jake tried to explain. \"I don't know why or how I do it... I just think of it and it happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird things have been going on with you, little bro! You carried a hundred pounds in the gym like it was nothing... You broke the treadmill in the gym because you ran too fast... Then you moved it out of place because you blew on it... Then you went jogging to some place far away...\" Sam stated out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran to California! I went swimming in the ocean! That's all!\" Jake insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? And I guess you just ran back to Miami afterwards?\" Sam laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... No... I flew back...\" Jake said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's jaw dropped wide open as he stared at his little brother with a complete expression of disbelief at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then put his pizza on the table before extending his arms sideways, allowing his body to rise about three feet above the floor. He remained stationary, floating three feet above the ground, in the middle of the living room, with Sam looking on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh!\" This is... incredible!\" Sam gasped, as he witnessed his little brother hovering in the center of his living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I could fly! I got super powers, bro!\" Jake said, as he finally landed with his soccer shoes touching down on the floor. \"Isn't that cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very cool... But what are you gonna do with these powers at school? Are you gonna tell everybody? Or are you gonna keep this a secret?\" Sam asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy... That's a hard question, bro... I have no idea how I'm gonna handle this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better be very careful with this at school, Jake!\" Sam warned his little super-powered brother. \"What if the kids found out about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then he collected his clothes to wear at school and got dressed.

Finally, he ran out the door and waited at the bust stop for the bust to take him to the elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at school, he had to carefully walk into the schoolyard because there were a long line of cars waiting to get into the parking lot of parents waiting to drop off their kids. Giovanni was waiting to cross the street, so he could walk into the playground. One car finally stopped, letting him cross. Somehow, the older gentleman at the wheel started talking to the lady sitting next to him, and his foot slipped off the brake.

I\u2019m so terribly sorry!\u201d the man said, as he got out of the car and walked up to Giovanni. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral other parents also saw what had happened, and they rushed over to Giovanni to see if he was hurt. Strangely enough, Giovanni didn\u2019t feel anything at all. He didn\u2019t even have a scratch on him! Not only that, but he had pushed the large Lincoln Towncar back almost three feet, using an amazing amount of physical strength, which had just left everyone completely astounded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the parents and the teachers surrounded Giovanni and the driver of the car, they noticed that the bumper of the car contained a large dent in the front. Clearly, the car had run into Giovanni, who would have been run over by the old man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d The teachers asked Giovanni. \u201cMy goodness! You just got hit by a car! Are you hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! I didn\u2019t feel a thing! Trust me!\u201d the boy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the teachers immediately took Giovanni to the nurse\u2019s office, where he was given a thorough checkup. There, the nurse found that there was indeed nothing wrong with him, and that he got away from the car accident without a scratch, which was a miracle! The nurse did call Giovanni\u2019s mother, who came to the school right away. But, since nothing was really wrong with him, they decided to keep him in school for the rest of the day. The other students, who had witnessed the accident, however, were very amazed by the fact that Giovanni was able to remain standing and he was able to push the car back using his bare hands! How did he get so strong? And how did the dent get in the bumper of the car?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring lunch, several boys joined Giovanni and started asking him all kinds of questions. Once more, Giovanni had no idea what had happened, since he was looking the other way and he didn\u2019t even feel that he got hit by the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school was over, Giovanni was called in to the nurse\u2019s office again. Unfortunately, because he stayed late in school, he ended up missing the bus ride home. So, once the nurse was finished checking him out, he left the school building and walked outside only to find that he had just missed the last bus going home. When he tried calling Marco to get a ride home, he realized that his cell phone battery had died as well. There was nothing else left for him to do now but to walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking down the street and realized that he still had about four blocks to go. As he looked up towards the sky, he spotted a few birds flying overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, it must be so nice to be able to fly like a bird!\u201d he grinned, as he decided to hop to his next step. He hopped again and then he began to hover above the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What the heck is going on!\u201d he gasped, as he realized that he was able to keep himself floating in the air, using his mind. When he willed his body to descend back until his feet touched down on the sidewalk, he landed back on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 How the heck did I do that?\u201d he gasped, as he realized that he was actually flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Giovanni was scared stiff. He had felt like the wind was carrying his body through the air, but then he realized that he was able to change his altitude just by thinking of how high up he wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me I can fly!\u201d he thought to himself, as he slowly allowed his body to rise up into the air until he was hovering three feet above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni then extended his arms above his head and directed his body to fly across the sky in a horizontal position. He flew all the way home, landing in the front yard of the house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so cool! I can fly!\u201d he cheered, as he ran back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Giovanni walked into the house feeling like he was living in a dream. He was able to see through walls and doors and metal, he was incredibly strong, he got hit by a car at school and he didn\u2019t get hurt at all, and to top it off, he was able to fly home after school was over and he had missed the bus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 I must be dreaming all this, right?\u201d he mumbled, as he examined his reflection in the bathroom mirror. \u201cNo ordinary kid just wakes up one day and is able to do all these things for no reason!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then his older brother Marco was walking past the bathroom and spotted his little brother standing in front of the mirror, still wearing his school clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, twerp?\u201d Marco grinned, as he walked by. Marco was over a foot taller than Giovanni, since Giovanni was just less than 5 feet tall and Marco was already 6 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni turned to face his older brother with a sincere expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bro\u2026 Do I look any different to you?\u201d he asked his big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco examined his little brother and noticed that Giovanni did look a little different. He felt like Giovanni seemed a little more athletic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you been gaining weight?\u201d Marco asked him. \u201cYou look a little bigger in your chest, in your arms and in your legs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess my muscles have grown a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re too young to grow muscle, dude! You\u2019re only ten years old!\u201d Marco replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know that, but, I think my muscles have gotten a little bigger! Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d Giovanni asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Maybe\u2026 I mean\u2026 You don\u2019t work out or anything, other than playing soccer, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 But\u2026 Weird things have been happening to me lately\u2026 And I can\u2019t explain them\u2026\u201d Giovanni sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant to ask you about that\u2026\u201d Marco wondered. \u201cHow did you know that I didn\u2019t have my keys in my pocket? And how come you were so certain that they were on the car seat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw them! I saw that your pockets were empty and I saw the keys on your chair in the car!\u201d Giovanni explained. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things I just can\u2019t explain right now, but\u2026 I can see through things\u2026 I can do other things, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I missed the bus after school today\u2026\u201d Giovanni recounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you walked home from school?\u201d Marco asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Not exactly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get home, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I flew\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Marco just stared at his little brother in complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco walked up to his little brother and ran his hand through Giovanni\u2019s short, black, spikey hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, little bro\u2026 People don\u2019t fly, okay?\u201d Marco chuckled. \u201cI mean, it would be nice if we were able to do that, but ordinary human beings do not have that ability\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, what do you call THIS?\u201d Giovanni asked him, as he slowly allowed his body to rise up off the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking ab---? Holy crap!\u201d Marco gasped, when he realized that his little brother was hovering a few inches above the ground! Giovanni\u2019s tennis shoes were suspended in mid-air! There was empty space between the bathroom floor and the soles of his shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 What the heck\u2026 How did you do that?\u201d Marco stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni made his body rise up even higher off the ground, until he was floating almost four feet above the tiled floor. Marco then reached over and gently grabbed hold of his brother\u2019s right tennis shoe, pulling it slowly towards him. He found that Giovanni seemed to be floating in mid-air like a balloon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing! You\u2019re floating like a balloon, bro!\u201d he said to his little brother, who was now hovering above his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! Isn\u2019t this cool?\u201d the younger brother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing! How do you do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea! I\u2019ve been able to do all these weird things ever since I got home from soccer practice yesterday afternoon. It\u2019s really weird!\u201d the younger brother explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 Let\u2019s go outside!\u201d Marco suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni extended his arms before him, and allowed his body to float in a horizontal position. Then, he began to fly through the house, soaring through the hallway and the living room, with Marco running after him, until they got to the front door. There, Giovanni reached down and opened the door, and flew outside. Marco followed behind him and quickly stepped outside, stopping in the driveway as he looked up in awe at his flying little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? I told you I could fly!\u201d Giovanni shouted, as he ascended high over the roof of the house. He flew over the neighbor\u2019s house before circling around their yard. Then he came around and landed right before Marco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBro! You\u2026 You have super powers! You\u2019ve become some sort of super-kid or something!\u201d Marco exclaimed. \u201cThis is so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I guess you can say that, yeah\u2026\u201d his little brother said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the other guys on your team? What happened to them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I only saw a couple of them at school this morning, but nobody had noticed anything unusual yet\u2026 I guess I can call them or go over to their houses and find out\u2026\u201d Giovanni wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I think it would be fun to know how the other guys are doing! I mean\u2026 Did they get super powers as well, or just you?\u201d Marco asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea. I need to find out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco and Giovanni then walked back into the house, although Marco realized that Giovanni was already planning on going out again real soon\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One minute he was just an ordinary little brother and then the next day, he had transformed into some kind of super-kid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the boys had gotten outside, Giovanni extended his arms, and he began to rise up off the ground like a bird!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!

I'll be right back!\" Giovanni said, before he took off flying through the air at high speed! Giovanni suddenly blasted through the sky like a rocket, soaring high over the neighborhood and then blasting over the area until he reached the street where his other teammate lived. No sooner had he arrived, or he spotted the boy with the curly red hair soaring over the sky next to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan! Over here!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giovanni! You can fly, too?\" Morgan said, as the two flying boys flew side-by-side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two super-kids then landed in front of Morgan's house, where they quickly caught up on all the strange happenings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!

Not only that, but P.E. in school will be a snap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni was already looking forward to going to school the next day, now that he was a super-powered boy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Giovanni woke up around 5 o'clock in the morning, he was wide awake! he felt like he had slept a whole night, and he was full of energy. As he rolled over in his bed and then looked down, towards the edge of his bed and then his hardwood floor, he spotted his black Nike soccer cleats in the corner. Then, with a start, he noticed two feet standing next to his cleats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Giovanni! How did you like your first day with super powers?\" a voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Huh?\" Giovanni said, as he opened his eyes and sat up straight in bed. Miraculously, he was able to see perfectly in the dark, due to his enhanced vision. As he looked on, he spotted a young boy, about the same age as him, wearing a blue soccer jersey and red shorts, with blue socks and black cleats. The boy had white hair and bright, blue eyes. \"Who... Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm one of the aliens who has given you and your other teammates your powers!\" the boy spoke. \"I have studied your character and feelings, and I have determined that you are very protective and responsible! You have the makings of a great superhero and a leader! Therefore, your powers will grow and other powers will be added to you!\" the boy with white hair spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? What?\" Giovanni stuttered. \"But... Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you will be a great superhero, even as a kid!\" the boy said, as he extended his hand and pointed his finger at him. A blast of blue light emitted from the tip of his finger and struck Giovanni in the forehead. After a few seconds, the strange beam stopped and the alien boy disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! What happened? I... I don't remember a thing... My mind is going blank...\" Giovanni the fell back on his bed and dozed off. he slept for another ten minutes, before waking up a second time. This time, he had forgotten all about the strange encounter with the alien, and when he looked at his alarm clock, he realized that he needed to get up and shower so he could get ready to go to school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! I need to get ready for school!\" he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni leaped out of bed and raced to his dresser in a flash. He then collected his clothes and raced to the bathroom in a blur. He turned on the water in the shower while he brushed his teeth. He was done in 6 seconds. Then he took a shower in 10 seconds. Afterwards, he dried off and raced into the room, where he put on his clothes. He brushed his hair and put on his socks and shoes. When he looked at his watch, he noticed that barely a minute had gone by from the time he had gotten out of bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck? I got dressed and showered at SUPER SPEED!\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turned into a blur that raced to the kitchen. He took a bowl and some milk out of the fridge and poured it. He sat down on the chair, just as his mom came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already showered and dressed? That was fast!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni decided to slow down and eat his Fruit Loops cereal, since he had more time than usual. Once he was done, he got his backpack and kissed his mom goodbye before walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to walk to school...\" he sighed, knowing he was in for that two-mile walk to school. He decided to go for a light jog, where he turned into a blur, which vanished and instantly appeared at the front entrance to the schoolyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he checked his watch, his mouth dropped wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... I walked to school in four seconds?\" he gasped. \"That is insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was among the first students to walk through the door. He was SUPER early! But, he figured, he would enjoy it, being the first to arrive at school. He knew it would be a fun day at school, now that he had super powers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was such a bright, sunny day that the head cafeteria lady allowed them to eat outside for lunch.  So, Giovanni grabbed his tray and headed out to the benches and tables that were placed right outside the cafeteria door near the playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Vanni!  Over here!\" called Morgan.  He and a few of the other soccer players were sitting at a table together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni was just about to head over there, when he heard something that caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone, Chaz!  And give me back my bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni looked around, but the voice had come from no one around him.  Then, he caught some movement out of the corner of his eye.  Two boys, whom he recognized as being in the grade ahead of him, were playing tug-of-war with a girl over a backpack.  What surprised Giovanni was that they were clear across the playground, more than a soccer field's length away from the eating area!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow!  He could hear them struggling and talking/yelling at each other as if they were right next to him!  He had super-hearing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuning back in, Giovanni heard one of the boys give a bark of laughter.  \"I don't think so!  I think my grandma would like this bag.  Put her sewing and yarn in it.  Besides, didn't you know you're not allowed to have pot on the schoolyard?  I'm gonna tell a teacher on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please!\" the girl said sarcastically.  \"It's not pot, you imbecile!  It's HEMP!  It's all-natural fiber that's only MADE from the cannabis plant!  And it's NOT a sewing bag!  This is my backpack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who you callin' an imbah...imbah....  I ain't that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his super-sight, Giovanni saw that the two boys were quite a bit bigger than the girl, and they were starting to look decidedly more menacing the longer the altercation went.  Giovanni decided he couldn't just let them get away with bullying her.  So, he set his tray down on the table with his soccer buddies, said a quick, \"Be right back.  Save me a seat, okay?\" and then super-sped off across the playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was there in front of the other three kids in less than a second and grabbed hold of each boy by one of their arms, twisting them behind their backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, ow, ow!  What the heck...?!  Who are you, and what do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  Let us go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" said Giovanni.  \"You guys are obviously picking on, um....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Chrys,\" the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!  You guys were obviously picking on, Chrys, here, and I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.  So, unless you don't want to be able to use your arms for the rest of the day, I suggest, Chaz, that you give Chrys back her bag.  You understand me?\"  Giovanni twisted Chaz's arm just a little more, making the older boy whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!  Geez!  We were only having a bit of fun with dorky girl, here!  Fine!  Here's your stupid bag back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaz dropped the bag on the ground and kicked it over to her, making Giovanni twist his arm a little bit more.  Chrys bent down to get her bag and put it over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" said Giovanni, \"I don't want to see either of you bothering her again, understood?  Because if I do....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni gave an extra little twist, making the two boys groan in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we promise!  We won't mess with her again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  Make sure you don't, because I'll be watching you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni let go of both boys' arms.  Chaz and his friend cradled their throbbing arms to their chest and quickly hurried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni turned to the girl.  Seeing her up close, he realized that she was the new girl in his class that had only started a couple days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for taking care of those boys,\" Chrys said to him.  \"You're stronger than you look.  And how did you get here so fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni shrugged, his face reddening a bit in embarrassment at the praise.  \"Um, yeah, uh, you're welcome.  And, well, I can run pretty quickly and silently if I need to.\" He scratched the back of his neck and looked away.  Chrys was really pretty, and he wasn't sure what to do...how to act, what to say....  She had long, light brown hair in two braids down her back, bright blue eyes, and a cute button nose.  She was wearing a tie-dye shirt over a long black skirt, with Mary Janes on her feet.  She was slender and wasn't much shorter than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your name?\" Chrys asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  I'm Giovanni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like 'Don Giovanni'?  The opera by Mozart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys rolled her eyes.  \"Never mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is Chrys short for something?  Like Christina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys's face turned a bit red.  \"Actually, my full name's Chrysanthemum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni couldn't help a snicker.  \"Chrysanthemum?  What a mouthful!  No wonder you go by Chrys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys straightened herself to her full height, crossed her arms over her chest, and raised her chin.  \"I didn't make fun of YOUR name when you told me!  You could at least give my name the same respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately contrite, Giovanni hunched his shoulders.  \"You're right, Chrys.  I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even know what a chrysanthemum is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys sighed.  \"This is why mom was home-schooling us out in California!\" she muttered under her breath.  Looking back at Giovanni, she said, \"A chrysanthemum happens to be a perennial flower of the mum variety that my mother loves to grow in her gardens.  My parents love nature and flowers, and so they named me and my four sisters all after flowers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Well, that actually sounds kinda cool.  What are your sisters' names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My older sisters are Dahlia and Marigold, and my younger sisters are Hyacinth and Jonquil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  I just have one older brother.  His name's Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just stood there for a couple seconds, looking at each other.  Despite his super powers, Giovanni felt a little intimidated by this obviously very smart girl.  Chrys, on the other hand, was glad that a nice boy was willing to come to her rescue.  She'd been getting picked on incessantly since she got here, being new and smart, and Giovanni was the first to actually try to get to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni felt his stomach growl and was reminded that it was lunch time.  So, he cleared his throat and said, \"Um, I have lunch waiting for me with my friends from soccer.  Would...um...you like to join us for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that would be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  The guys are cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys and Giovanni then walked back to the eating area and to the table where Giovanni had left his tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, guys?  This is Chrys, the new girl from...California?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys nodded.  \"Hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I invited her to sit and eat with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the guys looked at each other a bit, shrugging their shoulders, having a silent conversation.  Then Morgan said, \"Sure, Vanni.  Hi, Chrys.  I'm Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the rest of the boys introduced themselves, and Giovanni and Chrys sat down to enjoy their lunch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Giovanni had introduced Chrys to Liam, Jake and Morgan during lunch that day, so she could meet some of the other soccer players who played with Giovanni on his team. When recess was over, they ended up taking a few classes together, much to their pleasant surprise! Chrys tried her best to sit next to Giovanni in every class, so that nobody else would bother her for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the last period was finally over, they got up and exchanged addresses, and they found out that they only lived two blocks away from each other. Giovanni invited to walk her home, so the two students left the schoolyard together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for walking me home, Giovanni! That is very sweet of you!\" Chrys said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... My pleasure!\" he replied, blushing a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you still haven't told me how you managed to get from your table to the field, where the bullies were taunting me?\" Chrys asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, I find it quite amazing that you were able to twist the arms of BOTH those bullies at the same time! I mean, those guys are bigger than you... How can it be that you're THAT strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Uhmm... Good question...\" Giovanni replied, as he looked down while he scratched his head a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she said sternly. \"You're a nice guy! But, please don't lie to me, okay? You can tell me! Honest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Umm... I don't think you're gonna believe me...\" Giovanni said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Umm... We were at soccer practice about a week ago, when something weird happened to all of us... We were on the field, kicking the ball around... Practice was just about over... According to the Coach, we all dropped to the field, unconscious and at the exact same time! Our parents freaked out and everybody ran to see what happened... Well, we all woke up after a few seconds, and we couldn't remember a thing for the rest of that day...\" Giovanni explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What happened to you guys?\" Chrys wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you for sure... Please keep this a secret, but we all developed super powers since that happened to us! That explains why I can run super-fast and why I got super-strength, which I used when I confronted the bullies during recess!\" Giovanni whispered to Chrys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" Chrys gasped. \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I can fly! I got heat vision, and I can teleport! And I think I can do a few other things which I haven't even discovered yet!\" Giovanni told her. \"I have heat vision, super hearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... That makes you some kind of superhero! I mean... That's GREAT!\" Chrys cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure... I don't know where these powers came from and I don't know what to do with them yet... \" Giovanni replied humbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giovanni! I'll help you! But you have to tell me all about your powers! You have to tell me everything you can do, okay?\" Chrys said excitedly as she reached out and grabbed hold of his hands. \"You have to tell... WHOA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chrys let go of his hands, like she felt an electric shock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened? What's the matter? What's wrong?\" Giovanni asked her, while she stared at him with her jaw open wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt it! You're not joking! I could feel it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You felt what?\" Giovanni wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys gently reached out with her right hand, and took Giovanni's left hand. A smile appeared on her face, as she did the same with her left hand. Then she turned her head, glancing over at the house before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see through the wall of that house... That girl on the second floor is talking on the cell phone, and I can hear her conversation like I'm standing right next to her!\" Chrys said excitedly. Then she turned towards Giovanni. \"You can share your powers! I feel it! You can fly... You can do things at super speed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni just smiled as he looked away. Chrys had discovered how he could share his powers by letting her hold his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this heat vision thing again?\" Chrys wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Giovanni was looking down when suddenly two red light beams shot from his eyes, striking the concrete sidewalk in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch out!\" Giovanni shouted. \"You fired my heat vision!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Sorry, G.!\" She said, as she let go of his hands. \"I guess, once you share your powers with me, I can also use them, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You discovered something new!\" Giovanni laughed. \"You can access my powers because... I want you to have access to them... Only you and nobody else... I need your help, Chrys... Will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you! I promise! But we need to keep this a secret for everybody else! In the meantime, we need to practice using your powers, just like you need to practice playing soccer. And we BOTH need to practice, because I need to learn how to make you use your powers as well!\" Chrys said, as she took a step back and concentrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Giovanni began to rise up in the air! His shoes rose three inches above the ground! He was hovering in mid-air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! This is so cool!\" the boy cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make you fly, see? I'm using your powers!\" Chrys laughed, as she allowed him to land back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... we should fly together...\" Giovanni said, as he held Chrys' hand. \"We both share my powers when you hold my hand, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Giovanni and Chrys took off, slowly ascending higher and higher into the sky, flying slowly through the air. The boy and the girl then flew, side-by-side, until they reached her house. Then, they landed before her front door, and they said goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni then took off running to his own house, reaching the door in four seconds, with a wide grin on his face. He was the happiest super-kid on earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Giovanni trudged his way to the locker room after practice, leaving divets in the grass as he kicked at the lawn in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't understand it!  The last couple days, practice had gone majorly awesome for him and the rest of his teammates!  They had had so much focus and drive and energy, and with their super-powers on top of everything, they all just KNEW they were going to beat the competition out of the water at their next game in a couple days.  However, today, Giovanni had been the only one so OFF his game, he had no idea what was going on with his body or his powers, least of all why!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis coordination seemed off somehow.  He kept making mistakes.  His aim was atrocious.  The control he had to exert on his strength to keep from sending the soccer ball into the next county was virtually non-existent.  The coach had called him aside three times to correct him and ask if anything was wrong.  As far as Giovanni could tell, he still felt more than fine, but for some reason, nothing he did was working.  Eventually, the coach had him sit on the sidelines the rest of practice, watching the rest of his teammates perform everything flawlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni felt ashamed.  He had sat there on the bench watching his friends, his face red with embarrassment, until he couldn't stand it anymore and looked at the ground, his feet, anywhere else.  He had let the guys down.  He'd let the coach down.  Worse, he'd let himself down, and he didn't even know WHY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the locker room, he quickly stripped off his uniform, tossed it near the dirty clothes basket (but missed, and sent the entire wheeled hamper careening down the hallway to the opposite end, near the girls' locker room!), had a quick shower, re-dressed, gathered his backpack, and left without answering or talking to anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a moody, depressed air about him as walked down the sidewalk, heading off the school grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Giovanni!  Wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni stopped and turned and saw Chrys waving an arm at him and running up to him.  Giovanni sighed.  He had forgotten he had promised to walk home with Chrys again today after practice.  She had decided to join the botany club, which met after school the same time as soccer practice, and since they got out at the same time and lived so close to each other, they had figured they might as well walk home together again.  Personally, Chrys was helping to ensure she wouldn't get singled out or picked on again during her walk home.  Giovanni, meanwhile, was hoping to enjoy some time with someone who enjoyed his company...and knew his secret.  However, Giovanni wasn't sure he felt like having company on his walk home today, given the disaster that practice had been for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Chrys,\" he said rather morosely, when Chrys caught up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys frowned.  \"Are you okay?  You look depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni sighed again.  Did he really want to spill his guts to a girl he still barely knew?  However, his mouth seemed to decide for him and said, \"Practice didn't go so well for me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  What happened?\"  Chrys looked at him, concerned.  The look on her face reminded Giovanni of how his mom would look when he had a scraped knee or a really bad cough.  Chrys already knew his secret.  Maybe she could help him figure out why he completely sucked at soccer today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't really know.  Here I am with all these great powers, and today, I felt completely off my game.\"  Giovanni explained the many things that went wrong at practice, and his face went red when he confessed to having been benched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.  Interesting,\" Chrys said, as a frowned creased her brow, and she rubbed her lips with her finger.  She tilted her head, looking at him curiously for moment.  Giovanni fidgeted before asking, \"What's interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G, how did you feel after we left each other yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt really good, like I was on top of the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did you feel this morning when you got up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,....  I felt groggy, like I hadn't slept very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long did you feel that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni thought for a moment.  \"I actually felt kind of out of it until I met up with you at lunch today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys's lips twitched as if she were going to smile, but her lips evened out into a straight line again.  \"And you touched my hand at lunch, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni felt his face and neck get hot.  \"I was only guiding you to a free table!\"  He felt he had to defend himself for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I know,\" Chrys said dismissively with a wave of her hand, \"but after you and I connected and spent some time together, did you feel better?  More like your usual self?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni's eyes widened.  \"Yes!  I did!\"  He frowned a moment.  \"But what does all this have to do with practice going so awful for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me one more question first:  How do you feel now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni bit his lip and closed his eyes.  He was quiet for a couple moments before opening them and looking into Chrys's bright blue eyes in confusion.  \"I...I feel...off.  Like...there's something missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know,\" she said softly.  Chrys then carefully took Giovanni's hand in her hers.  They both gasped as a spark of sensation ran between them.  Giovanni realized now that he had felt the same spark at lunch earlier today, when he had touched Chrys's hand to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Giovanni felt a sense of well-being fill his entire body:  wholeness, peace, strength, control, focus.  Everything that seemed to have been lacking in him at practice now didn't seem to be lacking in him at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what just happened?\" Giovanni asked warily, quickly dropping Chrys's hand and taking a step back from her.  \"I don't understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys sighed.  \"You feel okay, back to normal now again, don't you?\" she asked knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think something happened when you shared your powers with me yesterday,\" Chrys explained.  \"When you did that, it affected how you can use and tap into your powers.  I think that when you're apart from me for an extended period of time, you can't ground your powers, you lose control over them.  Somehow, I have become a sort of grounding force for your powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni groaned.  What Chrys said made perfect sense.  He didn't want to believe it, but seeing how he felt ever since yesterday--with and without Chrys--Chrys's solution seemed logical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do I do now?  I can't touch you all the time!  And it's not like we have all the same classes together!  What do I do at practice?  Oh man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's as dire as you're making it out to be, G.  After you touch me, I'm sure you're grounded for a while.  We just have to determine how long.  Plus, there's bound to be another way to ground your powers other than having to touch me.  We just have to figure out what it or they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any suggestions?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Giovanni was sound asleep when his radio alarm went off at 6 o'clock the following morning. It was Wednesday morning, and he knew that he had to get up to get ready to go to school. He knew that he could shower and get dressed in a matter of just a few minutes, thanks to his newly acquired super-speed, so he decided to just act a little lazy and stay in bed rather than to get up and get started. This was all just fine, until he began to hear a familiar voice ringing in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giovanni...\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\" the super-powered youth groaned, as he clenched his pillow with his hands and pulled the pillow closer towards him. Was he dreaming, or did he just hear Chrys's voice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I get a super-kid out of bed?\" her voice spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" Giovanni moaned, as he turned his head the other way while he held on to his pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... I can feel it... I can feel YOU...\" Chrys chuckled. \"I feel your powers, Giovanni... Wait... Wait a minute... I can USE your powers! I see everything you're seeing... I hear everything you're hearing... This is so COOL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni turned his head around and opened his eyes. He didn't see anybody in his bedroom, but when he glanced at his clock, he could tell that it was 6:09AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, champ... You've been in bed for nine minutes... Since your alarm went off... I need to get you out of bed...\" Chrys giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm?\" Giovanni groaned, wondering where her voice was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Giovanni was overcome by a familiar tingling sensation in his chest. The tingling feeling spread to his torso and to his legs. It didn't hurt at all, but it felt very comforting. In fact, Giovanni began to feel very light. He felt like he was... flying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni slowly opened his eyes and realized that his position on his bed hand changed. Had his bed moved up higher? His perspective had changed. Everything in his room seemed... lower. Then, when he looked down, his mouth dropped wide open. He was floating over three feet above his bed, with his sheets draped over him while he was still holding on to his pillow with his hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... What? I'm FLYING!\" he said out loud, realizing that he was hovering in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way to get a super-kid out of bed!\" he heard Chrys say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrys! Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at home! But we can communicate telepathically! Isn't that cool?\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're making me fly? How did you do that? You're using my powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni hovered over to the center of his bedroom. From there, his legs were suddenly lowered, so that his body was now suspended in the air but in the vertical position, with his feet pointed towards the ground. Finally, he descended slowly towards the ground until his feet landed on the hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for putting me down!\" Giovanni grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got you out of bed, using your own powers!\" Chrys spoke to him, using her psychic abilities. Only Giovanni could hear her voice ringing in his ears. \"Now, get dressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni raced into the bathroom and showered and got dressed. He raced into the kitchen and had breakfast, before flying to school. Chrys didn't need to wait long, for Giovanni arrived at school less than three minutes later after he had gotten out of bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Chrys first came to Giovanni's school, she took several tests so the principal and teachers could determine her placement in classes.  Being as smart as she was, she tested to the highest level in almost all subjects.  As a result, one of the few classes that Chrys and Giovanni had together was social studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, they were having a test on the American Revolutionary War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni was hard at work on his answers, chewing on his tongue and beating the eraser of his pencil against the desk, trying to remember the facts he very studiously stuffed into his brain last night.  Maybe he should start studying with Chrys from now on--she probably had great techniques for remembering dates and people and places.  Right now, he was trying to decide if it was \"one if by land, two if by sea\" or the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness, who wouldn't know the answer to that is George Washington?\" suddenly came into Giovanni's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh?</i> he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...the writer of the Declaration of Independence was--duh!--Thomas Jefferson!  Sheesh!  How much easier can she make these questions?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wha...?</i>  Giovanni looked down his test to the next several questions and saw that number 12 did indeed ask, \"Who was the writer of the Declaration of Independence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni looked over at the next chair and saw that Chrys was writing down her answer in her loopy, yet efficient manner--and she was answering question 12!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, number 13...,\" Giovanni heard as clear as bell in his mind, even though he was sure that Chrys said nothing out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, he was hearing Chrys's thoughts through their telepathy link--and she didn't even realize it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Giovanni was in a quandry:  should he be honest and tell Chrys he could hear her thoughts, including her answers to the test,...or should he keep quiet and try to block her out, which probably really wouldn't work since he didn't know how, and continue to hear her answers, which he knew would guarantee him an \"A\" on the test?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni sighed.  He knew he had to do the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Chrys?\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  Oh, gee, as if we didn't cover the answer to this question very extensively in class!  Besides, how many of us haven't seen \"The Patriot\" and know that the commander of the British forces in South Carolina was General Cornwallis?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, CHRYS!\" he thought really loudly.  \"I can hear everything you're thinking!  You're practically giving me all the answers to the test!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys suddenly looked up.  Her eyes widened as they looked straight into Giovanni's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you serious?\" she thought, biting her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he thought back sheepishly.  \"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys gave an audible sigh.  \"No, I'm the one who's sorry, G,\" she thought.  \"I'll try harder to not...project my thoughts out to you.  I guess I just got so excited over how easy this test was that my thoughts got out of hand.  Hey!\" she said suddenly, frowning at him.  \"You're not cheating off of me, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni's face reddened.  \"No!  Er...well...I'm not trying to, but you did give me a couple answers before I figured out what was going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys sighed again and shook her head.  \"No more cheating, soccer boy.  We only have ten more minutes to finish this test.  We better get writing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the test passed in silence, other than the scratching of pencils on paper.  Giovanni did hear the occasional sigh or grumble from Chrys in his mind, but he didn't hear anymore explicit answers to the test.  Giovanni managed to finish the test before the teacher called for pencils down.  Of course, Chrys had finished long before and had quadruple-checked all her answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell rang for lunch, Giovanni walked with Chrys to the cafeteria.  Chrys was holding her books close to her chest with her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrys?\" Giovanni asked uncertainly.  \"Are you okay?\"  Then, Giovanni noticed her face was red.  \"Are you embarrassed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys looked away and said quietly, \"Yes, okay?  I can't believe I gave you the answers to the test...just by thinking them loudly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay!  I knew the answers to those questions anyway.  And it's not like you were trying to give me the answers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys sighed and then turned her head back to look at Giovanni.  He smiled at her and put a friendly hand on her shoulder.  Chrys gave a small smile back.  \"Thanks for cheering me up, G.  You're...you're a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni shrugged his own shoulders in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found a table with some of Giovanni's soccer buddies and sat down to eat their home-brought lunches.  Giovanni pulled out two ham and cheese sandwiches, a bag of chips, an apple, a package of Twinkies, and a juice box.  Chrys, on the other hand, brought out several tupperware containers.  The first was full of veggies--carrots, celery, slices of green pepper and cucumber, and broccoli and cauliflower sprigs.  Another container was full of some tan-colored lumpy stuff that sort of looked like oatmeal, but didn't smell like oatmeal.  She also had several slices of fresh bread, numerous slices of fresh fruit, and a thermos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked on in wonder as Chrys started in on her meal, dunking her veggies in the brown stuff and taking delicate bites.  \"What are you eating?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  This is just some hummus I use to dip my veggies in.  Tastes really good!  Made of chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, and tahini, which is ground sesame seed paste.  You want to try some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys looked at each other with weird looks on their faces.  Giovanni didn't want his friend's feelings hurt, so he bravely said, \"I'll try some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\"  Chrys held out her tupperware of veggies, out of which Giovanni picked a baby carrot, then her tupperware of hummus, and Giovanni dipped his carrot in the tan stuff.  He bit off the carrot, chewed, and swallowed.  All the soccer guys looked at him expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not bad,\" Giovanni said.  \"Come on, guys, try some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the guys then willingly took a veggie, dipped it in the hummus, and ate.  They were all pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, G,\" Chrys said softly, giving him a small smile before taking a drink from her thermos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Chrys.  What are you drinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soy milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni couldn't help a grimace.  \"Are you allergic to regular milk, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys shrugged and took a bite of orange.  \"Don't know.  I've never had it.  My parents are vegan vegetarians, and so my sisters and I eat the same as they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's vegan vegetarian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know what vegetarian is, right?\"  Giovanni nodded.  \"Well, besides not eating meat, vegan vegetarians also don't eat dairy or eggs, or anything that's derived from animals.  My family even goes so far as to not wear any clothes made from animals or use products that were tested on animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  That sounds...um...strict.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys shrugged again and took a bite of bread.  \"I'm used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all ate in silence for a bit until Morgan decided to tell a joke.  He began to really get into his telling and moved his arms around excitedly.  Without realizing it, he flung his arm out and sent his box of milk flying across the table--straight for Chrys!  Chrys saw it coming straight for her and instinctively crossed her arms over her face.  She waited a few seconds, but never felt anything hit her.  Slowly, she lowered her arms and was surprised to see the milkbox and its spewed contents of milk suspended in the air, frozen in time!  Everyone else at the table, including Giovanni, were looking at the frozen box and milk with wide eyes, in surprise and wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...!\"<br>\r\n\"What...!\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\"<br>\r\n\"Dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni looked at Chrys, and Chrys looked back.  \"Did I...just do that?!\" Chrys thought to Giovanni.  \"Did I just use one of your powers?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni shook his head and looked back at the suspended milk droplets.  \"If you did,\" he thought back to her, \"it's a power I never realized before!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That Saturday Morning, the Phantoms were playing against the Vipers at Meridian Park Soccer Complex, field number 2. All eleven boys had showed up for the game, and the coach had decided to start his best six players on the field at the beginning of the game. Of course, this included Liam, Morgan and Giovanni, who was their top defender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Phantoms were dressed up in their usual green jerseys and green socks with black shorts and their black cleats with the long, green socks hiding their shin guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Coach assigned who would play offense and who would play defense, and Giovanni started out on defense in the first half. The Phantoms started out strong right away, and Morgan scored the first two goals for the team during the first quarter already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring halftime, the Coach moved things around, and put Giovanni on offense, moving him to the front so that he had to attack the other team's goal. As soon as the referee blew the whistle, he moved up with Morgan and Liam, passing the ball between them, while the players of the other team tried to take the ball away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, the ball got kicked out, and the player from the Vipers would kick the ball from the corner. He kicked the ball high over the players, making it head towards Giovanni but it would almost pass him by unless he would leap in the air and knock the ball forward using his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni did exactly that: He leaped into the air, just high enough, that he almost made it reaching high enough to reach the height of the ball with his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys, who was watching from the sidelines, saw what was happening and became nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! He's not going to make it! He needs to jump a little... Higher!\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Giovanni was airborne, he suddenly felt a tingling throughout his body and realized that his body was ascending just a few inches more, like he was... flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball bounced off his forehead just in time, before he came back down to the ground and landed with his cleats on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball landed in front of him and a player on the other team caught the ball using his feet. He tried to drive the ball towards their goal, but the defenders managed to stop them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Giovanni and another player from the Vipers fought over the ball, until Giovanni managed to break away and get the ball away from the crowd. he broke free and charged towards the Vipers' goal, all by himself, with all other players running after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he kicked the ball hard towards the goal, and the ball bounced off the left goal post, spinning hard just before the entrance to the goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness! The ball should have gone in!\" Chrys gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, while the ball was still spinning around it's axis, the ball rolled into the goal, catching the goalie completely off-guard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Look at that! Goal! GOALLLL!!!!!\" Chrys cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How did he do that?\" one of the players on the other team wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did I do that? I can't remember using my powers on the ball! What on earth?\" Giovanni pondered, as he stood there, staring at the goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh... We scored but.... That was a bit unintentional....\" Chrys grinned, as she placed her hand in front of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the match was over, Giovanni walked over to Chrys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Uhh... I think I'm getting too good at using your powers, G...\" Chrys said sadly. She felt a little embarrassed over the secret assistance she had given the team by using Giovanni's powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry... We would have beaten them anyway... The score was 6-2 for us!\" Giovanni grinned. \"So it wouldn't have mattered...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... whew... You're not mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw... It's fine!\" Giovanni replied. \"I just want to get some cold water to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys  has seen a water fountain by the entrance to the field, So, she concentrated on the place where she had seen the fountain, and she made Giovanni disappear! The soccer player vanished and reappeared again, standing by the water fountain, near the entrance to the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni pressed the button on the fountain and he took a few sips of water. Chrys sensed when he was done drinking the water, and she made him vanish from the location and she made Giovanni reappear where she was standing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Had fun being teleported?\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You did that so fast, I didn't even feel it!\" Giovanni grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can teleport you anywhere and anytime!\" Chrys smiled. \"I'm in charge of your location!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it...\" Giovanni grinned, as he just stared at her in awe...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he groggily looked down, he realized that his flying power had kicked in, and he was flying about three feet above his mattress with his sheets draped over his back while he was still clinging with his hands to his pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmmm Chrys....\" he moaned, as he slowly woke up while Chrys allowed him to gently descend until he landed back on his bed. \"I'm awake... I'm up, I'm up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only way to wake up a super-kid like you, G.!\" he heard her voice ringing in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni quickly stumbled out of bed, collected his clothes, and ran into the bathroom so he could brush his teeth and take a shower. When he had dried off, he got dressed and combed his hair. Then he raced into the kitchen and prepared a bowl of cereal, beating out his brother Marco as usual. Giovanni was now much faster at getting dressed in the morning, and he easily beat his older brother at getting ready for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the soccer star grabbed his backpack and dashed out the door. No sooner had he started walking down the street, or the familiar sidewalk and street by his house had suddenly morphed into the entrance to the schoolyard and the path leading to the big double doors leading to the building where all the classrooms were. It all changed in a blink of an eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! How did I get here so fast? I wasn't even running!\" the soccer player gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, welcome to school, G.!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni turned around and was facing none other than Chrys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you teleported me to school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" the girl sighed, as she stared at the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to get you over here early so I could ask you a big favor!\" Chrys said to him. \"I need someone to help me run a small stand for selling Girl Scout cookies after school. We're setting up a table at a gas station across the street from the Premier Bank down the street!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni stared at her for a moment, still pondering the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wear your soccer uniform... Please?\" she pleaded with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Alright... I'll do it!\" Giovanni grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU!\" Chrys cheered, as she embraced the boy and almost squeezed the life out of him. \"I'll teleport you to the locker room so you can change. After that, I'll send you over there so you can join me! Don't worry, you just need to sit there and keep me company, okay? You don't have to do a THING! I'll make sure you'll get there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni just grinned. Ever since Chrys has discovered the ability to teleport him all over the place, she has been making him pop up at school and back at home as soon as school was over. He hasn't been to school at all! She has been making sure he has been showing up everywhere he needed to be, so he really couldn't complain about it. So, he just saw this as an opportunity to help her out and, after all, this was a little fundraiser for a good cause. Lastly, she was in control of his location anyway, so he really couldn't argue with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Giovanni disappeared from where he was standing and found himself standing right in front of his locker. She knew that he always stopped at his locker first, to gather his books for class. Then, after he had gotten the books for that dday, he teleported again, and found himself in class, sitting next to Chrys just in time for the bell to ring, indicating the start of the first period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class was over, Chrys was send him to the locker room, where he would change into his soccer uniform. From there, she would send him to the gas station, where a table was set up for Chrys and Giovanni so they could sell the cookies for a few hours that afternoon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Giovanni playfully grabbed all the boxes and stacked them up neatly in the form of a pyramid on the small table while Chrys sat down and counted the amount of change in her metal lockbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Giovanni sat down, he suddenly just stared ahead of him with a serious look on his face. Chrys noticed this, and asked him what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling weak\u2026 Kinda empty\u2026 Almost like I don\u2019t have my powers anymore\u2026\u201d Giovanni said, as he grabbed a rock off the ground and tried to crush it using his strength. To his surprise, he was no longer able to crush it to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, G.?\u201d Chrys asked him. \u201cOf course you still have your powers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have my strength anymore! I lost all my powers! I\u2019m normal again!\u201d he repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrys just stared at him and give him a strange look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that at all! In fact, I sense that you got all your powers! Just look down at the ground for a sec!\u201d she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni stared at the concrete sidewalk when suddenly heat vision rays fired from his eyes, striking the concrete!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! I didn\u2019t do that!\u201d Giovanni gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo but I did!\u201d Chrys laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 But\u2026 Wait\u2026 Let me try\u2026\u201d Giovanni said, as he looked down at the sidewalk and narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it! Why can\u2019t I make my own heat vision work?\u201d Giovanni wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh my! I know! I know it!\u201d Chrys replied. \u201cYou have all your super powers but\u2026 You lost all control over them! You can\u2019t control your powers anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Who controls them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do! I have complete control over all your powers!\u201d Chrys smiled. \u201cI have to make you use your powers and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the two teens heard a gunshot coming from the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni then stood up and looked towards the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrys! We got to do something! I think that bank is being robbed!\u201d he said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you out, G.! First, let\u2019s turn on your invulnerability and your super speed!\u201d Chrys ordered. \u201cNow run to front door of the bank and go see what is going on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni then ran across the street at super speed! He was so fast, that he just turned into a blur as he flashed to the other side of the road. Luckily, Chrys was able to communicate with him telepathically.  When Giovanni reached the front door of the bank, Chrys was able to see where he was through his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse x-ray vision to see through the walls!\u201d Chrys ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni\u2019s x-ray vision kicked in, revealing one masked man holding a gun pointed at a teller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun to the department store down the street and see if they sell any rope!\u201d Chrys ordered, as she sent Giovanni to the large Walmart down the street. Giovanni turned around and raced to the large store, arriving there in a second! He raced inside and flashed over to the hardware section, where he found a pack containing a ten-foot rope. Then he raced out of the store containing the rope, and ran back to the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, run into the bank and tie up the robber!\u201d Chrys ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni opened the doors and placed the rope around the robber. He tied him up and wrapped the rope around him, tying him up so fast, that he didn\u2019t have time to move or fire his gun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, come back over here!\u201d Chrys ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni then raced back to the cookie stand across the street, just as the police cars pulled up, as the officers ran out and arrested the robber who was found all tied up in the middle of the bank. Nobody could explain that it was a boy in a soccer uniform who had run into the bank and who had tied up the robber because he did it so fast, it wasn\u2019t seen by anyone and it was caught on the security camera as a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrys!\u201d Giovanni said to her. \u201cYoudidit!Youhelpedmecatchthebankrobber!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops! Let me slow you down, G.! Back to normal speed!\u201d Chrys laughed, grinning at the idea that she was in control of Giovanni\u2019s speed. Giovanni was unable to slow down on his own since he was doing everything at super speed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer player blinked as he was now back to \u201cnormal\u201d speed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did it! You helped me catch the bank robber!\u201d Giovanni cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to hear you talking at normal speed again, G.!\u201d Chrys smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah! I gotta get used to the idea that you control my powers\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying it!

Morgan and Liam would be together about now, you thought, they always visited each other after practise, you couldn't help feel sorry for Morgan, he had always been, the one who never fit, and as such he was constantly bullied at school, the teachers help, but one managed to slip under the radar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, he wished that they were here with him now, he sighed, and then something strange happened, he could hear Morgan's voice, it must have been his imagination, no he could still hear it, you jumped to your feet and started running round the room searching for the source, but there was no one in the room but you, and then it got stranger,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could now hear Liam's voice as well, \"Am I going mad you screamed\", suddenly both voices fell silent, and then you heard them again, as plain as day \"What was that\" Liam said, \"It sounded like Giovanni\" Morgan replied, \"He must be here\" Liam said, they could hear him as well, how was this possible, you closed your eyes and concentrated,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam, Morgan\" you thought, \"Giovanni?\" they both replied, \"Where are you?\" you heard Morgan say, \"At home\" you said, you sense the two confusion when a forth voice spoke up, \"What's happening\" said Jake, the four of you got into a frantic conversation, panicking you knew that this was just to weird, \"Listen listen\" you shouted, \"Lets meet somewhere, I can\u2019t stand talking to someone who I can't see\" the others agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four you met outside of town, in the abandoned quarry, each one of you were panicking, you could feel it, you all sat down to think about this, now that you were together, it was much easier to hear each other's thoughts, after several minutes, Jake looked up, he had noticed something, \"Guys\" he said, \"Is it just me or are we slightly bigger than we used to be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked up, and found he was right, all of us, looked slightly more muscular than we were this afternoon, \"What's happening to use\" Liam shrieked, he jumped to his feet, and kicked a small boulder, in anger, the boulder went flying. All four stared in surprise, we all ran over to it, Liam bent down and lifted it up with one hand, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the hint you bent down and lifted another boulder up, you were shocked at how light it was, it was like lifting a football, you handed it to Jake, who passed it to Morgan, all of you were the same, you were all now so strong, Liam ran over, with a little difficulty he lifted up a huge boulder it must have weighed about five hundred pounds, he lifted it up above his head with both arms, smiling he started walking towards the edge of the cliff, clearly planning to throw it off, but as he did, his arms started to strain, sweat poured down his head, he losing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly we ran over to him, but as we got there, he stopped looking strained, confused we stood there, Liam said \"Walk away again\", we did, after about ten feet he started to strain again, he hurled the boulder off the cliff and ran back to use, \"Interesting\" Jake said, \"it appears these powers get stronger, the closer we are to each other\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood there, confused and shocked, how had we got these powers? After a few minutes Jake spoke again \"I wonder if any of are other physical attributes have increased as well he said, getting up he started running on the sport, as he did the rest of us watching in amazement, his legs were moving with such a speed we could barely see him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam, also interested jumped to his feet, he stopped for a moment as if deep in thought, then something must of hit him, he then proceeded to do a perfect back flip, Morgan curious also got to his feet, stretching he proceeded to run towards the fence, at the last minute he jumped, clearing it, it was clear that it wasn't just are muscles that had got more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more experiments, it also turned out there senses had increased as well, they now had acute hearing, sight and smell, and all of them were still at loss, as how they had gained these powers, but they didn't really mind, they continued to examine their new found gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys have:<br>\r\nGreat (Not {yet?} superhuman) strength<br>\r\nGreat speed<br>\r\nPeak of human agility<br>\r\nEnhanced Sight, hearing and (sense of) smell<br>\r\nTelepathy (Among each other)<br>\r\nAnd there presence, gives each other strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they gain any other powers?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It became the game around school to try to get him to open up. A few bullies in school often stepped out of their way to pester him as he never did so said anything to stop their antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kid needs help.\" James had said one day. \"Maybe I can get him on the soccer team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, man.\" Giovanni had replied. \"You'll need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames first approached Todd ten days ago and gained little ground but like a true soccer player, he pressed his momentum and finally reached him on the fifth day. It turned out that Todd was a country boy, not used to the big city. Thanks to some friendly persistence on Jame's part, the two became close friends and James talked Todd into participating in a soccer practice that fateful night....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Todd woke up, he felt rather strange but he quickly shook it off when he saw the other boys, lying unconscious on the playing field. \"James?\" he said, rocking his body. \"James!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, James and the other boys began to stir and pull themselves off the ground. \"That was too weird.\" said James, standing up and looking around. \"What the devil could have happened to make us all fall unconscious at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" replied Todd, honestly. \"I woke up feeling a little odd, you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I just got off a roller coaster.\" said Giovanni. \"You, James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same.\" replied James, honestly. \"Only my roller coaster had rockets on it, what a rush!\" he looked at the others, slowly standing up, just as confused. \"What happened to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen thunder was heard in the distance and all looked up to see a powerful storm coming in. \"I think we had better try to figure that out later.\" said Todd. \"That storm looks bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was in agreement and they all walked back into town, parting ways as they all headed home. Todd, just as curious as the others, began to try to piece things together in his head. \"Maybe we were all electrocuted by a lightning strike hitting the grass.\" he mussed. \"We were so wrapped up in the game, we didn't even hear the storm coming until it was on top of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought seemed sound but Todd suspected there was more to it and found himself too distracted to even notice that it had begun to pour down rain. As he walked across the street, the sound of a car horn reached his ears and Todd quickly jumped aside. He did not realize where he had jumped to until he looked about, startled to find that he was now ten feet from the road! The car who's horn he had heard came to a stop, it was hydroplaning and blew the red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" asked the driver, though the open driver's side window. \"That was quite a leap, are you a gymnast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Country boy.\" replied Todd, shyly. \"I use to live around bulls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver smiled. \"I guess you would have to move fast around them.\" he said. \"Sorry I spooked you, can I offer you a ride home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd politely shook his head. \"My house is only two doors down from here, thank you.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver nodded and continued on his way while Todd took the final few yards to his front door and walked inside, slightly shaken by the events of the day. \"Even when dealing with bulls I could never jump <i>that</i> far.\" he whispered to himself, shaking his head. \"What a strange day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd moved to climb the stairs so to take a shower but found himself on the top of the stairwell before even remembering touching the first step. Bewildered and a little frightened, he walked to his bedroom and grabbed a fresh set of clothing then walked into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Curiouser and curiouser.\"</i> he thought. <i>\"Welcome to wonderland, Todd, I wonder how deep this rabbit hole goes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his shower, Todd walks out, fully dressed and feeling refreshed. Still, he was a bit shaken by the recent happenings and decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girl gave a short scream, he did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" said Todd, shaken. \"Ever since that practice game, weird things have been happening to me, to everyone who was there and I'm guessing you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, shaken as well, shook her head. \"I... I can't remember.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd sighed then looked about the room for some clues. It seemed to have been a typical bedroom, suited for a little girl of around seven or eight. The walls were painted a light pink, a canopy bed with princess style sheets was against one wall with a vanity/makeup center and dresser against another. The third wall was dominated by stuffed animals and dolls of various types and sizes... <i>\"Just your ordinary girl's room.\"</i> he thought. Then, on the vanity,  he spotted a small purse. \"May I?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded and Todd proceeded to dump the purse's contents onto the bed. Among them was a school ID with the girl's photo and name. \"You are Sarah Walker.\" you said, showing her the ID card. \"You live here and, since I do not remember ever seeing you, I'm guessing you just recently moved into the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at the ID card, curiously. \"I am Sarah Walker.\" she said. \"But why can't I remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd thought for a moment. \"Whatever happened to us, it knocked us out for a few minutes.\" he said, finally. \"Maybe, because you are a few years younger, you became overwhelmed and lost your memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, I guess.\" said Sarah. \"How do I get my memory back, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In most cases, I have read, memory losses are only temporary.\" said Todd, trying to be comforting. \"Give it some time, maybe it will all come back to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, from outside Sarah's bedroom door, a kind, feminine voice called, \"Sarah, who are you talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned to you, uncertain. \"Answer her.\" you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I invited a friend over from across the street.\" replied Sarah, calling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a tall, attractive woman walked in and smiled, upon seeing you. \"Todd, I didn't see you come in.\" she said, surprised. \"What were you two talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked at the woman, you immediately recognized her as the new appointed coach to the school's soccer team, Miss Kelly Walker. Only you had no idea, at the time, where she lived or that she had a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Miss Walker.\" you said. \"Sarah called me a few minutes ago, upset, I came here to see if I could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly turned to Sarah, concerned, then saw her purse, emptied out on the bed. \"Sarah, what happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah teared up a little and Todd jumped in. \"Something happened to me and the soccer team during the practice game earlier today.\" he explained. \"Whatever it was, it knocked us all out for a few minutes, you can call and ask anyone on the team, they'll verify my words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly, looked at Todd, stunned. \"Were any of you injured?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stunned and and disoriented.\" replied Todd. \"I remembered seeing Sarah in the bleachers, watching the game but I did not know who she was at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't seem to remember anything.\" said Sarah, now crying. \"I found his phone number somewhere and called him for help, he... he was nice enough to come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kelly turned to Sarah's dresser, where a pink telephone was resting, a thin black book appeared, which she recognized as her team roster book, holding the names and phone numbers of the team members. \"Excuse me a moment.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked over to the dresser and opened the rooster book to find a note in James' handwriting. It stated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If you need help, call Todd Levague, he's real good.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly sighed. \"How many times did I tell those kids not to write in this book?\" she muttered. \"Oh, well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Todd. \"May I assume you emptied Sarah's purse to find her ID?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did.\" replied Sarah, holding up her school ID. \"He did nothing wrong, err, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Kelly sighed. \"Yes, I'm your mom.\" she replied patiently. \"I am taking you...\" she pointed at Todd. \"... and you to the hospital right now, call your family and let them know so they can meet us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd swallowed. \"Yes, ma'am.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly touched his shoulder. \"If you are going to be on my team, I have one rule.\" she said. \"If anything bad happens, tell me right away so we can do something about it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd managed a smile. \"Okay... coach.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One hour later, a doctor finally approached them, introducing himself as Dr Dan Hal. \"Any word on their condition, doctor?\" asked Kelly, concerned. \"Are they going to be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Hal sighed. \"The tests showed signs of a massive shock to their systems.\" he replied. \"Not enough to cause any permanent damage but enough to cause heavy disorientation or, in Miss Walker's case, temporary memory loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea what caused this shock to their systems?\" asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Hal crossed his arms politely. \"A major storm hit the southern end of town.\" he said. \"It carried dozens of lightning strikes per square mile and spawned at least two tornadoes. It's possible that the boys and the young lady were all effected my a massive lightning strike from that storm as the soccer field was just at the edge of the storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they will recover.\" said Kelly, relieved. \"That's good to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be fine.\" said Dr Hal with a smile. \"Just make sure they take it easy for a while and have the other players get themselves checked out as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to call all of their parents.\" said Kelly. \"I'm their new coach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the hospital with a clean bill of health but a concerned mind, Todd and Sarah both decided to keep their strange experiences to themselves.

He was short for his age of ten with longish black hair and green eyes but he was very well built, which was more than a compensation as he was very good at the game of soccer. He had got up from bed to run to the bathroom, feeling sick to his stomach but he did not make it. He saw a sickening skin colored puke fly out from his mouth but screamed as he felt it also coming out of his rear, his eyes, his ears, every orifice of his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's happening to me!?\"</i> he thought, panicking. <i>\"Am I going to die?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the thought entered his head, Tex found that he suddenly no longer felt ill. In fact, he could think of a time he felt any better, which confused him greatly. Upon looking at his hands, however, that ill feeling returned as he saw that his hands were at least three times larger than they should have been. <i>\"What the hell!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex turned to a full length mirror and saw that he had somehow become a giant adult version of himself with muscles that would make any body builder envious. He looked at his new form in shock for a moment, wondering how this could have happened and why. Then, the telephone rang, distracting Tex and his new form instantly melted away, somehow pulling itself back into his body,returning him to normal. The change back left him feeling slightly weak but no longer ill as he then slowly picked up the telephone. \"He...

On the other hand, he knew that the soccer coach would be very upset with him, if he didn\u2019t go. Furthermore, he would look really stupid if all the other guys on the team would go to the hospital, and he would end up as the only guy who didn\u2019t. What if the doctor kept a list of all the boys who showed up, and those who didn\u2019t? Surely there was a roster of the team floating around, with his name on it. So, after a few moments of careful thought, he realized it was better to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex walked to the garage and opened the door, and pulled out his racing bike. Then he put on his biking shorts and sneakers and rode off to the clinic where Dr. Hall was waiting for him and where he was seeing the other guys who were on the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily there wasn\u2019t much of a wait at the clinic where the doctor worked at. The doctor saw Tex almost right away, and the nurse led him into the examination room almost immediately. She took his temperature and his blood pressure, before the doctor saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the doctor did ask him some general questions about that strange afternoon at the soccer field, Tex decided to remain silent about the strange muscular growth spurt. He got a business card and promised the doctor to call him in case anything unusual came up, or if anything strange happened to him, or if he had any pain. The doctor released Tex with a clean bill of health, and the teen happily left the office and walked out, jumping on his bike and riding his way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex had just gotten home, feeling hungry and thirsty from spending over an hour on the road and hanging out at the hospital. He decided to make for himself a peanut butter sandwich and a glass of milk in the kitchen, while watching a music show on TV. His parents weren\u2019t home since they were both working the late shift, so he didn\u2019t expect them home for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen boy had no idea what was about to happen that afternoon as he sat on the couch, watching his favorite TV show while he had the house all to himself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only, in that one second of super strength, his hand had ripped the refrigerator door clean off and was hanging loose in his hand. Tex let out a surprised scream, dropping the door and backed away to one wall. \"Oh, man!\" he said, leaning one hand against the wall. \"How am I going to explain <i>this</i> to mom and dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HICCUP!* Again Tex hulked out for a second again but that was all it took for his hand to plow clear through the wall, into the living room, leaving a large hole. He screamed a second time then ran for the sink to get a glass of water. \"I have to stop these hiccups before I completely destroy the house!\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the cold water tap to pour a glass then... *HICCUP!*... the cold water tap was ripped from the sink and the heavy ceramic mug was now powder in his hands, crushed by his temporary colossal strength. \"No!, No!, No!\" he wailed, frustrated. \"This is a nightmare, mom and dad are going to 'kill' me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to stop the hiccups that were causing his split second hulking out, Tex began to drink the water that was shooting from the cold water tap but stopped as heard the breaking of glass. He turned to see a tall man, wearing all black break his way into the house, holding a crow bar. a small grin formed on his face....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, the entire house was trashed, due to Tex chasing the panicked robber around the house while he had his 'monster hiccups'. Tex finally was able to slowly down a tall glass of water as mom and dad walked in to find the robber, tied up on the floor with their son, looking bruised and beaten. Tex took a few hits from the robber when he was not hulking out but quickly abandoned that idea as it only made Tex hit him even harder after a hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world!?!\" asked mom, turning pale. \"Tex, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll live.\" replied Tex, acting frightened. \"This psycho broke in and attacked me, the police are on their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did good, son.\" said Tex's dad. \"I'm proud to see you can defend the fort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex smiled. \"Thanks, dad.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Tex thought about what had happened to him then wondered if any of his team mates had been effected like he was.

As he listened to the ring tones, he wondered what, if any, strange events had occurred to him. \"Come on, man.\" he whispered. \"Answer already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes earlier, James, who was desperately trying to filter out the thoughts of people passing his house as he worked on cleaning out a large room in his finished basement. This room, which was used for storage, had a hidden door which his family had all but forgot about. He sighed as he carried the first box out but became confused as he returned to find the box he was going to take next was missing. <i>\"What?\"</i> He turned around and jumped to find it next to the first box he had moved only a moment ago. <i>\"okay... weird...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off, James took another box and carried it out and placed it next to the other two, making it three boxes out of the room. Only, just as he turned around, he heard something and turned back to find there were now six boxes in the pile. By this time, he was more than a little concerned as he was certain he was home alone at the time. \"Who's there!?\" he demanded to no one. \"Show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer came and James swallowed hard. <i>\"I don't like this.\"</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*I got to move these boxes*</i> he heard, in his mind. <i>*This one's heavy, give me hand.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, James spun around and let out a scream as he found four more boxes, including one that looked very heavy, in another corner of the wall he was moving the boxes to. Sweat began to bead on his forehead as he suddenly felt as if he was trapped in some sort of horror movie. He looked all around him, fearful of what he might find as he returned to the room he was trying to clear out to find that all thirty four boxes had been removed from the room. All that was left was to sweep it out and add some carpet and furniture from another storage room in the basement.  As he moved the broom across the concrete floor, a large amount of dust flew into the air, causing him to sneeze. As he did, a chorus of voices rang out, \"Gesundheit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames screamed the turned around to find there was no one, let alone a number of people behind him. Frightened and confused, he sat down in one corner and began to cry. \"What's happening to me!?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just like out of a horror movie, eleven versions of himself appeared, sitting against the wall of the room. They all had the same frightened look on their faces as they repeated his question. \"What's happening to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked James and his copies at the same time. \"I asked you first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\" screamed James, throwing his hands into the air. \"One at a time!\" he drew a breath to calm himself. \"I am James Hagen, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the copies replied. \"I am James Hagen the second.... I am James Hagen the third... I am James Hagen the forth... I am James Hagen the fifth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it!\" said James, holding his head as if it ached. \"Mind you, this is just a guess but I'm thinking I have developed the power to clone myself on top of reading other people's minds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to suggest the same thing.\" said the other copies in unison. \"Of course, that makes sense as we obviously share the same mind.\" they all paused then asked, \"How do you propose we 'pull ourselves together'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question, maybe you all came about because I had wished for some help to complete this task.\" mussed James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, once we complete the task, will return to having one body.\" the copies said, finishing the thought. \"Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and his copies worked together to complete the task, surprisingly sharing a pleasant conversation, and had finished in a fraction of the time James had originally expected. \"Thanks for the help, guys.\" said James, looking at the meeting room they had put together. \"Now the team and I... err... we have a place to meet in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was our pleasure.\" replied the copies in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they vanished, returning to the nothingness they were spawned from. \"Talk about being a one man team.\" said James with a chuckle. \"I wonder what powers the other guys discovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the telephone rang...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was slightly disappointed that the entire team did not show up but perked up a little when Giovanni told him that they had called and would be late. \"Well, we have enough players to run some drills.\" said Jake. \"We'll all take turns trying to get a ball passed James, using our powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\" said James, taking up his position. \"Just bear in mind, I don't have super strength so take it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll try.\" grinned Tex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Giovanni, you're first.\" said Jake. \"Let's see what we can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni nodded then moved the into position, kicking it lightly with his feet as he went. Then, suddenly, he gave a low grunt of effort and kicked the ball. A thunderous boom was heard upon impact and the ball flew towards the goal with the speed of a cannon ball!  James' eyes widened in shock but he reacted quickly and went after the ball. The the others, it looked as if James was moving in a blur as he clones jumped forward with each step, reaching the ball and pushing it away from the goal, just in time. Giovanni's jaw dropped in shock, both from the power of his kick and the skill James used to block it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible, James!\" he yelled, excited. \"Anyone else would not have have seen that one coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled. \"Well, I do have an extra twenty  two eyes helping me watch my goal.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all eleven of his clones appeared and yelled out, in unison, \"Next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex shook his head. \"Okay, wise guys.\" he said. \"Try blocking my kick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clones vanished and James waved him on, smiling. \"Come on, Tex.\" he challenged. \"Lt's see what you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex laughed then summoned his muscular form, startling the entire group. \"Not bad huh?\" he said, flexing his muscles. \"Eat your heart out footballers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should tone that down a bit.\" said Jake, wincing. \"This is a boys' team, you look more like an adult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex nodded then concentrated, reducing to his normal size but clearly holding a powerful physique. \"Is this better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" said Jake, giving a thumbs up. \"Give your strength a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex smiled then began to kick the ball towards the goal before giving it a heavy kick. Like before, there was a thunderous boom upon impact of his foot and the ball hurled towards the goal at impossible speeds. James, sensing this was going to be harder to stop, tried something. All of his clones appeared, for just a second, then reentered his body, making him twelve times as powerful and easily pushed the ball away from the goal. Like Giovanni, Tex's jaw dropped to the sheer power of his kick and the easy James stopped it. Only, he smiled as James' clones reappeared, shaking their hands, declaring, \"Ow!\" before vanishing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems as if you're a little stronger than Giovanni, Tex.\" said Jake. \"But he's better at maneuvering the ball so you're both about even.\" he then cracked his knuckles. \"Its my turn now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Jake kicked the ball into position and gave it a hard hit. Only the soccer ball, having taken two massive hits already, gave under the kick and exploded on impact of his foot. The deflated ball screamed towards the goal like a missile and James made his best effort to catch it but it slipped passed him and tore through the net. It then kept going, slamming into the bleachers, several yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" said Jake, blushing. \"I guess we better get the spare ball.\" he cleared his throat, seeing James blushing as well. \"Don't worry, man, if the ball had not exploded, I'm sure you would have blocked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a spare ball.\" said Todd, appearing near Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake jumped slightly, then smiled as he remembered Todd had the ability to teleport.. \"Thanks, Todd.\" he said. \"Lets move on to..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wonder if the same thing happened to the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were all hit, Hanson felt his body rising rather than falling and woke up on the roof of the building rather than on the soccer field. At first, he panicked, wondering how he could have ended up there but that did not last long as he jumped up to get his friends' attention to find himself sailing high into the air...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In other words, he had no idea how to LAND and remain with both feet firmly planted on the ground! Something in the back of his mind told him that this would never happen again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew back to the field and tried to land on both cleats. As soon as he touched down on the grass, his cleats would soon start to hover a few inches above the field again! As he looked down, he would gasp to find that he was quietly floating in mid-air the whole time, even if he was only an inch above the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck? Why is it that I can't land?\" he groaned, as he concentrated even harder on landing and STAYING on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to land again, this time, his cleats would almost bounce into the air as soon as they touched the grass! It almost felt as if he was weightless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he extended his arms above his head, he began to soar into the air, flying faster and faster! In fact, he had to concentrate on slowing down, because he almost panicked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I guess I'm supposed to be flying all the time!\" he wondered, as he flew back to his field. Since most guys had left by now, he just decided to fly home, which was okay since he would meet up with the team the next day anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home, he hovered into his room, removed his uniform and jumped into the shower. Afterwards, he dried off and put on shorts and a t-shirt, doing all of this while floating about an inch above the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it dawned on him. He had gotten so used to flying, that he didn't even think about it anymore. But, what would they say at school? How could he play soccer, hovering above the field? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, he went to sleep on his bed. He slept great, except when he woke up in the middle of the night and finding himself floating three feet above his mattress...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He floated just a few inches off the ground to make it look as if he were standing on the ground then began to kick the ball around. It was dark but he could see well enough. Wearing his cleats, more out of habit, he began to kick the ball from goal to goal, running drills. It did not take Hanson long to realize that with no friction from the ground to slow him down, he could move very fast on the field as he went from one end of the field to the other in no time at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible!\" laughing, he said. \"I'm literally running in the air!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPracticing more, Hanson also discovered that he could make the ball float slightly above the ground as well, meaning he could move it faster as well. He tried an over the head kick and was surprised that he was able to do it right every time as he had the ability to fly. He had so much fun, practicing that he did not realize that the sun had rose and stopped as he saw the rest of his soccer team, smiling at him. \"Um... hi, guys.\" nervous, he said. \"I guess you're wondering how I can float above the ground like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd Levague shook his head then vanished from where he was to appear in front of Hanson, causing him to jump slightly. \"Not really.\" smiling, Todd said. \"We all found that we have powers after passing out on the field before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all have powers?\" surprised, Hanson asked. the other nodded and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Todd did not have to teleport out of the way. He caught the punch and twisted the wrist before pulling the teenager's arm behind his back and pushing him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are pathetic.\" Serious, he said. \"We're just kids on our world. Our parents eat bullies like you for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a human expression meaning the bullies would be no match for the adults of their world but the teenage had no knowledge of this and stared at Todd with his eyes wide in momentary fear before covering it up with a nervous laugh. \"Your parents aren't here though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because we are all that's needed.\" Smiling, Hanson said. \"You are a waste of time to the adults of our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all that was needed to make the teenager's face turn red. \"Fine!\" Angry, he spat. \"We accept your challenge, <i>Phantoms</i>! One football game to determine the fate of this world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We win, you leave the planet and never return.\" Serious, James said. \"If you do return, you face our adults.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we win, you leave and never return.\" Scowling, the teenager said. \"That and your adults stay away too or we invade your world next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan could not help scoff at that considering their greatest weapon seemed to be nothing more than heavy soccer balls. \"You are welcome to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager frowned. \"The name is Kiev.\" Softly, he said. \"Remember it as it will be me who will make the winning score.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Famous last words.\" Softly, Liam countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiev shuddered at that, not knowing the meaning of the human expression and walked away, taking the other teenagers with him. Once they were gone, all of the Terrans cheered and hugged each other with tears of joy flowing from their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have managed a great victory today.\" Smiling, Mia said. \"All thanks to you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not over yet.\" Serious, James said. \"We know these types of bullies. they will use every dirty trick in the book to win the up coming game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we will all need to prepare.\" Confident, Giovanni said. \"Gather your people, we have a plan but we will need everyone's help.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Since he was close to his older sister, Laura, Todd felt that she would be the best one to have a conversation.  After all, she was a high school jock on her State championship softball team in her High School days.  she was always stronger than Todd but Todd didn't care. He liked her and she looked after him whenever she could. Right now Laura was taking some classes at the community college in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had no classes that day but was trying to do some studying. Todd stood by her door and knocked twice. She turned and smiled ' Hello, Todd. How are you? I can use a short break.I have been studying for a hour now. Do you need to talk'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded indicating YES. He said to her 'I-I-I think that something strange happened to me. It may be hard to explain.' Laura asked  'Do you want to tell me more'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd said \" I think that I better show you instead. Let's go in our backyard and I can show you'<br>\r\nWhen both Laura and Todd went outside, Todd wondered what to say or do.<br>\r\nSuddenly Todd heard something in his mind, he heard her thinking<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><i><span class=\"chunter\"> I do not like Professor Snale in my Math class.
