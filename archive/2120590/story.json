There's no going back to how things used to be, so you don't think about it much, besides, often time you're far too busy helping your dad at the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only crop that grew in the dry, cracked earth were these small brown things called tatoes. Most travelers say that tatoe stew tastes horrible, but the taste didn't bother you since you were eating these things your entire life. Your father is kind and loving, despite the horrible weather and uncertainty of the harvest, your father always stays positive. You never knew your mother, and every time you mentioned her around your dad he started getting sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and the are these things called furries. They apparently appeared shortly after the world screwed up, and they look like human/animal hybrids.  Some are peaceful and helpful, others not so much. There's this gang of female furries that constantly harasses your settlement, forcing it to pay ransom, and if they don't have enough money the gang kidnaps one of the settlers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now...</span></div></div>",

Great beasts roamed the land, tribes of humans and furries struggled to create an existence for themselves with the mightiest weapon known to them: a rock.  Yes!  The great rock!  When held by anyone, it can become a hammer, a bludgeon, a projectile, the possibilities are endless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until Urk discovered clothes 100,000 years from now, but his story isn't important here!

For you see, furry birth rates aren't like humans.  Where humans have a roughly 50-50 gender ratio, furries have a 99-1 gender ratio, meaning that males are so rare, they are never allowed to do anything remotely dangerous for fear of them hurting themselves and dooming a tribe to extinction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd David just found one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which one?</span></div></div>",

If it wasn't right, they moved on.  As they wandered, he decided to ask Snow some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, how many winters are you all?  You don't seem too old to me.\"  He asked a little cautiously, hie mother having taught him never to ask a women how many winters she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow smiled back, \"The youngest of us, Beth, Betty, and Bess, have eighteen winters, the other six are twenty winters.  My mother and her sister have thirty-seven winters, I have nineteen winters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All still fairly young too!' David thought to himself, \"And why don't you have any males?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow sighed, \"It is a curse from moon, mother and all mystics say, that when the world was young and men and furry were yet still beasts, the fox turned from the moon and worshiped the sun.  We were split from the wolves and made separate, thinner, weaker.  Our Todds, or males as you say, births became rarer and rarer.\"  She gestured to her white fur, \"That is why some of us have white fur, that we may commune with the moon to atone for our betrayal and remind us that we were once mighty wolves.  In respect, we do not mark our bottoms, or moons, and in exchange, the moon gives to us a male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was fascinated, to think the world was so old!  And a quick observation showed that, yes, all three of the white vixens had no marks on their bottoms, which swayed so gently and nicely in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vixens!\"  Ice called from up ahead, \"A sleeping tree has been found!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow dragged David along to the tree, a massive tree with thick branches that wrapped around its trunk all the way to about three feet off the ground.  He could already see the bare bottoms and tails of a few of the vixens as they crawled on their hands and knees under the branches, and he followed Snow under as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" Ice called from somewhere in the fluff pile, \"get to the center, as our new male, we must keep you safe, comfortable, and warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to refuse that offer, he eagerly and carefully crawled over the boxers until he was laying in the middle of them.  It was very comfortable, he felt a few arms wrap around his torso, his head was definitely nestled between two pairs of breasts as two vixens laying the opposite way rested their heads on his belly and chest.  His hands he was pretty sure were caressing the bare bottoms of some vixens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd someone had their head laying on his crotch, <i>that</i> certainly didn't help him relax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle as he lost the battle with his manhood's reaction to all this, \"So eager,\" the vixen said, pressing it down with her chin, \"but first you must grow before you are a true Todd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was both a restless and extremely comfortable night for David.</span></div></div>",

Case in point, his hands ended up grabbing a breast from two separate vixens, Lilly and Linda to be precise, who simply laughed off the unintentional grope.  He also was treated to a show of tail, butt, and intimate regions as the various vixens crawled out from under the tree on their hands and knees, him following behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vixens!\" Ice called out, the three sets of triplet vixens looking to their mystic, \"Now we must find food, bring what you can, David shall go with Lilly, Linda and Wendy today for food gathering.\" The triplet set in question cheered, dragging him over and hugging him tightly, their massive breasts almost smoothing him in a furry marshmallow heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go David!\"  Lilly said excitedly, grabbing his hand and following her sisters as they ventured into the forest.  \"Look for berries, animals, roots, anything that looks edible, we'll teach you what's is and isn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded and watched the vixens' behinds bounce and jiggle as they walked in front of him, their tails wagging from side to side, teasing him with a view of their behinds and more intimate regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even saw Linda bend over at the waist to pick berries from a bush, using her large breasts as an improvised bowl when she was finished (woodworking and weaving haven't been invented yet, nor the concept of using a large leaf).  And as Lilly and Wendy led him through the forest, he watched Wendy take off running through the trees, before hearing her growling and a brief scuffle happen, and she emerged with two medium sized rabbits dangling from her hands.  \"Meet you two back at camp!\"  She skipped happily through the trees, he massive breasts almost clonking her in the head several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does she mean?\"  David asked, curious about the phrasing of her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled, \"We can't return to the tree until we have food.\"  She shrugged, gently straightening his hair, \"That way the tribe always has enough for everyone.  But since your new, we'll let you slide at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed, \"Good, I wasn't much of a hunter with my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled, \"I think I see some berries up ahead, lets grab as man you as we can!\"</span></div></div>",
