            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The inside of the warehouse was one of the most crowded and sweltering places you'd ever been in. There were dozens and dozens of people, all vying to push past each other and see what was going on. It didn't help that parts of the place were literally curtained off-- you assumed that was what the ad had meant by 'privacy ensured'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a diverse group of people, too-- all sizes shapes and colors. There was an 80-year old black woman standing next to a 12-year old Asian boy. You guess money crossed all boundaries. It was certainly why you were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is cool!\" Marcie exclaimed, her ginger hair swinging back and forth across her shoulders. She'd always been the more excitable one of the two of you. As far as you were concerned, this was just a quick paycheck. And maybe you were kind of curious to find out what this whole deal was about. But only kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get this over with. I want that money in my pocket ASAP!\" you answered. You practically had to shout over the sound of the crowd. But they all fell silent when <b>he</b> stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a finely dressed man with an incredibly neat haircut. Clearly, this guy was from money. You took an immediate dislike to him. He was escorted by a thin, black-haired woman clutching a bundle of folders to the hastily-erected stage at the center of the room. It took a while, and he clearly wasn't the happiest with the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he took the stage. Producing a microphone from within his coat, he began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone! My name is Theodore Blue. I bet you're all wondering why you're here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a murmur of agreement within the crowd that you quickly joined in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, allow me to introduce Doctor Emma Strauss!\" He indicated the curtain he'd entered from with a wide sweep of his arm. A wild-looking blonde woman stormed up to stage quickly, her lab-coat trailing behind her. She didn't look all that put together, and the crowd parted for her almost instantly. This only made Theodore's face even more sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss didn't looked thrilled, on the other hand. She grinned in a way that indicated she wasn't very used to it. Theodore handed her the mic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, hello! I am the doctor! I'm very glad to see you all here today! I've been working on the things in the back for a very, very long time! They are my masterworks. Truly things of beauty.\" At a look from Theodore, she coughed. \"Ahem. So, you will be participating in the very first human trials of some of my finest inventions. In a few minutes, we will start taking people back. Please do not attempt to run. That would be very...unkind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something off about the way she spoke, but you pushed it aside. The nervous-looking woman from earlier took the mic from the doctor and smiled wanly. The doctor, on the other hand, slipped back behind the curtain. \"Y-yes. My name is Violet-- I will be handing your assignment sheets out to you all-- oh, no, don't worry, it's not work-- we just need to see what everyone is interested in! If you're interested in more than one, wait until your first test is complete to check your second box-- please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore snatched the mic from her before she could go any further. Violet hurried down the stairs and began handing out sheets to the first round of people. Poor girl was sweating even harder than you, and you hadn't even thought that possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Violet. Now, you have to engage in three experiments to be eligible for the full 10k. If you don't, you get a third of the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember though, in the interest of time, you are only allowed to engage in three different experiments! After you do, your time is up and you will be asked to leave the tent. Thank you for your time. Make sure ours is worth it,\" he finished somewhat menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to get second thoughts about this whole thing. Human experimentation was illegal or something, wasn't it? But maybe the rules were different if you volunteered. You were just curious to find out what these machines were that had Doctor Strauss so excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie latched onto your wrist and dragged you over to where Violet was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Let's get a hop on this! We don't wanna spoil the surprise for ourselves with a wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shook your head and went along with it. Marcie reached over a middle-aged woman's shoulder to grab two sheets from Violet. Almost absentmindedly, she handed one to you, and the both of you began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindswap Contraption?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDNA Infuser?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObject Transmogrifier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimeline Manipulator?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were a lot more, even stranger ones that you had no desire to read at the moment. You had no idea what any of these meant, but they all sounded weird. Did you still even want to do this? But you had a pencil in your hands and ten thousand dollars in your heart, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you check off first?</span></div></div>",

Then again, they were paying you the big bucks for this, so maybe...nah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask Marcie what she checked off. She grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timeline Manipulator! Doesn't that just sound groovy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sure does, but probably not in the way she's thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, Violet collects all the sheets. It's a while before she calls out your name, but it does happen eventually. Marcie squeezes your hand as you get up to disappear beyond the curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always,\" you smirk. She smirks back and hits you on the shoulder playfully. Before you know it, Violet has taken you beyond the curtain, where you pass by several more until you reach the end of the hall. She parts the cloth to let you through, where you see Doctor Strauss hard at work on what looks like two human-sized metal pods linked by a single tube at their tops.You guess that's the Mindswap Contraption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins at the sight of you and indicates the left pod quite eagerly. \"Go,\" she says, \"climb on in! Since you got here first, you get the privilege of choosing your partner! Don't worry, the other ones will get their own turns.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to ask something but were cut off by the doctor's sudden change of expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No questions! Into the pod!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and went ahead and laid down in the pod, back-first. The pod's open hatch swung down and sealed you in with a click. Somewhat worried, you pushed against the heavy metal lid. It didn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor glanced over her shoulder and winked at him. \"It's perfectly fine, I assure you. That is exactly what is supposed to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, okay. You were just glad you weren't afraid of enclosed spaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss read something off a monitor on a table hooked up to the machine. She turned to face the curtain expectantly. So did you, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive women walked through the door. Five very different women. You were beginning to get seriously worried. If this machine worked, you didn't particularly want to end up at the opposite gender-- or in anyone else's body at all. This was a seriously ill-advised idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss stepped in front of the women and grinned at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, allow me to introduce your options!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first woman was a middle-aged mom type. She'd clearly let herself go recently-- her pink t-shirt was struggling to contain her flab, and her pants were so tight you could practically see everything. Curly ginger hair was draped over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa Abernathy! 42 years old and mother of three! Ooh, I bet she'd like a change of pace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second woman was much shorter. And skinnier. Oh god-- she looked so weak. She might have been fourteen years old? Certainly not much older than sixteen. Her black hair was greasy and her retainer was obvious. Thinking about being her was making your head spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ursula Ruiz! She's only fifteen, but she's a senior in highschool. Bet you'd like being a genius like her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third woman was definitely your type-- if you ever had the balls to ask anyone out. She was about your age and curvy in all the right places. She was wearing a pair of tight tight jean shorts-- the top of her thong was peeking out. Her top wasn't much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eunhee Kang, 27 years old! She's a hard worker. An admirable trait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth woman was-- oh god, she was pregnant! How was that gonna work? But you had to admit, it piqued your curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunshine Jones, 31! What an appropriate name-- isn't she just glowing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last woman had something in her ears-- just barely visible beyond her long brown hair. Your eyes widened as you realized what they were-- hearing aids! She was hard of hearing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katya LeGuin, 19! What a beautiful girl. She lost her hearing in an accident. It sure would be nice for her to get a chance to experience something else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she trying to guilt trip you? Well, it wasn't totally ineffective... None of these choices seemed good-- You wanted out! You slammed your hand against the hatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! LET ME OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss shook her head, an evil grin on her face. \"I can't! Nor do I want to. Now choose. Which of these fine women's bodies will you choose to live in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream in frustration. Your heart thudded in your chest as you examined your choices. This was bad--- really bad. What were you supposed to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho were you supposed to choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The other women gave you a bad feeling--- you'd rather be fat than any of the other possibilities. You jerked your chin in Melissa's direction. The doctor clapped eagerly and practically skipped over to the monitor she'd been reading off of earlier. She said something to Melissa that you couldn't quite hear. The older woman grinned viciously as she peered through the pod window at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...I know I'm gonna loooove being you. Young and skinny and child-free....paradise!\" Her voice was surprisingly melodic-- it was weird thinking that was going to belong to you in a second. Oh god...you just wanted out of this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest jiggled heavily as she stomped her way over to the pod next to you. You felt the pod shake as she climbed in-- god, how much did this lady weigh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss did a quick check of the pod before returning to her monitor. She was breathing rapidly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, happy, happy day! It's finally time to begin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she slammed her hand down on a big red button next to the monitor. You squeezed your eyes shut as you felt something tug on your consciousness- on you! Before you could do anything, all sensation disappeared. It reappeared a moment later, but you felt very, very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chest heaved with every breath. Sweat clung to your face and...to your chest. Oh god...she'd really done it, hadn't she? She'd really swapped your bodies! Doctor Strauss grinned as the pods swung open. You stepped out, scared beyond belief. Your pants felt uncomfortably tight-- so tight you could feel everything down there. Your gigantic breasts (your breasts!) swung freely-- apparently, Melissa hadn't been wearing a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt entirely different-- and it was totally unpleasant. You regretted ever coming to this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss was on you immediately with a mirror. As expected, your reflection was that of Melissa-- of you, now. You squeeze your soft, round face with equally soft, stubby fingers. Behind those blue eyes was you! You, an average 28 year old guy! You want to say something to Doctor Strauss-- want to lash out, or ask questions, or...do anything so that you don't feel so freakin' powerless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?</span></div></div>",

Doctor Strauss approach\u2019d my old body and asked well so tell me how does it feel to not be Melisa Abernathy any more, you\u2019ve gone from an overweight 42 year old house wife and mother of 3 to a 28 year old fit male in a matter of seconds. Are you concerned that your life is no longer yours, your past your entire history now belongs to mister Smith and you are no longer a woman how is does make you feel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy old body replied absolutely fantastic I can\u2019t believe this is happening it\u2019s like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Looking after 3 children and a husband, cooking, cleaning, taking the kids to school, sports. Being an overweight woman constantly being judged, always feeling tired, not to mention the womanly issues my periods are absolutely hell then there\u2019s the thrush carrying around those enormous breast\u2019s kills your back. Then with all that having to feel sexual for your husband, I feel fantastic I am going to love this life. And as far as not being a woman well no loss there what so ever he is welcome to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing all that I started to panic my god what have I done. I start to feel the discomfort in my lower back oh shit this is real all her problems will now be mine <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss then approached me well I guess Mr Smith is no longer appropriate let\u2019s call you by who you now are Mrs Abernathy how are you feeling you look a bit uncomfortable. Well I replied my back is killing me Doctor Strauss then lifted both my breasts well Mellisa carrying around these girls will do that they have to be 34E, 38E my former body called out, oh  Boy 38E Doctor Strauss exclaimed hope you were a boob man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss looked at me now in Melissa\u2019s body stating now you interest me the most out of all the possible choices why a much older and larger married woman with 3 children, the other choices were closer to your age and a lot fitter with no baggage in fact they were absolutely stunning you could of been standing in the body of a woman that could of quite easily been a model but you chose a frumpy, old overweight, short housewife why? I had no real answer I panicked and at the time she reminded me of my mother and I felt safe. I interesting replied Doctor Strauss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long will this body swap be for I asked still not used to hearing that damed high pitched sing song voice that was now mine? What do you mean replied Doctor Strauss you surely read the terms there is no time frame it\u2019s if and when you both agree to swap back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss called my former body over Melissa was loving being in my body she hadn\u2019t stopped smiling since we swapped bodies Mr Smith were you aware of the terms? Hell yeah she replied I\u2019ve been participating for 4 years and no body ever chose me I have no intention of swapping back he can have it it\u2019s all his the kids the husband the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Melissa I guess that\u2019s that said Doctor Strauss perhaps you can persevere like Melissa used to and find someone to swap bodies with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to my former body and said you can\u2019t do this your life is terrible your body is terrible your so fat and your huge tits are a fucking joke, and who knows what the hell is going on with your vagina but it\u2019s itchy as hell with a weird burning feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body walked closer towering above me looking at my slimmer fit younger body I felt so uncomfortable. Then I heard my former voice It\u2019s not my body it\u2019s your body, it\u2019s not my life it\u2019s your life, you are Melissa Abernathy if you open your purse you\u2019ll find a drivers license that states that. Remember we swapped bodies and my life is your life and your life is now mine, and that burning and itching in your vagina do you hear me your vagina is part of some woman\u2019s life\u2019s. I\u2019m not fat you are fat so maybe get that into your head before you go throwing insults like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s enough you will both have time to fight later said Doctor Strauss now we have to move on to phase 3 we need to give you both a medical examination <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She parts the cloth to let you through, where you see Doctor Strauss hard at work on what looks like a simple injection set. It was an infusion pump or at least it looked like one. You guess that's the DNA infuser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins at the sight of you and indicates that you should sit down in some relaxing chair. \"Go,\" she says, \"make yourself comfortable in this chair please. Then I will inject you the needle and afterwards Doctor Strauss will connect the infuser.\u201d<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to ask something but were cut off by the doctor's sudden change of expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No questions! Into the chair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and went ahead and sat down in the chair and made yourself comfortable like Violet told.<br>\r\nNot a minute later she came as announced with the needle and once she was done the still or even more unfriendly doctor adjusted this infuser or however it is called.<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck, see the results in a moment\u201d said Violet as you hear a click. The doctor has activated the machine and it pours something directly into your veins\u2026 Somewhat worried, you close your eyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet said in her always friendly tone and you open your eyes again to see The doctor. You don\u2019t like him. He might be a brilliant man, but you don\u2019t like his attitude. Now he glanced over you and just said: \"It's perfectly fine, I am happy with the first results. That is exactly what is supposed to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like drugged and most properly you are from whatever the injected you: But Well, okay. You were just glad that this unfriendly doctor was happy with the result, because you don\u2019t want to imagine him when something happens he doesn\u2019t like!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss read something off a monitor on a table hooked up to the machine.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then it hits you and you come back to your full senses and you remember and realize what is going on here and most properly they talked about you. Meaning if the damn machine did its job you are a woman now?<br>\r\nIt was weird thinking that is really worked and all you could think was going to get away and you just wanted out of this chair and stand up.<br>\r\nYou did stand up but your chest jiggled heavily.<br>\r\nYou felt the huge amount of flash, which now was on your upper body-- god, it worked and you have to understand that this is some weight you need to get used now as a female?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strauss saw you getting up and did a quick check of your body, grinning and then returning to the monitor. She was switching the machine of now<br>\r\nThen he said to you: <br>\r\n\"It's finally time to begin your new life as a woman! Please come to me tomorrow latest or anytime you feel something strange or abnormal\"<br>\r\nWith that unfriendly comment and words, he left the room and even slammed the door behind.<br>\r\nYou squeezed your eyes shut to see the results again.<br>\r\nYou felt new sensations and everything felt very, very different.<br>\r\nYour chest heaved with every breath. You wonder about if and how your face might have changed.<br>\r\nViolet was still around. At least a friendly person and she guided you into some other room where you could find a mirror. She said she will leave you alone for some moments, just that you can get familiar. Then she will hand you some instructions and some more admin stuff must be done.<br>\r\nYou nod and check your new female self in the mirror:<br>\r\nA woman is reflected, and your eyes are fixed on your chest. Oh god...she'd really has a huge rack!<br>\r\nYou are scared beyond belief. Your pants felt uncomfortably tight-- so tight you could feel everything down there. Your gigantic breasts (your breasts!) swung freely\u2014because you hadn't been wearing a bra before the change\u2026.<br>\r\nYou felt entirely different-- and it was totally unpleasant. You regretted ever coming to this place.<br>\r\nAs expected, your reflection was that of female version of you, now. You squeeze your soft, round face with equally soft, stubby fingers. Behind those blue eyes was you! You, an average 28-year-old guy! Now you became a sexy bombshell woman\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed she was going to try the DNA infuser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they can change my hair purple!\" she said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for Violet to collect your sheets and the wait before you are called is even shorter.

The cute Asian guiding you doesn't react to them in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you pass through another set of curtains and into another room, barebones save for a small computer manned by Doctor Strauss and a small pile of objects beside it. They range from simple toys and snacks to underwear and other more \"intimate\" things. Violet directs you to just infront of the machine before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are my new test subject?\" Strauss asks. You don't get a chance to answer as she continues with \"Good, now hold still while I track your consciousness. I need you to think of an object, any object. It can be whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything? Thinking back to the experiment name, you gather this must be some kind of 3D printer controlled by your mind. After all, why else would she be scanning your brain? Object transformation?

You assumed it was using the machine again, but she walks away from it and scoops you from the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't name brand, but I am sure someone will enjoy you,\" she says, examining you closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy?

The one who drove you to the abandoned warehouse-- mostly because she owns a car and you don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDOCTOR EMMMA STRAUSS- The brains behind this mysterious experiment. She's invented a whole host of devices and can't wait to try them out with some victi-- ahem, volunteers. She's got an ego, so be careful not to talk too derisively about her babies-- the machines she's worked wonders with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHEODORE BLUE- An incredibly charismatic business man who is responsible for funding the experiment. He also doesn't really care about what happens to the volunteers, so don't count on him to keep you safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVIOLET CHANG- The woman in charge of keeping track of all the paperwork and making sure all the proper boxes get checked.
