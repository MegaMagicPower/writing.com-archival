The blastoise then gets up and takes you to one of the labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside there are numerous pokemorphs in lab coats doing all sorts of experiments.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, i'm here for the ad in the paper.\" you say to the scientists.<br>\r\nOne of them turns to you. It is a male Raichu pokemorph. \"Very well come this way please.\" You follow the raichu to a seperate office where he tells you to sit in a chair. He then gets a syringe full of a blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a prototype solution. So far we don't know what it does but if you experience any symptoms, please call the labs and ask for Dr. Thompson.\" Dr Thompson says and injects you with the liquid. You flinch a little but it didn't hurt that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your cooperation. You can collect your money from the main reception.\" Dr. Thompson says and you leave, collecting the money from the reception in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to your apartment and place the money in a small safe under your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decide to go to your girlfriends house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave your apartment and head to your girlfriends house but on the way you feel a little warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on the door and your girlfriends mother opens the door and tells you michelle is in her room. You get up and go into her room where she is on her bed reading a magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up and sees you. \"Jonathan, Hi!\" She gets up and hugs you at the door. \"where have you been then?\"<br>\r\nYou tell her about the lab and the money earned.<br>\r\n\"Wow, they must have been desperate to give that much away. So have you experienced anything yet?\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n\"Only that I'm warm, (panting and fanning yourself) could you get me some water please?\" You ask. \"Sure, you stay there, I'll be back in a minute.\" Michelle says going to the kitchen. You sit down on the bed and feel like your melting. You look at your hand and you realise you are, but into a blue ooze. Michelle enters the room with some water and sees you melting on her bed. She yells for her parents, her parents enter and see you melting into a pile of ooze on michelles bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou melt into a pile of ooze and pass out. You feel someones hands scoop you up and bring you to their muzzle, they accidently breathe you in and they lose conciousness for a moment. In the body you feel yourself spread in the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes and see above you:</span></div></div>",

You look in the mirror and you see michelle staring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why am-\" you start to say until you realise your voice sounds like michelle. \"Why am I michelle, I thought I was out of her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and hope you are dreaming. As you open your eyes, you are looking at the sandwich toaster in michelles kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly think, \"wait, first I was michelle in her room, why am I now in her kitchen?\" As you are thinking about this, you hear the sandwich toaster beep stating it is finished. You then hear michelle say \"Finally, this thing takes forever to toast. Mum should really get a new one of these things.\" You then see michelles hands reach toward the toaster and open it up and remove the sandwich and the weird thing is, michelle accidently burnt her finger on the toaster and you felt the same burn in the same spot on the same finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes again and you are back seeing yourself as michelle in front of her mirror and put your finger in the glass to cool it down from the burn. You wonder if this is another side effect from the stuff you were injected with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens and michelle enters with the sandwich and is suprised to see herself standing in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, is that you?\" michelle asks the copy of herself in front of her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" you say to michelle, in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you look and sound like me? michelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.
