You then combined with the dragon and you fought the creature alone. You created a sword made of energy and sliced the monster in half. When it was destroyed, you went over to check on the scouts. \"Are you OK?\" you asked Mars. She nodded and asked you to come to her temple with the others. You agreed and you all went to the temple.</span></div></div>",

Rei was stunned by what she was eeing. \"Who are you?\" you asked. The other you began to chuckle evily and said in a demonic voice \"I am you, or rather, your dark side.

No please!\" Then the werewolf was burned to ash and returned to its card form.

As you were approaching the capital city of Tokyo via jumbo jetliner, you stowed away both yourself and you custom chopper motorcycle within the plane's cargo bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the world knew, but you harbored a....dark secret. By day, you were an ordinary guy, standing nearly 6 foot 1 in height, having an athletic frame, and sporting a pair of green eyes and \"dirty blonde\" hair. But by night or in the presence of evil, your appearance changes, as you transform into the hellish Spirit of Vengeance, known only as \"The Ghost Rider\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with Hellfire and various weapons at your disposal, as the Ghost Rider, you seek out those who have spilt innocent blood and judge them as both judge, jury, and executioner. If they are deemed guilty, you unleash a Ghost Rider's ultimate weapon; Penance Stare. Upon use, the Penance Stare will unleash all of the pain and suffering the person has caused against them tenfold, burning the enemy's soul to a brimstone crisp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as the plane as fly just above the Tokyo skyline and reaching the airport, you figured that it's time to leave before someone at the airport discovers you. Opening the charge bay doors, as the wind blew fiercely and with relentless gust, you got on your custom chopper, revved on the throttle, as the engine roared and growled to life. Noticing that it was already nightfall, you let a slight smirk and thought, \"Well Tokyo, hope you're ready for someone like me.\" Flooring the throttle, your chopper went from 0 to 80 miles an hour in merely 4 seconds, just as you and your motorcycle were left falling mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after ejecting from the large plane, Hellfire consumed both you and the two-wheel vehicle, as your skin &amp; flesh disappeared in the blaze, turning you into a flaming skeleton with somewhat charred bones. The trenchcoat, stonewashed jeans, black boots, and dark gray T-shirt became charred and crispy, but still as flexible. The sawed-off pump-action shotgun, dual revolvers, and chain that was hoisted on your body morphed into your Hellfire Revolvers, Hellfire Shotgun, &amp; Hellfire Chain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as your motorcycle grotesquely transformed itself into your HellCycle, within those short few seconds mid-air and you had transformed into the Ghost Rider, as you crashed through the building in front of you, still sitting upon your HellCycle, where you drifted to slow your momentum down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite giving the people on the floor that you landed on, as the Ghost Rider, you got a good look at the city in front of you. However, as for your reasons here in Tokyo, you came here to investigate....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days ago, you recieved an unexpected bust from the very person who made you into the Ghost Rider; the demon lord known as \"Mephisto\". He made you into the infamous Spirit of Vengeance from a single deal, and so far he kept up with his end of the bargain, while you kept up with your end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as for why he decided to pay you a visit, Mephisto wasn't exactly there to have a nice conversation. From what he told Mephisto's \"assets\" had sensed some weird disturbances occurring within the city of Tokyo. At first, you thought that this claim was a little ludicrous, but when the disguised demon lord explained it to you that these disturbances had an essence of dark energy but not originating from Hell nor from this current time period, that was when you raised an eyebrow saying \"Okay, that definitely sounds weird. And what did you mean from it didn't come from this time period? Is it something from the past or the future?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I want you to find out, Rider.\" was Mephisto's response, just before he disappeared completely when the lights went out. However, seeing as how from seeing Mephisto's concern about the situation, you figured you had to head down toward Japan and see for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to present day, as you sat there on your HellCycle, you could sense another disturbance with your demonic abilities. You weren't sure what it was, but it was as if something was draining an innocent soul. Although you don't exactly have eyebrows as the Ghost Rider, you let out a demonic angry growl from whoever or whatever it was that was consuming human souls, which still counts as spilling innocent blood in your opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you revved on the throttle of your HellCycle, causing the demonic chopper to let out a mix between hellish screams and demonic growls and roars from it's engines, as your wheels of Hellfire spun with rage. Then, as the HellCycle went from 0 to 160 miles an hour in a mere 2 seconds, you went out of another window, off of the side of the building, landing on several buildings, and landing onto an elevated highway, all while leaving a blazing trail of fire in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted answers as to what was happening, and you were going to get them, even if you had to use Penance Stare on whoever's responsible to make them talk. Getting closer to the source of the disturbance, you noticed that the energy disruption was coming from a large suspension just ahead of you, just as you saw a few explosions upon the main suspension cables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you got closer to the bridge, you could see that there was a gruesome battle going on. However, you could tell who the villains were, and who was winning. Pulling out your Hellfire Chain, you aimed at the woman, known as \"Prisma\", who was firing dark energy blasts at a group of teenage heroines, known as \"The Sailor Scouts\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you whipped your Hellfire Chain around Prisma's legs and violently yanked her down hard, the Sailor Scouts and the others saw you, just as you whipped the tail of your HellCycle to come to a full stop. From there, you got off your hellish motorcycle, still holding onto the other end of your Hellfire Chain, as you slowly turned your flaming skull of a head, looking at the shocked group of women, with eyeless sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the Sailor Scouts' perspective, along with that of the reformed Catsy, Birdy, and Avery, they saw that whatever you were, you weren't classified as \"human\". \"Sailor Mercury, any luck with scanning this creep?\" The Sailor Scout in red, known as Sailor Mars, asked, as you noticed a Sailor Scout in blue, known as Sailor Mercury, scanning you with some visor from where she stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as you noticed Prisma slowly getting back up(not to mention pissed off from getting yanked to the ground), Sailor Mercury's visor was done scanning you, as she had a look of disbelief on her face as she looked back at her comrades and replied, \"Well, despite my scanners only say unknown, whatever he is, this flaming skeleton isn't even human!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Prisma unleash another blast of dark energy at you with that Nega Moon Crystal strobe of hers yelling, \"Human or not, you'll pay for interfering with me!\" Instinctively, you quickly yank the Hellfire Chain back toward you, as you swung the enchanted chain around like a whip, successfully deflecting the incoming bolts of dark energy with extreme efficiency, despite the Sailor Scouts and their friends had to dodge out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Prisma threw the deal energy blasts at a faster pace, you kept up with her attacks, deflecting them at superhuman speeds. But suddenly, you quickly grabbed one of your Hellfire Revolvers and fired off two shots at Prisma. Fortunately, one of those shots scorched her in the hand that was holding the Nega Moon Strobe, knocking the evil weapon out of her possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after disarming her, you quickly aimed your Hellfire Chain at Prisma's legs, whopping the end around both of the Nega Moon woman's lower limbs, then yank her off her feet once more. From there, you pulled on the Hellfire Chain with inhuman strength, putting Prisma just in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could even react, you put your left boot down on Prisma's neck, immobilizing her like a mongoose attacking a snake. Then, as you sheathed your Hellfire Revolver and pulled out your Hellfire Shotgun, you aimed the demonic firearm right in front of Prisma's face, to the point where the barrel was literally touching her skin. However, since you could sense that her soul was a mix between innocent and guilty due the Nega Moon energy tainting her spirit, you looked down at Prisma as the Hellfire Chain slithered up your free arm and wrapped itself around your unoccupied limb, you let out a demonic growl toward the green-haired woman and growled, \"GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON THAT I SHOULDN'T SEND YOUR DAMNED SOUL STRAIGHT TO HELL.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But then, just as you were ready to pull on the trigger of your Hellfire Shotgun, you suddenly heard not just the voices of Catsy, Birdy, and Avery, but also the voices of the Sailor Scouts and their two feline companions, as they all spoke in unison and yelled, \"No, don't hurt her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis event alone made you completely stop dead in your tracks. After all, out of all of the crazy stuff you have experienced as the Ghost Rider, this was something entirely new. So, in order to get some answers, you slowly but surely turned your flaming skull  to the left to face the Sailor Scouts and their comrades, speaking to them in the Ghost Rider's demonic voice and said, \"FIRST, YOU'RE ENEMIES, AND NOW YOU'RE FRIENDS! WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT TO SPARE SOMEONE WITH SUCH A TAINTED SOUL LIKE HERS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, Bonehead; she's not a 'tainted soul'! And second, her name's Prisma, and she's our sister!\" Birdy replied, feeling like you calling Prisma a \"tainted soul\" as an insult. Then again, hearing Birdy calling you \"Bonehead\" felt like an insult on your behalf. In response, you let out a growling scoff at the group and answered, \"SISTERS?! THE LAST TIME I CHECKED, SISTERS DON'T TRY TO KILL EACH OTHER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, during the conversation, Sailor Mars used her abilities as a priestess to sense what exactly was she and her friends dealing with, since she figured that you might be something supernatural when Amy's scanners can't figure out what you are. And it turns out, she was right; you were some sort of supernatural entity, as she heard Avery speak to you and said, \"That's because it wasn't her fault, Prisma was being controlled by that Nega Moon strobe! It was making her act like that, she wasn't always like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, butting into the conversation, Sailor Mars tried to convince you to spare the female greenette as she answered, \"Look, I don't know what you are or where you came, but Avery's right! Prisma wasn't acting this way out of her own will, that strobe was doing this to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were allowed to kill those who got in your way as the Ghost Rider, you had a bit of a moral compass, especially since you can sense that the Sailor Scouts legitimately possessed real pure souls, which made you hesitant in attacking them. However, from reviewing the information revealed to you, you connected the dots and figured out that Mephisto and his assets were right; there were darker forces at work here within Tokyo, Prisma and her 3 sisters happened to be good people that were simply used as pawns, nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO...IT IS TRUE AS WHAT THEY SAY; POWER CAN CORRUPT YOU IF YOU'RE NOT TOO CAREFUL.\" You replied, turning your eyeless gaze toward the Nega Moon Strobe, still laying there on the asphalt, just a few yards away. Although it was no longer in Prisma's clutches, you could sense a dark power inside it's crystal ball, a power that was too dangerous for anyone to use, good or evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on the strobe itself, you put your boot off of Prisma's neck and throat, allowing her to breathe, letting out a few coughs in the process before falling unconscious. But as you were inches away from the strobe, the Sailor Scouts thought you were going to grab it. But instead, you raised your right boot just above the dark strobe, and stomped down hard on it in one blow, crushing the gem powering it in the process. Finally, just for good measure, you kept your boot stamped down on the crushed gem of power, as you twisted your boot from left to right, grinding the gem pieces into nothing but dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom seeing what you did, the Sailor Scouts were still unsure on what they were going up against. But from seeing attacks, power, and appearance, they could understand that whatever you were, you happened to be a powerful entity. However, when you were looking back the Sailor Scouts, you heard the Sailor Scout in green, known as Sailor Jupiter, speak to you and said, \"So, you're not working with Rubeus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite you didn't know who this \"Rubeus\" guy was, but you had a feeling that he might the person responsible for these dark energy disturbances you have sensed when you first came here to this city. In response to what Sailor Jupiter had said to you, you spoke with the Ghost Rider's demonic voice and replied, \"I DON'T KNOW THIS RUBEUS BASTARD IS, BUT IF I WANTED YOU LADIES 6 FEET UNDER...\" Unexpectedly, in mid-sentence, you changed back from your Ghost Rider Form into your Human Form before their very eyes, as you then finished what you were saying and said, \"...I would've done so the very second I came into view. So, care to explain to me who you girls are, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after you said those words, you crossed your arms, just as Sailor Mars looked at you and replied, \"Oh, um...we're the Sailor Scouts, Defenders of Love and Justice! I'm Sailor Mars, that's Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, and Sailor Jupiter. The ladies over there are Catsy, Birdy, and..well, I'm sure you're familiar with who Avery and Prisma are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And speaking of introductions, who are you, anyway? We've seen anybody else with the type of power you have.\" Sailor Venus asked, speaking out for her own curiosity. Though you couldn't blame them for wanting some answers themselves. After all, you literally just came out of nowhere and \"helped\" them out, so you figured that they wanted to know what you were and why you just turned into a flaming skeleton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that it would be better to tell them sooner rather than later, you looked at Sailor Mars and her fellow Sailor Scouts and answered, \"*sigh* It's a long story, Sailor Scouts. But to put it out plain and simple; I'm the Ghost Rider. A Spirit of Vengeance, to be precise. When the Sun is up and about, I'm as alive as you 5 heroines. But when the Sun goes down or evil lurks nearby, I turn into what you saw just recently; a living skeleton coated in Hellfire, whose purpose is to seek out those who have spilled innocent blood...and send those bastards straight to Hell to burn for eternity. So yeah, I'm an anti-hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaction to hearing what you had explained to them, the Sailor Scouts were in a mix between shock, awe, and disbelief. \"Wow. Just...wow.\" Sailor Jupiter said, still relaying the fact that you unintentionally had just told the Sailor Scouts the Hell actually exists. Then, you noticed Sailor Moon becoming worried somewhat as she replied, \"Yeah, couldn't this get any worse? First, we have to deal with the Nega Moon, now we have to worry about demons coming out of Hell!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously seeing the concern on Sailor Moon's face, you tried to calm her down and answered, \"Whoa whoa, hold on! First off, Hell isn't going to invade, Sailor Moon! And second, I came here because some friends of mine have sensed some disturbances here in your city. Obviously from what my allies had told me, they don't know jack about what these disturbances are, or where they came from. Not to mention one of my allies thought that these disruptions had not come from our current time period.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although you still kept your attention on the Sailor Scouts, you noticed that Catsy and Birdy were helping out Avery carry the unconscious Prisma off of the bridge road, propping the greenette up into a knelt sitting position. From there, you heard Catsy speak out toward Sailor Moon and her fellow Sailor Scouts as the former villainess said, \"Sailor Moon, can you heal our sisters? I think they're ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously this got your attention as well, as you noticed that Avery slumped down onto her knees in exhaustion, possibly due to she was hit hard when Prisma was using that evil Nega Moon Strobe, prior to your arrival on the scene. \"So, what? You plan on purifying their souls or something?\" You asked to Sailor Moon, with a sarcastic and skeptical one in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't until you saw the look of seriousness in Sailor Moon's eyes, despite showing a gentle and compassionate smile, that you could see that the blonde pig-tailed Sailor Scout was indeed serious, causing your sarcastic demeanor to fade, as she slowly approached the 4 women on the sidelines. Then, you looked at Sailor Mars and said, \"She's serious, isn't she?\" \"When it comes to her friends, Sailor Moon can be really serious, Mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-(IYNH). You can just call me (IYNH), Sailor Mars.\" You answered, as you then suddenly sensed a great deal of power coming from Sailor Moon, revealing her famed Silver Moon Crystal, where she aimed the crystal locket at Prisma and Avery, saying the words, \"Moon Crystal Healing..Activation!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying those words, a powerful blast of pure light hit Prisma and Avery simultaneously on impact. And yet, the blast wasn't harming them, but purifying their tainted souls of dark negative energy. Although you figured that Sailor Moon has some good experience with using that crystal's power, you had to shield yourself a bit from the crystal's light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, even though you were on the same side as them, your powers as the Ghost Rider were completely different from the Sailor Scouts, grunting a bit from the light emanating from the Silver Moon Crystal, as you growled, \"Agh! Damn, that's bright!\" Noticing your reaction from Sailor Moon using the Silver Moon Crystal, Sailor Mars and Sailor Mercury approached you with some worry, wondering what was wrong with you, as Sailor Mars grabbed you a bit and asked, \"(IYNH), are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as Sailor Moon had finished her handiwork in purifying Avery's and Prisma's souls with her Silver Moon Crystal, you stopped shielding yourself, noticing how Sailor Mars and Sailor Mercury were concerned about your well-being. So in response, you slowly stood up, looked at Sailor Mars, and answered, \"*grunt* I'm fine, Sailor Mars. It's just that I'm a tiny bit more sensitive to powerful light-based attacks. Heh, I guess I forgot about that part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she and Sailor Mercury backed away knowing that you were now fine, Sailor Mars could see that you had a slight weakness to light-based attacks, but would've been in worse if they were weapons forged from Heaven, seeing as how the Ghost Rider's powers &amp; abilities were demonic in nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you cracked your neck a bit to snap yourself out of your stunned daze, you turned around to face the Sailor Scouts once more, seeing that they were now more focused on you. From there, Sailor Venus looked at you, putting a hand on her hip, and said, \"So, I'm guessing you plan on making an alliance with us, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, that was sort of your plan when you first met the Sailor Scouts, seeing as how both you and them have a common enemy. And as the saying goes, \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\". So in response, you just scratched the back of your head in confusion and replied, \"H-How the hell did you girls know that I was going to say that? And don't say that it was a woman's intuition, because I was being subtle about it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your reaction made Sailor Moon and Sailor Jupiter chuckle about it, just as you suddenly heard an older but unfamiliar female voice that said, \"In other words, an alliance would be most acceptable.\" Upon hearing the voice, you looked from left to right, then looked at the Sailor Scouts and said, \"Okay...um, did you girls just heard that or is it just me?\" Then, out of nowhere, another voice joined in, only it sounded more like a guy, and said, \"Look down here, Bonehead!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously becoming a little annoyed being called Bonehead, you quickly looked down and saw the black and white cats Luna and Artemis. At first, you thought you were just hearing things, but it was then that Artemis spoke and said, \"What, you've never seen a talking cat before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this is..completely new. Talking cats. Greeeaaat!\" You answered, obviously not expecting something like this, as you leaned your head up toward the moonlit sky in disbelief for a second or two, before you then Luna speak and said, \"Well, at least he isn't fainting out of pure shock from seeing us talk, Artemis.\" \"Duly noted, Luna. Duly noted.\" Artemis replied, agreeing with his fellow feline about you not fainting right off the bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though, Luna does raise a valid point. An alliance would help, seeing as our enemy happens to be much stronger than the usual monsters we face.\" Sailor Mercury answered, agreeing with what Luna had said. But soon, one by one, the Sailor Scouts mostly agreed with having you as an ally, as Sailor Venus looked at you and said, \"Well, I guess that settles it; Having a guy who can turn into a flaming skeleton it is, then.\" \"What she means is 'Welcome to the Sailor Scouts, (IYNH)!' It's not much, but our base is at the Cherry Hill Temple, just in case you're wondering where we go to when we're not fighting the NegaVerse.\" Sailor Jupiter replied, making things a little easy to understand, despite you understood Venus's sarcasm from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite your different set of powers, you were now officially a member of the Sailor Scouts, along with receiving the location of their base of operations; an old but still-occupied building known as the \"Cherry Hill Temple\". So far, so good on making some progress. Although it wasn't much, but it was a good start.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>12 hours later, you were traveling on your custom motorcycle, reverted back from being in it's HellCycle form from the previous night, making your way to the location of the Cherry Hill Temple, the secret base of operations for the Sailor Scouts. Although you just got here to Tokyo, they managed to point out it's location before they helped Catsy &amp; Birdy with Avery and Prisma, just as you went off into your HellCycle and drove off into the night, going your separate ways for the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, getting back to what was currently happening. As you drove through the streets of Tokyo, you remembered where the Cherry Hill Temple was located at as best as you could. However, it wasn't exactly easy with becoming adjusted to how traffic goes in Japan, seeing as how the flow in each traffic lane was inverted, compared to the flow of car traffic back in the States. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after taking about an hour or two, you finally made it to the location of the Cherry Hill Temple, stopping just in front of the temple's line of stairs. Although you had to learn the entire Japanese language to understand some or most of the chicken scratch they call words while on the plane ride to Tokyo, you looked at the plaque on the stone wall by the stairs that read \"Cherry Hill Temple\" in Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you managed to understand what the chicken scratch said, as you let out a slight smirk and answered, \"Well, this is the place, I guess.\" From there, you parked your ride by the sidewalk, kicking the kickstand up, as you got off your chopper and approached the stairs. But as you ascended up the flight of stone stairs, you noticed a pair of crows perched upon a white Japanese gateway, looking at you with curiosity and ferocity, almost if they were the temple's guardians. Now you see why Crows and Ravens are the messengers of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you got up to the top of the stone staircase, you noticed how big the place was. The temple was built as a hybrid mix between a Japanese shrine temple &amp; a one-story house, with a courtyard on one side, and a Japanese garden on the other. You could tell that whoever owned this temple, obviously had put a lot of hard work into it's creation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than seeing an old man and a male brunette in his mid 20s both wearing hakamas and talking to each other, you weren't sure where the Sailor Scouts were at. So, you decided to check inside the temple itself, as you approached the building's front door and slide it open. Although you could hear the faint noises of the Sailor Scouts' conversation, you decided to make your presence known to them and said, \"Hey, Sailor Scouts! You girls in here? It's me, (IYNH), the Ghost Rider!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when heard Sailor Mars's voice as she replied, \"We're in the living room, (IYNH)!\" But then, as you stepped foot upon the hardwood flooring of the Cherry Hill Temple interior, Sailor Mars spoke to you unexpectedly and said, \"And take those boots of yours off! I just cleaned that floor!\" Obviously trying to avoid invoking Sailor Mars's wrath, you did what she ordered and took off your boots as you replied, \"Sorry! This is what happens when you grow up in the States like me, since I'm not used to Japanese traditions and all that weird stuff, Sailor Mars!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just after you took your black boots off and laid them beside the other pairs of shoes, leaving you in your socks, you walked toward where Sailor Mars was located at inside the temple. Luckily, as you went to the right, you found where Sailor Mars was at in the temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you noticed that Sailor Mars wasn't wearing her Sailor Scout outfit from last night. Instead, she was wearing a red hakama around her lower half, along with some white socks. But on her upper body, she wore a white long-sleeved robe shirt, with the bottom tucked into her red hakama pants. Other than that, Sailor Mars wasn't wearing her tiara, red star earrings, and her red high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sailor Mars looked at you and said, \"Just so you know, (IYNH), don't call me Sailor Mars when we aren't fighting the Nega Moon. But you can call me by my real name. It's Raye.\" \"Well, at least it's better than just calling you Sailor Mars all the time, Raye.\" You answered, as you then noticed that Raye wasn't the only Sailor Scout present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying against a nearby wall, sitting on the floor Indian-style, a short bluenette you recognized as Sailor Mercury, was currently using a laptop. Like Raye, Sailor Mercury wasn't in her Sailor Scout outfit either, wearing a casual outfit. Also sitting on the floor Indian-style, was Sailor Venus, wearing a casual outfit as well, as she was petting Artemis along his back. Then, you noticed Sailor Moon wearing just some shorts, white socks, and a short-sleeved button-up shirt, laying against some pillows while reading a few manga books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously not expecting something like this, you sat down by Raye and said, \"So...this is Sailor Scout HQ, huh?\" \"Well, it isn't much, (IYNH)...but it gets the job done. That's Amy over on the computer, that's Mina over there petting Artemis, the girl behind us reading my comics is Serena, and if you're looking for Lita, she's outside getting some practice into her punches and kicks.\" Raye answered, giving you the real names of each of the other Sailor Scouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you noticed a map of the entire city of Tokyo, marked out with black crescent moons at specific locations in the city, left out upon a coffee table. Curiously, you turned your head to look at Raye and said, \"I'm guessing that you're using this map as a way to point where these Nega Moon guys attacked, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was Luna's idea to map out each of their previous attacks. However, even with the concept of cataloguing each attack they had unleashed, we can't figure out what their motives are in attacking each location.\" Amy replied, all while keeping her eyes on the laptop monitor. From what you could see, the Sailor Scouts had a bit of a snag figuring out the Nega Moon's motives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a better examination, you picked up the map, looking at the area. Amy was right about one thing though; the places that each recieved an attack from the Nega Moon were either separate from one another by dozens of city blocks, or very close enough to touch one another. \"Although each of these were attacked by those Nega-scum, we managed to get rid of their negative energy in each area.\" Raye said, giving you a little more insight into the Sailor Scouts' fight against the Nega Moon forces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though your friend's right about one thing, Raye; These Nega Moon guys' attack patterns look random, almost as if they're....\" You replied, as you suddenly felt those gears in your mind grinding, realizing what their plans might be. From there, you suddenly grabbed a red marker, as you started connecting some of the points. Obviously thinking you might be going a little crazy, Raye lurched up from her position on the furniture as she growled, \"What are you doing?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, it got the attention of the other Scouts, as they approached the two of you to see what you were doing with the map. It was when you were finished that you showed what each location meant, as you laid the map back down on the table and answered, \"It's a theory, but I think I know what the Nega Moon is doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking at your handiwork, the attack locations all connected into what appeared to be a 5-point star. It was then that Luna appeared and jumped up onto the table, looked at what you did, looked up at you, and asked, \"I'm guessing that this is your theory, (IYNH)?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you stood up and slowly paced around a bit and answered, \"Look, I don't have as much experience in fighting these scumbags as you, girls. But I do know one thing though; Whatever Rubeus and whoever he's working for are planning, it's got something to do with what's happening in the present. As for why they've been attacking these places, it's got something to do with their plans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, your theory sounded a little...ludicrous. However, out of all the other Sailor Scouts, Raye was actually starting to think that your theory actually would make sense in the enemy's attacks, as she spoke and said, \"Look, to be honest girls, I...I think (IYNH) here might actually be onto something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing this, the other Scouts were a little surprised upon hearing Raye's response, as Lita spoke to Raye and said, \"Okay, first saving Catsy, and now this? Raye, I think you might be going a little bonkers on us here.\" \"Actually, I agree with both Raye and (IYNH) here on this matter, Lita. Think about it; the Nega Moon has attacked each of the places we had visited. The Chess Tower, the Supermarket, a Cosmetics Shop, even here at the Cherry Hill Temple!\" Amy answered, obviously agreeing with your theory actually making sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, Amy! Whatever these Nega Moon jerks are planning, it's really, really big!And as my Uncle once told me, 'Nothing is as simple as it seems'. And so far, he's on a winning streak here. Whatever their plans are, we gotta put an end to it. Fast!\" You replied, ready to head out to find answers. But then, Raye grabbed your and said, \"Hold on there, Rider! We don't even know where to start, how do you expect to find Rubeus and stop him and the NegaMoon's plans?\" However, in response, you turned your head to look at Raye &amp; her friends, displaying a sly smirk on your face and answered...</span></div></div>",

No way you're using them to get some answers!\" Raye yelled, suddenly realizing what your plan was, furiously rejecting your idea, as Lita joined in on the argument and said, \"Yeah, (IYNH). Haven't they been through enough as it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay first off, girls; I am not trying to interrogate those 4 sisters! I just want to talk to them, and I treat people fairly. 'Do unto others as they do unto you', right? Think about it; they were once working for Rubeus before they defected, correct? Maybe they might know a few things that we missed. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, but we're basically stumbling around in the dark without knowing what Rubeus and his superiors' plans are, other than that they're playing for keeps!\" You answered, being both calm and stern at the same time, as you put the grim truth out plain and simple to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after saying your words to them, there was this eerie moment of silence between you and the Sailor Scouts. Although you were just being honest with them to gain their trust, you unintentionally forgot that the truth can sometimes hurt. So, in an effort to amend things with the group, you let out a long sigh and said, \"Look, I'm...sorry for being harsh on you girls, but it's the honest but dark truth. Whether you like it or not, Sailor Scouts. I care about the fate of this world as much as you girls, but seeing when those scumbags get away with harming innocents and taunting us like they're untouchable really pisses me off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you did apologize to the Sailor Scouts for the truthful outburst, Raye...actually felt something toward you. At first, she thought it was sympathy, since you care about the world and want to protect it from the dark forces you're both currently facing against. But then, Raye's own heartbeat slightly increased in pace, almost as if...she was starting to fall in love with you. \"Whoa whoa whoa! Me, falling in love with (IYNH)? Get a hold of yourself, Raye!\" Raye thought to herself, trying to snap herself out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, shortly after snapping out of her near-daydream daze, Raye looked at you with a pair of serious eyes and answered, \"Fine, you can talk to them. But under only two conditions!\" \"Hm. Okay Raye, shoot.\" You said, crossing your arms, having a feeling that Raye's making a deal with you to talk to Catsy and her sisters under certain conditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as her fellow Sailor Scouts watched the powder keg of a small but important argument between you and their fiery comrade, Raye spoke to you and growled, \"First off, if you're having a 'talk' with Catsy and her 3 sisters, me and the other Sailor Scouts are coming along with you. And second, if you ever, EVER hurt them in anyway possible, we're sending you back to whoever your friends are, in bandages! Is that understood?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* That's fair enough, I guess.\" You replied, noticing how protective she was of Catsy and her female siblings, since she was directing that infamous bad temper of hers at you, literally putting the phrase \"Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn\" to shame. So, in an attempt to avoid making that temper of hers erupt even more, you uncrossed your arms, extended your right hand out a bit to shake Raye's hand on agreeing with her conditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Raye grabbed your extended hand with her own appendage, and shook it as she said, \"Good choice.\" Shortly after letting go of your hand, Raye went to her own bedroom to change out of her Miko outfit and into something more casual, where you thought to yourself and said, \"Wow. Now I see why she's Sailor Mars; she's got some roaring flames for a soul. hehe, my kind of girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she done getting dressed, Raye was now wearing a pair of jeans, sneakers, an orange long-sleeve shirt, and white jacket. As you put your black boots back on, you heard Amy call Birdy to have her and the other sisters meet you and the other Scouts at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, you arrived there minutes before Raye and her friends have, due to your mode of transportation, while they were forced to take the bus as a form of transportation, since neither actually own a car, let alone have the knowledge to drive one yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, just as expected, Catsy and her fellow siblings arrived as well, as you saw Raye and the others greet them with handshakes and hugs, noticing how friendly the four sisters were toward the Sailor Scouts. But then, Amy spoke toward Prisma and said, \"It's good to see you're feeling much better, Prisma. So, how does it feel to be free from Rubeus?\" \"I feel relieved to say the least. My sisters and I started up our own make-up business.\" Prisma replied, just as Catsy then remarked, \"Yeah, too bad Birdy's been using our products.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Birdy fired back at her sibling and answered, \"What? I was only testing them, Catsy!\" Of course, the four sisters and the Sailor Scouts couldn't help but have a chuckle about such a minor distraction. Then, Avery looked back at the very people who gave her and the other sisters a second chance at life and asked, \"So, why did you want us to meet you here, girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you stepped out into the open and answered, \"I believe I'm the answer to such a question, Avery.\" Of course, Avery and her fellow sisters easily recognized you. Or at least, back when you were as the Ghost Rider. \"Wait a minute, you're that bonehead with the flaming skull, aren't you?!\" Catsy said, easily recognizing you from memory. Of course, you felt a bit insulted by that unapproved nickname, where you then let out a sigh and replied, \"Glad to see you still remember me. But yeah, I'm the \"bonehead\" with the flaming skull. Name's (IYNH).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they were somewhat hesitant to talk to you, so you decided to reassure them and explained, \"Look, I know we got off on the wrong foot on that bridge last night, but I'm on the same side as the Sailor Scouts. Otherwise, I wouldn't be in such a talkative mood if I wasn't one of the good guys.\" \".....Alright, so.... what do you want then?\" Birdy asked, wanting to know what your true intentions were, due to you looked like something out of a nightmare when you're in your Ghost Rider form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to her question, you looked at Birdy and her 3 siblings and answered, \".....All I want are some answers, Birdy. I know that you and your sisters have worked with this \"Rubeus\" character before in the past. I came here to Japan to put an end to whoever or whatever has been causing these disturbances, and I intend to do so. However, I don't know how to stop them if I don't some answers. I'm not trying to interrogate you or anything like that. I just need to know who to go after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, hearing the name Rubeus obviously put a bad taste in their mouths, as Catsy crossed her arms in frustration and said, \"Hmph! Rubeus, that bastard deserves to be dead for all the pain he's caused! And to think I actually loved him.\" From what you heard from Catsy, you could easily tell that Rubeus sounds like a real scumbag that deserves the wrath of the Ghost Rider's Penance Stare, as you then turned your head toward Raye and asked, \"I take it that Rubeus is a real piece of Shit?\" \"Well, I wouldn't say it like that, (IYNH). But yeah, he was really bad. I mean, he abused Catsy's love for him, but then crushed it when she failed to catch Rini.\" Raye answered, bringing up how abusive and manipulative Rubeus was toward both Catsy and her fellow siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were a little confused as to who this Rini person was, as you then spoke toward Raye and the other Sailor Scouts and asked, \"Wait a sec, who's Rini?\" \"Ugh, she's a little girl who claims to be from the future like Catsy and the others.\"Serena replied, with an obvious tone of annoyance in her voice, as if Rini was getting on her nerves in some shape or form. Fortunately for Serena, you decided to focus back on Birdy and her sisters, as you then looked at them and said, \"I take it that you ladies were after Rini then, correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were. Back when we were working for Rubeus and the NegaMoon.\" Avery answered, which raised a few more questions than answers for you, as you then spoke once more and asked, \"The NegaMoon? I'm guessing that was the faction you and your siblings were a part of prior to your defection?\" \".....Yeah, we were a part of that group. Back then, our mission was not just to capture Rini and the Imperium Silver Crystal, we were also trying to corrupt several points around the city in the present with dark energy, so the future city of Crystal Tokyo would cease to exist.\" Birdy explained, since she was the one who received the details of the NegaMoon's plans by Rubeus himself. From there, you pulled out the map from earlier, as you laid it out on a nearby benched table and said, \"When you meant by corrupting several points of the city, did you mean THESE areas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking at the map you've presented, Birdy, Catsy, Avery, and Prisma confirmed your suspicions, as Birdy then spoke to you and answered, \"Yes, those were the areas we were trying to take over. Rubeus said it was all part of the NegaMoon's plan to control the Crystal Nexus. Back in the future, it was in the center of the city.\" Upon confirmation, you then folded up the map for transportation, as you then spoke toward Birdy and her sisters as you said, \"So in other words, you, your sisters, and Rubeus traveled back in time to alter the past, so the NegaMoon would succeed in the future and take over Crystal Tokyo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn confirmation, Birdy nodded once to confirm your summary of the situation at hand, as you then shook her hand and said, \"Thanks. That's all I need to know.\"  But then, just as you and the Sailor Scouts were about to leave....</span></div></div>",

From there, they realized that it was both Luna and Artemis whose calling the 5 girls, as Amy spoke toward the two felines and asked, \"Luna, Artemis? What's going on?\" Suddenly, they heard what sounded like a loud explosion on the other end of the communicator, as Luna spoke up and explained, \"Girls, we have a Droid attacking the Arcade Center! It's draining people of their energy! Get over here, quick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you overheard what Luna was talking about, just as Lita then spoke toward Luna and Artemis and replied, \"Don't worry, we're on it!\" From what you heard, you made an estimated guess that these \"Droids\" were basically the NegaMoon's foot soldiers, albeit monstrous inhuman foot soldiers. So, as Raye and her friends transformed into the Sailor Scouts, you figured now would be an excellent time to bring out the Ghost Rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as you got back on your motorcycle and started up the engine, you looked back at Raye and the other Sailor Scouts and said, \"You're not going to get there fast enough, ya know.\" \"You got a better idea, (IYNH)?\" Lita asked, a tiny bit annoyed at your comment. From there, you then spoke up and answered, \"Look, I can reach that \"Droid\" much faster than you girls on foot. I can take one of you with me to keep that freak preoccupied until the rest of you arrive. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the Sailor Scouts decided to go along with your plan, as Raye volunteered to accompany you, where she then sat behind you on the motorcycle. \"Alright then....Let's ride!\" You exclaimed, as you then quickly transformed back into your Ghost Rider form, causing the motorcycle to violently warp and alter into it's Hell-Cycle form, roaring to life with flaming wheels and a demonic appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you looked back at Sailor Mars and growled, \"HOLD ON.\" Then, you revved on the throttle, causing the Hell-Cycle's engines to roar and howl to life with a demonic aura. In turn, this caused the Hell-Cycle to go from 0 to over 100 miles per hour in two and a half seconds, leaving a trail of Hellfire in the process. Of course, Sailor Mars held on as tight as she possibly could throughout the high-speed ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was you swiftly weaved through oncoming traffic on your Hell-Cycle, Raye noticed how easily you were able to transform into the Ghost Rider in broad daylight, where she looked at you exclaimed, \"So, how are you still able to transform even if it's not nighttime?\" \"EVIL CREATURES LEAVE AN INHUMAN SCENT THAT STILL LINGERS. NO ORDINARY HUMAN CAN DETECT SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AS A SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE, I CAN PICK UP THIS SCENT WITH EASE.\"</span></div></div>",

In appearance, this Droid looked like a humanoid bat monster, as it wailed this inhuman screech, causing any nearby windows to shatter like a bull in a china shop. Of course, there were still innocent bystanders attempting to get away from the monstrous Droid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, among these bystanders, were Serena's friends Molly and Melvin, as they were knocked a bit closer toward the Droid by the crowd. In turn, this drew the bat-like Droid's attention, as it steadily stepped closer toward the two of them! \"Don't you date hurt Molly!\" Melvin said, standing up and shielding Molly with his own body, attempting to defy the inhuman creature that towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, both Melvin and the Droid heard the roaring sounds of a motorcycle rushing toward them, where you then launched up into the air via a ramp, raining Hellfire on the Droid with your Hellfire Revolver! \"Mars...Celestial...Fire...Surround!!\" Sailor Mars yelled, unleashing her Mars Celestial Fire attack on the Droid! From there, Sailor Mars quickly jumped off your Hell-Cycle, landing on the pavement in the process, while your Hell-Cycle landed as you drifted a hard turn to stop your momentum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, both Melvin, Molly, and the nearby crowd easily recognized Sailor Mars, but then they saw you in your Ghost Rider Form, displaying a mix of fear and confusion, unsure of your allegiance. Of course, the Droid cracked a smug smirk and said, \"Heh! Well well, if it isn't Sailor Mars! Where are your fellow Sailor dweebs?!\"  However, as you stepped off your Hell-Cycle, the Droid then took notice of you, obviously feeling that something wasn't human about you, aside from the flaming skull for a head and motorcycle with it's wheels on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your- GAAAAHH!!!\" The Droid asked, just as you whipped out your Hellfire Shotgun and fired once at the bat-like Droid, causing it to scream in pain as the Hellfire went through it's body and scorching a piece of it's \"soul\"! After all, Hellfire was known to pass through the physical plane and burn one's soul. \"I'M THE VERY BEING THAT MAKES YOUR SKIN CRAWL...\" You growled, where you then stepped closer toward the monster, firing off another shot from your Hellfire Shotgun, scorching it's soul a bit more, while you continued to speak and growled, \"I AM THE ONE WHO HUNTS SCUM LIKE YOU! I AM THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE WHO KILL THOSE WHO SPILL THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, you then fired off another shot, this time scarring the side of the Droid's inhuman face, making it hiss at you, as you then answered, \"I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN WALK ON BOTH WORLDS. I'M THE GHOST RIDER.\"  In response, the Droid lunged at you, launching you into a nearby wall, as Sailor Mars quickly dodged out of the way! From there, you delivered a powerful kick, launching the Droid 10 feet away from you, as you then freed yourself from the wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retaliation, the Droid unleashed a howling screech, screaming into the sky in the process! However, it was there that both you and Sailor Mars realized why the Droid screamed: It was calling for reinforcements, as multiple duplicates of the same Droid swooped down from above to aid their damaged comrade! Fortunately, the rest of the Sailor Scouts arrived, just you unleashed your Hellfire Chain upon the multiple Droids, whipping at the inhuman monstrosities alongside Sailor Mars!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while the fighting continued, Molly, Melvin, and rest of the nearby crowd used this to their advantage, as they escaped the battlefield toward the safety of incoming law enforcement! However, it was there you then noticed something: the Droid you scarred with your Hellfire was getting away, as it began to take flight from the battlefield! As you grabbed another Droid and slammed it into the ground, finishing it off with 3 powerful punches with your Hellfire Chain wrapped around your hand and arm like a set of makeshift brass knuckles, you then approached your Hell-Cycle, just as Sailor Moon noticed you on your demonic vehicle and asked, \"Hey, where do you think you're going?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ONE OF THOSE DROIDS IS GETTING AWAY. I'M HUNTING IT DOWN!\" You answered, as you revved up your Hell-Cycle, then quickly turned it to go after the retreating Droid, accelerating from 0 to 125 miles an hour, leaving a blazing trail of Hellfire behind you.</span></div></div>",

You would ride on your motorcycle not just for fun, but also because those enemies could kill you quickly on the ground. You would ride to survive. In the final battle between you and the leader of the monsters, you won but the monster destroyed your motorcycle and you have never ridden again.<br>\r\nLita was shocked when she heard that story.</span></div></div>",

Later Chacu Challhua was about to destroy the school when you heard Mercury yell \"BLACK-WING STORM!\" Then a black whirlwind shot at the Immortal, causing it to roar in pain. \"The Black-Winged Dragon has chosen you Mercury\" you said. All four of you hit the Immortal with everything you had, but it still wasn't enough you knew what you had to do. Jupiter begged you not to use the power of the Crimson Dragon. But you told her \"I'm sorry Jupiter. I have to. I will not allow my friends to die. And I'm sure as hell not letting the love of my life die either.\" Jupiter then started to blush at that statement. Then you used the wings, tail, and left arm of the Crimson Dragon to attack Chacu Challhua. \"CRIMSON SLASH!\" you yelled. You then swung your arm, Slicing the Immortal into Peices. Then the purple Chaos Emerald apperared and absorbed into your body. But then the amount of energy used had taken its tole. The wound on your chest had gotten bigger than before.

Neither of you had a clear advantage until you made a slip and Koragg got the upper hand. From that point on it was one-sided. Koragg slashed you over and over again. Your armour could barely withstand the blows. It took a while but eventually your armour broke and you returned to normal. You still had your sword so Koragg continued to attack you. Blood poured out of your body until you had less then 5 pints and you died. Lita saw you die and she became insanly angry. She went straight into Star Jupiter form and attacked Koragg but he just slashed her and she fell but Jupiter got back up and tried again. She kept trying and kept on getting angry until she evolved into Sin Star Jupiter. In this form all of her anger and hatred and other minus emotions fueled her armour.

Your spirit is a drill that will pierce the heavens. Come on, what are you mopping around for? Let's go.\"<br>\r\nJupiter nodded and your powers grew.

You began to run up one of them and sliced the others. The demon tried to hot you with its claws, but you sliced it hand just as easily as its tendrils. Once you made it to its shoulder, you jumped high above it and called upon the power of lightning. When the girls saw this, they were both shocked and amazed.

You dodged it and looked where the blast came from. \"APOPHIS!\" Then a snake-like creature appeared and began to laugh. \"It's been a long time.

But when Apophis saw her, he knew he had a chance to weaken you. He shoved you aside and charged at Venus. He used his Venom Blade and slashed at her. But you pushed her out of the way and took the hit for her. Apophis laughed and said \"Just as I planed. Good-bye, Son of Ra. The venom can only be cured by one being. But as far as I know, You haven't spoken to your father in years. Fare well!\" Apophis left and Venus ran up to you. You were screaming in pain and the other scouts arrived shortly after. They helped you get to the hospital. But when you got there, the doctor said that you only had 24 hours to live. The others gasped and Mina began to cry.  The doctor left the room and Mina never let go of your hand. Soon 20 hours went by and Mina never left your side. The other scouts were in the room with the two of you. \"Mina, my love,\" you said weakly \" I just want you to know, the last 24 hours with you have been the best in all my life.

You placed your hand on her face and said \"Promise me.\" She nodded and you closed your eyes.

Her hymnea broke and she felt pain but hs ekept on going and then you thrusted your dick in and out over and over again. The feel of each other was so immense that you both came. Then Morrigan got off and began to arouse you until you were ready and then she put her ass on you, after putting some lube on. Your dick went into Morrigan's ass and she was really enjoying it.<br>\r\n\"So tight,\" you moaned \"I love your ass, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't say that,\" Morrigan moaned \"It's so dirty that I'll cum too early.\"<br>\r\nYou kept shut but continued to pound Morrigan's ass. Neither of you could hold it and you both came.<br>\r\nAfter that Morrigan sexually aroused you by getting on you but putting her vagina over your face and keeping her mouth near your dick. You were so aroused that your dick just shot up into Morrigan's ready mouth. You put your tongue in her vagina and began to eat her out while she gave you a blow job. You massivly pleasured her and teased her cunt a bit but she was screaming with pleasure and she began to deep throat you. You could feel your dick go and go. Both of you were in ecstasy. Neither of you could stop feeling this amount of pleasure but then you both came. However, neither of you could stop. You just kept on giving each other oral. Suddenly you both blasted out a massive amount of cum and then you both passed out from the amount of cum you produced but not before you could say to Morrigan<br>\r\n\"Mistress, my queen, I love you with all of my heart.\"</span></div></div>",

As the creature howled in pain, Mina looked and saw you standing, even though you had a large hole in your shirt. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou will not harm on hair on her head.\u201d</span> you said as you called upon the power of wind. You created a sphere of wind in your hand and Mina could tell how powerful it was just from how fast it was spinning. You then charged at the creature and landed a powerful kick, which sent him through a glass window door and onto a balcony. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNow that we\u2019re outside, you will pay for attacking Mina.\u201d</span> You once again began to charge and this time, you thrusted your right arm forward and the wind sphere connected with the creatures stomach. The sphere began to bore into him. <b><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cRASENGAN!\u201d </span></b>you yelled as you sent him into the sky. The amount of power in that attack destroyed him when he was high enough. You then used your powers to repair all of the damages the creature did and the people returned to find everything back in place. Luckily, you and the girls were back to normal at that point. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNow that that\u2019s over, what were you going to say?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</span> you said scratching the back of your head and blushing <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI was saying I think I\u2019m in love\u2026 with you Mina.\u201d</span> Mina blushed and she hugged you at that point and you embraced her as well. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI love you too Sasuke.\u201d</span> The girls saw what was happening and decided to keep quiet for now. Shortly after that, you and Mina ad one last slow dance and shortly after that, the two of you went home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The crow then landed on Mina\u2019s shoulders and she asked it to take her and the others to your home. The crow nodded and took to the air. The girls followed the crow and it led them through a forest. Soon, they reached what looked like a barrier of some kind. But when they passed through it, they saw what the outside of your home looked like. They thought it was the scariest mountain they will ever see. But then, the crow changed back into a tiger and led them up the mountain. Soon, they found themselves at the entrance. Mina and Artemis entered with the others close behind. But as soon as she entered the door, Rei felt some powerful negative vibes form the place. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWelcome. I had been expecting you. Hello Mina.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cH-Hi Chase.\u201d</span> she said with a blush. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cCome, I prepared a little feast for you and your friends.\u201d</span> you said as your jungle cats which included tigers, panthers and jaguars led them to the dining hall. As soon as Serena had saw the spread on the table, she immediately took a seat. The others followed suit and they all enjoyed the food you prepared for them. Lita was hoping to get the recipes from you. Artemis was having a good time as well. As soon as Serena was finished, they heard you walk into the room in the next level. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cI trust your meal is satisfactory.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cIt\u2019s the best meal we\u2019ve had in ages.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cI\u2019m pleased that you\u2019re enjoying yourselves.\u201d</span> you said as you snapped your fingers.

He\u2019s Chase Young, the prince of darkness.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cWhat are you talking about Rei?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cTrust me, I know what I am saying.

You lived with your loving parents in a small town in America. Your mother was a kind and caring young man who worked for a company. Your father on the other hand was a bit unusual. Not in the crazy way, but in a magical way. He had the ability to perform magic. You loved how he performed magic tricks. He didn't perform tricks like a magician, but he did magic attacks and other many forms of magic. You thought it was so cool that you wanted to learn how to use the magic your dad did. Your dad was reluctant at first, but then he decided to teach you. He taught you everything he knew from attack spells, element spells and many others. The teaching was difficult at first, but eventually you were as good as your father. Your father was proud and you thought he was the best in the world. Everything was wonderful until one day, everything changed. One night, you woke up in the middle of the night by a strange sound. You went to inspect it and you saw your father saying goodbye to your mother, but your father looked different. He was wearing a full body suit with a cape and he was also wearing a helmet. When you saw him, you were amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung (name): Daddy? Is that you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom jumped in surprise and when she saw you, she tried to hide your father in his new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: (name)! Son. I can explain! ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father: It's all right honey. He was bound to find out sooner or later. May I have a spare moment with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother stepped back and your father kneeled down, took off his helmet and spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father: Son. It's time I told you the truth. About everything. Would you care to listen to your dear old father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung (name): Sure Daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou father then told you everything. He revealed that he was actually from another world in a different galaxy and that he was a guardian to protect the world from evil. He was known as the Solaris Knight. Also the training from your father was preparation for you to carry on your father's legacy. At first it was a bit overwhelming to you, but you understood every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So you're a superhero that saves people Daddy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father: That's right. And right now I have to go and save my friends. I have just been called to join them in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung (name): Will you be back soon Daddy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father: I don't know son, but I want you to know that I love you no matter what. And take care of your mother as well too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung (name): I will Daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father: And here. I want you to have something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father took out a strange looking phone and a small framed picture of you and your father and mother and handed them both to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father: These are for you. I bear the responsibility for protecting this world and someday you will too. Just remember, don't ever lose to evil. Protect this world from evil and if you're ever feeling alone, I'll always be with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your gifts and then at your father. You gave your father a determined look and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung (name): I promise. I won't let you down Dad<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the very last time you saw your father. A few years had passed since your father disappeared. You now were going to a new school, but it was all the way in Tokyo. So you and your mother left America and moved all the way from Tokyo. At first you missed your previous home in America for it always reminded you of your father, but you were open to a new experience. You were on your way to your new school, but you were feeling a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. This is it. I can do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a beep and vibration in your pocket. You pulled your phone which happened to be the phone that your father gave you and answered it. It was your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Hi sweetie. Did you get to school OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mom. I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm coming up to the school now. You don't have to call me every few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Sorry honey. I just worry about you so much ever since....you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mom it's OK. I'll be fine. Besides Dad wouldn't want you to feel sad. Be happy okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: Hahaha. You're just like him. Always positive. Well I better let you go. Have fun okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kay mom. Love you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: Love you too son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your mom hang up.  You sighed and laughed to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. That's mom for you. Always being worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you arrived at the school gates of Juuban Municipal. You dug in your chest and pulled out a landyard with a picture if you and your father and looked at it. You couldn't help, but think about that faithful day when your father left. You lightly clenched your picture and looked up in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Well Dad, I'm finally ready to see the world and make new friends. I promise you'll be proud of me. I'll do whatever it takes to be just like you, so please.......watch over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just walked past the school gates when....</span></div></div>",

She's.....she's beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked into the school, you couldn't stop staring at her. You were staring at her so much that you didn't watch where you were going. Then you bumped into something hard and fell flat on your back. You looked up to see three boys standing over you. The one in the middle was the one you bumped into, and he wasn't happy that you bumped into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiddle Boy: Hey! Watch where you're going punk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oops! Sorry about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and politely apologized to them. Unfortunately, the boys weren't gonna let you off easy. The right boy got up in your face looking like he was trying to pick a fight with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight boy: If you're really sorry, you'd get on your knees and give me your lunch money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft boy: You better do it now, otherwise we're gonna have to beat you up for hurting our boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! I said I was sorry. And there's no way I'm gonna do that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight boy: Fine! I guess. We're gonna have to beat you up kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them surrounded you so you couldn't escape. You took a defensive stance ready to defend yourself. Then you heard voice and Lita came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita: Hey! Back off. He said he was sorry and frankly he barely tapped you. That's low picking on him like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight boy: What'd you say?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft boy: No one talks to us like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left boy charged forward and attempted to punch Lita, but Lita caught him and flipped him with a judo throw. The right boy tried to attack Lita as well, but Lita side stepped out of the way and kneed him hard in the gut. You gaped in wonder seeing Lita's fighting skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Whoa! She's amazing! Not only is she beautiful, but she's got strength and fighting skills to boot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed the middle guy behind Lita. He pulled something that made your blood freeze. A knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh my gosh! He's gonna stab that girl with the knife! I gotta do something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you....</span></div></div>",

Lita looked behind her in time to see you step between her and the middle guy with the knife. The knife was close to nailing you in the face, but you turned your head and dodged it. Then you smacked the knife out of the guy's hand and gave him a powerful punch in the gut knocking the wind out of him. The middle guy was motionless for a moment, then he fell down to the ground. The middle guy's other two guys as well as Lita all stared at you in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight guy: Oh crap! He beat the boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft guy: Oh man! Grab him and let's scram!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys quickly grabbed their leader and they ran for the hills. Lita turned around and came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita: Whew. That was close. You saved my skin. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No problem. Couldn't let stand by while a beautiful girl is getting attacked from behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita blushed from your compliment, then she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita: Oh no! Your hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your right hand and saw that you had a gash on it. It was a big cut, but to you it wasn't that big of a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. Don't worry. It's just a scratch. I'll take care of it when I have time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita: No way! Now hold still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest anymore, Lita dug into her pocket pulled out a handkerchief and tied it around your hand over your wound. As she tied it on, you couldn't help, but blush seeing Lita so close to you. Your heart began to beat like a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita: There we go. You should be okay know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But.....is this okay? I mean, your handkerchief is gonna get all dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita: It's okay. It's the least I can do after you saved me like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked at her watch and then she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita: Anyway, I gotta go. See you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey wait! Tell me your name at least!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita: It's Lita! See you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask anything more about her, Lita had already raced into the distance. All you could do is watch Lita disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. So Lita's her name. She's an incredible woman. Not to mention kind and strong. (sigh) I hope I can see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the school began to ring snapping you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh crap! That's the bell! Oh man! I'm gonna be late on my first day! Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you raced off to class hoping that you wouldn't be late. Then.....</span></div></div>",

You had no idea where to go or what to do? You looked down hallways and you looked up stairs, but you couldn't find your classroom. To you it was like a maze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh come on! Where the heck am I supposed to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to give up, but then a voice called out to you. You turned to find a young woman named Ms. Haruna walking up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Haruna: There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you. Are you (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Haruna: Good. I'm Ms. Haruna your teacher. When you didn't show up, I figured you were lost. So I came to get you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thank goodness. Sorry about this. I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Haruna: It's okay. Just make sure it doesn't happen again. Now come on, let's get you to your new classroom okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ms. Haruna led you to the classroom. Soon you both stopped outside a classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: This must be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Haruna: Okay. I'm gonna go settle the class down and take roll. You stay out here. I'll let you know when to come in okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ms. Haruna went in leaving you alone. At this point, you excited and nervous at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Okay. This is it. This is going to be my new classroom. I hope I can make some friends here. Maybe I'll even get a girlfriend here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked at your hand where Lita bandaged your wound. You couldn't help, but think about Lita and her kindness for saving you and using her handkerchief to cover up your cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. That girl sure was kind. She would make the perfect girlfriend. What was her name? Lita I think. Man, she sure was pretty. I think I'm in love. I wish I could see her again. Maybe she'll be in my class. Okay! Calm down. You have to relax! Relax!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard Ms Haruna speak to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Haruna: Now listen up class. Today I have an important announcement to make. We have a new transfer student tin our class today. He's from America and I expect you all to give him a warm welcome. His name is.....(name). You can come in now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Okay! Here goes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plucked up your courage and walked in the classroom. When you came in you stood in front of the class and bowed politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hello. It's nice to meet all of you. I hope we all can be good friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you took your seat and class began. A little later it was the lunch period. You thought that this was the perfect opportunity to find some new friends. You looked around to find some one to hang with, but you couldn't find anyone. Then.....</span></div></div>",

You're (name) am I right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....yeah. That's me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Hi! I'm Serena. It's nice to meet you. I noticed you hadn't made any new friends yet, so I thought I'd introduce myself. Hehehe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's nice to meet you Serena. You know, it's a good thing you came. I haven't really made friends because there's hardly anyone around. Why is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: I think it's because they're scared of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Of me? Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Well, I can't really explain it, but I heard people say that you're a guy that loves to fight because they saw a fight you got into today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh crap. So that's how it it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: But don't worry, I don't think you're scary at all. In fact, you seem like a really sweet guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well thank you for saying so Serena. That's really nice of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Hey! I got an idea! After school, how about I introduce you to some of my friends? They'd really love to meet you! And I can show you the arcade where me and the girls hang out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure. I'd like that very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Yay! You're gonna love my friends and you're gonna love living here too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell began to ring signaling that the lunch period was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Well, I gotta get back to class! I'll see you after school (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): See you then Serena! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Serena dashed back to class. As you watched Serena leave, you were all smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Awesome! I finally made a friend! Even if it's one, that's awesome! And I'm gonna make some more friends after school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered Lita and you looked at your hand where her bandana was tied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Still, I wish I could see that Lita girl. I would have loved to be her friend. Hehehe. Maybe even something more. Hahaha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you daydreamed about Lita, you couldn't help but get a silly grin on your face. Then you snapped out of your love daze and hurried back to class. Then later after school you met Serena after class and you walked with her to....</span></div></div>",

There was crane games, racing games, and fighting games too. One thing was for sure, you had never been to an arcade before, but you were loving being in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow Serena. This place is amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Have you been to the arcade before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Nope. This is the first time for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: What? Man, you've been missing out. Come on! I'll show you one of my favorite games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena then led you to an arcade game called Sailor V or something like that. Then she inserted a quarter and began to play so she could show you how it's done. At first she was doing fine, but then at some point she began to get overwhelmed by enemies and she ended up losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Oh man! Well, I guess I didn't do too bad since it's been a while. Well (name), wanna give it a go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure. I don't know if I'll be good, but I'll do my best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was your turn to play. It was a little awkward for you at first, but then you started to get the hang of it.  You blasted lots of monsters which earned you more and more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Wow! You're pretty good at this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You think so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first your score was about ten thousand, but then to Serena's surprise, the score began to climb higher and higher. Soon your score was up to fifty thousand and counting. Unknown to you, a crowd was forming and everyone was watching you play the game. They were all amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Oh man. He's even better than I thought. He might even beat Amy's score!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour score was now up to ninety nine thousand and you were about to face the big boss. You engaged the boss and gave it everything you got. Then when boss was weak enough, you blasted it one more time and you defeated the big boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes!!! I did it!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the crowd that was watching you playing erupted cheers and applause. You nearly fell over in surprise seeing the huge crowd. You pushed through the crowd to find Serena. You found her chatting to a guy with blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Serena!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Oh! (name)! I want you to meet someone! This is Andrew. He works here at the game center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew: Nice to meet you (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. Nice to meet you Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew: So I take it you like to play games as much Serena does?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Not really. To be perfectly honest, it's my first time playing a game like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew and Serena: Seriously?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: But you're so good! Not to mention you got the highest score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hehehe. It was nothing really. I noticed all the patterns in the game and stuff so it was pretty easy to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish explaining, you looked at the clock. It was getting late and your mother was probably getting worried about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sorry Serena. Sorry Andrew, but I gotta get home. My mom's probably wondering where I'm at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Oh sorry about that. I don't want your mom to worry. Hey by the way, I'd like you to meet some friends of mine tomorrow. I'll introduce you to them tomorrow after school if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure! I'm always looking for some new friends. Anyway, I'll see you Serena.

I can't wait to tell my mom! I not only had an awesome day at school, but I made some new friends! Can this day get any more awesome?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly just as you rounded a corner, you saw something or rather someone. It was a young man who wearing a blue gray suit with a green trim. His hair brown and tied to a ponytail and he seemed to floating in the air with in a veil of flowers. He was Zoisite third commander of The Dark Kingdom. When you saw him you had a bad feeling like your body was instinctively warning you to be careful. He stalked around the house and seemed to be looking for something. One thing was for sure, he definitely looked suspicious. You hid behind the corner and peeked out so he couldn't see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Who the heck is that? Whoever he is, he looks suspicious. I wonder what he's up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hid behind a wall so he couldn't see you. Then Zoisite pulled out a black prism. The prism began to glow and a bright light came out of it. It looked like he was using the crystal to track something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: According to this, the person who has the next rainbow crystal should be right around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Rainbow crystal? Why would he searching for a crystal in a place like this? Maybe he's some kind of thief. A wanted international thief that steals jewels and other stuff just to make money or something. I wonder if I should call the cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as you took a step to try to get closer, your foot hit a can with a loud clang. You quickly hid back, worried that Zoisite heard you. There was a long silence. It was so quiet that the only sound you heard what your heart pounding in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Man! That guy definitely heard me for sure! OK. Just stay calm (name). Maybe he didn't hear you. Maybe he thought that you were a stray cat or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back to see where Zoisite was, but you looked only to find that he had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the.... Where did he go? I'm sure I saw him just a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Zoisite appeared behind you making your heart nearly jump out of your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: What have we here? A little spy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Uh oh! Busted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: You know little boy, it's very rude to spy on people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little scared, but you bravely stood your ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey you! I don't know you are, but your not getting your hands on that rainbow crystal or whatever you're looking for! Not while I'm around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Hm. You're pretty brave for a little boy. And you know? Such bravery is deserving of a sporting chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A sporting chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Here's what I'll do, I'll give you ten seconds. In that five seconds, I want you to turn around, walk away, and forget that you ever saw me. If you're still here by the time I get to ten, I will make you wish that you had never seen me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: One......two......three......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zoisite counted down, you looked around,. There was no one to be seen for miles which was perfect. You knew that Zoisite was no ordinary man and you knew that you couldn't let him get away so you had only one option. You had to fight him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: There's no way that I'm gonna get this guy get away.  I can't fight this guy using normal tactics like with those thugs. Which means I'm gonnna have to take him with my my magic. It's been a long time since I had to use magic, but it's my only option. I'll just use a spell to catch him off guard and then I'll turn him in to the authorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Four........Five........Six........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a defensive stance and prepared yourself to fight. Zoisite seeing you getting ready to fight began to get slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Seven.......Eight.......Nine.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Here goes nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when Zoisite was about to say ten......</span></div></div>",

Zoisite immediately dodged and landed on the ground safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: What the....!! How did you do that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered him by launching another spell at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Easy. I did this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fire ball shot from your hand. Zoisite disappeared to dodge the fireball. Then Zoisite reappeared behind you and and unleashed an attack of his own. A swarm of flower petals surrounded him and then they turned into needles. Zoisite waved his hand and fired the needles straight toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Zoi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh no you don't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved your hands and a barrier protected you from the needles. Zoisite then landed on the ground and you dispelled your barrier. At the moment, you two were at a stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: I must say, I'm impressed. You're definitely not an ordinary human. But if you think you stand a chance against me just because of that, you got another thing coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite then disappeared and reappeared in front of you in a blinding speed. Then he proceeded to punch you, but luckily you narrowly dodged it. You countered with a punch of your own, but Zoisite dodged the blow. You punched and you punched and you even kicked, but Zoisite dodged every blow like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Is that the best you can do kid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm not finished yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you fired a spell at Zoisite which he dodged, but this time you closed in and gave Zoisite a powerful punch in the face. Zoisite reeled back and and staggered in surprise. Zoisite now had a line of blood coming of his mouth. He wiped his lip and saw the blood. He gave you a look of pure anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: You little bastard! You scarred my precious face! I'll make you pay for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood your ground and got ready for Zoisite's next move. Zoisite who was now extremely mad and was ready to kill you, but then a voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Stop right there Zoisite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Who said that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around trying to find where the voice was coming from. You looked on top of wall and there standing there was a young girl. She was wearing a sailor uniform with a red bow. She wore red boots, was wearing a tiara on her head and had a familiar pair of buns and pigtails. She leaped down from the wall and stood between you and Zoisite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What in the world? Who is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Grr! Sailor Moon. Always showing up at the most annoying times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Sailor Moon? Is that who this girl is? What is she? Some kind of super heroine? And why does she look so familiar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: I don't what's going on here, but I do know that you're up to no good Zoisite! In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: You always had a nasty habit of butting in. As much as I want to destroy you Sailor Moon, I'm a bit busy right now. This boy just scarred my beautiful face and I must make him pay. So you'll have to wait your turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: Hey! Don't ignore me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Now then...prepare to die boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite then went on the attack again gunning straight for you, but quickly fired a spell. Zoisite disappeared and reappeared again and then fired a force of energy at you. You were blown back a little, but managed to stand your ground. Sailor Moon watched your fight with surprise and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: Wow! How is he doing that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Zoisite kept firing blast after blast trying to at least get one hit in on each other. Then Zoisite fired an energy past that went right past you and hit a telephone pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh come on! You completely missed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite said nothing. He just gave you grin that made you feel a little uneasy. Then you heard a creaking then you that the telephone pole was falling and it was falling toward Sailor Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: Eeeekk!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Watch out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fired a spell right at the pole falling. It exploded with a mighty boom, but Sailor Moon was out of danger. Unfortunately, you left yourself wide open, for Zoisite took advantage of the distraction and fired an enregy attack right at you sending you sprawling to the ground. Then Zoisite stood over you and made a sword made of crystal appear. He raised it and prepared to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: Oh no! Look out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Now you die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that it was the end for you, but then....</span></div></div>",

Then a young girl with a familiar brown hair in a ponytail landed in front of you. She was wearing the exact same outfit as Sailor Moon, but hers had different colors. She was Sailor Jupiter. Another of the Sailor Scouts. When you saw her, you couldn't help but stare in awe of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: Sailor Jupiter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Jupiter: Sorry I'm late Sailor Moon. (turns to you) Hey kid. You okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see Jupiter extending her hand offering to help you up. You took her hand and she helped you to your feet. You didn't know why, but you couldn't take your eyes off of Sailor Jupiter. For some reason you felt like you had seen this girl somewhere before. You just couldn't put your finger on it. Sailor Jupiter was of course Lita, but you didn't know this yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-yes. I'm fine. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, two more girls jumped in out of nowhere and behind Zoisite making him surrounded. One of them was a girl with blue hair and the other had long black hair. They were also wearing outfits just like Sailor Moon and Jupiter and had their own different colors as well. They were Sailor Mercury and Sailor Mars. When Zoisite saw them he was more annoyed than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: So the rest of them have come huh? How annoying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mecury: Okay Zoisite! You're evil ways stop right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mars: We won't stand by while you attack innocent people! So if you wanna fight someone then fight us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: Oh you guys! Thank you so much! You saved our butts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mars: Well we wouldn't have had to if you had just showed up when you had to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: Oh come on Mars! I couldn't help it! Give me a break!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mars: Yeah right Meatball head! You probably were fooling around with Darien or something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: Grrrr!!!! That's all you ever say! Serena, you're an idiot! Serena, you're dumb! Serena, stop being lovey dovey! All you ever do is be mean! Well I'm more mature than you!!! Blblblbblbl!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mars: Get real Meatball head! Blblblbllb!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Sailor Moon and Mars got into an argument and were having some kind of sticking out your tongue contest. You and the other Sailors all sweatdropped and couldn't believe that they were fighting at a time like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Uhhh......Are they always like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Jupiter: Sadly yes. But don't worry they're best friends when push comes to shove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well I hate to say it, but with friends like that who needs enemies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mercury: Hey you guys! Stay focused! We're dealing with Zoisite remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite who was standing in the sidelines made readied himself for a fight. After all it was five against one now. Six if that included you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Well, well. The Sailors Scouts. As much as I want to deal with you right now, I'll deal with you later, My business is with that boy. So if you know what's good for you, you'll hand over the boy and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a defensive stance and got ready to fight again, but then the sailors stood between you and Zoisite protecting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mars: No way! You have to get by us first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mercury: That's right! We won't let you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Jupiter: We'll protect him no matter what. So you might as well give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon: That's right! We can't sit by while you go around hurting innocent people. In the name of the moon.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter: We'll punish you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Fine then! I'll just destroy all of you at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite got ready to fight and so did the sailors. You got ready to fight as well, but Jupiter placed her hand on your shoulder and calmed you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Jupiter: Don't worry. We'll take it from here. Stand back okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....yeah. Sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped back and did as you were told. Zoisite was more than ready to begin the fight, but suddenly a voice rang in his head making him stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Zoisite! Cease your attack immediately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Kunzite?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: You must retreat. It's an order from Queen Beryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: But Kunzite.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Now! You don't want to upset Queen Beryl do you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Zoisite had no choice but to do what the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Sorry Sailor Scouts, but something came up. I'll let you all live. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey you! Come back here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at you with great hate on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: You got lucky this time boy. But the next time we meet, I'll personally see to it that it will be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he disappeared in a storm of flowers. You let out a sigh of relief seeing him disappear. You could now rest easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew. That was close. At least he's gone. Anyway thanks for saving me Sail.....what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the Sailors wanting to thank them, but they were nowhere to be found. It was like they disappeared into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the heck? Where'd they go? I wanted to thank them for saving me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the lights from the street lamps began to flicker and turn on which meant that it was getting late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh crap! I better get home! Mom's probably worried sick about me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dashed away towards your house not wanting to make your mom worry. Unbeknownst to you, four figures watched as you ran towards home. Then they disappeared into the night.</span></div></div>",

How dare that little brat do that to me! I swear when I see him I'll....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a young man with long silver hair with blue-grey eyes appeared. He was Kunzite. Another one of Queen Beryl's loyal generals and considered to be one of the most powerful in entire Dark Kingdom. And he's also Zoisite's lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: Calm down Zoisite. It isn't good for you to be angry like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Kunzite! How can I be calm after what that boy did to me!? He scarred my precious face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: A boy? A mere boy was able to wound you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: He was far from ordinary! He was using some kind of sorcery! I swear when I see him again I'll....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite. Enough. Queen Beryl is requesting your presence immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: How cruel. You don't even care. You mean Kunzite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: You know that's not true Zoisite. I'll always care about you my love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite turned away. Then Kunzite smiled and made a rose materialize in his hands. Zoisite still had his head turned, but when Kunzite handed him the flower he gratefully accepted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: There. You look much better when you're smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Thank you Kunzite. You always make me smile my love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: And don't you worry. When I find the boy who did this to you, I'll personally see to it that he pays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Oh Kunzite....thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: Come. Let's so see Queen Beryl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later in throne room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: We're here just as you requested Queen Beryl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: My queen. Why did you stop me? I could have easily have defeated those Sailor Scouts. Not to mention that I was in the middle of searching for a rainbow crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Beryl: Orders have been given by the great ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: Orders?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: What are they my queen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Beryl: The two of you are to go on a mission. You must find a very powerful item known as The Sword of Darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: The Sword of Darkness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Beryl: The Sword of Darkness was wielded by a powerful warrior who served The Dark Kingdom many years ago. He was one of the most strongest warriors that ever existed. Until the day that we suffered a great loss to our enemy. After the rainbow crystals were sealed, he was sealed away in his own sword never to be seen again until now. The Great Ruler has located the sword and now wants the sword found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite: But why my queen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Beryl: I don't need to explain myself to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. Then Kunzite bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunzite: Very well. We shall get the sword and bring it to you at once my queen. Where is the sword located?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Beryl: You will find it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Beryl waved her crystal ball and a picture formed. It was a picture of forest with cave close to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Beryl: Now go. And don't let the Sailor Scouts stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoisite and Kunzite: At once Queen Beryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kunzite and Zoisite left to go retrieve the sword. Meanwhile back at your place, you had just made it home. Your mom was a little upset that you were home a little late, but she was glad that you were home safe. Then after you ate dinner and washed up, you got ready for bed. As you lied you in your bed, you thoughts were filled about everything that you experienced. Meeting Serena, going to the arcade, going through the ordeal of fighting Zoisite and having the Sailor Scouts save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Man. What an incredible first day I had. I'll say this much about this town, there's definitely never a dull moment. Although it would have been awesome if I never ran into that guy. And those Sailor Scouts. I wonder who they really are. For some reason, I feel like I've seen them before. Nah. No way. (yawn) Oh well. I guess I better get some sleep. I got school tomorrow and a chance to make more friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

The monster was very powerful and was about to finish off Sailor Venus, when they heard someone yell \"CHAOS SPEAR!\" Just then, a spear made of energy slached the monster's wrists and it roared in pain. as the sailor scouts and the monster turned their heads, they saw a siloet in the sun. \"WHO ARE YOU?!\" asked the monster. You then said \"I am the champion of truth, the warrior of light, the King of Hearts. I am Solaris Knight! Now, you lay one more hand on Sailor Venus, I will obliterate you!\" The monster clenched its fist and threw a punch at Sailor Venus. Venus closed her eyes and waited for the punch to hit her. But just before Venus was struck, she heard an impact, but didn't feel any pain. She opened her eyes and saw that you blocked the monster's punch with just one hand. She was amazed at your strength and she heard you say to the creature, \"Don't say I didn't warn you.\" You then used your hand to push the creatures fist back and you jumped into the air. Your right hand began to glow and you yelled \"SHINING FINGER!!!\" A huge energy blast came from your hand and destroyed the monster instantly. You then landed on the ground and Venus just stared at you with lust. You walked over to her and offered her your hand and helped her up like a gentleman. Venus thought that she hit the jack-pot. As you helped Venus up to her feet, the other scouts asked why you were here. You told them that you were around when the creature appeared. Then Sailor Mercury asked what you were looking for. You then said \"I will tell you all tomorrow. Where shall we meet?\" Then Sailor Venus said you could all meet at the temple that belongs to Sailor Mars. You agreed and you said \"Until tomorrow Sailor Scouts. CHAOS CONTROL!\" Just then, a flash of light flared from where you were standing, and when the light faded, you were gone. The scouts thought you teleported yourself to another location. Venus couldn't wait to see you again.</span></div></div>",

The two of you were waiting for his attack, when Shark Gundam came from the side and was about to take a bite out of Venus. Again, there wasn't enough time for you to react with an attack, so you took the hit again. Venus heard Shark Gundam's teeth sink into your flesh. She asked you why you took the hit. You then said to her \"I will take hits like this for you a thousand times over.\" She then placce her hand on your cheek (Or rather the cheek of your helmet) and thanked you. You then sent a surge of energy into Shark Gundam's mouth, causing him to let go. He then retreated back into the water, while you were losing a huge amount of blood. Venus tried to help you up, but then Shark Gundam came out of the water again. And this time, you couldn't do anything to save Venus. But before he made contaact, Sailor Mars hit him and sent him back into the water. You turned your head and saw the other scouts have arrived. You told Jupiter to use her lightning on the water. She did as you told her and Shark Gundam was sent into the air. This was yoour chance. You raised your right arm, even though your arm was covered in blood and used your Shining Finger attack. Sharrk Gundam was destroyed and the dark blue emerald went into your body. The two emeralds healed your wounds, but the amount of blood you lost was too great and you passed out. Venus took you back to her home and began to clean the blood off of you. </span></div></div>",

Then you did a bit of shopping, which you kindly paid for. After that you had some lunch which you paid for. You were heading back to the temple when Mina noticed a karaoke bar and dragged you there. Along the way Mina explained that she wanted to be a singer. When you got inside the building, Mina asked you to sing a duet with her. You agreed and you sang <i>Love will find a way</i>. When you finished, Mina asked you to sing your own song and you told her \"I will, if you do your own first.\" She nodded and told the DJ what she wanted. <i>Everytime We touch</i> by Cascada. When she finished, you and the audience clapped and she began to blush. Then it was your turn for a song. You talked to the DJ and told him your song. He nodded and you went backstage. While the employees were setting you up, the DJ said \"This song is for a member of our audiecne, Mina\" Just then, music began to play and you sang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the boundries of your city's lights.<br>\r\nStand the heroes waiting for your cries.<br>\r\nSo many times you did not bring this on yourself.<br>\r\nWhen the moment finally comes, I'll be there to help.<br>\r\nOn that day, when you need your brothers and sisters to care.<br>\r\nI'll be right here.<br>\r\nCitizen soldiers.<br>\r\nHolding the life of the ones that we guide through the dark of despair.<br>\r\nStanding on guard for the ones that we've sheltered.We'll always be ready because we will always be there.<br>\r\nWhen there's people crying in the streets.<br>\r\nWhen they're starving for a meal to eat.<br>\r\nWhen they simply need a place to put their beds.<br>\r\nRight here underneath my wing, you can rest your head.<br>\r\nCitizen soldiers.<br>\r\nHolding the life of the ones that we guide through the dark of despair.<br>\r\nStanding on guard for the ones that we've sheltered.We'll always be ready because we will always be there.<br>\r\nOn that day, when you need your brothers and sisters to care.<br>\r\nI'll be right here.Citizen soldiers.<br>\r\nHolding the life of the ones that we quide through the dark of despair.<br>\r\nStanding on guard for the ones that we've sheltered.We'll always be ready because we will always be there.<br>\r\nHope and pray, that you never need me.<br>\r\nThe rest assured I will not let you down.<br>\r\nI walk beside you, but you may not see me.<br>\r\nThe strongest among you may not wear a crown.<br>\r\nOn the day when you need your brothers and sisters to care.<br>\r\nI'll be right here.<br>\r\nOn that day when you don't have strength for the burning you bear.<br>\r\nI'll be right here.

But you both transformed and went to fnd the third Chaos Emerald. You and Venus arrived at the location of the emerald and saw nothing. You could sense something nearby and were on your guard. As you and Venus looked around, you saw a shadow over you. You looked up and saw a giant bird dive-bombing towards you and Venus. You grabbed Venus and jumped out of the way. You turned and saw Raven Gundam in his raven mode. You and Venus shot at him, but missed every shot. He made another charge at you, and he missed. You took careful aim and yelled \"SOLAR LAZER!\" You hit his wing and brought him down to the ground. He then transformed into his fighter mode and charged at you. He had incredibly fast kicking speed. Those blades on his feet could easily slash you. You dodged all of his attacks and then he  made an attack towards Venus. You created a sword from the energy of the Chaos Emeralds and you blocked the attack. Venus was relieved that you didn't take the hit, until she saw Raven Gundam's other blade in your side. Blood started to drip from the wound. \"Well, I didn't see that coming. I forgot about the other blade.\" you said. Venus watched helplesssly as you were injure quite badly. But Raven Gundam has left himself wide open to a close range attack. You raised your right hand and said \"SHINING FINGER!\" The energy blast instantly destroyed Raven Gundam, revealing the red Chaos Emerald. It was absorbed into your body, and your wound instantly healed. You and Venus transformed back to normal and you both went back to her home.</span></div></div>",

You were in so much ecstasy that you came right there and then. Then Mina licked up the cum from your dick.<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she said seductively \"It's time you and I become one.\u201d<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you said \"I live to please you.\"<br>\r\nYou began to take off her outfit and her breasts popped out. No joke, they were DD\u2019s at least. You grabbed one of them and began to massage it. Then you did the same with the other. You massaged both boobs until her nipples were erect. Then you put her boobs together and sucked both of them at once. Mina was moaning with pleasure and you could feel something sloshing inside her breasts and then it came out. You began to drink Morrigan's succubus milk. It was so tasty and filled with spice. You could live off that as your only drink. Mina just kept on giving you her milk.<br>\r\n\"Drink my milk.\" she said between moans of pleasure<br>\r\n\"Yes my love.\" you said<br>\r\n\"Say it, say what I want to hear.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, mummy.\"<br>\r\nMina began to squeal with pleasure and her breast milk increased but you just kept on drinking it.<br>\r\nThen Mina removed your head and took off her outfit to reveal her hairless crotch and you then lied down on the bed and Mina lied down on top of you and put your dick inside her. Your dick went right up and hit her hymnea.<br>\r\n\"I'm still a virgin because I only tempt. Your the first I've ever wanted to go further with.\" Mina gulped and went pushed your dick in even further. Her hymnea broke and she felt pain but she kept on going and then you thrusted your dick in and out over and over again. The feel of each other was so immense that you both came. Then Mina got off and began to arouse you until you were ready and then she put her ass on you, after putting some lube on. Your dick went into Mina\u2019s ass and she was really enjoying it.<br>\r\n\"So tight,\" you moaned \"I love your ass, Mina.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't say that,\" Mina moaned \"It's so dirty that I'll cum too early.\"<br>\r\nYou kept shut but continued to pound Mina\u2019s ass. Neither of you could hold it and you both came.<br>\r\nAfter that Mina sexually aroused you by getting on you but putting her vagina over your face and keeping her mouth near your dick. You were so aroused that your dick just shot up into Mina's ready mouth. You put your tongue in her vagina and began to eat her out while she gave you a blow job. You massively pleasured her and teased her cunt a bit but she was screaming with pleasure and she began to deep throat you. You could feel your dick go and go. Both of you were in ecstasy. Neither of you could stop feeling this amount of pleasure but then you both came. However, neither of you could stop. You just kept on giving each other oral. Suddenly you both blasted out a massive amount of cum and then you both passed out from the amount of cum you produced but not before you could say to Mina<br>\r\n\"Mina, I love you with all of my heart.\"</span></div></div>",
