            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today marked a full week of being back home.  It was a beautiful day too.  The sun was out, birds were chirping, and the faint smell of freshly cut grass wafted in through the window from somewhere down the street.  All of it was preventing you from sleeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumbled and tried to pull your pillow over your head, but the damage was done.  You looked at your clock.  10:30.  Probably for the best to get up anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily swinging your legs off the bed, you lurched your way up, steadying yourself on your desk chair.  A brief look into the mirror revealed just how bad your bedhead was, and you struggled to push down a cowlick or three.  Getting dressed, you slowly closed the door behind you to avoid waking Caitlyn and made your way downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed inwardly when you saw your mother sitting at the table.  She looked up from her cup of tea when she heard you enter the kitchen and nodded toward a piece of the newspaper on the counter.  Sighing, you grabbed the classifieds and began the process of toasting a poptart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe grocery store might need a new bag handler,\u201d your mom started, \u201cI also heard from Hannah that there might be an opening at the pastry place she works at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nagging was annoying, but you just nodded at her suggestions.  Your mom meant well.  Things at home were still really tense with Caitlyn and the move, so your mom seemed to be dealing with it by \u201cmom\u201ding you instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually about to head into town,\u201d you said through a mouthful of poptart, \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for some of these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother smiled.  \u201cIt\u2019ll give you a bit of structure to have a job, love.  Oh!  And make sure you\u2019re home by six.  We\u2019re visiting Hannah for dinner tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou half heard her as you were already out the door.  The summer air outside was a lot less suffocating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~-~-~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk into town wasn\u2019t far - only thirty minutes - and you were quickly in the town square.  You\u2019d been exploring for the past few days and had begun to recognize some of the buildings, even though they all looked fairly similar.  Two words could describe Mallorysville: quaint and old.  The town square especially looked like you had gone back in time and stepped into the 1800s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom had told you and Caitlyn the reason you had moved here was because you had a family member lived nearby.  But between not having met this supposed family member and your trips into town, you were beginning to suspect she hadn\u2019t been entirely truthful.  After all, your dad had always loved these types of places - historic, old, and with a story to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind drifted to thoughts about your dad, good and bad, and his mysterious disappearance three years ago.  In fact, you were so preoccupied, you didn\u2019t notice you had wandered to a place you didn\u2019t recognize until you realized you were completely alone on the street.  Looking up and down the road, you realized you couldn\u2019t really even hear the usual hubbub of chatter or cars or whatever else a town might have.  It was eerily quiet.  A bit apprehensively, you turned to go back the way you came, but you found you didn\u2019t recognize any landmarks.  You were lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d you muttered under your breath.  Best to find someone and ask for directions.  Since there was no one on the street, you should probably find a building and ask inside.  Craning your neck, you saw a shop up ahead.  Oddly, it seemed to be the only building that opened onto this particular street.  That did make your choice easier, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside, the shop was much like all the other buildings in town - small and old.  All of the windows on the front seemed to be covered however, and you couldn\u2019t see inside.  The only thing indicating it was even a shop was the sign hanging above it\u2019s door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Shae\u2019s Antiques</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the door open caused the twinkling of a bell above your head.  Inside, the shop seemed a lot larger.  There was a main entryway that opened onto a first floor.  Farther in the back, you could see stairs up to a second floor with a balcony that allowed you to see back down onto the first floor.  From the ceiling, the entire place was lit with a chandelier that almost seemed to contain candles.  That would be impossible however because the entire shop was a fire hazard.  The whole place was covered with shelves and old looking items - everything from paintings to clothes to jewelry.  The windows as you could now see were covered with some sort of black cloth, giving the entire place a slightly cramped feeling.  Somewhere between cozy and claustrophobic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could make out a few people, presumably customers, milling between the shelves looking at items, but they paid you no mind.  One person did, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, welcome to Shae\u2019s Antiques, Jack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the counter, right by the door, the shopkeep waved you over.  She was on the taller side, with fiery red hair pulled up into a bun.  She looked a bit younger than your mom, but dressed strangely, almost like she had the fashion sense of a much older person.  Her thick woolen sweater did little to hide the size and shape of her impressive chest, however, and you found your eyes drawn down before you remembered your manners.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hi.  I\u2019m sorry, have we met?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed - a light, pleasant sound.  \u201cIn a sense.  I knew your dad back in the day.  I have to say, you look a lot like him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffened.  \u201cAh.  And you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the woman noticed your slight change in tone, she didn\u2019t react to it.  \u201cMy name is Cleo Shae.  This is my store.\u201d  She smiled a bit.  \u201cPeople don\u2019t usually come here unless they have a reason to.  Usually, they need a bit of a change in their life that they can\u2019t find anywhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cocked your head a bit.  \u201cWell, I\u2019m actually here to get directions, so I- \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo cut you off with a sweep of her hand.  \u201cYou\u2019ll find your way home once you\u2019ve found what you\u2019re looking for.  And don\u2019t worry!  First thing you get here is free!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got your ears to pick up a bit.  Free?  From the look of some of this stuff, it definitely had to be worth something.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo laughed again.  \u201cNo catch!  Most people just can\u2019t keep away once they\u2019ve tried one of my items.  Lots of repeat business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell.  You didn\u2019t have the directions you were looking for, but you certainly could pass some time here.  Who knows?  You might even find something valuable.  What to do first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was a little too weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile that\u2019s tempting, I really just want those directions.  What\u2019s the fastest way back to the town center?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo eyed you a little bit, almost as though she were impressed with you.  \u201cWell, as I said.  You\u2019ll find your way home once you find what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d  As she moved back to where she had been standing before making your acquaintance, she picked up a black piece of cloth and needle and began to sew.  Oddly, she never once broke eye contact while doing so though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight...but....  I mean you see how that kind of doesn\u2019t make any sense?\u201d you managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo smiled.  \u201cPerhaps what you\u2019re looking for isn\u2019t something from the shop, but something from me.\u201d  She stopped sewing after a minute and admired her handiwork.  As she let the black cloth fan out, you couldn\u2019t help but stare at it.  It looked straight out of Harry Potter.  That wasn\u2019t what transfixed you though.  With each swish of the fabric, the light seemed to catch a million little sparkles sewn in.  It looked like Cleo was holding a piece of the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like it?\u201d  Cleo asked, noticing your appreciation, \u201cIt\u2019s my old cloak.  I managed to tear one of the seams during one of my recent experiments though.\u201d  She leaned across the counter in a conspiratorial way.  \u201cThe part about inflation they don\u2019t tell you is how hell it is on your wardrobe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just blinked at her.  She was weird.  No wonder she knew dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo threw on the cloak over her sweater, and you couldn\u2019t help but idly wonder how she wasn\u2019t burning up in the cramped shop.  \u201cSo.  If it\u2019s from me - what is it I can help you with, Jack?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look to be 15 years younger than my dad.\" Cleo smiles again and says, \"I'm flattered. Appearances are malleable, even age is malleable. What is isn't always what it has to be.\" You laugh and retort with, \"Now that sounds like my dad. Ok, I believe you, you had to have known him.\" You then somber up and ask, \"Do you know why he left us.\"  Cleo looks away for a minute and appears to wipe a tear from her eye. When she looks back she isn't smiling anymore. She sighs and answers with, \"From what I know of your father. He left because he had no choice. Something must have happened that he couldn't come back. It's not because he didn't love you, your sister, or your mom. I'm very certain he's somewhere still looking after you and making sure you have a happy life. Now enough of that. Let's pick something out for you.

I'm sure other guys are to.\" Cleo smiles and says, \"I know just the thing for you.\" For a second you think she may be going to do something to help you with your issue. She then pulls a neckless with a charm on it from her pocket. She hands it to you and says, \"Wear this to be tonight and it will help you get over your fear of women.\" \"I'm not scared of women\", you blurt out! Cleo shakes her head and states, \"Fear was the wrong word, I'm sorry. You don't understand them. This will help you understand them, trust me. It will also help you understand yourself. Please take it.

An ancestor of yours, perhaps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah,\u201d you said, accepting the item in the palm of your hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. Pretty sure we have an Irish heritage. You know, back in the day when people were coming over for a better life in America.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy boy, all sorts came to the new land of opportunity in search of a better life. Some had to give up everything they had to escape certain death in their motherland. Who\u2019s to say who intermingled with whom in the literal melting pot of culture? It was certainly an interesting time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo spoke as if she had been there herself as her eyes glazed over for a moment, the same way your mother would whenever you asked her about dad. Lost in memories. Cleo then smiled and shook her head, as if abandoning such thoughts and returning to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis locket was once a family heirloom that the grand duchess had to pawn off in order to buy herself safe passage to the new land. She had been separated from her family, you see. The common folk had chased them out after accusing them to be a coven of witches in league with Baba Yaga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah,\u201d you said, holding up the locket. \u201cIt\u2019s silly to think that people could really believe stuff like that back then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Baga Yaga had left for the new world centuries prior. But that is a story for another day. If you seek a job in my shop, I ask that you hold onto that locket and wear it for one week, starting tonight when you get home..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA week?\u201d you said. \u201cAre you sure? I mean, it sounds pretty expensive as an heirloom and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure,\u201d she finished with a coy smile. \u201cI suspect what\u2019s to follow will take a week to resolve. If you can manage it, then you are more than worthy of becoming my assistant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the woman was talking in riddles. But you felt a strange calling to the locket that you couldn\u2019t explain. It was for that reason alone that you accepted the item and tucked it into your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty,\u201d you said. \u201cNow do you mind pointing me in the direction of Summer Street?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just laughed. \u201cCertainly, my child\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got home with little issue after that. Your mom had wondered where you had gone but got off your back when you mentioned the prospect of interviewing for a summer job. After that, the day continued as was average. You hung out and played video games, had dinner while enjoying the silent treatment going on between your mother and sister, and then you showered to get ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while though, you never forgot the strange woman\u2019s words to you and kept the locket at your nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after your shower that you approached the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight then,\u201d you said, standing in nothing but a towel and dripping wet. \u201cShe said wear it at night when I got home and it\u2019s night, so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put it around your neck and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could half laugh at yourself for expecting something to happen. The woman was just a little weird, was all. Like she could see five steps into the future. But she was clearly just off her rocker. She acted twice her age when she looked over thirty. Clearly she must have been a little out there and it had rubbed you the wrong way. You fiddled with the locket for a moment, lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you realized that it actually had a button at the top to press. Curiosity overcame you and you pressed it without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d you said. \u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was an old picture like something from a museum when cameras had just been invented. It was a photo of a rather large woman with a big chest to boot. You took special note of that because you had never seen someone from that time period show so much skin. She looked noble, dressed in pearls and silks. You couldn\u2019t tell the colors of things because the picture was black and white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this is the duchess,\u201d you spoke to yourself. \u201cOdd. I don\u2019t remember that button being on the locket before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was only because the button would appear when someone was wearing the locket. Unbeknownst to you, opening it would trigger events that would start your campaign to become Cleo\u2019s assistant in the shop. And change your life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExposing the photo to the world would cause you to...</span></div></div>",

Perhaps the strangeness of the day coupled with all that walking was finally getting to you.  On a normal day, you might be up for an hour on your phone, but as soon as your head hit your pillow, you were out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~-~-~-~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a mansion.  One of those old Victorian looking places with the wood paneling and gold candelabras lighting everything.  Only it didn't actually look all that old.  Everything around you was expensive looking though.  From the decorations, to the food wafting in from the dining area, to the guests who surrounded you.  They were all dressed in period wear - rich silks, corsets, and flowing fabrics as far as the eye could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to wander the halls, you could feel a strange flowiness to your clothing, suggesting you shared in the strange dress.  Music surrounded you, played from a far off set of string instruments and giving the entire atmosphere a jovial feel.  People mingled and laughed, but you walked past them all, as if heading to a determined location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued past some rather boisterous partygoers, you began to notice how alien your movements felt.  It was as though your back was being forcibly straightened by your clothing, making it a bit harder to breathe but giving it support at the same time.  Thankfully so too, because it felt as though there was a great weight added to your chest.  You could still feel the locket around your neck however, and that was somehow very grounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner, you turned into your presumed destination.  A lavish bathroom, with faucets of gold and a polished silver mirror.  You placed your had in the marble sink and looked up at your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duchess looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~-~-~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke in a sweat.  The clock said 9am, but you somehow didn't feel rested.  Bad dreams you supposed.  Getting up for the day, you didn't recognize that the first of many changes had begun as your newfound passenger had begun your steady transformation.  But what did she want?  And why might Cloe want you to have her necklace?</span></div></div>",

But you were more preoccupied with the fading thoughts of your weird dream. You had never had one so vivid and realistic as that one and couldn\u2019t help but wonder what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, you would soon find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Jack,\u201d chirped your mother as you sat down at the table in front of a mountain of pancakes. She was standing in front of the oven top making more. \u201cHope you\u2019re hungry. There\u2019s plenty more where that came from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brushed the hair out of your eyes and got to work, finding yourself surprisingly hungry. Across from you, your little sister was glaring at you. Apparently, she and mom had another fight and by the looks of things your mother was the victor yet again. As much as you would have liked it if they stopped fighting, you didn\u2019t see it as your business anyway. You instead focused on woofing down the food in front of you like it had been years since your last meal. You absentmindedly itched at your scalp a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had a haircut?\u201d your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d you replied, chewing mouthfuls of dry pancakes. \u201cPretty recent. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re due for another one, considering how shaggy you\u2019re starting to look. You have such nice and bouncy hair, it\u2019d be a shame to let it grow out like a weed. Maybe you can take your sister with you. She\u2019s doing nothing but brooding anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlyn opened her mouth to protest but silenced herself when your mom shot her an angry look. Your mother then turned to you with all smiles and teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to look your best if you plan on getting this new job of yours. Take some money from my pocketbook and go out for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled your own plans for the day and you and your sister did as asked before heading out on the town with a little extra pocket money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot once did you question how odd it was that your hair was starting to near your shoulders in length, despite the fact that you had gotten a haircut merely a month ago. You had always been a brunette, but perhaps you always had a hint of redness to your hair. Nor did you question how strangely the locket felt as it pressed against your chest. And the warm sensation traveling from it and slowly coursing through your body at a steady pace, like a dam breaking for the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, something peculiar was happening to you right under your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no mere locket you were wearing but a gateway to the spirit that it contained within, begging for physical form to give it shape and meaning. It just so happened that you would be its host and, over the course of the day, it would attempt to influence you more and more. Working in as subtle way as possible until you were powerless to control your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost would sense its opportunity as you ventured on the town with your sister and it pulled you towards...</span></div></div>",

Can\u2019t let your mom or your sister know you\u2019re wearing jewelry. Of course, your mind is also elsewhere in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept playing back the memory of your dream and how real it felt. You had never had an experience like that before while asleep. The body you had been in...It felt like your own. Every bouncy step. Every layer of makeup. Every gasp of air wearing the tight corset. And when you had seen your reflection in the mirror, that left you with a cold chill that stuck with you all the way down to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack?\u201d your mother\u2019s warm touch shook back to the present again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDa?\u201d you answered in a thick voice that almost didn\u2019t sound like your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom blinked a few times. \u201cHoney, are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDa. Izvinite za neudobstva.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table stared at you like you had carrots growing out of your ears. Evidently, instead of saying \u201cyeah, I\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience\u201d you had uttered a language you had never heard before, let alone spoken. Though, by how confidently you had said the strange words, you spoke it as clearly as you did English. But that was just the thing too. You had thought you had spoken English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, you rose from the table and booked it to the upstairs bathroom. Your mom was either too stunned or too confused to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself having wandered to the bathroom sink and locking the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold water ran from the faucet and splash on your face over and over again as you commanded yourself to wake up. Clearly you were still dreaming and you got your wires crossed. Hell, even when you looked up, there was the Duchess staring back at you in the mirror, wearing the same pajamas you were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until she started talking in your own voice that you paid the odd reflection much mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack Richmond,\u201d she said to you. \u201cI don\u2019t have much time, so listen carefully to me. I was able to swap our voices, but I lack the power to do anything else. I lack the power to do much of anything, in fact. And it was by pure luck that I was able to tap into your latent magical abilities while you were asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKto ty\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d she snapped with a fierce and angry tone. \u201cJust listen to me. You were given this locket for a reason. It\u2019s a conduit to my trapped soul. But the connection is...Wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the Duchess\u2019 face distorted and morphed between hers and your own. It was almost like she was fading from existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a connection between us. It can\u2019t be severed...I need you to find a way to make it stronger...If you don\u2019t\u2026Start with a battery...Look for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like she was breaking out, like your phone call between each other was passing through a tunnel. You watched with an odd mixture of horror and entrigue as the visage of the Duchess contorted and folded in on itself. Slowly, the elements of your old self appeared in the mirror and there was no trace of her left. You patted your own cheek in disbelief and were relieved to see your reflection do the same, now back under your control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack?\u201d your mom had finally tracked you down and knocked on the door. \u201cSeriously, you\u2019re starting to worry me speaking in tongues. Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you replied, surprised at first that you had spoken in English again. \u201cI\u2019m...Fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just massively confused. Bad dreams were one thing, but this was a full on possession, if you had ever heard of one. Yet the Duchess, whoever or whatever she was, sounded more spooked than you did. She seemed pretty desperate and was in a bad way by how she begged with you. Pleaded even for you to do something...But you couldn\u2019t exactly determine what by her broken speech. Something about a battery? Was she talking about the locket?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, why was any of this your problem?</span></div></div>",

Thanks, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sweetie.  Try to relax a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until you heard her and Janet leave the house that you relaxed and let out a breath you didn't even know you were holding.  You made your way back into your room, and closed the door tightly.  This was too weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you made eye contact with your reflection in your full length mirror.  It was you.  You looked down at the necklace.  If you took this off, maybe you wouldn't be possessed anymore.  Whatever the hell just happened wouldn't happen anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clicked the button on top a few times, revealing and concealing the photo of the woman you'd just seen with each press.  No.  Whoever this woman was, she needed your help.  And helping her would get you a job which seemed surprisingly intriguing now that you knew Cleo's merchandise was legit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about what the Duchess had said?  Something about finding a battery?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at the necklace, turning it over a few times.  There were no slots for batteries here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you mean, 'battery'?\" you said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt a jolt in your right hand, almost like it had fallen asleep.  In a mixture of fascination and slight horror, you watched as it pointed at your desk completely involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on my desk?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand just continued to point, so you slowly stood up and made your way over to it.  Your hand was pointing directly at your cup of pens.  As soon as it was within reach, it grasped a pen, and tapped it on the desk.  With a vague sense of understanding, you slipped a piece of paper underneath it.  As soon as you did so, the hand began to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Battery = spell focus</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spell focus?\" you read aloud.  \"Like a wand or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand scribbled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or something.  Person or object with power</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your chin with your non-dominant hand.  \"And if I do that, it will improve our connection?  What would that entail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand didn't write anything this time.  In fact, you found that you could bend and use it by yourself again.  Great, you were on your own.  It was a good thing you had a few potential leads on all things occult.  You knew Hannah Becker next door was a nut for this kind of thing.  However, while she might be able to assist you, you weren't sure just how much you should reveal.  Your father had an old interest for this stuff too though, and so it might be possible you'd get lucky going through some of his old stuff.  Your mom had kept a few boxes of it during the move that she'd put in the attic.  Of course if that didn't pan out or if it proved too difficult, you could always just ask Cloe.  What to do?</span></div></div>",

What do you know about...Ghosts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, her face lit up as she closed the door behind you. Suddenly, you felt trapped with a caged animal ready to pounce on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I love ghosts! You know I picked this house because the agent told me it was haunted, much to my disappointment. I even brought all my tools to deal with a haunting with me. Why?

Curious to what it could mean, you removed the clasp from around your neck and gave it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d you said. \u201cI think this locket is haunted by the spirit of some Duchess. But it only seems to communicate when you\u2019re wearing the thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor real?\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice perked up and she snatched it out of your hand before you could even react. \u201cLet me see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing as Hannah quickly slip the locket around her neck, it bounced between her two breasts before settling into place. Then you both waited for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOdd,\u201d said Hannah as she clasped the locket. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anythi--Oh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clasped her head and winced, which was followed by a low moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distinct sound of a balloon filling with air escaped her entire body as your eyes widened. Hannah\u2019s already impressively sized chest looked like it wanted to escape her dress. The two orbs bloated and blimped up until they were the size of melons, her dress groaning just to contain it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth didn\u2019t stop there as her dress became just a tad higher, exposing her plump thighs. Her thick behind was looking more like a shelf as she continued to grow outwards. In fact, her new proportions were almost eerily familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final clue came in the form of her blonde hair, which burned away into a scarlet color. It was still Hannah\u2019s face, but she looked almost like the Duchess in the locket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we are,\u201d said the Hannah/Duchess combination in a heavy Russian accent. \u201cBylat, it\u2019s good to have a body again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d you said. \u201cHannah, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO Gospodi, my boy. I thought you were more intelligent than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a few heartbeats to realize what she meant. \u201cYou\u2019re the ghost?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d the Duchess said as she turned to a mirror and admired herself. \u201cThis one isn\u2019t too bad. I\u2019ve always wanted to be taller, but I suppose it wasn\u2019t meant to be. The spell was so finicky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d you asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hannah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s still here. She\u2019s just...How do you say it? Sleeping? She needed to make room for me and I guess she couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stole her body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you think Cleo gave you my locket in the first place?\u201d the Duchess asked, sounding more annoyed with you by the minute. \u201cI was but an essence in a locket when she found me buried in the snow outside of Moscow. She knew exactly what I was and had the wisdom not to wear me, else I might have taken over her body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you could have taken over my body!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNet. That\u2019s not how it works. The process requires a body close to my original form. I would have had to spend a lot of energy slowly molding you into an ideal shape. There are some touch ups I need to do to this girl to be a full copy of myself. Drop a few inches. Touch up my face a little. Of course, even if you remove the locket, these changes I\u2019ve done to her will be permanent. And eventually she\u2019ll be gone forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were floored. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take over someone\u2019s body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t I? You were the one who gave me to her. And I\u2019m not powerful enough to exactly fight you at the moment. I need a host though, or else you fail your trial with Cleo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip. Was this the true test then? Seeing if you\u2019d sacrifice someone else? You couldn\u2019t just leave Hannah that way. Then again, the other alternative was to continue wearing the locket yourself, even though you\u2019d end up just like Hannah was now. Or perhaps you could find someone else to play the ghost host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

I'm taking the locket back and wearing it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist, boy,\" the Duchess put her hands to her waist and shook her head. \"Were it me, I'd simply pass it on to someone else. In fact, that was what I was hoping you would do. That was why I held back on transforming you despite how long you were wearing the medal'on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, does that mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da. If you decide to go through with this, I'm not holding back. I will start changing your body to suit my needs. And, like Hannah's current shape, this will be permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and understood the consequences for what you were about to do. But then you thought a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A while ago you mentioned something when you took control of my body. A battery. What were you talking about, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da. It was a hope of mine that I wouldn't have to steal someone's body like this, I don't want to have to do it. But you have no idea what it's like to be trapped as a spirit with no physical form. It's torture and I will not bear it any longer. But, with a...How do you say? Battery? I would be able to conjure a homunculus for myself. An empty vessel that I can assume control of with ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said. \"And what exactly does a battery look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is a pretty thing,\" the Duchess gestured to her hand. \"Small beautiful stone. Or sometimes even a potion. Is something a witch would put all of her magics into. Very powerful. Very old magics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you said. \" I think I get it. Hannah might know what I'm talking about then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to risk looking for a battery, you're welcome to try. I will trust you with removing my locket. But don't screw with me, boy. I have ways of making your life a living hell if you decide not to wear my locket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" you gulped. Even though she was shorter than you, this woman was very intimidating. \"I'll wear it right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khorosho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched patiently as the Duchess removed the locket from her neck and held it out to you. The moment it passed from her hands into yours, she did a slight jolt like she had snapped awake. Then her body blinked a few times. You assumed that this was Hannah returning back in full control of her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" asked a familiar bubbly voice. \"What happened? And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself, no doubt noticing how the Duchess had changed things up for her and made her significantly larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why are my boobs huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story,\" you replied, clicking the locket around your own neck as promised. \"Where to begin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you began to tell her everything of what had just transpired in the last five minutes. Hannah almost didn't believe that she had played host to the Duchess until she looked in the mirror and saw that her blonde hair had morphed into a natural looking scarlet. She also switched into more comfortable fitting clothes, as her dress struggled to contain her swollen body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, now I have to find whatever this battery is or she's going to do the same to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it sounds like her entire existence has been hell. How would you feel if you had to spend the last two hundred or so years without any sort of physical form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That empathy is going to get you in trouble one day,\" she said, shaking her head as she returned from the bathroom wearing a new pair of sweatpants and large(er) T-Shirt. \"So, you need to find this battery of hers to give her an empty body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what she said. Do you have any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, call me crazy, but this almost sounds like a Philosopher Stone. Maybe we can start our search there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you said before pausing as an odd tingle ran through your body. \"Woah, hold on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation seemed to spread from your chest where the locket touched your skin. It was like a wave of needles gently pressing into your skin, traveling to a particular part of your body. This was the change that Duchess spoke of which she would force on you. Spending an hour talking to Hannah had given her enough strength to let you know that she was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to first alter your...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were in no hurry to reveal this strange locket to anyone else, especially your weird neighbor. The weirdness of being host to a ghost was enough for one day. So, you thought back to your dad\u2019s interest in the occult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something of a hobby of his and, more often or not, you would find yourself spending your afternoon wandering the wiccan shops while your dad browsed for spells and books. Your mom just shrugged and said he could be spending his time on worse things. She believed in ghosts, so he was welcome to believe in anything he wanted, including spells. Funny how both of them turned out to be right in their beliefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, your dad\u2019s stuff was as good a place to start as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the house empty, you wandered upstairs into the attic. You hadn\u2019t been inside yet yourself and your mom claimed to have a fight with a squirrel the last time she went up. Peering around and using your phone as a flashlight, you found it in a state of disrepair common with most people\u2019s attics. Pieces of forgotten furniture and taped up boxes littered the floor, with rat droppings and old hornet nests scattered in the corners. Thankfully, you didn\u2019t hear any live animals and scurried on through as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blew the dust off one lid and found the words \u201cDavid\u2019s Stuff\u201d etched in permanent ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening it revealed a literal treasure trove of bizarre things that would fit right at home in Cleo\u2019s store. You would have to remember to show each these things when this was all said and done, you might get a good price for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plenty of books, old tomes that looked like they belonged on the set of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. From prior experience, you knew that the books carried old spells and rituals that your father would attempt to no avail. Your mom used to joke that one day you would find a pile of ash as his remains around a pagan rune in the basement from a spell gone wrong. A part of you wondered if that actually happened. Maybe you could search the books from any definition of the word \u201cbattery\u201d to appease the Duchess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also an odd stone. Wiccans believed that there was power in natural stones, so your father told you. Different stones would channel different things into people. Jade was a natural conduit for energies around the world. Sitting at the top of the pile was a perfectly round jade orb that could fit into the palm of your hand. It had a strange air about it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other thing worthy of interest was a wand, or what looked like one. It was a gnarled rod of elder wood the size of your forearm with a pommel. The thing would fit right into a Harry Potter movie and you imagined waving it around to channel things. The Duchess spoke of a spell focus. Could the wand be it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you could ask her for more. But even after playing with the locket a few more times, you were met with nothing. Just a deep hunger in the pit of your stomach, despite just eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you said aloud. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to pick one of these and see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided on...</span></div></div>",

Your sister and I had a shopping trip planned, so we'd like to go do that.  I had to get her out of her room somehow.  Are you sure you're all right?\" she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a few seconds and looked back into the mirror, resting your gaze on your own reflection for a few seconds just to make sure that your own reflection was all that was there.  \"Yeah mom, I'm fine . . . just trying to shake off a bad dream,\" you said as much to convince yourself as to convince her.  You brought your gaze back to your mother and smiled as best you could.  Your mother seemed unsure, but she smiled back.  \"Ok honey,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey can you do me a favor while your sister and I are gone?\" she asked.  \"Can you go up to the attic and look in the wardrobe that's up there?  There should be an old dress in there.  I told Hannah she could look at it when we go over there for dinner tonight.  She likes old things I guess.  And don't forget that you, your sister, and I are going over there to her place tonight.  She's invited us over enough times that we start to look rude if we don't make time at some point,\" mom declared, \"so dinner's at 6.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will you be back?\" you ask.  Mom pauses.  \"About 5,\" she said, \"we have to get ready.\"  With that, your mom gave you a quick kiss on the cheek and headed downstairs to get your sister.  You heard the front door open and then close and, a minute or so later, you looked down to the driveway through a bathroom window to see your mom's car pulling away and heading down the street.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited a few seconds there in the bathroom, glancing at the mirror every few seconds, then back down at yourself.  As it's just now ten in the morning, you're still in your pajama pants and a t-shirt that hugs your semi-athletic frame somewhat loosely.  The shirt has upon it the word \"Supernatural,\" after your favorite TV show.  You trudged out of the bathroom and then somewhat sluggishly up two flights of stairs--one to upstairs and the second the attic.  You sniffled a bit as the dust from the attic infiltrated your nostrils and opened the door to the attic, looking upon the musty old place.  Your mom had moved in not long ago, and yet dust was there already.  You stepped into the dust-ridden room and looked across to the other side of it, where there sat the wardrobe your mother talked about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked around a bit more, you realized the attic itself was actually quite big and roomy.  \"Look at all this crap,\" you said to yourself as you entered, beholding the wardrobe, a mirror, and a number of chests and boxes strewn about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, your mission was clear, and you made your way in the direction of the wardrobe--a big wooden thing that just looked old and ornate.  You weren't generally a fan of antiques, but something about this one called to you.  You slowly opened it up, hearing the slow creak of the heavy wooden door as you did.  A small gust of wind seemed to blow past you as you did so.  That was especially weird since one wonders how the wind would have come from inside the wardrobe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the wardrobe is a plethora of old clothes.  Some of them were obviously for men, though most of them seemed designed for far larger men than you, and men seemingly from an older, more ornate time.  Some of the clothes were for women--women of all sizes.  A few of them appeared to be bathing suits from various times, and a few of them seemed to be very tight-fitting spandex outfits, some for men and some for women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around somewhat surprised as to all of the clothes that were in there.  You took your hand and moved the dusty clothes around as smells of past times and past lives filled your nostrils.  Suddenly, something caught your eye, and you were not even sure why.  Reaching into the wardrobe, you pulled it out slowly.  It seemed, in the faintest and most distant way, to call to you.  It was a black suit that appeared to be very fancy, or at least it appeared it was very fancy at one time.  There was with it a silk button-down shirt that was a shiny white, and the black pants and suit jacket seemed like they were probably tailored.  Your fingers danced across the dark, worn fabric and on to the frilly white shirt with its folds of silk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran your hands over the clothes, your mind began to wonder, wonder elsewhere deep down inside your own mind.  Your body became slow and tired a visions of this suit and its occupants flooded your head.  Had this been worn to a grand ball by a rich aristocrat?  Who knew?  But the thought fascinated you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking about it, and perhaps not even entirely in control of your own movements, you reached your hands down and removed your own pants, letting them slowly drop to the ground.  Your shirt went too as you lazily dropped it to the ground.  You slowly slipped your skinny, semi-athletic leg into the pants before reaching also for the shirt.  You slowly slipped your arms into the shirt and, half-asleep, buttoned the shirt as your eyes and head drooped.  You slid a set of suspenders lazily over your shoulders.  Luckily, the suit appeared to have been made for somebody about your height.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished putting the suit on, a sort of fog seemed to lift from your mind.  You shook your head a little bit and glanced at yourself in the mirror, wondering why you had suddenly thought it was a good idea to put this thing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you asked yourself as you chuckled a bit looking down at the suit, running your hands over yourself.  It didn't fit you at all.  As you quickly discovered, though the suit was made for a person of your height, it was made for a far heavier, more rotund figure.  \"You can fit three or four of me in these fucking pants,\" you declared as you held up the gigantic waist area at the font of the pants.  \"Somebody had a hell of a gut,\" you said.  The rest of the suit was the same, as your arms and legs practically swam in the shirt and suit coat.  The suspenders hung loosely against your thin body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the suit hanging off your body, you shuffle awkwardly back toward the wardrobe and leaned in just a little bit, your head inches from the hanging clothes as your hand rested on a small shelf directly to the right of the clothes.  As you glanced about the wardrobe again, unknown to you, and again not entirely in your control, your hand begun to move slowly toward the back of the wardrobe, toward something in the dusty confines of the old furniture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard something begin to rattle around at the back of the wardrobe, and then suddenly, something leapt from the back of the antique wardrobe on to your finger.  Startled, you pulled your arm and hand out of the thing quickly and looked at your fingers.  You beheld the thing that had been in the back of the old wooden piece of furniture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fu--\" you began as you held up your hand and looked upon a pewter ring that appeared to match the locket that hung around your neck.            </span></div></div>",

You walked to the window of the attic and looked out to see trees blowing about and dark clouds sliding across the sky in a sort of ominous dance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that just won't do,\" came a voice from behind you.  You quickly spun around, startled to a see a woman in your attic, a woman you had seen and heard before.  Before you stood the rotund, curvy, ornate figure of the Grand Dutchess herself.  Red hair dangled down from the top of her head and framed a face that, from all appearances, was in its forties, though something told you it was much older.  The woman had plenty of exra meat on her bones, as that face bore a devious smile and at least three chins.  She wore a red dress that showed off a blessed abundance of cleavage--boobs that rose and fell visible with her every breath and protruded beautifully from her frame as they struggled against the silk fabric of her dress.  She took a couple steps toward you, and they jiggled like tubs of jello.  Her dress had no sleves, and so feminine and yet flabby arms were folded across her beautiful chest.  Farther down, her belly jiggled to, pushing the limits of her dress.  The lower part of her silky red ensemble billowed out into a swirling, waving mass of silk, though you imagined that her legs and ass were were similarly full of wonderful, jiggle-prone fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grand Dutchess,\" she said in a thick Russian accent.  The accent was thick enough that you assumed she spoke broken English and thought (correctly) that these two words alone were enough to communicate her meaning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still gobsmacked by the whole thing; your head spun as you stared at the busty woman.  After a couple seconds of smiling, she stepped forward again slightly, the dusty old floorboards creaking under her girth, and she simply waived her hand as if motioning for you to come to her.  Suddenly, you found that you could not speak, and your body, still clad in the gigantic suit, simply floated up into the air and began to inch toward the waiting woman.  She walked around for a couple more seconds, appearing to study you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell you wanted to say something. \"Talk boy,\" she commanded, and you suddenly found that you could.  \"What do you want?\" you said in shaky and terrified voice, \"what do you want with me?\"  She smiled a bit and motioned to the ring on your finger.  \"Ring is good,\" she said, \"and I thank you.\"  She paused again and looked up at you, still smiling.  \"Need vessel . . . need body,\" she said, \"yours good . . . will hold me,\" she declared as she, standing a few feet away, somehow levitated up off the ground with all its impressive flab until she was about even with you, there floating several feet in the air.     </span></div></div>",

It almost looked like one of those wide bottom flasks from your old chemistry class back in highschool.  The cork on top of it's narrow stem only solidified the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're giving me what?  A potion?\"  You couldn't hide the slight level of mockery in your voice, but it only seemed to make Cloe smile wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.

When it became obvious she seemed intent on an answer, you managed to say, \"I mean.  I suppose it depends what you want me to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Cloe's turn to cock her head.  \"Well, drink it of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the neon green contents of the flask.  Wait.  Hadn't it just been orange?  \"You want me to drink this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course!  It would be a bit messy to do anything else with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid was now a deep purple.  \"I mean, aside from how I have zero idea what that gunk could possibly be, isn't this an antique store?  How old is that stuff?  Is it even safe to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Cloe said, tapping the glass, \"I just brewed it this morning though, so there's no risk there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your eyes, the hue of the liquid brightened into a scarlet.  It was pretty, like watching a rose bloom.  Almost instinctively, you began to reach for the flask but stopped yourself.  \"So, if I drink this I get a job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloe just nodded in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps if you were in a normal state of mind, you might inquire into such things as what that would entail or how much you'd be paid, but Cloe was right before.  It was calling to you.  You wanted to drink this odd liquid, and you weren't entirely sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping the cork off, you gave the bottle a small whiff.  It smelled nice - sort of flowery.  Tipping it into your mouth, you found the taste was even better.  It was like the best sweet tea you've ever had in your life, and you were honestly sad that there was only a mouthful.  Placing the empty bottle on the counter, you grinned at Cloe.  \"So when do I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloe grinned back.  \"Right now!  C'mon back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you followed her into the back area, away from the other customers, you weren't entirely prepared for the changes that were about to beset you.

Here, why do you manage the cash register for starters? That should let you get more familiar with some of the items around the store here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou questioned the wisdom in trusting some random boy off the street with the money of the shop, but you weren't the type to make off with cash like that. Plus, you were admittedly kind of curious to see what this shop had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were settled into place, Cleo showed you to counter where an old fashioned register made of iron like something out of the early 1900's awaited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can figure things out,\" Cleo said before waving you off. \"Now I have another batch to prepare. If this works well, we might have the next best seller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she was talking nonsense again. But you weren't given the chance to question her as a short little man carry a huge box that looked like a treasure chest came your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, lad,\" squeaked the tiny man. \"I see old Cleo's got some new blood, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, yeah,\" you said, before remembering your manners as an employee. \"Do you need a hand sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure do. If you could just grab the bottom there and help me lift it...That's the ticket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you did the awkward dance of hoisting the chest up onto the counter with you doing most of the hard work. The small man was just taking the edge of the weight. The moment the box got onto the counter, he let go before you were ready...With your hands still underneath the very heavy box. You could only watch in horror as the chest crushed your hands flat. Rather than suffering from an immense amount of pain that would result in you going to the hospital, however, you instead felt nothing at all. In fact, everything below your wrists looked like it belonged in a cartoon as you yanked it out from under the box and your hands resumed their normal shape, completely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo's potion did have an effect on you, though it was still working its way through your entire body.

As you stared at your hand you Cleo came back from whatever back room she was in, \"Ah, I see you've discovered for yourself the effect of the potion.  Good for you!\"  Cleo gave you a hearty pat on the back that weirdly rippled throughout your body.  As Cleo effortlessly carried the large chest out of the store for the short man you continued to just stood there in stunned silence.  When Cleo got back in she smiled at your stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you see the potion you took has made you more...maliable.  That's the word we'll use.  In a show like this I find it much easier to navigate the shop and help the customers out if your body exceeds the limits of the average person.  You've seen for yourself first hand, that chest should have crushed your hand, but instead if helped you adapt.  You'll find your body will be able to adapt to many situations both great and small.  But until you learn to control it, you'll likely only be able to shift your body when you...trick it to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo thought for a second before saying, \"Make yourself tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something you can do, now just imagine yourself tall.\"  Cleo said matter of factly.  So you tried to close your eyes and imagine yourself taller, but it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, in future you'll be able to control your body with a mere thought, but that day isn't today.  Now, to show you that you can infact do that, grab me that hat from the top shelf over there.\"  Cleo pointed to a hat shelf and pointed at a top hat that had to be at least 12 feet high.  You decided that you should probably listen to Cleo since she seems to know what she's talking about and reached up.  Sure enough, you steady found yourself stretching and growing til you too were 12 feet tall.  \"Holy cow!\"  You said feeling your voice seeming to shake the shelf a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, you're very impressive, now if you could put that hat on the 2nd shelf please?\"  Cleo asked.  You had to bend down to reach the shelf, but you couldn't fit it in comfortably until you found yourself shrinking back down to your normal hight.  \"Now your first full day of work will begin...whenever you feel like coming in.\"  Cleo said with a smile.  \"I have a feeling you might want to spend some time testing your body, no rush to get back here.  Now go, have fun.\"  Cleo said and you found yourself practically sprinting back to the house.  You had no idea what you were going to do, but you had to test this power.  As you ran you tried to turn your feet into roller skates, but sure enough Cleo was right, you don't have that kind of control yet.  When you got home your mom asked you to go do the laundry.  You went there without thinking.  As you stood in the laundry room getting your mom's clothes out of the laundry you felt your body tremble.  You had to test the power and you had to test it now.  But how could you trick your body into shifting somehow?  You looked around the laundry room and didn't see much outside of an old bottle of wine in the recycling pile, a mouse hole in the wall, and the drying with your mom's clothes in it.  But you couldn't stop yourself, you hat to test now.</span></div></div>",

You closed your eyes bracing for the impact, but you just felt yourself slide across the ground.  Slowly you opened your eyes and realized that it had actually worked, you had shrunk to a few inches tall and were actually inside of the wall of your mom's new house.  At this point you realized apparently the magic in your body somehow extended at least a little bit, because you noticed your clothes had somehow shrunk with you.  \"At least I don't have to worry about adventuring in the nude.\"  You said to yourself as you looked around the inside of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pitch black in the wall.  You really wished you had shrunk a flashlight to go with you, but your phone was on its charger.  But as soon as you thought this, two bright lights generated from behind your eyes.  Apparently your body becoming more malleable to the environment included giving you some light in the dark.  You would have admired how cool and crazy this was, but your flashlight eyes noticed something.  The thing that was making the mouse holes.  Or should you say rat holes.  In front of your was a giant rat, well, it was normal sized but it was a giant to you right now.

You saw it as a challenge for yourself as you stripped naked. Clothes didn't stretch with you, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you hyped yourself up. \"Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started by pressing your finger into the top of the bottle and pushing in. Sure enough, before long your entire hand could fit inside the cramped space. And then your arm. Surprisingly, though the bottle looked completely full, you felt as if you could keep going. Your body inside kept collapsing in on itself to make room for more of you to squeeze in. You took your other arm and slipped into the smallest crevice of the opening. Sure enough, you could fit both arms in there. But now for the tricky part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went headfirst into the bottle next. It was a bizarre experience to have your entire vision warp as you forced your skull into a shape that it wasn't supposed to be in. You heard nothing but an echo and saw a filtered green version of your basement as you jumped into the table and wiggled your legs behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough gravity and sheer force of will, you continued to press your lower half deeper and deeper into the cramped space that was your new home. When all that was left on the outside was your wiggling toes, you took a deep breath with what limited air there were in the bottle and forced them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" you said with a muffled voice. \"I did it! This is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle wobbled around on the table before your mass caused it to tilted and tumble onto the floor. But not shattered. Your eyes spun in circles as you lost your sense of direction and the glass made a loud tink as it rolled on the floor.

But that was when you made an awful discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you cursed. \"How do I get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trapped in the wine bottle as large footsteps creaked on the stairs leading into the basement.

You were debating whether you wanted to call out for help and tell Caitlyn what was going on with you and your magically malleable body, or if you wanted to stay silent, hope she goes away, and try to get out of this on your own.  But it didn't look like Caitlyn was going to give you much choice in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are Jack's dirty clothes doing on the ground, where'd he go.  I could have sworn he was just in here.\"  Caitlyn said to herself when she saw the tip of the wine bottle tangled in your clothes from when it fell.  You really hated that your sister was a nice person and picked up after you as you felt the bottle you were stuffed in being picked up.  \"Ew, what the hell is in this bottle?  Is that some weird mold?  Is Jack doing a freaky science experiment.\"  Caitlyn continued to examine the cloudy glass but stopped when she got a look at your eye blinking and clearly looking at her.  Caitlyn's eyes widened as her mouth opened in shock, deciding the jig was up you tried to make the situation slightly not worse as you managed to open your mouth and say, \"Please don't scream sis.\"  Caitlyn actually obliged you and didn't scream bloody murder.  What she did do however was drop the bottle out of shock.  Thankfully...or maybe unfortunately the glass seemed to be really sturdy as it just bounced off the tile floor.  You felt every bit of your body pound against the floor with each little bounce and movement.  You were afraid you were going to throw up from this ride on the worlds worst roller coaster, but thankfully for your health you didn't add your own vomit to the contents of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time with steady but confused hands Caitlyn picked you up, \"Jack?

She approached the bottle with what seemed to be a baby girl doll.  \"If I don't experiment on you now, I could just cut a hole in this and pour you in there to see how you adjust.

Though your primary senses were her sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell, you had some secondary senses if you focused hard enough. You were a part of every single inch of her, from her blood, to her skin, to her bones, to her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment, wondering if you could enhance those elements with enough focus. It made sense on a scientific level. You were billions of foreign particles that had latched themselves onto her cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her corset with her pronounced chest, you tried focusing on her boobs first trying to force them to be larger by summoning more of yourself to the location. But, of course, since you had a limited amount of mass to work with, those extra weight had to come from somewhere. To that end, you took a bit of everything from your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed your eye level drop ever so slightly as Caitlyn's breasts pushed against her bra. It was an odd sinking sensation followed by a tightness in her chest as her boobs went up a few cup sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened was quite simple. You had stolen two or three inches of her height, bringing her down to 5'2. And, in exchange, you had converted all that mass into her breasts. Her bra size shot up from C cup to E, as the string holding her corset together groaned while her bra strap in the back snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your own little science project. Clearly, you could mold Caitlyn into whatever you liked. But it had to be mass she already possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" you mocked Caitlyn by using her own voice to talk to her. For good measure, you hoisted your new breasts up while you shifted in her loose-feeling clothes. \"I guess you're the play thing now, Caitlyn. What should we do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a few thoughts. You could shape her body into something for the sake of it, though you had little material to work with given your sister's scrawny size. You could also try collecting more mass somehow. Maybe eating more food or collecting it through other means...Maybe it was time to visit Cleo too, to see if there was any way to separate you two eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do?</span></div></div>",

You flexed your dainty fingers. It felt like your body but you also had a heightened sense of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your engorged tits.  Being able to play with a rack like this was one thing.  You have never got your hands on a pair this big, but them being attached to your own chest was another this was so bizarre!  You make your way to the kitchen to find some food to eat to see if that would give you the energy to transform yourself further without making this body shorter.  Somehow you just knew that would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also strange being so short.  Your house felt different at this height.  The legs of Caitlyn's jeans drooped over the back of your heels because of the reduction in height.  You reach the fridge and open it.   There was a bottle of chocolate fudge.  You popped up the cap and started chugging the rich chocolaty liquid.  Licking your lips you put the bottle back down and picked up a box of pizza.  You guys ordered too much last night and didn't even touch one of the large pepperonis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the box on the counter and take a bite of a cold slice.  You chew thoughtfully looking down at your bust then inspecting your unfamiliar thin arm.  You take another bite and put a hand on your tummy.  This was going to take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and take a bigger bite.  This time you accidentally swallow it without chewing.  You cry out in alarm expecting to choke but to your surprise you don't and you feel a tight lump travel down your throat down to your stomach.  That was weird!  Did this control you had over Caitlyn's body let you consume food differently?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling silly but daring you took another slice and stuffed the whole thing in your mouth.  Crust was exposed in your open mouth and despite your better judgement you attempt to swallow it whole.  Again a very tight lump traveled down your throat to the pits of your tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp for air after you swallow it.  It felt so strange but oddly satisfying.  You do this a few more times until the pizza was gone.  Your belly now protruded out and felt firm as it was full of an entire pizza.  Some skin was exposed under your top revealing your taunt tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave it a satisfied tap and gave a spicy burp.  You cupped a hand to your mouth.   \"Excuse me!\"  You said in Caitlyn's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?  Do you keep eating or convert the food already in your taunt tummy?</span></div></div>",

Deciding that your mom might like to have her son and daughter not sharing the same body you decided it was time to seek some help.  It was time to see Cleo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the store was an awkward one as Caitlyn's corset was barely holding together after you had changed her proportions.  You were definitely getting some odd looks from some onlookers, but you were able to ignore them for the most part and finally you found Shae's Antiques again.  As you walked inside you saw the familiar striking red headed woman behind the counter look at you and say, \"Hello, welcome to Shae\u2019s Antiques, Car...\u201d  Cleo stopped mid sentence as she sainted her eyes and tilted her head as she looked at you, but then a wide smile spread across her face, \"Didn't expect to see you so soon Jack, let alone looking so different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did...you know what, never mind.  I need your help and I need it bad.\"  You said surprised by the woman's magic observation or whatever it was.  And so you explained everything that happened after you left the shop from the bottle to your sister's 'experiments' to now having taken over your sister's body.  \"So, maybe I could figure this out on my own, but I need to fix this before mom gets home, so can you please help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo seemed to be running over a list of options in her mind before she snapped and said, \"I've got it, wait right here.\"  With that Cleo went to the back room and a minute later she emerged with what looked like a bicycle pump that had a steampunk vibe to it and a bunch of glass cylinders attached to it.  \"You need to open up, and I'll put this in your mouth.  I'll suck you out into one of these tubes.  You'll eventually regenerate, but I'll give you a potion to speed it up and there you go, you'll be you and your sister will have her body back...or whatever you leave of her body.  Now say ah,\"  Before you could think about it, Cleo was leaning in to shove a very sharp looking needle down your throat to suck you out and leave you once again vulnerable in a glass container like with the wine bottle.  Were you ready for that?</span></div></div>",

You watched as this bust woman began to pump like mad. You felt the air leave Caitlyn's lungs as something else went with it. That's when you realized that the little bits and pieces of you were getting separated from the cells in your sister's body and sucked down the narrow tube of Cleo\u2019s pump.

A body that was wearing a weirdly colorful sweater and pants.  \"I'm alive...and that's my voice!  I'm me again!\"  You celebrated your victory by standing up and doing a bit of a victory dance.  Your dance of joy was interrupted by a skeptical voice saying, \"Could you <u>get</u> any lamer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see Caitlyn, still with huge breasts and a short stature sitting with her arms crossed looking at your from the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lame?  Oh I'm sorry for experiencing joy after being afraid I'd never have my body again miss 'boil me alive'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, you are the one who took over my body and...changed it you little pervert!\"  Caitlyn said starting to get heated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert?!  Ok fine then.   Boil me again and see what I do to your body next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\"  The voice of Cleo seemed to echo and emirate from everywhere in the room.  You turned and saw she was in the doorway.  \"Now, I don't care what headache's you cause for your poor mother at home, but while you are here you are both employees of Shae's Antiques and will act like cordial human beings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam,\"  You both said meekly before you realized something.  Looking at Caitlyn you saw she was wearing the same colorful sweater that you Cleo were wearing, \"Wait a second, you gave her a job too?!  But she's crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I am simply curious, not crazy.  Besides, I like the vibes of this place.  Very punk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she can't work here!\"  You told Cleo who simply said, \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...\"  You struggled for a second to think of something, \"She's still in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this will be a wonderful way to teach her some responsibility.

That's a very difficult kind of magic. Magic is very give and take like that, don't ask why. It's just the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Caitlyn pouted. \"So, what are the rules with mine then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mass follows the same rules as science. It cannot be created or destroyed. So, when you shrink something or someone, the mass has to go somewhere. Namely in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I'm going to get taller if I shrink someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps if you had enough training. But namely the mass will settle where extra weight typically goes in your body. Your fat cells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to get <i>fatter </i>if she shrinks people?\" you asked, overjoyed at the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she will lose that weight if she causes things to grow,\" added Cleo. \"To that end, there's a limit to how big something can grow, unless you want to convert mass you've borrowed or start overeating. You might also find the actual process of changing sizes quite physically straining. Like doing cardio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of rules,\" you commented, flexing your own fists. \"I didn't get that much of an explanation when you gave me my potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours is a lot more easier to understand.

Clearly, you can fit into just about anything if you were able to squeeze yourself into a wine bottle. And yet your body functions were able to still work.

Or rather, your organs and such have all been converted into solid rubber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense, I can still breathe. See?\" You did a deep breath to confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My theory is that that's just the air passing through your entire body. Look, we can stand around and try to explain everything away with science and exposition, or we can actually do something fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want me to do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah,\" you said. \"Good one. No, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious,\" Caitlyn said as she because to remove her shirt. \"If my theory is right, then I should be able to fit inside of you like a suit. And slip out just as easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, don't I get any say in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can always just shrink you to the size of a bug, even if it turns me into a whale.

You humored her by getting to your knees and opening your mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wider,\" she commanded. \"There we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances, there was no way that you would be able to fit an entire foot inside your mouth. With your newfound powers, however, that was proven to be just the case as Caitlyn pressed her leg deeper down your throat. You could feel the impression of it slipping down your neck and tried to breathe but couldn't. Yet that didn't seem to matter as you didn't feel like you even had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" she said. \"Your body works differently now. Putting the other leg in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pried open your lips and did just that. Your entire head was distorting as she slipped herself deeper and deeper inside of you. It hit you when she was up to her hips in your mouth how bizarre this was. It really was like you were just a one piece suit to be worn. Though you were still functional as a human being. Your tongue brushed against your sister's breasts as she pulled herself almost completely inside of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" she said when it was just her head sticking out of your mouth. \"I'm going to try and fit my arms and legs into yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a phantom feeling of something moving under your limbs. Invisible fingers fitted under yours, like you were being worn like a glove. Your toes wiggled on their own as your sister's head slid deeper down your throat. You were standing upright at this point, clutching your stomach as Caitlyn filled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" she muttered with her last breaths of air. \"You're too tall. This isn't going to work, I can't see over your neck. What if...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tingle through your body as your point of view slowly began to drop followed by a pressure in your lower abdomen. You quickly realized what your sister was doing, using her powers to shrink you from 5'10 to her height of 5'1 to make you a perfect fit for her. It was beginning to feel very tight in your body as Caitlyn took up more and more space. Most of the excess mass had gone to her hips and you felt your jeans groan from the outside just trying to contain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pop as all parts of the both of you settled into place. You could feel your sister underneath your skin and, while you had your hair and body tone, you also now had your sister's chubby body shape, face, and short stature. Her theory had actually worked!

You decided to give your try at speaking, \"Esh dun, ca you it ou ow?\"  You could kind of move your lips, but not enough to actually form the sentence 'It's done, can you get out now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, that feels really weird, don't move my lips like that, it's kind of nasty.\"  Caitlyn said putting her hands to her lips.  Caitlyn took the chance to give herself a look in the mirror.  Sure enough it looked like a shorter and chubbier version of you was looking back at you, with a slightly more feminine shaped face with Caitlyn's face skin tight under yours.  Caitlyn gave a poke at your chest as it rippled at the touch.  \"Maybe you should hit the gym, you look like you've got a pair of man boobs under your sweater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah eree uhey.\"  <i>(Hah hah very funny) </i>You say managing to roll your eyes.  \"Ow it ou un iv me I bohea ac.\" <i>(Now get out and give me my body back.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sister seemed to understand what you wanted and said, \"We're not done testing yet, we just started.\"  Caitlyn said as she put her hands over your now too long and too slim jeans and closed her eyes as she put her hands one them.  A few seconds later you could feel the waist stretch out and then the legs shrunk down to fit your body.  As this happened you felt a very slight shift in Caitlyn's stomach.  \"All right, I'm starting to get the hang of this!\"  Caitlyn said unable to hide her excitement.  \"Now for another test, I can still use my powers while wearing you, but can I access yours?\"  Caitlyn looked around the room wondering how best to test this theory.  As your head moved along with Caitlyn you could see her linger on the bottle that you'd gotten yourself stuck in, and also saw Caitlyn look at her closet for some reason.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I got an idea,\" she said as she brought your attention to the closet again. \"Let's go digging for memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were helpless to stop her as she opened the door and started having you scour the racks going through her different outfits over the years. Your mom had organized them when you had moved by year and Caitlyn was going further and further down. From her teenage years, to her preteens, to elementary, to toddler. It was when she was in the era of that last one that she started to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hah!\" she said, hands lingering on something bright colored. \"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gurbled a groan as Caitlyn brought out a pair of pajamas that you hadn't seen since you were five or four years old. Caitlyn was practically a baby then, barely standing at two and a half feet tall at age three or two. The onesie she was having you hold was vibrant red with a little pony on it. The stitches on the knees and near the hands showed that it was well loved and, indeed, you remembered Caitlyn wearing the thing constantly. That was probably why she never threw it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to love wearing this all the time,\" she said. \"I never thought I would get the chance to again! This is where you come in. How do you use your powers, Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mumbled something in reply. There was no way she was going to hear you with her head in your mouth. Caitlyn sighed as she began removing your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Condense yourself then. Do whatever it is you do when you fit into the wine bottle, only with the clothing here. If you do this, I will gladly leave your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have much of a choice considering she was in full control of you. Though you apparently decided when it was time to use your powers. As Caitlyn had you stand there in your underwear, you looked into the red pajamas and focused. You imagined it was the wine bottle again, just a space that you needed to fill. And to fill it, you had to compress yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou garbled a \"go\" to Caitlyn, which she seemed to understand as she tried stepping into the footies of the outfit. Immediately, you were overcome with the same sensation as when you squeezed into the bottle. Only you had to be more delicate, cloth was softer than glass. Caitlyn was certainly feeling it as your reshaping of your own body affected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omph,\" she said. \"Tight! It's like being squeezed by a blood pressure wrap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister wasn't made of rubber and you could hear her bones crack as you both sunk deeper into the floor. The more of you both went into the outfit, the smaller you became. Caitlyn continued to give a few uncomfortable grunts as you shrunk and compressed into a smaller and smaller form. Before long, you couldn't even see the top of her bed, you had shrunk so small. As Caitlyn fit your now little arms through the holes of the outfit, you could loosen up a bit. The only thing that hadn't shrunk was your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" she said, walking around and feeling up the worn material of her pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunted a warning as she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. We've proven you can use your powers to squeeze into stuff while I'm inside you. Hang on, I'll climb out now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put your hands to your lips in preparation to pry open your mouth like you were a suit and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly Caitlyn grabbed your mouth by the lips and began to stretch it as far as she could.  Slowly she began getting her limbs loose from yours as though your skin was a tight pair of jeans.  You could hear groans of pain from Caitlyn as she struggled get climb up your ribs and past your tongue to climb out of your skin.  You were sure that if your mom walked in on this, she would faint from this scene out of a horror movie, but honestly it wasn't that bad.  Sure it felt weird for Caitlyn to remove your hand from outside of hers like a glove, but it didn't hurt, Caitlyn seemed to not be in the same boat, as when she finally got her feet out of your mouth, she was gasping for air on the bed in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I don't know how you do that, my whole body feels sore, it's like I just got squeezed into and out of a tube of toothpaste.\"  Caitlyn said not even bothering to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  I actually feel good outside of still being the size of a toddler squeezed into your old pajamas.  It's probably because of my mailability potion or whatever it is.  You're probably lucky you don't have any broken bones or something worse.\"  You said slightly amused at how out of it your sister was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, must be.  If you don't mind, I think I'll pass out now.\"  And with that Caitlyn's head hit her pillow and she was out like a light.  You grinned with amusement.  \"Well, I've got my own tight space to get out of,\"  You said looking at the Caitlyn's old red onesie.  You tried to imagine yourself just slipping out of the outfit, but you were having a hard time getting it to happen.  \"Ok, I'll just take it off first.\"  You reached for the back of the onesie to under the buttons to it, but you found your arms were too short.  \"Stupid child proof buttons,\"  You said as your tried to tug the onesie over your shoulders and tried to pull your hands through to get out the hard way, but your hands had already joined your head in being the only parts of you that were actually your normal size, you couldn't fit your hands through the pajamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, fine, then I'll just picture myself stretched out and I'll just bust my way through,\"  But then you heard a loud snore from Caitlyn's bed.  For the first time in a while you were almost kinda sorta getting along.  And if you just ripped up her favorite pajama's as a kid all the good process would be long gone and you'd be at each other's throats again.  \"Maybe I should just turn in for the night and let Caitlyn help me out in the morning,\"  You said, but then you remembered you had another option.  Before you'd left the store Cleo had given you her phone number in case of an emergency.  But did being stuck as the size of a toddler in a red onesie really count as an emergency?  That'd sure be one embarrassing phone call that probably wasn't worth Cleo's time.</span></div></div>",

For some reason, you had the good idea to crawl into bed with Caitlyn and go to sleep just like you used to do as kids. Though in this case, she was more like the older sibling given she had grown back to her 5'1 stature though not without a little extra chub from having shrunk you a bit when she was inside you. That made her especially soft and warm as you hugged her from behind and your eyes fluttered. You were just going to close your eyes for a little bit. Just give yourself a little rest after all the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that meant you instantly passed out and you drifted off into a slumber that would last the whole night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you were woken up by...</span></div></div>",

Man, that had been one of the most relaxing sleeps you've had in a long time, that crazy day must have taken more out of your than you thought.  As you blinked the sleep out of your eyes you felt a warm and comforting presence.  You looked down and saw that your sister's now chubby arm was wrapped around your chest, one look around saw that sometime in the night Caitlyn had grabbed you and held you close like you were a teddy bear or baby doll.  Feeling a little embarrassed by the situation, you managed to crawled out of your sisters grasp before she woke up and saw you with her in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you carefully climbed to the floor you again tried to reach the buttons in the back of the onesie you were stuck in, but still you couldn't unbutton yourself.  \"Guess I'll just wait around until Caitlyn wakes up.\"  You said to yourself.  But then a voice came from behind you, \"Or you could go ahead and come to work for your first full day, you wouldn't want to be late after all.\"  You almost jumped out of the onesie in shock, you turned around and standing by Caitlyn's closet was the bosomy Cleo already in her work sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!  How'd you get in here?\"  You ask as you heard Caitlyn also finally starting to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo simply pointed at the closet, \"All closets are connected if you look hard enough, didn't you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I know something crazy like that?\"  You say still a bit stunned.  Cleo ignored your shock and gave Caitlyn a little shake, \"Come on, it's time to wake up, you've had enough time to test your powers and now it's time to work.  Up and at'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlyn murmured a quick, \"Sure,\"  and slowly crawled out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing an opportunity to finally get out of this onesie and back to your normal size you say, \"Cleo, could you help me out with this outfit?  I can't exactly get into my uniform at this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo looked down at you and nodded, \"Of course Jack, all you had to do was asked.\"  Then in the blink of an eye Cleo pulled a ridiculously huge handkerchief out of her sleeve, cover you with it, and when she pulled it away the onesie was on the ground and you were in your colorful work sweater.  You were also still the size of a toddler with a normal sized head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't what I wanted!\"  You say stomping your cute little foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have said so,\"  Cleo said as she did the same trick with her handkerchief on Caitlyn putting her in a uniform that fit her body.  \"Then give me a hand and...\"  You tried to say but Cleo cut you off, \"No time for that Jack, the store will be opening in a few seconds and we need to be there, come on.\"  And so Cleo picked you up and grabbed your sister by the hand and dragged you both into Caitlyn's closet.  She pushed past rows of clothes and before you knew it, you were in the clothing racks at Shae's Antiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at everything in awe at how you had somehow transported here while Cleo gave instructions, \"Now Caitlyn, as you adjust to your powers I think today it'd be best if you worked just in the clothing department helping customers find the perfect fit for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I use my powers?  And do I use it on the clothes or the people?\"  Caitlyn asked but Cleo just shrugged and said, \"I'll leave that up to you.\"  Which caused Caitlyn to smile very wide.  Cleo then looked down at you, \"Now for today I think I know what department of the store you should stick with toys and electronic today.  I'll handle the register and the rest of the store.  Now let's get out there and make this an experience our customers will never forget.\"</span></div></div>",

You were finding it kind of tiresome being so small as you waddled around the shop with your massive head. Caitlyn was certainly having fun subtly resizing people so that they would find the outfits they were interesting in better. You watched her both gain and loss weight each time she passed by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, there were some perks to being seen as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" called a rather seductive voice. \"Do you work here, little boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawked at the sight of a rather tall drink of water. She must have been six feet and was built like Jessica Rabbit, complete with flowing red hair. It was all you could do to turn away so you didn't catch a full view of her cleavage poking out of her sundress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was interested in this little toy for my son. He's about your age and he loves robots and space and all things to do with it. I could this cute little ray gun that looks like it should make noise when you fire it.

Can you look at it for me, big boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed as you continued to avoid eye contact with the lady. \"Sure, let me take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, she offered you a toy gun that looked like something out of a 1950's sci-fi movie. It was bright red with a little nozzle for the muzzle, barely even a pistol that you could hold in your tiny little hands. It had little openings in the casings though, which you were sure you could fit inside using your powers. As you pressed again it, your entire hand wormed its way into the device. You fiddled around until you found the problem, one of the gears was out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, by removing it, you triggered the firing mechanism of the gun, which was aimed squarely at the bosom women looming over you.

As soon you fixed the red toy a green beam shot right out of the nozzle strait into the chest of the woman who towered over you.  You were speechless with shock and surprise as the tall woman actually seemed to be getting even taller and her already impressive breasts were getting even bigger.  Her chest expanded, but her dress did not.  The fabric seemed to be holding her breasts in with every last ounce of strength in their fibers.  They were so tantalizingly close to revealing themselves you couldn't stop yourself from staring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\"  The woman said as she seemed to finally stop growing at what you figured must be about 7 feet tall.  At this point you remembers she was a person and not a pair of breasts so you looked up and said with a red face, \"Oh!  I am so sorry!  I'll talk to the manager and I'm sure she'll be able to help fix...\"  But the woman actually smiled and squatted down low enough so your face was right next to her cleavage.  \"It's all right, you were a good and smart big boy.  My son will love this.  And if he breaks it again I'll know who to take it to.  I'll be sure to tell the manager did such a good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, wow, uh thanks.\"  Was all you could say.  But the lady didn't stop smiling, \"You are just the most adorable little man,\"  And she gave you a little hug burying your face in her cleavage.  You didn't even realize you weren't breathing as she finally broke the hug and made her way to the clothing department leaving you standing there with a big smile on your face.  \"Best.  Job.  Ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day continued and you helped a few more customers without any issue, it looked like the store was going to close soon when Caitlyn came over to your department.  She seemed to have been hard at work, she seemed to have transferred away a lot of her mass as she was skinnier than you'd ever seen her.  She had a grin on her face as she looked down at you and said, \"So, I saw a customer today who had nothing but good things to say about 'the young man' in the electronics and toy department.  She had me resize a bunch of clothes for her, I'm still trying to recover from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as your mind went back to the wonderful moment of bliss in her arms, as you did Caitlyn seemed to have an idea of what you were thinking of, \"You know, if that thing down there is getting to be too big for you I can take care of it?\"  She said pointing a finger at your crotch which was sporting a visible bulge beneth your pants.  You covered yourself and said, \"Keep your powers away from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlyn seemed to be about to make some smartass remark when Cleo approached the two of you, \"Such a great day!  We haven't been this busy in ages and I have a feeling you two are my good luck charm.  Great job Caitlyn taking care of all of the clothing, and Jack, don't think I didn't notice you went above and beyond fixing that toy gun that led to even more sales!  Great work!  Jack I honestly didn't know you were so handy, how about you take a crack at the store's repairs pile?  I'll even let you take home and test whatever you fix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling proud of your work for the day and wanting to continue to impress Cleo you said, \"Sure thing Cleo!\"  And Cleo took you and Caitlyn to behind the counter where there was a box full of items that seemed to be not working.  You and Caitlyn dug through the box for anything that caught your eye.  It was weird, the box actually seemed to be bottomless, you didn't see the same broken item twice.  Finally after a while Caitlyn held something up and said, \"How about this?\"  You took a look and were intrigued by the item Caitlyn was holding.</span></div></div>",

There had been a customer who wanted to fit into a short dress and she had to shrink them to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only short because I had to fit into the stupid uniform,\" you replied. \"Now that we're home I can fit comfortably into my jeans and T-shirt. And I picked this thing. Check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up what appeared to be a normal looking blender on the surface. But you had come to realize that there was anything but normalness when it came to Cleo's shop, so you had given everything in the box a careful look. You imagined that Cleo might have you tinker with all of them at some point given your magical touch with your powers. But for now, you were happy with unraveling the mystery behind this kitchen appliance as your sister read over the logo on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Body Blender?\" she asked. \"I know I'm not one to talk having boiled you alive, but you're not seriously considering climbing into this thing, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I'm reckless but I'm not <i>that </i>stupid. This is supposed to be something that anyone can use, not just someone with my powers.

Now to test that theory of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some of my hair then? I'll charge you fifty bucks for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I can just go to mom.

Thankfully your mom didn't mind if the kids used her bathroom from time to time, after all it was the master bathroom and like 5 times nicer than the one you and Caitlyn had to share.  So without any issue you were able to grab a hair and you casually strode back into the your room where Caitlyn and the Body Blender were waiting with the fruit and milk from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited to do more testing you pour all the tasty ingredients into the blender saving the best and weirdest for last.  As you stuck the hair in the blender like the cherry on top, you take a look at the buttons on it.  You noticed that instead of settings like 'blend' 'puree' and 'liquify' there was a set of numbers 0-9.  You decided to work with Caitlyn to come up with theories as to what the numbers mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's how many hours you turn into the person?\"  Caitlyn proposed, \"You push the 1 then the 0 and boom, you're mom for 10 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible,\"  You ponder, \"But it could be something like a percentage, same example I push the 1 then the 0 and I become 10% mom somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're never going to know til you try it.  Bottoms up.\"  Caitlyn said as she pushed the 1 then the 0 for you.  You watched the milk, bananas, pineapple, and piece of hair blend together.  You expected it all to turn into yellowish drink, but instead it weirdly turned into a cool looking light purple color.  \"Ooo, wonder what color other hairs turn it.\"  Caitlyn pondered, but you weren't worried about colors, but you obviously weren't worried about what was going to happen when you drank it because you downed the magical looking mixture down in a matter of seconds.  You looked at yourself in the mirror and Caitlyn watched you with interest as you felt your body beginning to change.</span></div></div>",

That feeling of growth went down to your face, which got slightly rounder and wider. Your nose ever so slightly smaller. Your lips a bit bigger and fuller. But you were still largely you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went down the rest of your body. Your boobs grew a little with fat, but definitely weren't big enough to be considered breasts. Your stomach got an inch wider and your hips grew out. Your arms and legs got a little softer, your hands and feet a little smaller. Speaking of smaller, you felt your clothes loosen as you dropped an inch of height. You still weren't as short as Caitlyn's five foot self as she stared up at you smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it makes sense that 'Body Blender' would be about blending people together. You look like you're 10% mom now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself all over, even your groin which was definitely ten percent small than usual. It looked like you had been given a new toy to play with.

There were options like \"memory\" or \"personality\" that you weren't sure you wanted blended together. But if Caitlyn wanted to try it, you were more comfortable with her being her own test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what do you want to do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister grinned as she said...</span></div></div>",

And best of all we don't have to explain why we don't look like ourselves instead of just hiding from her and hoping she never runs into us.\"  Caitlyn said listing off the pros to this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit this idea was tempting.  It was just dumb luck your mom hadn't run into either of you the last two days since this craziness started, no way she'd recognize either of you with the different body shapes you've had.  Even your current body which was mostly yourself was still 10% mom with you slightly changed features she'd still notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's do it.  But save a few strands of mom's hair in case we need to turn her back.\"  You said and Caitlyn smiled as you gave your consent to the plan.  And so she was off to set the plan in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you had a moment to yourself, you decided you too should play it safe and saved a few strands of your now slightly redder hair in case something goes wrong, you can always use the blender and go back to this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Caitlyn came back with a bag with some strands of mom's hair for backup along with her water bottle that she used for her post work out smoothies.  Caitlyn plucked a few of her own hairs and mixed up your mom's favorite smoothie with bonus essence of Caitlyn.  She pushed the buttons 1-0-0 along with the personality and memory settings and hit blend until the smoothy had turned into a cartoonishly deep red color.  You poured the mixture into mom's favorite bottle and put it on the table with a note that Caitlyn wrote, 'Mom, hope you had a good run, I went ahead and mixed your favorite.  Hope you feel refreshed after you drink it.  Lots of love.  Your loving children.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the bait was set.  Feeling like you were on a hunt of some sort, you both hid behind the couch in the living room where you could stay decently well hidden, but could still see the bottle.  You both waited silently for minutes before you saw your mom stroll in.  She'd worked up a good sweat and was dabbing the sweat off of her forehead when she saw the trap.  She picked up the bottle and note before saying, \"Aw, how sweet of them.\"  Before she popped the top of the bottle and downed the special smoothie in a matter of seconds.  You both eagerly watched with bated breath as the Body Blender mixture began to take effect.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, your sister and your mom weren't that much of a far cry from each other in looks save for the extra weight your mother had gained over the years. That seemed to be melting off of her though as she slowly began to shrink in mass, causing her workout clothes to come loose all on her body. She grew about an inch in height as the rest of her face seemed to become younger with every passing second. She looked surprised as her wrinkles disappeared before an odd sense of serenity came over her followed by the coy grin your recognized from your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Caitlyn asked, rising from your hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it did,\" mom replied, hands on her waist. \"We knew it would after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're both Caitlyn now?\" you asked as you stood before two perfect clones, though your mom was wearing her baggy clothes still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are identical in every possible way,\" explained mom. \"I have all of your memories from the point you plucked the hair from your head.

You climbed out of your clothes, now standing at just a hair under three feet as your sisters glared down at you still holding the blender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get away!\" they both called out at the same time like a creepy pair of twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you had a head start as you abandoned your pants and waddled down the street with the blender still in hand and only a shirt to cover yourself. To anyone watching, you appeared to be a small child running down the road with a kitchen appliance in your arms, completely unaware that you were all that was saving this town from a terrible fate of being overrun by clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to hide this thing from them and the only place you could think of was Cleo's. It was late in the day at this point, however, and the shop was probably closed. Sure enough, when you arrived you found the door to be locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing I'm so small now,\" you muttered to yourself as you spied a way inside in the form of a small open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw the blender in first and then squeezed in through the tight gap, which was barely large enough for you even at the size you were shrunken to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, you had to marvel at how big everything seemed. The lights were out and it gave Cleo's shop an almost haunting appearance with all the old oddities on display. It didn't look as if someone was there, but you could almost feel a presence in the building. Though you didn't have time to be spooked. It was only a matter of time before the Caitlyns figured out where you had gone running. And there was little you could do to fight against them at this size. Not to mention how you were supposed to counter their combined powers at all if they were shrinking you without any care of how bloated they became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you could look around the shop?

Cleo has even given me permission to take the body of any intruders.\"  You noticed Wilma seemed to be looking your body up and down as she said this.  Seeing a chance to get out of this you said, \"Wait!  Please don't take my body!  I need it!  And I need you!

You run up and pick up your former mom who screams, \"You may have shrunk me, but I still have my powers.  Jack I'll take your hight and then I'll glrurururuerur!\"   You couldn't make out what she was saying as you had dunked her head first into the mom mixture.  You held her under for almost a minute until you were sure she had drunk some of it in.  And sure enough you could feel Caitlyn's body shifting back into moms under your fingertips.  Satisfied the transformation was complete you took your now fully mom again, out of the silver colored substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen Richmond coughed and sputtered until she looked up and said, \"Jack, I was just...not me...and I'm small.  Is this a dream?  What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably tell you what's been going on the last few days.\"  You said putting your mom down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you told your mom everything since you first found the shop.  She laid down across a book cover as Wilma spent her time with a body putting on clothes and playing with her growing and shrinking powers.  Finally you told mom about the last few hours events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is that ghost woman going to possess my daughter forever?\"  Mom said looking at Wilma wearing a gigantic cowboy hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she says she should only stay for a day.  But I wish it could be longer, she'll already a better sister than Caitlyn ever was.\"  You said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that about your sister.\"  Mom scolded, but you weren't having it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom.  She tried to kill me or threaten to kill me multiple times.  And she just tried to take over the world or something just as sinister and used your body to try it.  Wilma can keep that body as far as I'm concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want my daughter to be possessed forever...but something has to be done.  And with her having powers now I don't know how much I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Cleo should be getting in soon, we'll ask her if she has a magic jail or can remove Cailtyn's powers at least or something.\"  You said as you watched the sun come up through the shop window.</span></div></div>",

Does it always have it so that you get overwritten by the person you're becoming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean if you drink the smoothie, do you have to mentality turn into the person? No, that was only something special we did with your drink. You can do just the body swap without a personality or mental change too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I think I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was simple enough as the three of you worked through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, Wilma returned your mother back to her normal height and restored a little of yours before she had spent all of her excess body fat. You were standing at around 3 and a half feet, which made even your mom look quite intimidating. Once that was done, your mom plucked a hair from both her and Wilma's head to create two separate smoothies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Caitlyn has proven to be too dangerous with her new powers,\" she explained to you. \"I'm just going to have to punish her by taking them in the only way I see how. We'll switch bodies. She can have mine until she learns a little lesson. And I'll go around posing as her so you two won't get in trouble with your boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, you think that your mom quite liked the idea of being young again, at least for a little while. When the smoothies were done, both set to only 100% and no additional effects, Wilma and your mom clicked the glasses together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather bizarre sight to watch your sister and your mom suddenly trade bodies. Your mom's entire figure shrunk as the robe she had been wearing after you had transformed her back began to slip off her shoulders. Wilma, on the otherhand, grasped at her ballooning waistline. She looked as if she had been inflated like a balloon. Both women stayed around the same height, you never realized how much Caitlyn looked like mom in the face and hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like that worked,\" your mom said, adjusting to not having to carry so much weight anymore. \"And not a moment too soon. Looks like the sun is starting to come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long night of running around and causing chaos. You were hit with a wave of exhaustion as you realized that you were going to have to go to work soon, even though you had spent your night trying to save the world. You glanced over to Wilma and made a promise with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your help. I'll make it up to you, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, sonny. I had my time.

Instantly she tried to point at you in order to shrink you down even further, but luckily her powers really went away when you and mom gave her a copy of mom's body.  After that she tried to launch herself at you, but Cleo wasn't having any of that.  She gave a look to an empty body of armor by the door, and it sprang to life grabbing Caitlyn before she could do anything.  \"No one assaults my employees and gets away with.  Caitlyn you are banned from my shop for the foreseeable future.  Oh yes, and you're fired.\"  With that the armor dragged a kicking and screaming Caitlyn from the shop and threw her out.  You saw through the window that Caitlyn seemed to be looking for something, but somehow seemed to be unable to even find that shop even though it was right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Caitlyn taken care of, you and your mom in her new Caitlyn body explained what happened to Cleo about her crazy plans.  Cleo shook her head, \"I was hoping giving her some power and access to the shop would be enough to satisfy her curiosity and give hers something to do, but I sadly in this timeline I was mistaken.  A shame.\"  Cleo sighed before smiling and looked to your mom, \"Well Ellen since you already have the body for it, how would you like a job here?  I believe you're already familiar with some of the perks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom was only half listening as she was amusing herself by growing and shrinking a book entitled, 'Magical pregnancy for dummy's as written by a literal dummy'.  She finally dropped the book and said, \"Oh my, do you mean that?  That sounds wonderful!  I was hoping for a way to get in contact with my husband and I'm sure this shop would help me with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, indeed.\"  Cleo said, although for the first time you noticed Cleo looked a little nervous, did she know more than she was letting on.  But you had other questions you wanted answered.  \"Cleo, Wilma was so good to us, I mean we couldn't have stopped Caitlyn without her help.  Is there any way that we can help her get her own body to live again?  Can she just keep Caitlyn's?  I've only known her a few hours but she's already a better human than Caitlyn ever was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo raised her eyebrows at you and smiled, \"That's very thoughtful of you young man, but it's very unlikely to happen.  A possession can only last til dawn unless the human in question fully welcomes them into their body.  And as you saw with how your sister rejected her, that's not something a normal human would...or should do.  Perhaps she could start life anew from scratch, but that would require assistance from a soon to be mother and that's a whole other bag or worms.  Don't get me wrong, I do like and care for Wilma and I'd hate to lose my night guard, but it's not very feasible for her to have a new body.  I'm sorry.\"  You wanted to ask more questions, but the doors had opened and the customers needed supervision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom immediately took to Caitlyn's old spot in the clothing section, and since you were back to a child like 3' 6\" you decided to once again stick to the kids section.  Hours of helping customers out with their problems ended with you cleaning up the things that had fallen to the ground.  You picked up a katana that had cut a little girl in half, but you put her back together no problem.  You chuckled as you wondered what would happen if you used it on yourself.  With how adaptable your body had magically become you thought you might end up like a starfish and become two copies of you if you cut yourself in half.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you grabbed a clock off the ground that a guy had played with and disappeared after using, no idea what happened to him, but you could have sworn you heard Cleo mutter something about 'messing with time travel' when you asked a follow up she just said that the customer would probably end up back in this shop '50 years ago from now' whatever that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you picked up that book mom had been playing with earlier about magical pregnancies.  You thought about giving it a read for curiosity's sake, but messing with a book with that title might have consequences.  As the sun went down and you got ready to head home you notice Wilma materialize to begin her own shift at Shae's Antiques.  You once again wished you could somehow help get a body of her own, when you were hit with a strike of inspiration...or maybe it's stupidity.  You quickly picked up a tool that you could use to try and help Wilma get a body of her own.</span></div></div>",

And time traveling...That never ended well in all the movies. One wrong move and you might cease to exist. You could tell yourself that Cleo would never put something so dangerous in her shop. But after all you had been through, you realized that wasn't the case. That was why you were picking up the book on pregnancies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to be slick about it, being so short the book was a little unwieldy at your stature. But you were able to successfully hide it under the new tool Cleo had asked you to work on that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since the blender worked so well, how about this one instead? It's a broken CD player that's supposed to play hypnotizing music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded dangerous to you. You were going to have to keep this one out of Caitlyn's hands, with all the trouble she would get into with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your mom and you both walked home. Caitlyn had spent the day adjusting to her new body, looking none too pleased that she had to do all of mom's typical chores, including cleaning. Though she didn't complain for too long after your mom threatened to shrink her if she disobeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a neat trick,\" she said. \"Maybe this will finally allow us to get along. Let me know if she tries anything, won't you Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and took your dinner upstairs that night, reading from the pregnancy book while working on the CD player, taking turns doing both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly discovered that the book actually had a series of spells and enchantments, some of which were designed for just the sort of thing you were looking to do with Wilma. According to your research, you could actually generate a full grown infant in a matter of a week with the right spell. It would just be an empty shell waiting to be possessed by Wilma forever. What's more, the infant would have access to untapped magical powers, though the book didn't really elaborate on that. The problem was finding the proper host, or mother, in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell clearly stated that it needed a female for it to work. You were distinctly 90% male given your mother's smoothie drink, though there might be other ways to turn into a girl if only temporarily in Cleo's shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose you could ask your mom for help too, she was looking at the book herself. Maybe Caitlyn would also offer her help if you phrased it as an act of redemption. What would you do or who would you approach?</span></div></div>",

And as far as your mother goes, she'd be the natural choice, after all she had already given birth three times and knew what it was like.  But she had just been given a sort of fountain of youth in the form of Caitlyn's body and you didn't want to take away any enjoyment of her newfound youth by asking her to give birth for your ghost friend Wilma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, this was all your idea, and the book itself said the process would only last about a week, so why not?  After all how many guys could say they've given birth to a magical ghost baby?  It sounded like the sort of crazy thing you didn't want to pass up.  As you molded your hand to fit into the tight cracks in the hypnotic CD player you managed to connect the correct wires as it lit up and began to spin.  Quickly you pulled your hand out of the device and turned it off.  \"All right, no explosions and no hypnotized brain.  Job well done me.\"  You put the CD player on your bedside table and turned out the lights.

The guy who had used the clock from the day before suddenly materialized, confused how he lost an entire day. Then you were forced to separate a brother and a sister fighting over a magic mirror that changed their ages, going from toddlers to seniors in the span of a few minutes. You didn't get the chance to approach Cleo with your proposition until lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cleo,\" you said, sitting at the break table with her in the backdoor. \"Remember how I asked you about Wilma yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, I remember everything,\" she responded from reading a newspaper from 1941. \"And I already know what you're going to ask me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" she replied, looking up at you from her paper. \"And I do not approve. Bringing people back from the dead is a dangerous business. Therefore, I will not help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But you won't stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot save people from themselves, only if they choose to do harm onto others.

You had hoped Cleo might be able to provide her valuable insight, as she had been doing this sort of things for what was an undoubtedly long time. Working with her had given you some pocket money, but it wasn't nearly enough to buy anything substantial based on what you had seen around. Maybe you could ask your mom for help with the finances involved with this. Though it would be a gamble on what would exactly work.

After all, you weren't the same naive guy who had gotten himself stuck in a wine bottle a few days ago, you were wiser now and could probably test out stuff safely to get it to do what you want.  And you didn't want your mom over your shoulder giving you her input, you would buy some sort of tool to give you a temporary sex change so you could birth Wilma a body to take.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you went to the one place you could afford, the clearance bin.  It was a big box of assorted junk from all over the store that all looked super cheap, broken, or too old to sell full price.  You carefully began moving things around trying to find something that would give you the desired female body when you heard a voice behind, or more accurately, above you say, \"What are you up to today Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up behind you to see Wilma floating behind your shoulder, \"Well, I was kinda hoping to keep this a surprise, but what the hell you're already here.  I'm looking for something that will turn me into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't know you swung that way young man, I'm sorry.  Young lady.\"  Wilma said looking a bit flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  I'm a dude.  I like being a dude.  I just want to TEMPORARILY turn into a girl and...well.  I want to make myself magically pregnant so you can have a body of your own.\"  Wilma looked stunned to hear this, but seemed very moved.  \"Oh Jack, that is so very sweet of you.  But you really don't have to do something like this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!  I mean, you basically saved my life last night when you saved me from Caitlyn, this is the least I could do for you.  I owe you big time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilma looked like she was about to cry.  Could ghosts cry?  \"Well I'm not going to say that I think this is a good idea, but I certainly won't stop you.  Good luck young man.\"  Wilma said as she floated off.  You felt yourself getting a little annoyed, \"Why doesn't anyone want to help me get a sex change so I can bring a dead person back to life...ok if I put it like that I get why it sounds bad.  But dang it I have good intentions.\"  You said before getting back to digging in the clearance bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of very careful digging, you found a few promising items.  First was a pair of 100 sides dice in a nice wooden body, one die was blue and the other pink.  The box seemed to have some symbols engraved on it like an hourglass and what you recognized as the male and female symbols.  \"Well, this seems like it might be able to do what I'm looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the dice asside you went back to looking for anything vaguely feminine, after all that was probably your best lead.  Eventually you found a broken looking Barbie doll with it's legs and arms missing.  Curious you dug around to see if you could find the other pieces to the doll and you did manage to find pieces from other dolls that might fit in it.  \"Don't know if this will effect me, but maybe I'll just take it home to fix to get on Cleo's good side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding you still should look for something else with sex change potential you noticed something that smelled very flowery and girly.  You found that the scent came from an old looking pink candle.  \"If this doesn't do what I want, maybe I can give it as a gift to a girl someday.  Who knows.\"  You said as you looked at the change in your pocket and realized you could only afford one item today.  Finally you made your decision.</span></div></div>",

And Cleo refused to give you any sort of answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well,\" you decided. \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you prepared to roll them, you were startled by the door slamming open. Even with your new height, Caitlyn was still about your size and looked very intimidating indeed as she glowered over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" she growled. \"I've had enough of this stupid body. You're going to find a way to change me back or I'm going to make your life a living hell somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cait, come on,\" you tried to argue, hiding the dice in your hands. \"You had your chance and you blew it. Cleo won't like it if I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, rubber boy! I wonder what would happen if I tried eating? Or sitting on you? With this stupid fat body, I bet I can crush you flat until you do what I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right in that regard, being in mom's body meant she had an advantage in weight on you. You could only put up your arms in defense as she came at you, savage and mad from being forced to live mom's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me back my body!\" she yelled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she shook you, what happens?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had your hands balled in a fist with the pink and blue 100 sided die held tight within, and this did not go without notice.  Caitlyn who was practically frothing at the mouth shouted at you, \"What's in your hand?  Will get me out of this body?!\"  And without even waiting for an answer, the power hungry Caitlyn grabbed your first and with her superior mass managed to pull your fingers apart and grab the dice out of them.  \"Caitlyn don't do that-\"  You tried to warn, but Caitlyn wasn't listening.  She through the dice like a weapon against the wall, the hit and rolled around on the ground before coming to an unsettling halt.  You stared at the dice expecting an explosion, or smoke, or lasers, or something, but nothing seemed to be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be careful with magical stuff Caitlyn, I have no idea what those are supposed...\"  But when you turned to look at your sister, she wasn't there.  Looking down you saw a pile of your mom's clothes Caitlyn had to wear now, but something was wiggling around in there making a racket.  You bent down and dug through the clothes until to your shock you came across a crying baby boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...I guess that confirms that the dice can swap genders.  Thanks for testing them out for me...baby bro.\"  Caitlyn glared at you and screamed as she tried to take an adorable looking swipe at you with her tiny fist.  You just had to laugh at the threat, \"Well, now that I know what the dice can do, I guess I can afford to figure out more about how they work without testing it on myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put Caitlyn on the ground, and took keep her from trying to cause trouble you put a laundry basket over the top of her which as much as she tried, she couldn't get it off of her.  With Caitlyn locked up in baby jail you took a closer look at the dice.  It looked like the blue on had rolled 60 and the pink one had rolled 59.  \"So if we use simple subtraction we end up with a total of blue 1.  Meaning the person who rolled it turned into a 1 year old boy.\"  Caitlyn continued to wail.  \"Oh shut up, it could have been a lot worse for you, you could have ended up like 99 years old or something,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you took some time to take a closer look at the box that the dice came in.  You now definitely knew the importantce of the male and female symbols, the hourglass, and the math symbols on it.  But that left a few things you didn't know what it meant.  There were a few circles on it at the top that turned into a crescent moon before turning into a circle again.  Thinking out loud you said, \"Maybe it means it lasts for a day?  A month?  Maybe that's what it means.\"  There was one way to test the theory, and very careful not to roll them, you passed the dice back to Cailtyn in between the holes of the laundry basket.  She happily took them and rolled them landing on blue 82 and pink 52.  Doing the simple math you realized Cailtyn should be turning into a 30 year old man, but she was still a baby boy trapped in your laundry basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So once you roll you can't turn back for...an amount of time yet to be determine.  But if it's a day or a month it doesn't matter, I'm going to have to be lady long enough to get magically pregnant and give birth after a week or whatever.  You know, I've done enough thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn off your brain and grab the dice.  Now you knew what you needed to roll for your goal, you wanted pink to beat blue by preferably 20-40.  \"That's like a 1/10 chance maybe?  I don't know, but I'm in a gambling mood.  Let it ride!\"  You shout out as you pick up the dice and give them a toss.  You see the blue stop first and it landed on a 1.  \"One sex change coming up it looks like.\"  You said as you watched anxiously as the pink die came to a stop.</span></div></div>",

Walking was so hard and your fat legs were wobbling around as you went to the mirror to get a better look at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were indeed female now, you recognized that by the long red hair you were now sporting.

You tried to walk to your pants to grab your phone, but you just wobbled and fell down.  Feeling the frustration of your newly unstable legs you give a cry of frustration, \"CLEOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen by a miracle, or more likely it was some sort of magic, your phone began to ring and vibrate itself out of your pants pocket and right beside your body.  Thankfully you could still read and saw that the name of the person call read was, 'CLEO'.  Instantly you reached your chubby little hand out and after a failed try or two you managed to open up the phone call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qweeo?\"  You said softly into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH, good to hear from you Jack, glad to see your 'giving birth to a ghost' folly at least left you with the ability to answer the phone.\"  You could hear the very casual voice of Cleo on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hwelp me!  I'm a baby gwrl!\"  You struggled to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'd say you sound more like a toddler than a baby since you can actually speak,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juss help meeeee!\"  You say trying not to break into tears, and Caitlyn crying in the corner of the room wasn't helping calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you, I told you I wouldn't help you with this idea of yours, you'll just have to live with the consequences.\"  Cleo said very sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I stwuck like this?\"  You asked suddenly really regretting your roll of the dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous, you'll be able to grow up to become a fine and beautiful young lady, and once you're of age if you want to keep with your plan I won't stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THA'S NOT WHAT I MEAN!\"  You scream very shrilly into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean Jack.  I was partially joking.  I'll just give you some advice.  You can turn back or change your form into whatever you want with magical items in my shop, but again I stress I will not help you if it's for reasons I don't agree with.  And also you'll need to pay the items on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief, at least you weren't going to be magically a 2 year old girl forever or something.  But Cleo wasn't done as she continued, \"With that said, I don't care what body you have.  It's no excuse to miss work.  I expect to see you and your mother in the shop first thing in the morning for your assignments.  If you do not show up on time, I will have no choice but to ban you from my shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!  But I'm a baby now!\"  You say in horror into the phone, she surly can't expect you to work like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A toddler.\"  Cleo corrects before continuing, \"And no excuses, hopefully your mother will be willing to give you a ride if she can find a babysitter for little Caitlyn, yes I know about her foolishness too.  But even if she's a baby she's still banned from my shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"  You tried to come up with something to say that could fix all this, but nothing came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope to see you at work tomorrow Jack, I really do.  Goodbye.\"  And with that she hung up the phone leaving you near tears.  As Caitlyn continued her screaming you said to yourself, \"How am I going to expwain this to mom?\"</span></div></div>",

Is everything alright in--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom got the briefest of looks at the scene in the bedroom. But, unfortunately, she didn't watch where she was going as she stepped inside and kicked something on the floor. That something happened to be the dice, which you had left lying where they fell. You could only watch helplessly as your mom disappeared into the clothes she was wearing. In her place, a cooing baby girl sat looking around the room curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are des dice woaded?\" you asked, seeing that your mom had rolled 55 pink and 54 blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must have been some astronomical bad luck on everyone's sides to all land in the baby to toddler range. Mom looked like she had no idea what was happening and Caitlyn had been bawling her eyes out nonstop. This probably wasn't what Cleo had in mind and you had to call her again to tell her what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the phone again and hit redial your must recent number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" Cleo answered. \"I'm on my way there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you said, trying to keep up with your childish brain. \"You know what happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt it.

I'll be there in five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, five minutes later and Cleo let herself into the house. That was for the best, considering none of you were tall enough to reach the door in your states. She entered your bedroom and towered over all of you as she looked down at the mess that had been created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then,\" she said, first gathering up the dice. \"Step one will be to get rid of these things to keep them out of reach from future customers. They'll go in the dangerous chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she dropped the dice in the pocket on her apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step two will be to get the three of you back up to a proper age. You're lucky I have just the tool to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her other apron pocket this time and pulled out...</span></div></div>",

Now, come here Ellen.\"  Cleo squatted down and looked to your baby mother who giggled and crawled her way to Cleo.  You were actually surprised at how well your mom was taking suddenly being transformed into a baby.  She seemed to be adapting to the craziness of Cleo's shop faster than even you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo shook up the sand of time and held it against your mom's head.  Steadily in a matter of seconds you watched as your mom grew from baby Caitlyn into her 17 year old form she had just minutes earlier.  \"Dat thing can mwake people older?\"  You ask as your mom put back on her clothes she'd previously de aged out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, it transfers years from one person to another.\"  Cleo said with a satisfied smirk down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh you don't look any younger?  How old are you?\"  You question but Cleo just smiles as your mother huffs, \"Jack!  Young man I thought I raised you better than to ask a woman's age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sowwy mom.\"  You as you watched as Cleo freed Caitlyn from her baby cage.  She seemed about to put the necklace up to Caitlyn's head before saying, \"You know what, you can stay like this for a while.  That last thing you need right now is a burst of testosterone.\"  Caitlyn again continued to cry as your mom then asked, \"Then do you mind giving me a few extra years that you were going to give her, I mean him?  I'd like to be able to drink wine again legally and maybe dates some older men without risk of them going to jail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo smiled, \"Of course Ellen, anything for one of my most valued employees.\"  She again put the necklace to your mothers head, and although Cleo didn't seem to be changing ages, your mom's breasts filled out some more and her belly puffed out a little bit as she seemed to go from 17 to about 25.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were excited to watch this magic work, eagerly you raise your hand, \"It's my turn now right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo looked at your and looked conflicted, \"On one hand I'd love to get both of my best workers into bodies that didn't go again child labor laws, but I don't really want to give you what you want after your foolhardy experimenting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down in shame, in the crazy aftermath of the dice rolling you'd let it slip your mind the reason you wanted to become an adult woman in the first place.  To make a magical baby for your ghost friend Wilma to become.  Cleo seemed to be still thinking about what to do when your mother actually said something, \"You know Cleo, I know what Jack did was a bit reckless but you know he's still a good boy, or girl, and have good intentions.  I think you should give him his old age on one condition.\"  Cleo seemed interested as you looked curiously to your mother wondering what she was about to suggest.</span></div></div>",

Make me big and I'll be prwegnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very adult choice. Now, you might want to lose that shirt before you rip it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as commanded as Cleo shook the sands of time again and held it against your forehead. In an instant, you were overcome with a rush as you started to rise up from the floor, your legs looking like tree branches as they grew up and out. That wasn't the only thing taking up your field of vision as a pair of orbs began to sprout on your chest. You became distinctly aware of the fact that you were indeed female, as a toddler there wasn't much difference. The older you got, however, the more you could feel the changes from this and your boy body. Your hips got wider while the rest of you remained thin and slim, probably in part to your exercise routines. In fact, the fattest part of you remained your chest as you exploded up to D cups before stopping. You were quite a bit bigger than your mother as an older Caitlyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of looking the same as always, Cleo looked a little bit younger this time. Only slightly. Considering she had just given up about 40 of her years, she was only missing a few crowsfeet and wrinkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" she said. \"I aged you up to the ripe age of twenty now, so you don't have to worry about school. I'll see to it that your new identity is all sorted out too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you said, still not used to your female voice. \"Well, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?

It looked oddly hypnotic, and if anyone else were to offer you this, you'd turn it down.  But you trusted Cleo, and you didn't want to question her and make her think you didn't trust her.  So you grabbed the vial and drank it down.

What's the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo shrugged, \"You've already gone this far and are willing to go even farther.  And I don't want to lose an employee because they were trying to do something nice.  Foolish, but nice.  So I just helped you cross the finish line.  And don't worry about this from a medical end.  Shae's Antique's has a fantastic insurance plan.  You'll just have to get your check ups at a...special medical themed branch office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\"  You said putting your hands over your belly and it's new occupant, \"Thanks Cleo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see if you'll be thanking her after 9 months of morning sickness and strange cravings.\"  Your mom said as she came up to you and gave you a big hug, \"Oh, my little boy is going to be mommy!  And I'm going to be a grandmother!  I never thought I'd see the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?  I so totally could have gotten my girlfriend pregnant...you know, if I had a girlfriend.\"  You sheepishly said with what little oxygen your mom's hug left you with.  The two of you shared a tender moment, it was broken up by the sound of crying at your feet.  An angry looking Caitlyn was punching your feet, deciding punting a baby wasn't the best choice you picked your sister turned baby brother up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we going to do with you?  You're still banned from the store so you can't come to work with me and mom.  I guess we'll have to switch off on looking at you until we get a babysitter for little Cane here.\"  You say as the newly christened Caitlyn formed her hands into cute little fists and swung them wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for that, I want both of my star employees in to work, it's a busy time of year.  I'll take care of young Cane.\"  Out of nowhere Cleo pulled out a 3x3 puzzle cube and twisted it around a few times until she decided on a pattered and then tossed it.  When it hit the ground the cube opened up and there was a flash of red light.  Emerging from the light was a man who looked about 20.  He looked like he just came out of the cover of a teen magazine.  Except for the fact that he didn't have eyes.  The man smiled a weirdly artificial smile and said, \"Enjoy your day of work or play.  I shall take care of the little one.\"  And held his arms out.  You were hesitant to give Cane over to this creature when Cleo said, \"Meet the Boyfriend in a Box.  It's a portable golem that can be programed for many different activities including cooking, cleaning, romance, and 100s of other possibilities.  In this case, he'll be a very capable babysitter.  Just push the button inside the puzzle box and he'll return ready to be programed for any other need.\"  You happily handed your brat of a sibling over to the golem as you reached down to look at the curious puzzle box, but your mom stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more tinkering for now.  It's time to get to work.  You've still got to provide for little Wilma or William.\"  You nodded your head and put on your work sweater that was now kind of tight in the chest region and went to work.</span></div></div>",

That was when Cleo informed you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we can confirm the pregnancy is proceeding as normal, I'm going to have to introduce you to a friend. She's quite familiar with magical pregnancies, so she'll help Wilma settle in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't thought that far ahead of how Wilma would take possession of the unborn baby inside of you. You supposed it was a good thing that you now had Cleo to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife went on in the Richmond household as you slowly got adjusted to your new life as a soon-to-be mother. You weren't showing any obvious signs of changes outside of adjusting to breasts before you were overcome one night with a sudden rush of sickness and went sprinting to the bathroom. Your mom woke up and helped you by holding your long red hair out of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the first warning sign,\" she chimed with a cheery smile. \"We should take Cleo up on her offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calls were made and the three of you, your mother, Wilma, and you both headed to the address Cleo had given you after work the next day. You were surprised to find that the doctor was in a perfectly normal looking clinic, though no one seemed to mind Wilma floating around just behind you. There was the usual amount of waiting in the waiting room before your name was called to see a Doctor Jane Stillbirth. You hoped that her name wasn't a bad omen or an even worser pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" greeted an eccentric woman in her sixty's with grey frazzled hair. \"You must be Jaclyn! I've heard so much about you already, quite the noble thing you're doing here. Dangerous, for certain. But let's see what we got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than turn to you and your belly, she instead examined Wilma instead looking her up and down with various tools. Only on the occasion would she glance towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she said. \"This will prove very difficult then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked. \"Can't you just put her in the child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't quite work like that. This vessel is to become a new home for her soul. Therefore, you need to be properly accommodating to her or you'll just end up with a normal child that rejects Wilma's soul every morning as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" you replied. \"But how do we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite simple!\"</span></div></div>",

Fare thee well.\"<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening you were going through your new nightly routine of taking a bunch of prenatal vitamins and taking a shower.  Something that you took your time with, after all with your new body you wanted to make sure you were familiar with it and got yourself nice and clean.  Especially since your body was about to have a guest.  You checked on your mom who was rocking baby boy Caitlyn to sleep before heading to your room where you were in for a shock.  Floating above your bed was Wilma just waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\"  You said in surprise at the undead specter, \"WILMA!  I'm practically naked!\"  You said holding the towel tight over your nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old ghost just chuckled, \"Dearie it's nothing I haven't seen before, and I'm about to have it myself anyways Jaclyn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...could you turn around for a minute?\"  You said feeling your face flush.  Wilma rolled her eyes and lowered her flower headband over her eyes.  You took the opportunity to put on some panties and a bra (something it only took you about 3 minutes to do now) before putting on a yellow nightgown your mom had gotten for you.  You crawled into bed and said, \"Ok Wilma, goodnight.  My body is yours.  Enjoy your sleep.\"  With that you saw Wilma lowering herself into your body before you blacked out.  </span></div></div>",

You both hovered just close enough that you could see the surface, where thousands upon thousands of people were sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are the sleeping dreamers,\" explained the fairy. \"The normal ones who don't get to walk around in Dream Land.

They were more...Perfect, if that was the right word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dream self is your true window into your soul,\" explained the fairy. \"You can alter your appearance up there however you wish.

Before you was basically the craziest tv in the world with millions of channels, each unique and crazy in it's own way and could never be described to you if you asked about it in the real world.  You had to check it out.  As you floated in the weird space like area you began to try and float over to one of the dream plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could you felt the fairy tug at the tether that connected you, \"Whoa there, before I let you loose to have your fun, there is one thing you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's tone shifted to be more serious although their face still had an air of whimsy.  \"The hopes and dreams of human being are powerful things and should not be interfered with.  Observe all you want but do not try to interfere.  Your will may be strong enough to survive, but if it's not, well, let's just say you will not be able to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"  You asked, but the fairy simply waved goodbye as they severed the tether between the two of you.  You began to float freely down towards a dream planet.  You landed on a what you figured had to be land, but it was more like a fluffy cloud, you don't know what to expect, but there seemed to be nothing around.  \"How the heck to do watch people's dreams in here?  Is this like a holodeck?\"  And as you said it, the cloudy world morphed before you eyes and feet into a black room with a yellow grid patern on the floor, walls, and ceiling.  \"Ok this is pretty sweet, but I think I'd like less of a sci fi vibe to my dream watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Realm of Dreams seemed to bend to your desires as the holodeck room disappeared and a huge chair covered in pillows appeared with a 200 foot wide television made of glass.  You jumped up, did a triple backflip and landed comfortably in the chair.  \"Wow, this thing is comfortable, can the Dream Realm get any better?\"  The answer to this question was yes because a new fairy came by with a silver trey full of a ice cream with the consistency of cotton candy that doesn't melt, a milkshake that was literally made of rainbows (your new favorite flavor), and a remote control for you dream viewing pleasures.  You picked up the remove that just had a microphone in it and said, \"I guess I wonder what Caitlyn's dreaming about.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly on the there was blackness and the sound of a baby crying, slowly a version of Caitlyn in her old normal body appeared but was wearing a diaper.  Standing over her looking a hundred feet tall were your normal male body and your mom's.  The giant Jack said in a warped voice, \"I have proven once and for all I am bigger and I am better than you, you dumb little baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy diapers for the rest of your life baby boy!\"  The giant version of your mom said in a demonic voice that was the opposite of hers.  Diaper wearing Caitlyn began to shift and shrink down until she had turned into her baby boy body she had now as the two giants laughed over her.  And a new face that looked 1000 feet tall that vaguely resembled a twisted version of Cleo joined in on the laughing and looked like it was about to eat Caitlyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first instinct was to protect Caitlyn.  Despite all the horrible things she's done, dang it she was still your little sister and you wanted to try and help her.  But the fairy who brought you your snacks gave a cough distracting you.  You suddenly remembered what this was.  This was a dream for Caitlyn.  A nightmare.  It wasn't really happening to her.  And you couldn't interfere or else who knew what could happen, the fairy had given you that warning.</span></div></div>",

She managed to outrun a dinosaur in the desert when it slipped over some roller skates.  She then went rafting down a river and beat up a humanoid beaver in a log rolling competition where the log was a giant wine bottle.  And you cheered loudly as you downed some kiwi jelly flavored dream popcorn when Caitlyn managed to win a fation contest to advance to the mountain by dropping a chandelier on her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the final climax of Caitlyn's epic dream came when she entered a treasure room in the mountains.  But before Caitlyn could claim her prize, a gigantic three headed dragon hit Caitlyn with blue fire that turned her into her baby boy body.  You used the remove to move the camera around to look at the dragon and were a bit sad to see that the three heads resembled you, your mom, and Cleo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Caitlyn really does have deep rooted problems with us.\"  You said as the dragon was about to squish Caitlyn you were about the change the channel again to something nicer when you thought aloud, \"No, if I just keep changing the channel the same problem is going to keep coming up.  She sees me, mom, and Cleo as bad guys because she's paranoid or something, I've got to change that.  One of your dream fairy friends dropped you off some ladybug flavored ice cream (it tastes better than it sounds), but you didn't notice as you were just staring at the remote.  There were a ton of buttons you hadn't wanted to mess with, but in order to get your sister's head right you might be able to do real good.  You pointed the remote at the dragon and hit a down button and sure enough the dragon began to shrink down until it was even smaller than baby Caitlyn.  Something that made Caitlyn actually stop crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that's a good start, let's see if I can do anything else to help.  You looked at the remote for the least threatening button you could, and settled on one shaped like a teddy bear and pushed it pointing at the three headed dragon.

Your fairy pal didn't interfere, but you definitely heard a \"Hmmmm.\"  coming from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't care if you were interfering.

Now, do hurry or you'll be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wasted no time and snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in a rather odd position as you found your head buried in a greasy, empty plate of food next to a mountain of other plates. You found that your stomach was quite sore and felt very full as you groaned and sat up to realize you were in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that!\" Wilma called out to you from the other side of the table. \"It's just been so long since I tasted real food that I just couldn't help myself and pigged out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPigged out was putting it lightly. Wilma, in your body, had apparently eaten the entire fridge's worth of food in a dozen course meal over night. Your mom absolutely freaked out when she discovered what had happened until Wilma apologized for you, and to you as well for adding about ten pounds to your waistline. You supposed a little extra weight was to be expected when pregnant, but at this rate you were going to get as big as mom was before her transformation into Caitlyn. Wilma was also looking a little different than she had the night before. She was still big, but she looked a little less like a hippie in some strange way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that messy surprise, you were also pleased to see that for once real Caitlyn wasn't crying the whole time she was awake. She still gave you the stinkeye, but at least she had lightened up a bit and wasn't trying to damage your ear drums. You supposed a little more work in Dream Land and she might actually start to like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got dressed and your now tight fitting clothes and wondered what the new day would bring for you next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and mom left Caitlyn to her golem babysitter to teleport into the shop through your closet for work.  Your mom went straight for the clothing department, she'd been looking forward to see if she would be gaining or losing mass today.  You were about to go to Cleo for today's assignments when your stomach churned, \"Oof, Wilma did not do me any favors this morning.  I swear I already feel 9 months pregnant.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you stomach calmed down a bit, you went right to Cleo who looked at you with a raised eyebrow, \"You've got gravy on your cheek.\"  A bit embarrassed, you wiped it off and explained how you found yourself full of everything Wilma ate last night.  Cleo simply sighed but she didn't chastise you any further.  Instead she asked you to help her carry a particularly heavy crate to a new area of the shop.  So using your malleable body, you put your feet flat under the crate and used yourself as a dolly to move the heavy box.  Arriving at your destination, an area that almost looked like a bar with hundreds of colorful bottles on the wall that you could have sworn were not there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo opened the box and smiled, \"Good, we can finally open up our casual potion corner.  The Self Stirring Cauldron is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that going to do?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stir simple potions for me.  I've always had a potion service hear but it's only been very special orders that I would only take on sparingly.  Without one of these baby's,\"  Cleo touched her newest acquisition, \"It takes a lot of attention and time to make a potion.  With this even you could make a potion in a matter of minutes.  In fact, that's what you'll be doing today.  I already set up all the ingredients around and labeled them for you.\"  You reached up for one neon yellow bottle that was labeled, 'Toenail elongation'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always just thought potions had newt eyes and toe of frogs,\"  You said looking at the conveniently labeled bottles that all seemed to just have effects listed on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were the olden days, modern times come with modern conveniences even in the magical world.  Now all you have to do is man the counter, add whatever ingredients the customer wants, and the Self Stirring Cauldron will do the rest, even bottling the potion.  Although I do recommend you check IDs and only sell to people 21 and over.  Need to save some younger people form themselves.\"  You noticed Cleo gave you a little look at that, but you brushed it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so began your day.  And sure enough it was very simple work.  One collage age guy wants long red hair, no acne, and good breath, there are ingredients for that.  One elderly lady wants some youth, good health, and no more peanut allergies.  There's a potion you could mix for that.  Things went very smoothly til you had a customer who you had to check an ID for.  Her ID said her name was Leila Cadell and she was a 21 year old woman with jet black hair and some of the most beautiful blue eyes you'd even seen.  If you weren't a pregnant woman right now you'd probably ask her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile that melted your heart a little she asked, \"My friend is getting married but her parents aren't around to walk her down the aisle so I volunteered.  So I was wondering if you could age me about 20 years, give me some dad strength, and...why not go nuts a little bit.  A splash of maturity, but not too much.  And lets see...can I have a glass eye?  I think it could be neat to try.  And if I don't like it I can get a nice eyepatch for the wedding.  And can I get a sex change potion on the side?  I'm not sure if I want to go as her mom or dad yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super cool.\"  Was all you could say, you felt yourself become a bit tongue tied, but that didn't stop you from doing your job.  Sure enough there were bottles on the wall for all of those ingredients described and the cauldron did it's self stirring.  As you watched the mix turn into a tantalizing caramel brown the aroma hit you.  This potion smelled like pancakes and syrup and your mouth was watering.  Although your stomach was not as happy with the scent as it began to rumble uncomfortably.</span></div></div>",

You had the strangest feeling that she might have said yes were it not for the fact that she had her friend's wedding to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if she had some backup during it, she might not have shot you down so quickly. You began playing with some ideas on how you might help her out, even though she was a person you just met. You were in a magical shop, after all. Maybe Cleo had something you might be able to use. Maybe you might be able to mix some potion for yourself to help her out with the wedding. Or maybe...You could visit her in Dream Land to help take her mind off things like you had with Caitlyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do?</span></div></div>",

But if she came to the store once, surely she would come again someday, after all you did provide excellent customer service you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the next day the blue eyed beauty came back to the store and the potion department still manned by you.  With a bit of a frown she put the potions you had made her the other day onto the counter.  \"Was something wrong with the potions Layla?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes raised a bit in surprise, \"Oh, you remembered me, how nice.  No, there isn't a problem with the potions, at least for me.  My friend is in full bridezilla mode and apparently having a 'handsome parent with an stupid pirate eyepatch' would draw too much attention away from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to give you a hook hand instead?\"  You jokingly ask and thankfully Layla chuckled at your quip, \"I'd absolutely love to try that, but sadly not for the wedding.  Just give me a simple 30 year age up, some grey streaks of hair, and...I want something unique but not something that will draw attention away from bridezilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some bad breath.  Nobody will be looking too much at you, but if you go as her dad you get to give her a unpleasant surprise during the father/daughter dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla's eyes lit up, \"Oh I like that.  It also settles which gender I'll go as for the wedding.  I've still got the sex change potion you gave me yesterday so it's perfect thanks...I'm sorry I didn't catch you name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack!  I'm Jack.\"  You say eagerly and you brush past your own boobs when you offer to shake her hand, \"Well, I guess it's Jaclyn for the next 9 months.\"  You add as you put the ingredients in the Self-Stirring Cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla's eyes seem to smile, man those things are so beautiful they're almost hypnotic, \"Oh my God, congratulations!  I'm sure you'll be a wonderful parent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\"  You say blushing, but as the potions continued brewing you decided to be brave and go for it again.  \"So...do you have a date for this wedding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla seemed a bit surprised by the question, \"Well, I actually don't right now.  I just broke up with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and have been too busy helping with this wedding to bother looking for a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you didn't feel like going stag to this wedding, I think I can get time off, if you wanted a date you know.  Just saying.\"  You say trying to sound calm as your heart beat a million times a minute in your chest.  You just concentrated on Layla's eyes as you waited for an answer.</span></div></div>",

As the last customers of the day left you walked over to your mom in the clothing department.  Ellen smiled at you as she saw you browsing through dresses.  \"You've only been a girl a few days and you're already looking through dresses.  Would you like some help?  I've gotten pretty good at finding the right dress for the right girl.\"  She said as she shrunk and grew a hat in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom's words mostly went over your head, you just said, \"Find the fanciest dress I can.\"  You grabbed a blue one, it matched Layla's eyes and those were certainly on your mind.  Your mom looked over your shoulder and said, \"I don't think that will look good with your hair.  How about this green number over here?  Oh, this will be so much fun, I haven't gone dress shopping like this since Caitlyn started going through her punk phase a while back.  Why don't you grab a few different dresses and we'll go to the dressing room.\"  Your mom seemed excited or something, you just had to complete your goal.  \"Find the fanciest dress I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sweetie I heard you.\"  Your mom now had a more concerned look on her face, \"But let's have some fun and try on a few different things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just grabbed the blue one you had in your hand and slowly started walking to the door, \"Found the fanciest dress I can.\"  Now you just had to wait for the next day to drink the potions before the wedding like Layla told you.  Man you sure liked Layla, you'd do anything to get her to look at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man.  Um young lady, get back here and tell me what's going on.  Why are you acting so odd?\"  You ignored her, she doesn't matter now.  You didn't even notice your mom aiming her arm at you to make you shrink, but she hesitated, \"What if this effects the baby?  Oh, I can't risk it.  CLEO!\"  Your mom called out and appearing out of nowhere was your boss, you walked past but she got a good look into your eyes before she said, \"Damn it, I can't believe I didn't detect her.\"  You were about to open the door and leave the store forever, after all, why would you come back when you could just follow Layla around.  But Cleo grabbed an old bug spray atomizer and sprayed a purple mist into your face.  Suddenly thoughts of Layla went away and thoughts of wanting to throw up from the nasty spell replaced it.  You bent over dropping the dress and wretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleo, what the hell was that for?\"  You manage to say before going back to coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were under a thrall.  I should have detecting it happening, but sometimes people...or monsters get through my defenses.  Damn!\"  Cleo cursed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it?  What happened?  One second I was helping Layla with a potion and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next second you were about to be her slave.  Good thing your mom caught on because it would have been nearly impossible to help you once you were in her clutches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your mom who came in and gave you a big hug that felt very needed right now.  Ellen looked to Cleo, \"So, what do we do about this?  The girl who did this can't get away with it, she tried to take my baby and grand baby away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go to her!  Layla expects me to go to this wedding thing tomorrow.  I can show up and confront her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo frowned, \"You can go, but I'm going as back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen did something you'd never heard your mom do and she snarled, \"I'm going too and you can't stop me.  I'll show her what happens when you mess with my family.\"  And your mom shrank one of the potions Layla was going to make you drink and crushed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo sighed, \"Very well, all three of us are going tomorrow to confront her.  But Jack, you'll be on the front lines and you'll need a weapon to protect you.\"  Cleo went to the candy section by the cash register and grabbed something for you.</span></div></div>",

Cleo had done what she said and used potions and a few other magic tricks to turn herself into an older version of you.  She was currently with the wedding party pretending to still be hypnotized by Layla.  Meanwhile, you and your mom were in position.  You were in the back row of the oddly creepy looking gothic church where the wedding was taking place.  And instead of being in a suit or dress like most of the people there, you and your mom were wearing matching trench coats, fedoras, and sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know these things are magic and keep people from noticing us, but I still feel dumb.\"  You said looking around at all the well dressed guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I've been working in our clothing department for over a week now, I know that these are good stuff.  I just hope this goes well, I'd love to squish that Layla for what she did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to stay silent instead of actively approving or disapproving your mom's desire for vengeance.  Honestly you weren't sure you knew what you wanted to happen to Layla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of late comers entering the church the ceremony finally began.  You would think it was a normal wedding with normal music, normal patrons, the only difference was that when the bridesmaids came out, Layla the succubus was one of them.  You made sure to look away when you saw her, even if she couldn't really see you thanks to your disguises you didn't want to risk it.  Finally once everyone else was in their places, the bride came down the aisle with her 'mom'.  You had to admire how good Cleo was at looking like was hypnotized with the hollow look in her eyes.  But as they passed you, you noticed a piece of paper fall to the ground.  Knowing no one would notice you picked it up and showed it to your mom as you read the message you instantly knew was directed at you two.</span></div></div>",

You looked to your mom who was also eating non stop, although with her powers saw as she grew a turkey leg to be the size of her head before biting in and returning that lost mass right back into her.  You 'thankfully' had the benefit of a body that could magically adapt to anything.  Even as your stomach filled up, you could magically feel it stretching to make room for more, you stomach was getting bigger and bigger as the hours went by.  But you couldn't stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even tell if the wedding was still going on, you never saw anyone outside of your mom out of the corner of your eye since all you could look at was the damned never ending buffet table.  \"Curse the stupid bride!\"  You try to say, but it just comes out a garbled mess with a mouth full of buttery and cheesy mashed potatoes.  Was this the end?  The room seemed to be getting darker, was the sun going down?  You didn't even think you could sleep if you tried.  The bride had magically sentenced you to eat until you died, but thanks to you and your mom's powers you both could last who knows how long.  Maybe forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put your hand in a bowl to get as much gravy in your hand as possible, you suddenly saw a pale blueish face come out of the gravy.

She flew right into your growing frame and the next minute there was blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened on a flat black slab in what seemed to be a void.  \"I'm in the Dream World!\"  You said finally feeling free from the curse of gluttony.  \"Curse?  You're dealing with curses?  Good luck with that one.\"  You dream world fairy pal said offering you a smoothy of sparkles.  You turned it down, you didn't feel like you ever wanted to eat again after what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm here in the dream world, what can I do?  I can't visit anyones dream to tell them what's going on, I mean, Caitlyn is a baby still and mom and Cleo are fighting demons already and probably loosing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you just have to wait, give your ghost friend a few hours and hope she helps set things right.\"  The fairy said conjuring you up a bean bag chair made with jumping beans to relax in.  You tried to think of an alternative, but now it seemed all you could do was wait on Wilma and hope she helped you out of this.  So you sat back and relaxed for a few dream world minutes in order to give Wilma a few hours to save you.  Finally you had enough of waiting and you snap waking yourself up and pushing Wilma out.

You, on the otherhand, had put on a decent amount of excess weight. No big surprise there considering how much you had been shoveling down your gob before you let Wilma take over. It felt as if your boobs had gone up in size and you now had a distinct muffin top, as well as wider hips. You were going to be quite heavy soon if this continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all,\" said Layla. \"It's rude to point.

You were expecting to be led to another back room, but Cleo bent down and was turning the dial to a safe.  She opened the small metal box up and you bent down to look at the contents.  Inside the safe seemed to be a whole other room that was way to big to be on the other side of it, before you could ask what it was, Cleo gave you a firm but gentle push and you fell into the safe.  Sure enough you were inside a big metal room with all sorts of very dangerous looking items ranging from a sinister looking dagger, to a creepy looking giant black egg, and there was even some box with a bunch of wires on it in the middle of the room which had a clock on it.  Before you can examine anything you see Layla fall down on the ground beside you.  She shouted behind her, \"Watch it you old hag, that hurt!\"  But Cleo simply waved as she shut and locked the two of you in the Safe Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Layla, anything catch your eye?\"  You asked deciding as you put some Holy Water Taffy in your mouth.

On one side, you could see a small display of very curious statuettes.  Some were shaped like people while others were more abstract or even monstrous.  On the other side, a series of older looking paintings were hung on display.  Some looked like haunted victorian artwork straight out of a horror movie while others were abstract splashes of color that even from here gave you an odd sense of... change?  Artwork didn't normally speak to you like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was plenty more shelves past that to explore.  Where to check out?</span></div></div>",

Though you normally didn't have much of an interest in rings or necklaces, some of the items propped up for sale had certainly caught your eye with their unique designs and cheap price tags. Sure, some of them were plastic but they were no differently priced than the real deals. Or what seemed to be the real deal from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one ring that looked similar to those \"dice rings\" you had seen in conventions with Dungeons and Dragons shops. It was a single ring with three \"spinners\" on it. Two of them were labelled with increasingly larger numbers from 1 to 200 by powers of 5 on one and 50 to 500 by powers of 10 on the other. The third spinner had just two labels. M and F.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing to catch your eye was a golden amulet with a rather large ruby on it. Rubies were your birthstone and you always found them rather pretty. This particular gem was so large that it was almost prop sized. But the shine it gave told you it was real, even if you didn't quite believe the price tag. There was something odd about staring into the blood red jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the first two items you had in mind, though perhaps you could always look elsewhere...</span></div></div>",

The gem was almost hypnotic as it swayed back and forth. And back and forth. And--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found something interesting, I see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and looked up at the beaming face of Cleo grinning back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you said sheepishly looking away. You had the itch to purchase something and didn't want to admit it. \"How much for that ruby amulet? I know you said the first item is free, but I don't want to rip you off either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So considerate, much like your father. Don't fret though. It is an expensive item, but I can sense that it calls to you, doesn't it? In a way, I feel you are destined for this item and it for you. It would be vile of me as a business woman to go back on my word. Therefore, I give it to you on the promise that you wear it only when you get home. To not spoil the surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a little weird but you ended up agreeing. And before you knew it, Cleo had wrapped up the amulet in a small paper bag and sent you on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, kid. Do say hi to your mother for me, I'd love to see if she remembers me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged off the weird vibe Cleo was giving you as you returned to an empty house save for a note on the fridge. Apparently your mom and Caitlyn had gone out for lunch on the town. Another misguided attempt at mother/daughter bonding to mend their frayed relationship. Things had been taxing for them lately and you tried to keep out of it as best you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you popped some frozen burritos in the microwave and scurried over to the bathroom, the amulet still in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing your business, you paused at washing your hands in the mirror and recalled Cleo's words. She was quite insistent that you only wear it when you got home, which was strange. But now that you were home alone, you could obey her one request. You grabbed the golden chains and hoisted them around your neck before locking them in place with a satisfying click. The ruby then dangled in front of your chest, proudly. Almost like it was glowing. You half expected something interesting to happen the way Cleo was pitching it to you. But that might have just been her sales personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned to the mirror though, you noticed something odd about your reflection.</span></div></div>",

A shiny bauble and nothing more? No, everything in my store has some level of magic to it, depending on what catches your interest. I\u2019ve found that often my items tend to call to people in specific ways, like they have a mind of their own. That amulet you took, for example, once belonged to a beautiful Irish lass and left traces of her behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are you saying?\u201d you asked, looking down at the glowing red amulet still clutched in your hands. \u201cThat wearing this thing will...What? Turn me into her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a way! I see you at least discovered most of its effects on your own. And, as you know, it returns you to normal with no consequences the moment you remove the amulet. I\u2019m surprised you weren\u2019t the least bit curious to see the full transformation, it\u2019s really quite an experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d you said, though not denying that you were a little bit curious yourself now that you knew it was easily reversed. \u201cWhat makes you think I want a dangerous thing like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want it, you\u2019re welcome to give it back. I\u2019m happy to do a trade in for something else, now that you know my stock is magical. Maybe we can find something that catches your eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a moment. It wasn\u2019t so bad to have this item in hand. Heck, something about the idea of being someone else, even a girl, was a little bit exciting to you. Though perhaps it couldn't hurt to have a test performed on someone that wasn't you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there might be even more magical goodies to consider, now that you knew Cleo was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

And I'm starting to get the feeling that you might know something about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she sounded coy even over the phone. \"Tell you what, if you manage to make it over to my store fully transformed into the Irish girl, I'll tell you everything I know about your father. Even his dirty little secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed and pondered that thought. Your father's disappearance had always left a gaping hole in your family, despite your mom's best attempts to move on. It was like he was just wiped off of the face of the earth overnight, no traces and no clues to his whereabouts. This lady, Cleo, was the first lead anyone had in ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Not to mention, you were a little excited at the idea of becoming someone else still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you soon,\" replied Cleo before hanging up, as if she knew what your answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and put down the phone, your stomach growling as you grabbed your plate of now cold burritos and angrily munched on them. Your mom and sister would be out for a couple more hours, leaving you enough time to change and make your way to the shop and back. The last thing you wanted was to see them freak out over a strange girl suddenly appearing in your house. With the amulet in hand, you finished your lunch and made your way to your bedroom where there was a full length mirror from which you could watch the transformation. You took one last look at your reflection before slipping the clasp around your neck and locking it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, the changes started with the very top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could watch the beginnings of your hair's new scarlet hue as it came it from your roots to the very tips of your formerly brown hair. When you were sporting a complete ginger color, there was an itch in your scalp as the changes crept forward. It was like someone was gently tugging at your hair, stretching it out so it became longer and longer. You grabbed a handful and felt how soft and smooth your new hair was. Whoever this Irish lass was, she had a wonderful head of hair. Within the total span of about two minutes, you were back to where you had left off with a fiery red hairstyle that went down to your neck and looked like a wig on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you whispered to yourself. \"Now what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came with a slight tingle in your face, the transformation evidently was working for your head down the rest of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invisible hands that had grown out your hair were now working on kneading your face in what almost felt like a facial massage. Though you could see your face contort and bubble, it didn't feel painful in the slightest. In fact, it felt rather pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as your face's overall shape changed first, going from a pointed and hard chiseled and masculine look to something rounder. And softer. Your cheeks swelled up next, looking full and plumper followed by your lips which inflated larger into a smile. Your nose flattened into a cute button nose as your eyes became bigger with longer lashes and thinner brows. All the while your skin paled and became smooth to the touch as you raised a hand to confirm that you were indeed witnessing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of wearing the amulet, any traces of Jack Richmond were gone from the neck up. In his head's place was a very comely and beautiful girl with glowing red hair and skin as white as snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" you said in a distinctly higher pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the invisible hands work their way down your throat, smoothing your Adam's apple and compressing the muscles in your neck. There was no stopping it, though you knew you could remove the necklace at any time and undo everything. It occurred to you that, while you knew the Irish lass was a redhead and beautiful, you had no idea what kind of body she had as the tingling spread from your neck to your shoulders, pressing them inwards and losing more of your muscle mass which caused your T-shirt to loosen. You hoped you could find clothes that would fit the new you. Maybe borrowing some from your sister...Or your mom if you ended up on the large side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of body shape would you end up having?</span></div></div>",

It got down to your hands as you held them up and studied them as your fingers became smaller and daintier. In fact, every part of your upper body seemed to be following suit  in constricting on itself as your breathing quickened. You took deep gulps of air as you felt your stomach concave and get shallower, like the invisible hands had grasped your tightly and squeezed you like a bottle of shampoo. Around the ten minute mark and you were looking distinctly female in shape from the waist up, leaving your shirt dangling over your shoulder from your lost body mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, of course, it didn\u2019t stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your intestines tie themselves into a knot as the workings of your inner body made way for some new features as well as discarding some old ones. You gasped as you reached down and discovered the last parts of your gender slip away as your hips flared. The hands treated you to a massage that left your legs wobbling as they lost the mass of your muscles from soccer. All the while you grabbed hold of your jeans to keep them at your waist as the tingling trailed down to your feet. You watched as your toes shriveled up deeper into your socks as you dropped a few shoe sizes. Then the tingling faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into the mirror at yourself. The person looking back at you had a distinctly female shape with your skinny waist and bigger hips. Though you admitted you were somewhat disappointed. You still had your old height of 5\u201910 and little other in the way of curves to speak of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look like a stick,\u201d you said, shuffling around in front of the mirror trying to get a better look at yourself. This was going to take a lot of getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t given long though as you felt an immense pressure suddenly on your shoulders and then all around you. It was like the invisible hands were trying to squeeze you into a small box and your body was obeying it like playdough. Your field of vision lurched violently downwards as you disappeared into your shirt from the sudden drop. It occurred to you what was happening next. You were shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pants dropped to the floor, there no longer being any support for them with so much less of you. The entire world around you seemed to grow and look so huge from your new perspective. And every time the pressure stopped and you thought it was over, it happened again and you shrunk to lower heights. You could only stand there, your T-shirt serving as a massive dress to cover your body as you felt smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, it too did pass and you stood frozen for a moment, adjusting to your new height before going for a tape measurer by stepping out of your fallen underwear and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c4\u20198!?\u201d you squeaked. \u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m a freaking midget at this height!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weird as it was to be child sized, it was actually kind of thrilling too. You looked in the mirror and saw would could only be described as a tiny redheaded fairy girl, dainty and small. It was going to be impossible to find something that would fit you at this size in the house. But you had to make due in order to sneak over to Cleo\u2019s. You suddenly felt very vulnerable at this size and height, though you supposed you could take off the amulet at any time and undo it all.

You pressed a hand to your own cheek to feel if what you were seeing was happening to you, but that wasn't the case. You didn't think it would be, considering you couldn't feel what you were witnessing. And what you were witnessing was your reflection morphing into an entirely new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in awe as your slim face and features bloated outwards into rather chubby cheeks including dimples. Your thin nose flattening into a more button shape as even your eyes took a different shape and color, an eerie green. You watched your brown hair grow out and burn into a vibrant red. Most of all were the rather shapely melons forming on your chest, stretching out the T-shirt you were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, there was a rather shapely looking young redheaded woman smiling back at you.

I can't exactly take control of anything if the body I'm using doesn't match my own. Or my former body, at least. The amulet you're wearing is sort of like a conduit between me and you. I can funnel my essence through it and into you, but to do that I require a significant amount of energy. Your body's energy. Or, at least, that's what the old woman told me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The old woman? You mean Cleo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cleo...Yes, that was her name. You know, she might not look it but she's far older than she appears. Much older than me, even!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou supposed you shouldn't have been surprised that the lady who gave you a necklace with a possessing ghost wasn't exactly what you could call normal. You were certainly going to have some questions for her about giving away such a dangerous item for free, if this ghost had been the vindictive sort you could have found yourself in a lot of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Anyway</i>, continued the ghost girl. <i>What I'm going to do is channel my essence into your body borrowing its natural energy. You're going to feel very tired while this happens, like you're running a marathon, so it will happen slowly. The more of my essence that goes into you, the more of me will start to manifest with your body. It will take some time for the first changes to happen, but once they start it will get easier! If you ever want to stop, just remove the amulet. That will cancel the conduit, but it will take almost an equal amount of time to start changing back to your old self. Your body has to expel my essence, after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" you muttered, not one to argue with the logic of magic. \"I'm suddenly feeling very hungry. Have you been doing this the whole time already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't not not do it. It's all an unconscious effect. But yes, we've already begun since the moment you put on the amulet.

Though even as you munch on them, you found that they weren't doing much to fill you up. Apparently, Alice wasn't lying when she said she was going to use a lot of her natural energy to mold you into her image. As you scoured the cabinets in search of more easy foods, you had to wonder what that meant. What it would be like to have her body. You assumed you would still have some level of control. And who knows? Maybe you might even like being a girl, at least for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you crunched on some BBQ chips, your body began to feel tired, like you had gone jogging. Something was clearly going on inside of you as you wondered briefly what would change about you first.</span></div></div>",

You were like a vacuum cleaner and all you found you wanted to do was stand in front of the fridge and chow down. But before you could begin on that feast, you felt a little tingle in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack? Can you hear me like this?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"Alice?\" you called out to the thin air. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded almost like she was moaning, or she was in a dizzying spell that left her almost at a loss for words. <i>I think...I think it's starting. I can feel myself flow into you. It's really...It's really intense to suddenly just feel again. I can't...I can't hold it back any longer!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the distinct sound of someone in an extreme pleasure as you were suddenly overcome with the same intense arousal. For a moment, you and Alice felt connected as one entity as you instantly began to harden and your eyes rolled back into your head. Your hands unconsciously traveled to your chest as you began panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can feel them</i>, Alice said as you grasped your suddenly tender nipples. <i>They're so...They're so big!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began rubbing your chest, you felt a bit more weight to them with more to grab. You managed to look straight down at two unfamiliar bulges beneath your shirt. Then, after an intense wave of pleasure, they seemed to grow just a little bit bigger. Your legs buckled as you collapsed onto the floor of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack, I'm sorry,</i> Alice said between noises of pleasure. <i>I'm sorry that I'm so big.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be...Sorry,\" you said, one hand on your budding and the other in your pants. \"This feels...Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good...Cause I...Can't hold it back any longer!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you hit a climax, your entire back arched as two giant breasts exploded from your chest, stretching the fabric of your shirt out instantly as they wobbled bralessly in place. You had shot up from a C Cup all the way to a G cup in a fraction of a second and were feeling the weight of them beneath your fingertips as they sunk into the fleshy mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" you groaned, looking down at the new cleavage you had now. \"I had no idea that was gonna be so intense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I didn't either. I'm so sorry, Jack. It was just the rush of having a body that pulled me in. I have no idea why it did my girls first. I guess I just miss having boobs with actual weight to them. It's been so long!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the mess you had made, you began to feel up your new assets. It was like having two melons glued to your chest, they were so weighty and firm. You tried to stand and felt them jiggle slightly as you rose. These breasts were yours and they were going to take some getting used to, not that it was a bad thing at all. Indeed, looking down you actually noticed that the sudden growth had split the neck of your shirt, ripping it slightly. Alice also must have noticed the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please don't be mad!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"I'm not mad,\" you said, holding your boobs in place as they wobbled around. \"But maybe we should...\"</span></div></div>",

At least when it comes to my boobs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you said, walking up the stairs as your chest bounce freely in place. \"You can feel them and nothing else? That's really strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've been disembodied for so long that it's hard to explain because it's normal to me at this point. I just sort of exist as a mind and nothing else. Giving even a piece of me back into the real world is beyond overwhelming to describe. I can feel my breasts wobble with every step you take even though I can't feel anything else. Would it be weird to say that it's kind of arousing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" you replied. \"You are pretty cute, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice laughed. <i>You're so sweet. If I wasn't borrowing your body, I'd totally go on a date with you to repay you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that,\" you said as you came upstairs and faced the various bedrooms. \"We should probably focus on getting some clothes before the next change happens. I kind of saw what you look like in the mirror, but can you give me an idea of your dimensions so I can scout around for clothes that fit us?\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nSure! I'm sure you noticed that I'm rather big, but I'm also a little shortie too! I'm around 4'10 when I last measured myself before I died and I weight about two hundred pounds. I had a waist of 48 inches and 42 G cup. Women's shoe size 5.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't kidding, it was no wonder your shirt had exploded from the pressure. It was just lucky it started with your chest or your pants might have exploded with how wide her hips were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the only person I can think of near that is my mom. Though you're even shorter than she is. Wow, that's kind of weird to think about that I'll drop a whole foot in height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It will be gradual,</i> Alice assured you. <i>I want to see what pretty outfits your mom has for now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou licked your lips and stepped inside your mother's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first step was removing your tattered T-shirt and finding a bra. Unfortunately, your mom was a 38 E cup and just a little too small for your new bust. But it was better than nothing for now until you could properly shop for something more fitting of Alice's body. She helped by directing you in your head on how to clip the bra on and eventually get settled, though she always seemed to purr whenever your hands touched your chest. The process was pretty stimulating for you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was going through your mom's wardrobe for something Alice would like wearing. As you stood wearing nothing but pajama pants and a bra, you spent the next half an hour sorting through the many clothes your mother had collected over the years. After still moving in, her closet was in disarray too, which made the searching more tedious. But it made Alice happy and that made you happy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to make you too uncomfortable and she settled on a grey dress with black stockings, which was simple enough for you to figure out. The dress did not work for someone without hips like yourself, but you could see Alice fully dressed in the same outfit as you looked over in the mirror. And you had to admit that the material was soft and very comfortable to the touch, and made your boobs really stand out nicely.

I think I feel another change coming on soon, don't you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, your stomach groaned. You were already completely empty with Alice having sapped all the energy you had just consumed thirty minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe after I fill up,\" you answered. \"We're going to run out of food at this rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe we'll have to buy some more. I can't wait to see what changes next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit that you couldn't either.

The skin beneath the dress you were wearing was feeling softer and more malleable like clay. Suddenly, you heard the cracking of bones as your whole perspective lurched downwards ever so slightly. And then again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack, I think we're shrinking...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a couple of inches, but Alice was indeed correct. The tight dress you were wearing was beginning to feel a little bit more loose as the bones in your torso rearranged themselves and your spine compressed to match someone more Alice's size. You breathed in deep as your shoulders pressed inwards and stayed slimmer, giving you a daintier build which only highlighted how massive your breasts looked. You felt another drop as you lost another inch as all your excess mass seemed to settle in your stomach, which was now feeling a little bloated. You grabbed handfuls of new fat as Alice groaned in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god, I have a torso again. I can feel everything...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pop as you dropped another inch, bringing your height down to 5'6. If Alice was right, you'd still have eight inches to lose and you imagined most of that would be when your legs started changing. You shivered as you pressed down at your throbbing member, determined not to soil your mother's dress. You breathed in deeply with Alice's smaller lungs, giving you a slight shortness of breath. This was going to take some getting used to, but you liked the idea of becoming more compact and smaller. And your added gut gave your boobs someplace to rest on slightly, as it jutted out a good inch than what you were used to. Your skin on your chest felt so much softer than your arms', you couldn't help but rub yourself all over which sent Alice into her on tizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on, Jack. That feels really nice but we should stop. For now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obeyed her commands, realizing how much your gut was growling. \"I guess it's time to feed it more if we want to keep this going. But there's a bit of a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We're out of food?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a new house, so mom hasn't actually been around to do the shopping.

You licked your chops as you crept out the front door, hoping to see what Hannah had in store for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was your next door neighbor and had a big personality, despite being one who was so short. Like your mother and Alice, she was on the larger side though probably closer to Alice in shape and weight. In fact, she and Alice would probably suit each other quite well if they ever met. And perhaps they might if Alice would make good on her baking promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts wobbled around as you made your way over the bush separating your two properties. Hannah lived in a quaint two bedroom home and had often invited you over many times since you arrived. Of course, you had never taken her up on her offer yet. She didn't appear to be home as you snuck over to her window and pried it open. You had to jump up a little bit higher than you were used to given your stunted state. And all the physical activity had left you with shortness of breath. But luck was on your side as you landed right in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot,\" you said as you made your way to the pantry, licking your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had a rather simple setup with a lot of appliances around from the 90's but still looked to work just fine. She certainly kept a full stock compared to your diminished kitchen back home, with shelves worth of jarred and boxed goods that you wouldn't have to cook. Your stomach gurgled as you grabbed the nearby container of chocolate pretzels. Alice's tiny heart was beating a mile a minute as you gorged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Hannah was in fact as she had heard a noise and walked into the kitchen to investigate. What series of events would unfold as a result?</span></div></div>",

What on earth are you wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun around to greet the disturbance with a mouthful of sweets only to completely forget about the new breasts you were sporting, which wobbled with the sudden motion. Hannah, your neighbor, was standing there dressed in rather casual clothes of jeans, a black top, black boots, and a maroon jacket (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu8V8jVVYAAvQwa?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu8V8jVVYAAv...</a>). Her brown eyes bulged at the sight of you partially through your transformation into Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those...Are those real?\" she had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How rude</i>, Alice fumed inside your head. <i>I could ask her the same question!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true, Hannah was a big girl. Though she was also rather short too, though looking less so given your drop in height. It scared you a little bit that you might be looking up to her soon in due time. As you swallowed the remaining food in your mouth, you found your voice to quickly calm Hannah down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, I can explain everything...Though you're not going to believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs so you came clean as to what you were doing while you continued to chow down on whatever was at your disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't believe you at first, of course. Alice was a voice in your head after all, and it was hard for her to just example everything she had already told you. But it was hard to argue with the facts that you were a few inches shorter and had the chest to prove it. By the end of it, Hannah had calmed down a little bit. In fact, she seemed rather pleased by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's so kind of you, Jack! To let a ghost like that get a few more moments of living again. Aren't you uncomfortable like that though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little hard to breathe,\" you admitted. \"And the extra weight is...Different. But it feels really good when it happens. I just need to keep stuffing myself to make it happen faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm happy to provide that and give a good excuse to your mother until you're ready to turn back. You just have to take off the necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Alice is essentially the necklace, so removing it should cut her off from me. Keeping it on is what allows for the changes to happen though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack...Speaking of changes, I think we're about ready for what's next.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you felt a pleasurable tingle run through your body as your toes curled. What would be next, you wondered?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sensual sensation ran up from your chest to your arms. Your arms had been a bit of an eyesore now that your torso had changed to match the dress you had borrowed. They were muscular and bulky things that weren't delicate looking in the slightest. Most of all, with your shortened chest, they dangled further than usual like you were a gorilla. That was soon all to change, however, as you looked down at your biceps which appeared to be bulging more than usual like you were flexing. They got bigger and bigger until they reached their limit. Then it was like someone was letting the air out of a balloon, there was a slight hiss sound as you watched your muscles begin to shrink away until they were non-existent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had been watching the change in your arms with a strange and quiet fascination as they turned into sticks. You tried to flex a bit, but there was just nothing to show off. You felt weaker but at the same time it was also like the most pleasant massage you had ever been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's safe to say my arms are what's changing next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't kidding,\" Hannah replied. \"This is really happening to you. That's so weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot as weird as the feeling when your arms started to shorten. It felt as if they were being pulled back into your shoulders as you held them out and watched your reach get shorter until you lost about a good half a foot. At least it made your upper body more proportional with itself. The sleeves of your dress were now starting to feel very loose indeed, though that wasn't to last for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, it felt like your arms were two balloons only this time they were filling with air. Or fat, as you had come to realize with Alice's body. While in front of Hannah, you had to keep from moaning which was quite difficult. Feeling yourself get bigger and bigger was always kind of a rush, though this was followed by a strange numbing sensation as your arms settled into the same shape and size of Alice's when she saw her in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all there is to it,\" you said to Hannah. \"We've been at this for the last three hours or so. It's safe to say we still have a long way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to keep going until you turn completely into her? That's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at least pleased that Hannah was on your side in all this, though she was always a bit of a strange one. Deep down, you wondered if she was just lonely and the idea of having another lady her size was appealing to her, even if it was through magical means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were lost in thought, something strange happened. Your arms lifted up on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack</i>, Alice said in your head. <i>Look! I can control them! I have arms!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you weren't quite as excited with that prospect as she was, given that it was slowly dawning on you that you were losing control of your own body. You always sort of thought you would be the one driving and Alice would get to experience things through your eyes. You found that you could still move your arms, but there was another force fighting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack? Is something wrong?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little...Surprised is all,\" you answered her. \"I guess I didn't really consider that you would be able to control my body too. Well, our body, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, after we fully transform into me...</i></span></div></div>",

Alice didn't even try to stop you as you removed it from your person. You felt a strange sensation of relief at that, though your body didn't turn back to normal. You were still shortened in the torso, had a chubby belly, thick arms, and of course a massive bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice?\" you called out, only your head was being quiet. It was like her presence had vanished entirely. \"Of course...She's trapped in the necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at the sadly blinking ruby amulet in the palm of your hands. You had forgotten Hannah was even there until she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help but overhear,\" she said to you. \"But it sounds like in order to bring this Alice girl back, you need to be willing to not exist for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you replied with a sigh. \"I feel bad. I want to help her I just...Don't know if I'm willing to go <i>that </i>far for a complete stranger. She said I'd get complete control again if she ever removes the amulet. I just don't know if I can trust her with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if you trust me?\" Hannah offered. \"What if I kept an eye on things to make sure that she doesn't go running off with your body, not saying she would. Or, better yet, why don't I wear the amulet for you instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that? But then the same thing will happen to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind. She can't be wearing the necklace forever. Besides, it gets lonely here all by myself. I could use the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck a nerve on your pride that Hannah was being braver than you about all this. You had been in a hurry to allow Alice to share your body, what was the issue with letting the ghost girl have a ride for a little while after being trapped in an amulet for a century? Maybe there was a better way to get her a body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

As the ruby fell between your breasts, you heard a familiar voice chime in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Jack,</i> Alice sounded to be on the verge of tears if she was even able to cry. <i>Thank you so much for trusting me. I swear, I'll let you be the one driving until the changes are fully.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" you replied. \"I'm sorry for freaking out like that. I guess now I just realize we jumped into this without much planning. We should probably set some terms. How long do you want my body for, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh...I hadn't really given it much thought. Even a little bit of freedom for a little while would be amazing, I'll take whatever you're willing to give me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried by how long this is taking and if my mom will start wondering where I am. People are going to start to question where I've gone if it takes almost half a day to become you and then turn back into me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said,\" Hannah interrupted. \"I can help with that, leave it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hannah pulled out a cellphone as if from nowhere and began dialing a number in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Ellen? It's Hannah, from across the street. Listen, do you mind if I borrow your son Jack for the weekend? I need a strapping young man for a house project I'm helping a friend in a neighboring town with. He'd have to spend the nights though and I'm willing to pay him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of money, you could hear your mom's tone instantly changed to pleased. She had already been badgering you to get a summer job. And if Hannah was serious about money then you'd essentially be getting paid for letting Alice screw around with your body. You wondered what Hannah got out of all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! I'll send him home Monday morning without a hair out of place on his head. Ta ta!\" Hannah hung up with the most coy grin on her face. \"There we go. Problem solved for the both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And the process should get easier each time we do it,</i> Alice added. <i>If you want to, I mean. The more you wear my amulet, the more I'll get used to your body and we'll be able to switch back and forth quicker. You may even be able to control it with time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that works,\" you said, feeling a little better with a plan in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Hannah said. \"We should probably get you some food as to speed things along. Alice, you can hear me, right? Do you think you can focus on which part of Jack will get changed next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not sure. I can try.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she can try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would be a dear, I'd like it if you could focus on...\"</span></div></div>",

I have makeup to pretty your face and no one is really going to bat an eye that you're not as...Endowed as you are in the chest department. If I had a wig, we could make do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you had to ask, a funny feeling running down your back. \"Why would I even need a disguise when I thought we were waiting until Alice had a complete body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you silly, boy. I'm going to help you with that, for certain. But I'm not doing it for free. If I'm going to pay you then you're going to have to do a little work. And what I want most of all is a friend. If you want your cash, then the least you can do is a little of the work and not leave it all to poor Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on, Jack,</i> Alice urged you on in your head. <i>This could be fun!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to disagree though you weren't as you stopped in place. The strangest feeling of pleasure erupted through your head, like someone was giving you the most enjoyable scalp massage you had ever received. You stifled a moan as your felt your hair begin to tickle the tops of your ears and then cover them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had a nearby mirror which allowed you to observe the changes being done to you from a reflection. Your brown hair was expanding, like time was passing in the blink of an eye. Thick locks of brunette snakes curled down to your shoulders before they settled in the style you had seen in the mirror before when you were talking to Alice. It didn't stop there though as a spicy tingle grew from the roots. You could see the brown of your hair burn away into a more vibrant scarlet hue. When it was finished, you looked as if you had put on a wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my word,\" said Hannah, putting a hand to her mouth. \"You have the most beautiful hair I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" you asked Alice. \"You said that you needed food to fuel the transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hair isn't too hard to do if I can focus</i>, Alice replied. <i>Your hair grows naturally, after all. All I have to do is influence a little bit. As for energy...I don't know. It's getting so much easier now. Maybe that's a sign that we're becoming more compatible!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't quite sure what to make of that, though you supposed it was a good thing that things were getting easier. All this eating was making things inconvenient for you, and you could still feel your tummy rumbling and demanding food. You were denied, however, by Hannah who grabbed a hold of your wrists, which had been shrunken from the changes to your arms. You gulped as you suddenly realized that Hannah was taking you to put some makeup on to disguise yourself better when out on the town together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was where she planned on taking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discovered that she was taking you...</span></div></div>",

It's been so long since I've had a gal pal to hang around with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were having a hard time keeping happy for Hannah as she continued to prod your face with various unknown implements. You were still getting used to the heavier feeling on your head from your new hair, which Hannah had done up in a bun to keep it out of your face. Everything was starting to feel different and you were starting to become very conscious of the fact that in time you were no longer going to have any control of your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah leaned back with a smile and reached for a mirror. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to believe that the person looking at you in the mirror was actually you. You had seen Youtube videos before where guys were given complete makeovers by their girlfriends to a scarily transformative degree. This was the case here, though you didn't look quite like Alice given your different facial structures did you did look distinctly female. Especially with your new assets and hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my gosh,</i> Alice cooed in your head. <i>Jack, you look so pretty!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to match the dress you're wearing, at least,\" Hannah added. \"Now I don't know about you, but I'm craving Italian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you were dragged along outside in public as you were in mid-transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you were thankfully you were largely unrecognizable to everyone else. Even though you were new in town, the last thing you wanted to do was having everyone think you were some sort of freak, despite your enjoyment of it so far. You had always been a shy guy who didn't like drawing attention to himself. Hannah, on the other hand, was the loud and proud sort. You two were total opposites in that regard and it was a little awkward to be around her, especially with all the stares you were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta show off the goods a little, Jackie,\" said Hannah, who had pulled her shirt down a little to expose her cleavage. \"Guys tend to like that and give you stuff for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt caused you to gawk when she managed to get an entire appetizer at no cost just by winking at your waiter. You immediately started to dig in, because you were famished. Alice seemed to be building up for another transformation sooner rather than later. There was no telling just how much of you would be left by the end of the meal given you had ordered two entrees. You couldn't help but feel the waiter give you a passing look as you finished your plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's interested in you,\" Hannah commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you couldn't help but blush at that. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you should go talk to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still sound like myself,\" you protested. \"Besides...I wouldn't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't worry, Jack! </i>Alice piped. <i>I can feel enough energy now to try something new! Let me just focus and...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't stop either of them as a familiar tingle ran through your whole body, causing you to shift in your seat and hold back a moan.

That's when you realized what was to change about you this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, fiddlesticks,</i> Alice cursed before she moaned. <i>Sorry, Jack. I thought I had a handle on it this time...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't left with any room to argue with her without looking crazy talking to yourself in public. And while your hips began to flare out, you wanted to draw as little amount as your lower half began to transform. You weren't getting any shorter, but you were growing much, much wider as the once loose dress began to fill out quite rapidly. As you knew from the mirror, Alice was distinctly pear shaped, even with her massive chest. You could feel your hips get wider and wider, digging into the panties you had grabbed from your mother which you now realized were a few sizes too small. Worse, these changes being so close to your more...erogenous places had complicated matters somewhat and you had to bite your lip to keep from making any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only grabbed onto your seat as you were taken on the ride of your life. Somehow, this was getting even <i>more </i>intense with each passing change. Hannah must have seen that you were being quiet as she raised an eye and looked under the table before realizing what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" she whispered as she leaned in close to you. \"Well, you certainly have a womanly shape now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true. With your hair and breasts combined with this most recent transformation, it was hard to call you anything else but female. There were still elements of you left, namely your hands, your legs, your feet, your face, and your throbbing member. With how tight your dress now was on you, it was very hard to disguise how aroused you were by all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think talking to him is such a good idea right now,\" you replied. \"These clothes are starting to feel a little tight on me now. My mom was a little chubby but not like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just have to fix that then, won't we? I know what we can do next! Clothes shopping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very hard to say no to Hannah, but at least you could avoid making a fool of yourself by flirting with the waiter. You couldn't help but notice him staring at your newfound hips as you both went to leave. Walking around like this made things even stranger as you now had to constantly worry about bumping into things from behind. Your ass was sticking out a good half foot and, while that certainly made for comfortable seating, it was awkward to waddle around like this without swaying your hips in every direction. No wonder girls tended to walk like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you reached the store Hannah was dragging you to, a Torrid that had happened up in the local mall, your stomach was already starting to grumble again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you a new outfit that fits!\" said Hannah as she pulled you through the mall. \"What are you in the mood for? Something sexy? Casual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth watered as you passed by a hot pretzel stand. \"Umm...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm hungry again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Hannah stopped at the pretzel stand and pulled out her wallet with a smile. \"Casual it is! I'll even treat you for this too. Do you happen to know what Alice's sizes are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, 48 inches waist and 42 G cup. Women's shoe size 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, girl! You're bigger than I am! We'll have to get something that fits just perfectly then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were given a bag of cinnamon dusted pretzels to tide the butterflies in your stomach over, though even you were aware that the more you ate the quicker you sped along to disappearing. It was actually getting rather harder to move your body, almost like there was a lag to its commands. It made you wonder if Alice was secretly controlling things as to not make you feel scared. You had to admit it felt nice being like this though. Every step sent jiggles down your body to all the right places. All the more reason to get a change of clothes quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah immediately took over the shopping, with Alice throwing her helpful ideas which you would broadcast. You were far more distracted with filling your stomach, though every bite you seemed to take only made you hungrier. You weren't even paying much attention to what Hannah was picking out for you until your bag of pretzels was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Hannah said, handing you a big pile of clothes. \"Go on into the changing room and put these on. Alice, do give him a hand with things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Will do!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped into the changing room, you stripped out of mom's far too small clothes and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had even gone so far as to get you panties, which were black silk and annoyingly comfortable, even in your aroused state. The bra you had trouble with again, though Alice took over and assumed control to guide you. You had to admit it was bizarre watching your arms move entirely on their own, though you had to control your hands and fingers at her command. Once that was down came on the stockings again, pure black until the other pair you had borrowed from mom. Then you could finally get a look at the outfit Hannah had chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a polka dot heart dress, black and white, with a leather belt cinch for around the torso. You threw it over your head and were a little embarrassed by how nicely it hung to your curves, showcasing every part of you like a perfect fit. It even came with a black cardigan that slipped comfortably over your swollen arms. As you stood to face the mirror, you had to admit that the girl you were becoming was very pretty. Even if her dress was a little short on her.

This is the happiest day of my...Oh!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your perspective lurch slightly downwards. This had happened once before when your torso had changed, which led you to glance down at your legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's happening, Jack! We're shrinking again! Oh, it will be so nice to be at normal size and not a giant! No offense, Jack.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou weren't given much leeway to argue as you had to bite your lips to keep from moaning, though that didn't control your hands which were rubbing all the way down your hips. You could hear your bones cracking and snapping to morph themselves into a small shape all the while your eyesight dropped lower and lower. The dress which had hugged around your thighs now skidded down past your knees to properly fit you. As the shrinking stopped, you felt the world wobble into place followed by the sound of creaking fabric. Your stockings were starting to fill up around your calves, which inflated with fat until they matched the rest of your chubby legs. You gulped at the sight of yourself, having shrunk from 5'10 to your new height of 4'10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to drive home the point of how small you now were, when you stepped out of the changing room you found yourself having to look up at Hannah instead of down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh,\" she said, covering her mouth. \"You look so adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt quite exposed indeed as she reached down and grabbed you by the wrist, now able to pull you around effortlessly with your shrunken stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! I got you some proper fitting shoes for when your feet change so you don't have to waddle around in clunky men's feet. Let's go pay and move onto the next thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered to think what the next thing would even be as Hannah range up the clothes you were wearing and escorted you out into the rest of the mall. You weren't sure how this could get even more embarrassing until you both ran into someone you knew. That person happened to be...</span></div></div>",

It was higher and girlish, though not quite Alice's yet either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we just stopped to eat but here. I brought this for snack runs when I'm a little peckish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah reached into her handbag and brought out a candy bar. Your mouth immediately watered as your hands moved on their own, almost shoving the sweet in your mouth before you could even open the wrapper. You knew that this was only going to speed things up faster, but you didn't care. It was all starting to feel so good, like your body was becoming numb to pleasure. All that was left of you was your hands, your feet, your gender, and your face. The body you were in was completely foreign to you otherwise and it was wonderful, minus the stares of course. You weren't used to such attention brought on yourself being a girl of significant \"assets\" which were jiggling with every step. The world was looking so much bigger and more intimidating now that you were pint sized. Everyone was like a giant next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to suck on the chocolate and nuts, you were stopped by Hannah who still had you by the wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be! Look who it is. Caity, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically swallowed the entire candy bar whole at the sight of your little sister, though she wasn't so little anymore. You had become quite adjusted to looking down at your sister, who was 5'4. In your new stunted state, however, you found you were at chest level with her. She was in her punk phase, with black hoodie of some band and shredded jeans. You immediately turned away from her. Though you didn't think you could be recognized in such a body, there was still your face even if it was covered in makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Caitlyn waved unsurely. \"Uh, hi. Hannah, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you remember! Though, I suppose it's no surprise since you haven't come to visit me yet. And this here is Alice, my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed the rest of the candy bar as your sister offered her hand to shake. Was she going to notice that you had mannish hands if you accepted it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hang on, Jack,</i> Alice called in your head. <i>I'll fix you up in a jiffy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip to keep from moaning as you felt your hands bubble and shrink. Your fingers were turning squat and small as the bones cracked to match a more dainty appearance. For added measure, your fingernails became polished and cleaned as they turned into the hands of a girl just as you accepted Caitlyn's shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" you whispered shyly, your voice even higher now. \"I'm Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlyn gave you a look now that you were directly facing her. She paused slightly as if she had noticed something before completing the shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, I'm Caitlyn. Hannah's new neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we're all friends, do you want to join us, Caity? We were just about to go out on the town for some shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Caitlyn agreed, you couldn't help but notice that she continued to hide her stares at you. It was almost like she was looking at your face, did she perhaps detect traces of your own face under the makeup? You could only hope now that you could find some more food and speed things up a bit more, even if it meant Alice would have even more control of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go,\" continued Hannah. \"I need to visit the little girl's room. Too much soda and all that. You don't mind waiting, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't even given the chance to object as Hannah disappeared into the restroom, leaving you alone with your sister. Had you been thinking clearly, you might have realized you could just follow her. But you were uncomfortable enough as it was without having to pretend to be normal in a girl's bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you were behind with your sister's continued glancing at what you assumed to be your face. The awkward silence became almost unbearable as she tried to break the ice. Though in a way you did not expect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um...\"</span></div></div>",

Granted, we're new in town so I guess that's not very fair of me to say. How old are you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>19,</i> Alice responded immediately. <i>Same as you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nineteen,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How do you know Hannah then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, uh, were in college together for my first semester and were roommates. Though Hannah left, but we still keep in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed like as good a lie as any. You weren't sure of Hannah's educational background, something that you'd have to remember to ask about later or tell her to play along. And since you were in college yourself, you could have an easy enough time coming up with a story to please your sister. You also decided to keep \"Alice\" in the same school as you in case Caitlyn started asking specific questions, like she was known for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty cool then. What college are you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Salem University.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even cooler! My brother is attending there! Have you ever heard of Jack Richmond?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pretty big campus and, no offense, but that's not exactly the most original name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlyn giggled slightly. \"True. I'd love to change it when I get older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eye at your sister. She never really giggled before and she was acting a bit funny around you. Was it because you were a fellow girl and not her bothersome older brother now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started asking all sorts of questions about college. You decided this was a good thing, because it meant that Alice, who was undoubtedly paying attention to all this, could get her story straight when she eventually took over the body, which you could feel was quite soon as your stomach began to rumble again. As it did, you could feel a tingling running down your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack,</i> Alice interrupted you. <i>The changes are happening much faster now! Our feet...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you could feel them. You were still wearing your old boy sneakers given that they still fit you, though that was beginning to change under the pressure of conversation with your sister. It felt like someone was giving you a full foot massage as you could hear the bones crack and shrink. You felt your toes no longer being able to touch the tops of your shoes as they began to shrivel away from Men's Size 12's to Women's Size 5's. Before long, you were like a kid dressed in his parent's shoes. And all that was left of the old you was your face and your member throbbing under your dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Hannah came out of the bathroom to rescue you. You called to her instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Han. Do you mind tossing me my new pair of shoes? These are giving me a blister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Hannah seemed to understand immediately. \"Of course! Here you are, Al.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had picked out for you a pair of matching black flats that fit perfectly, both on your new feet and the dress you were wearing. You were amazed at how easily your shrunken feet slid into them, it still flooring you how small you had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" said Hannah. \"Now that we're all refreshed, I wanted to check out one of the local shops that has a bunch of good antiques.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I come along?\" Caitlyn asked rather forwardly. \"I'm trying to escape mom and could use a...Distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled at Caitlyn as if she had noticed something. \"Of course! This'll be a fun end to a perfect girl's day out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did either of you know, the shop Hannah had in mind happened to be the very store which you had gotten this amulet in the first place. Cleo's Shop was bound to provide a further twist to your predicament, as you didn't know how to feel about your sister tagging along and why she kept staring at you. What you did know what that you were fast starting to lose feeling in the rest of your body. Indeed, your limbs were starting to move on their own ever so slightly, almost like Alice was the one really doing the driving and just pretending to let you drive, like a toddler given a steering wheel toy in the front seat. Even though you couldn't deny that it all felt nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at Cleo's shop...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your time in Cleo's shop was somewhat surreal, given your growing lack of control of your own body. It was kind of hard to explain, but you were sorting fading away into the background. You could still move and talk, but it was all like moving underwater and Alice's influence was more guiding you. Most of your responses to people were just parroting what she'd tell you to say because you couldn't really focus. Alice seemed to hold a particular interest in your sister too and you thought it was a good thing that the two could get along so well, given you were aping Alice's bubbly personality. From Cait's perspective, it must have just looked like Alice was simply getting more comfortable around her, little did you know how true that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued your hazy focus through the shop until one particular encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then. You seem to be coming along nicely, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun around to face the voice, only to find yourself staring at a very large set of breasts bundled up in a tight green sweater. She had red hair, close to Alice's own, and looked about thirty despite feeling like she was much older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleo?\" you asked with a distinctly female voice. \"You know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'm the one who gave you that amulet, after all. Don't you think I would recognize how you'd turn out? Speaking of which, hello Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello, Miss Shea.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"How are you liking having a body again, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, it's wonderful! The only issue is that poor Jack here has to stuff his face the whole time if we want to make any progress.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou weren't even wondering Cleo could see to hear Alice, despite her still talking in your head. Cleo frowned as she reached around in the pocket of the apron she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's no good. I had forgotten that the process for possession involves the use of natural energy. Here, try this on Jack. I know it's a little late, but call it a reward for your good deed in giving Alice another chance at life. If only for a short time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands weakly accepted what appeared to be a golden ring with an emerald gemstone that seemed to glow. Your hands seemed to move on their own as they placed the ring on your middle finger only for you to receive a sudden surge of energy. It was like you had suddenly been gifted all the power you might receive if you had eaten a full meal and slept for 12 hours straight. With what little you could still feel in your body, you felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ring is like a battery,\" Cleo explained. \"Instead of Alice feeding off your own energy, she can use that instead. It has enough power to turn you fully into her, but then you'll have to wait a day for it to recharge. Though you can still change through normal means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can feel it!</i> Alice called in your head. <i>I'm almost whole! Ooooh, it's coming!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to feel numb with pleasure as you leaned over on the counter of the store. There was a convenient mirror resting there and you could watch as beneath the makeup, your face was starting to bubble and reform itself. You could feel your cheeks swell out as a slight extra chin began to show itself. Your strong nose shrunk and became more bubble-like. Your lips inflated and grew fatter as you could feel the teeth inside your mouth arrange themselves and get smaller. The last thing to change was your eyes, which went from a plain brown to a blueish green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...You felt nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" your mouth moved on its own. \"Is this...Is this really real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" Cleo smiled from over your shoulder. \"Welcome back to the world of the living, Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. You were still here, it's just...You didn't have a body anymore. Or rather, the only part of you left didn't really have any brain, though you could still feel it throb beneath Alice's skirt. She had almost completely replaced you physically in the world and you were more like a hovering essence inside her head. Or your head. Or whatever the two of you had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had full control of everything and pressed her hands against her head, feeling herself all over. Cleo just sat back, looking quite pleased with her work that had resulted in making someone so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" she said. \"What are you going to do first now that you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could sense Alice thinking about it. She had promised you she'd only hijack your body for a day, then you'd have to be back for Monday. She decided...</span></div></div>",

If you lock it up, there's an enchantment on the door that no one can hear from the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left powerless as Alice assumed full control of your body. Though you could see everything through her eyes, you couldn't really feel anything. Well almost nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice walked quite awkwardly with your throbbing member still being the last part of you tethering yourself to this world. You could feel it, once that was gone then there would be nothing left of Jack Richmond on this mortal plane. You would disappear entirely! Even now, it was becoming hard to stay focused, like you were blinking in and out of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, Alice got to the bathroom with a single toilet and sink, all polished and pink. It was definitely a female lavatory and you could almost smell the perfume in the air, if you still had a nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sat down on the toilet and slid the panties she was wearing off before reaching up her dress skirt and grabbing hold of you. That snapped you back to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack,\" she said aloud. \"Are you still there? Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah,</i> you replied your voice echoing in a deep place like a well. <i>But barely. It feels like I'm fading away...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you are, in some sense. Without a body to call your own, the thing that makes you <i>you</i>, your soul is just going to go to sleep for a little while. Then I'll be the one in full control until I remove the necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, I'm just gonna...Disappear?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No quite. Like I said, it's just like you're going to be sleeping. The two of us can't exist at the same time, after all. Not when there's just one body. And since the body is mostly me at this point, I'm the one who gets to have it since my personality is so much stronger. The only reason I could even remain in this mortal plane was because the amulet was my body, for a time. You would need your own body to keep existing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Like the amulet?</i> You asked. <i>It is possible to put my soul into that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe! But then you would be in the same position I was, trapped in a necklace until someone put you on and you'd transform them into your body. I was thinking though...What if you let your soul become more like mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not sure I follow. Like...Combine our souls?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that would be possible. But you're starting to fade away here because your soul doesn't match my body. If you thought and acted more like me...Then maybe your soul could hang on and you could maintain a presence in my head while I drove for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to think but it was becoming hard to do even that. You could feel your manhood throbbing as Alice's delicate hands grabbed hold of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a thought,\" she offered. \"If you decide to just go asleep too, you'll be back when I remove the necklace. I just wanted to offer in case you didn't like the idea of passing out. Whatever you decide, I wanted to do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What are you...Oooh!</i> You moaned intensely as she began to stroke you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such tiny hands, Alice could grab you with both of them as she worked. \"I can't give you a hug or a kiss since we can't exist in two places at once like this. But I can do this for you before you disappear, as a thank you. Thank you, Jack. You have no idea how happy you've made me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she couldn't imagine how intensely ecstatic this made you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far different from all the time you'd pleasure yourself. This was like someone else was busy taking care of you. And her hands were so soft as they moved up and down and up and down. That's when you realized what else was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to shrink away into Alice's groin and as you did, you found it harder and harder to think about anything but the pleasure. All other thoughts and feelings were fading away like your very existence. And before long, there was only the sexual urges as rational thought all but disappeared. Before long, Alice had to use one hand because there simply wasn't enough of you left. You were getting sucked up and losing consciousness from the most intense orgasm you had ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you throbbed, the fear of disappearing filled what remained of your being. A big part of you didn't want to simply not exist. Would you accept going to sleep for a time? Or would you try another way to keep your soul here on this mortal plane before it faded away entirely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Think like Alice. That's what you had to do to keep on existing in the moment. You weren't ready to give yourself up entirely and just let Alice drive, you wanted to see what she did. And you weren't about to spend years trapped in an amulet. You had to think. What did Alice like? What was she like? In the real world, there were only inches of you left as Alice's reproductive organs began to take shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the confines your own fading self conscious, you imagined yourself in an empty white room with several doors while behind you, the room was collapsing into an endless void. You ran trying to open each door as the world crumbled around you. You needed some sort of safe haven to hide yourself as you came to the one door with color in this plain world of existence. A bright red portal with a heavy brass knob that only came up to your chest, in fact the door itself was strangely pear shaped, like a woman's body. Try as you might though, the door simply wouldn't open either. And the collapse of the universe was speeding right behind you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at yourself, being in a tall lanky body and you knew what you had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Alice,\" you told yourself as you imagined what Alice was physically like. \"I <i>am </i>Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a short girl, so you pictured yourself shrinking in height to match the size of the door, like you were being squashed down by a giant hammer. But she was also a large girl, so you knew you had to grow. You could feel yourself expand out in all directions, swelling up like a parade balloon. You felt heavy and bloated as your stomach blew up and you pressed down on it, commanding it to spread more towards your hips and thighs. Alice was pear shaped, after all, and you would have to be too if you wanted to fit through that door. Most of all were her breasts and you commanded your flat chest to grow out and fill your hands. You had to moan with pleasure as cleavage took up your downward gaze. Before long, you had literal melons on your chest. What else did Alice have? Long, beautiful red hair. You pulled out your own brown hair as the brunette burned away into scarlet before it touched down to your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sure you lacked the finer details of Alice's persona, lacking a clear image of what her face and other parts were. But, for now, you would have to pass as her being a short, squat, and busty lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Alice,\" you repeated, in a distinctly female voice before you grabbed hold of the door knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the door opened and you squeezed you way in just before the world around you collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice could only hold onto what remained of you by her fingertips before it got sucked into her new female parts. She panted, having experienced the most intense change of the whole process of returning to the mortal world before sighing and cleaning her hands off a little. Everything had left her feeling quite moist and wet. When that was all squared away and she was cleaned up with her panties back on, she stood up and faced the mirror of the bathroom. And with it, her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? Are you still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm you,</i> came the reply in a distinctly female voice, though it was not her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was quite taken aback by that announcement. \"You're...Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm <b>trying </b>to be,</i> the voice sounded quite strained. <i>It's taking a lot of effort to remain here and I can only do that by thinking I'm you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Alice put her hands to her face. \"I'm so sorry! I'm probably not helping matters much by questioning it, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's fine...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThough Alice knew enough about tones of voices that you were struggling. And, being the helpful person that she was, she fully intended to aid you in keeping with her. Besides, having a voice in her head made all of this less of a lonely experiences, especially after years in solitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if keeping around means you have to be more like me, then all I have to do is show you what I'm like, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess? What do you have in mind first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question excited Alice, having lost her freedom until this point only to be given a whole weekend to do...Well, whatever she wanted! It was getting late in the day and almost dinner time, perhaps Hannah might want to get some takeout and Alice could could convince her to have a slumber party of sorts? Girls loved doing that. Then again, there was this Caitlyn girl who seemed interested in Alice, a girl's intuition and all that. Or maybe Cleo might have some suggestions on how to help, given she had been so helpful already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice decided to...</span></div></div>",

Though you couldn't help but notice she seemed a little sad you had refused her. <i>But can you help me with finding someone who might be willing to share? I won't let them host me unless they agree to it, so you need to be honest with them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's oddly noble for a ghost looking for a body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, you attract more flies with honey...I'm Alice, by the way, so you don't have to introduce me as 'the ghost girl.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" you realized she was formally introducing herself to you. \"Uh, Jack. Jack Richmond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, Jack, I'm putting my hopes and trust in your hands. I've waited years for this chance, so please don't let me regret it. And good luck!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was certainly more cheerful of a response than you were expecting. And you could feel just how eager she was to have a body again. You might feel the same way too if you were a ghost for who knew how long. Plus, though she was chubby, she was really cute. You wondered if things worked out what kind of \"reward\" you might get for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was for later. For now, you had to find a proper host who might actually believe your crazy story and agree to let Alice live a little. The question was a matter of who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was always your mom. She was eager to help anyone in need, no matter how small. She might be the perfect host for Alice until a more permanent solution could be found. Even if she didn't completely understand, she would probably be happy to share and might even enjoy the company with your dad gone for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts also went to your sister Caitlyn. Though a little moody, you always knew your sister to have a good heart. And there was a time when she was in her \"wiccan\" stage where she swallowed everything related to wishes. Perhaps showing her an actual ghost might peak her interest enough to go through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last person you could think of was your neighbor Hannah. She definitely had the same dimensions as Alice, which might be why you found her a little bit attractive. Hannah wasn't the brightest person, but she was the closest in body shape to make Alice more comfortable.

But not before Alice gave you one last worried smile. She was putting her trust fully in you, but even that meant she had a right to be concerned that you might stab her in the back. And who knew when another opportunity like this would come her way. You were determined not to let things come to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were still at a loss on who you could trust with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a question you continued to ponder over as you sat at your desk playing video games, keeping Alice's amulet. Every so often you would glance at it and talk to it. It seemed to glow impatiently every hour or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you replied. \"You can imagine this is probably hard. I'm essentially asking someone to share a body with a complete stranger! But I suppose you're right. I'm not going to get anywhere unless I actually ask someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you heard the sounds of people entering your house downstairs. This was followed by stomping and the slam of a door from your sister's room. Sounded like Caitlyn had another fight with mom again and their lunch out together didn't exactly turn out well for either of them. Cait was sure to be in a mood too. She sure was lonely since you had moved into this new town of Mallorysville, away from all her friends in your old town. Perhaps she could use the company in the form of a ball of sunshine like Alice the ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only matter was how to approach her with asking her to be Alice's host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose to could take an example from Alice and just be upfront about it, tell her about Alice and hope that she says yes. Alternatively...You could always just drop the necklace into Cait's possession and just hope for the best. That wouldn't be manipulating her, exactly. You were sure Alice would talk to her and help her figure it out. It would just be nudging them both in the right direction and then you could avoid an awkward conversation with your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively alternatively, Cait had a lot of quirky friends. Perhaps she might know someone who would play host to a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do?</span></div></div>",

And forget about delicious food anymore. You would need to eat nothing but plain chicken and greens, with the occasional muscle powder to keep fit. It's a horrible pain in the butt, I tell you! But if you were me, then you would never worry about what you eat. You might be fat, but you would be comfortable. And you would look damn good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused. She made a surprisingly valid argument. She was kind of cute for a chubby girl. \"Fair enough...But why a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do you find beer bellies attractive? There's only one way a guy gains is with his gut. With a girl though...Do you mind taking a step back for a second?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as commanded, which granted you a full view of your girlish reflection and all its splendor. Needless to say it wasn't her breasts which were the only things that were big, she had the hips and thighs to match as well. And only a little tummy poking out as well as you put your hands on your waist and she did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>See? For a girl, you have the curves to fill out. Especially the boobs. Can you imagine eating and eating only for them to get bigger and bigger before your very eyes? We both know you've always been a boob guy.

As bizarre as this conversation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Look,</i> continued the reflection. <i>I'm not asking that we snap your fingers and boom, turn you into me.

Now, sit on the bed and close your eyes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you followed the girl's orders now curious how she was going to go about this. You sat across each other on opposite beds as you shut your eyes tight and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Listen to the sound of my voice. Only my voice. Nothing else in the world matters right now. Focus only on my voice and soon it will be your voice too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It starts with a tingle in the pit of your stomach. It spreads from there, going to every corner of your body. You curl your toes as you suddenly feel quite aroused as pulses begin rumbling through your arms and legs. That's when you realize that your skin is feeling unusually smooth and soft. Softer than typical like you've been keeping yourself mositized for years. You can feel all that hair on your forearms and shins begin to recede, leaving everything feeling velvety and supple. It\u2019s like not even being in your own skin anymore, like you\u2019re becoming a different person. And that really turns you on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped and opened your eyes to a very aroused sight in your pants as your tent pitched.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHey!

That was just a little taste test.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the girl in the mirror had made the words she had said a reality. Your skin was now impossibly smooth and soft, so much so that it felt incredible to rub. Almost as soft as hers looked in the mirror. This was the real deal! She really was transforming you into her!<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWant to stop? </i>She asked you. <i>This is only going to be harder if you don\u2019t relax and let me work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your member throbbing, it was clear whatever she was doing to you was really turning you on.

It was like being at the mercy of a dream, and every bit as thrilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You can feel the pulsing resonating through your whole body again like a heartbeat. Warping and priming you for a big change. You find yourself getting more aroused at the prospect of being a different person. And you won't open your eyes this time as I mold you like putty in my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel them, don't you? My soft and delicate hands massaging their way around your shoulders. You're a big, strong lad aren't you? And that just won't do for this sort of work. So, let's just bring you down a bit to my level. Here we go, I'm going to push down a bit on you. You'll just feel a slight bit of pressure as I take a few inches off the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere we go. Feel that sinking sensation? Your shirt suddenly feeling a bit loose on you? Nothing to worry about, this is completely and oh so relaxing. It's like taking a deep breath of air and just letting it all out. Down we go. You don't even notice that your feet barely touch the ground anymore. You've lost quite a bit of height already! And speaking of feet, let's take a look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese won't do, so big and clunky. Let me rub them a bit. Compress them and crush them down to a more ladylike size. That's it, it's just like wearing a smaller pair of shoes. Even your toenails are looking cleaned and polished. There, look at those cute little feet! They are absolutely adorable and perfect for wearing high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to shrink again? Down we go, just a couple more inches till you're in the lower five foot range. Your shirt is starting to feel limp around your neck. Don't worry, we'll fill it up soon enough. Let's just work on making a solid foundation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms are so bulky and thuggish, let me give them a big squeeze so I can wring out those useless muscles. There we go, and now the other. While I'm here, let's give those hands a squeeze and make them tiny to make so that everything just feels huge to the touch. Don't you feel dainty and delicate? That's because you're probably lost about half of your body mass at this point. Let's just reach around your waist here. Breath in for me, dear. That's it. You feel your sides concaving a bit as I start you off with a more feminine shape. You're starting to feel quite small, aren't you? That will pass soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think you're ready to be brought down to my level. This is going to be a drop, I suggest you hold onto your pants before you lose them. I press down hard and...Welcome to the land of the short and soon to be stout! You're around 4'10 now. Everything will look so big to you when you open your eyes. But you like it, it turns you on. Let's work on that face next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a rugged chin has no place on this beautiful body, don't you agree? It rounds about a bit, becoming smooth and makes your face circular and cute. You feel me tugging at your cheeks to inflate them and stretch them outward, but it feels nice. I'm just giving you a facial, dear. Press down on that nose to make it less protruding and pointed. Pinch those lips to make them luscious and thick. You look like a completely different person as I widen those eyes a bit. Next comes the hair. I run my fingers through your brown locks over and over again. Each time I do, there seems to be more and more hair to work with. Before long, you look like you're three months due of a haircut. A few more tugs and the hair is down to your shoulders, tickling your neck. Wit ha satisfying length, your scalp starts to itch as the pigment changing into a more pleasing color. You slowly become a redhead, like you were always meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the fun part. You're looking very girlish now, indeed. So, let's give you something to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm going to lean into you and kiss you. I can tell that gets you excited as I nip you on your swollen lips. You taste my tongue as I take a deep breath and blow into you. My warm air settles in your stomach instead of your lungs and you feel rather full all of a sudden. That's when I take another breath...And blow into you harder this time. That sensation of fullness increases exponentially with each blow and you begin to feel it spread to all corners of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt starts with your hips. Your legs begin to press together as your empty pant legs start to fill up with soft, warm flab. Suddenly, you have a waistline to match your old body and the rope belt of your pajama pants starts to actually feel tight on you, even though your pant legs dangle over your shrunken feet. You feel yourself rising from your seat as you're not getting taller. No, it's your butt getting bigger. Everywhere is getting wider. Your legs, your toes, your arms, your fingers. It's like being coated with a thick layer of blanket for your entire body and you looking positively pear shaped as your proportions soar to more than double their original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut butts aren't the only thing you want, right? You gasp as you feel a tingle in your chest. I ready myself for the deepest breath yet as it give it my all. You arch your back as there's a foreign weight on your front. You cup your hands over a handful of flesh as you can feel your new breasts growing with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big do you want them? That's a silly question we both know the answer to. Your hands can barely contain them as they start to stretch out the neck of your shirt. If you look down, you can see a canyon of cleavage staring back at you in the face as each boob is bigger than your own head. You fondle them and feel them jiggle. Yes, it's okay to touch them. These are yours and they are a part of your body now. All of this is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's only one detail missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough all this, you've been rock hard this whole time. We'd better take care of that, shall we? I undo the rope belt and reach down your pants to grab hold of you. You feel a strange gurgling in your lower abdomen. I grab hold of the shaft and start working my way up and down it, slowly at first. You squeeze at your new tits as I increase the speed. It's funny, but with each passing second there seems to be less of you to hold onto, though you never lose your hardness. You're sinking away into something...Better. As we near the end of our fun, I can only hold onto you with two fingers. You convulse as new body parts mingle with your nervous system. The sensation is overwhelming as you explode into your new gender. Welcome to being a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you may open your eyes and see what we've become.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally did so and gasped in a voice that wasn't your own at the stunning beauty standing in your bedroom. You looked exactly as you imagined you would, red hair, short, plump with huge breasts and wide hips. You didn't care if you were a chubby girl, you were <i>hot</i>. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sta.sh/01f0jfgxr8b0\" target=\"_blank\">https://sta.sh/01f0jfgxr8b0</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now then</i>, said a voice inside your head, growing louder.</span></div></div>",

So, can we take this a little bit slower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That\u2019s no fun</i>, your reflection gave a pouting face. <i>But I\u2019m not exactly in a position to argue. What did you have in mind?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...Don\u2019t know. Maybe doing it piece by piece every so often so that I can get used to it? I\u2019d like to get comfortable in my own skin, especially if it\u2019s really going to change me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suit yourself. You know where to find me when you\u2019re ready.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou breathed a deep sigh of relief and removed the necklace, watching the image of the girl morph and shift as she returned to your own shape. After a few moments of watching, you were staring back at yourself. Completely normal again, save for your much smoother skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat up, you found the smoothness of your legs were only highlighted. If you had any idea that constant moisturizing and caretaking of your skin could result in such a comfortable feeling. Maybe your reflection really was onto something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break gave you a moment to think matters over a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked the idea of doing this transformation piecemeal, it allowed you to adjust and process everything new. Walking around in your new skin made you appreciate it that much more and you couldn\u2019t deny that you were at least a little bit curious what would happen next. But when your mom came back home with a particularly grumpy Caitlyn, you were having second thoughts. How might your family react to your new body? You were lucky you just moved and didn\u2019t have many friends yet, it would be less to explain to them. But to your mom and sister, it was going to be an awkward conversation to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later that night after dinner that you finally returned to your bedroom, locking the door and grabbing the amulet left within your nightstand. You slipped it over your neck and did the clasps as your reflection morphed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Finally</i>, said your reflection as the girl returned. <i>So, are we ready to go all the way? I was right, wasn\u2019t I? You like being different.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to deny that,\u201d you replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m just a little cautious about all this. How am I going to explain it to my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please. Your mom is always been open minded and Caitlyn would love to have an older sister.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cEven if that was all true\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Look, if you\u2019re really nervous, then why don\u2019t you ask Cleo tomorrow for any tools she might have in disguising things from them so that they don\u2019t notice. Or that they\u2019ve always seen you as such?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThat was true, you hadn\u2019t thought of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a good plan,\u201d you decided, reaching for the clasp of your necklace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hang on! While you\u2019re here, you said you wanted to do this piecemeal, right? Well, why don\u2019t we do the next step then? Something small and easy.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe thought was strangely tempting as you gulped and pondered what you might be able to alter next before cooling your expectations. You still weren\u2019t sure about your family situation, so best to pick something they wouldn\u2019t notice. Or something they couldn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth and replied to the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Which apparently is to become said fat chick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's exactly how it played out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little convincing from your reflection as she explained to you that if Cleo gave you a magical amulet then of course she was going to have more items like that for sale. You were just a little embarrassed about the nature of the request. And you felt insane explaining all of this to Cleo over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, however, just chuckled at your fumbling request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my dear. We don't judge here in this shop. We get all kinds, let me tell you. Though, let me also tell you that I told you that you would be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" you said, still red in the face as you paced around the bathroom. \"So, do you have anything in mind for what I told you about? Something that can let me change back too if I didn't like it? And what's the price that we're looking at? Because if it's something crazy then I'll just say forget it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, trust me dearie. I think after you'd had a taste of your truest desire then you won't want anything more. But as for cost, I can promise it's very affordable. And quite undo-able, if that's still your biggest concern. Why don't you come on down and I'll have something ready for you that I promise is exactly what you're looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and clasped at the amulet, glancing over to your reflection who winked at you one last time. Your mom and sister would be out for a couple more hours, at least. You could run down and try this little scheme real quick, whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you set out again, back to Cleo's shop only to find what she had been planning to sell you.

Get me enough energy and I can do it for you. Want to be buffer? Feed me and I'll make it happen. Anything and everything.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. That would be kind of nice,\" you said taking a bite of your still cold-in-the-middle lunch. \"Wouldn't those require a lot of life energy though? Won't I end up dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's why you just use someone else's life energy instead. Just by touching them while wearing me, I can sap their life force instead. That way, you don't have to be the one to suffer the consequences. Just think about it! Any wish, any wish at all and I can make it happen! And you don't even have to pay for it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but someone else does,\" you said, swallowing your burrito. \"Still, I could think of a few things I would want to wish for.

And it's long tusks were sharp and made of real ivory. The body was made of extreme curves, much like the fertility statuette you were just looking at. The hands and feet, however, were flat elephant hooves. And there was a tail on the big butt of the creature. Perhaps this was some sort of goddess from eastern culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next was a more modern piece. It was actually two statuettes holding up a small mirror on both sides. One looked like an angel, with dove wings and a halo. And that would mean the other was clearly a devil with horns and bat wings.

His eyes lit up upon looking  at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, is that you? Boy am I glad to see you, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked and looked over the strange man. His voice was vaguely familiar and could be that of your father. Yet the last time you saw your father he was just tall and lanky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you was a tall and buff blue man. You begin to question the man further until he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I look different. The thing is I've become a genie,\" your dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the man who called himself your father curiously. \"If you're really Brad Richmond then what's my favorite Christmas present that I got nine years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Skipper. Such a sweet dog. Your eyes lit up with joy when we picked him up from your grandma's,\" your father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as the man told you your favorite Christmas present. Before you was your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father chuckled nervously. \"I got caught in a magical accident five years ago. I was inspecting a lamp one moment  and the next moment I got sucked inside the lamp. Not to mention I had amnesia for three years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were sucked into a genie's lamp and had amnesia for three years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father nodded his head. \"That's right. Also, when someone becomes a genie they are assigned a new name. I've been  going by Soltarus for the past five years. Now what do you wish for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a genie and employee of this shop I'm supposed to offer wishes starting at five dollars per wish,\" your father said. \"However, you could buy my lamp for thirty dollars and take me home. So what will it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take some time to think it over. You could pay five bucks and have your now genie father grant one wish or you could buy his lamp and take your father back home.</span></div></div>",

A golden genie lamp appeared in your hands. You find yourself at the front counter. You see Cleo at the counter wiping off a crystal ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and smiled. \"I see that you want the genie's lamp. Not many people offer to buy Soltarus, but you aren't any person are you, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo types on a keyboard and the register door opens. \"That will be thirty dollars Mr. Richmond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled thirty dollars out of your of your pocket and paid Cleo. Cleo gingerly took the money and thanked  you for your purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exiting the shop you run the lamp. As expected your father's form materialized before you. He then bowed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings master, I am Soltarus, genie of the lamp. Name your wish and it shall be yours,\" your father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any wish?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any wish. And before you start calling me Dad I must inform you that we have a master-servant relationship now. Around your mother and family friends I may go by Brad Richmond, Dad, or any other name out of formality around loved ones, but from here on out refer to me as Soltarus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head in agreement. \"That's right Soltarus. Let's head home first before we start with the wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your genie father made your way to your Mom's place. Once you have arrived you unlocked the door and proceeded inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA close inspection showed that no was home...yet. You then glance over at Soltarus and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many wishes do I get since I bought your lamp? You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father shrugged his shoulders. \"That's  up to you. I just grant the wish and then reality changes in order to fulfill the wish for the most part, master. What do you wish for master?\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You play the role of Jack Richmond, a 19-year-old college student staying at your mother's new house for the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a rather average sort of fellow - brown eyes and brown hair, moderately athletic build, standing at a respectable 5'10\".  An interest in all things nerdy compliments your pursuance of a computer science degree, but you still enjoy the odd game of soccer or artistic pursuits of theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small town you've moved to, Mallorysville, was named for its founder, Mallory Shae.  She must have been some sort of intrepid explorer from the 1800s - and a really successful one at that - based on all the tourist traps and merchandise you've seen around town.  You've spent your last few days here exploring the shops and marveling at all the displays and quaint BnBs, but nothing could prepare you for the latest shop you've just stumbled into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Some characters to start with:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ellen Richmond</b> - Your mother.  5'1\", 180 lbs, and 43 years old.  After having dyed her hair for years, she's opted to go back to her natural auburn, which now hangs down to her shoulders.  After Jack's father's mysterious disappearance a few years back, she's been putting on some pounds, but she's still very attractive with a pear-shaped body.  She moved recently to a small house in Mallorysville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Caitlyn Richmond</b> - Your little sister.  5'4\", 130 lbs, and 17 years old.  She's been very upset at having to move to a new town for her senior year of highschool and has mostly been avoiding talking to anyone, preferring to text her friends or listen to the latest punk band she'd discovered in her room.  She's pretty fit, having competed in varsity soccer throughout highschool.  She has long, auburn hair just like your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hannah Becker</b> - Your blonde next door neighbor.  5'0\", 220 lbs, and 21 years old.  Hannah's natural charm and bubbliness is incredibly infectious.  Though short, her large curves and even larger personality quickly fill the room, and she has visited your house, often unnannounced, many times.  She gets along with everyone, even Caitlyn despite herself.  She's invited you all over a few times, but your mom has yet to take her up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cleo Shae</b> - A mysterious woman with the same last name as the town's founder.  She owns the titular antique shop, Shae's Antiques.  Though she appears to be an impressively-bosomed woman in her late thirties with striking red hair, she gives off a very commanding, worldly vibe, almost as though she were considerably older and more well-traveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  Write coherently.  An odd spelling or grammar mistake is no big deal, but try to minimize them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  Choice chapters are okay, but try to make them a bit more interesting than a single sentence if possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  Don't end the story abruptly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.  Please avoid using characters from popular media (videogames, TV, books, etc.).  Original characters are more than welcome however!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.  All TF is welcome!  TG, WG, AP, AR, etc.  Have fun and go crazy!</td>",
