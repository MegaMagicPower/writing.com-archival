For a moment, Amanda stands and watches it whirls around, trying to figure out just how fast it's actually moving. After a bit, she takes the first step, and the door hits her foot. She pulls her foot away from the door before the rest of her leg gets pulled in. Amanda takes a deep breath and watches the door revolve a couple more times before making another attempt. This time, she manages to step into thee space at the right time and shuffles along until she is inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankful that ordeal is over, she steps far enough away from the door to survey the lobby she's entered. Dark cherry tones imbue the walls and contrast with the gray marble underneath her feet. A minimal desk with a black stone top sits in the center, flanked by entry gates on either side. Men and women trickle into the lobby and hold their key cards to the entry gates. Looking to the left, Amanda spots a cluster of black leather chairs and a small coffee table. To the right are a coffee kiosk and a whole bunch more people. Checking her watch, she notices it's 9:30. Where should she go?</span></div></div>",

Glancing once more at her watch, Amanda queues in behind a short, portly man as he finishes narrating the rather lengthy description of his order. The barista turns quickly away from the counter as the gentleman steps aside to await his beverage. Still pondering what exactly she had hoped to acquire from her caffeinated pilgrimage, Amanda slowly steps up to the kiosk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda awaits the barista's return, a strangely familiar shape to the side of the kiosk catches her eye. Though his back is turned to her, Amanda immediately recognized the hulking shoulders of Donavan Portier. Amanda feels her cheeks warm slightly as she instantly recalls a particularly scandalous week she and Donavan had spent in the Caimans during his last (and her first) spring break. Half decade old visions begin flooding through Amanda's mind as the coffee attendant returns to the counter. Amanda snaps her attention back to the present long enough to sputter her order before the disconcertingly illicit visions of the young executive began invading her mind once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pallor of Amanda's face pales slightly as the barista motions towards the kiosk's pick up window which is situated directly behind Donavan's well built,Brioni suited frame. As Amanda hesitantly steps in the direction indicated by the attendant, she catches the distinctly Russian accent of the man conversing with Donavan.</span></div></div>",

She thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside she is met with a large information desk on her left. There are two guards on duty.

That was better. \"I was told to report to a woman on the fifteenth floor before eight o'clock. I was told nothing about stopping at a desk first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no badge and no one goes past this point without a badge. My job is to make sure of that. Now if you wouldn't mind stepping over to the desk, I am sure the receptionist can get you to the fifteenth floor with no further trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda glanced at the man's name badge. Harold was all it said. His blue uniform was meant to look like the local police department, but there were a few insignia's missing. Amanda wondered what Harold would do if she reached out and patted him on the chest, like she wanted too. Deep down she had the feeling he was all bark with no bite. He looked like a rough, tough man of power, but he was probably a teddy bear. Instead of going with her first idea, she put her best high-there-handsome smile on her face and said, \"Thank you Harold for your help. See you later.\" then she walked to receptionist desk, Glancing over her shoulder she found Harold watching her. </span></div></div>",

Her smile slowly fades, but she shrugs off being ignored and, clears her throat and plasters a more grimace then smile on her face, but she tries to appear nice. The male guard looks down on her, then rolls his eyes as if to say, hopeless, just before giving a head bob, to indicate that it's obvious that's the help desk. As Amanda turns to walk away, he elbows the other guard and smirks.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strangely quiet in here, for the number of people walking through, Amanda thought to herself, even at the help desk with the 2 employees and 3 guests waiting to be helped. On the counter stood a ticket dispenser with a sign that read TAKE ONE PLEASE. <br>\r\n\"Oh God.\" Amanda thought \"It's 9:57 now! I had better\"  \"Excuse me Ma'am.\" she blurted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stern expression, the woman behind the counter swiftly points to the dispenser.</span></div></div>",

She always seems to be doing that when she's too excited.  \"Is there an employee parking section?\" The man gestures to the left with his head.  She lets her eyes wander over his combed over, dark brown hair, green eyes, and black suit.  \"Thanks so much,\" she smiles and puts her window back up, driving slowly towards the spot where the man indicated and looking into her side view mirrors to watch him.  He opens a big glass door and disappears.  She shuts her car and takes a deep breath.  Pursing her lips she takes one last look in her rear view mirror.  No remnants of breakfast in her teeth; check.  She opens her door and her heels clack on the pavement as she makes her way towards the same building the stranger had just went into. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grasps the steel handle and pushes.  The door doesn't budge.  She pushes again.  \"It's a pull.\" Am arm adoring silver bracelets peeking out of a white sleeve reaches around and pulls the door open.  \"Oh,\" Amanda blushes profusely and thanks the woman.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They step into the air conditioned building.  A man behind a desk nods at them.  Amanda stops and walks over to him.  \"I'm looking for Mrs. Raydon's office.\"  The man smirks and the same white sleeved arm taps Amanda's shoulder.  \"That's me, dear.\"  Amanda almost smacks herself on the forehead but lets out a nervous giggle instead.  \"Amanda,\" the older woman says slowly.  Amanda nods and the woman smiles; little creases form at the corners of her piercing blue eyes.  \"Excellent. Excited for your first day?\" \"Very.\"  \"Good.  Come with me.\"  They walk across the floor and Mrs. Raydon presses the elevator button.  They both face the chrome doors and don't speak.  The elevator arrives with a lingering ding and they step on.  Mrs. Raydon presses the button for the 6th floor.  \"Have you been an assistant before?\" She turns to Amanda as the doors slide shut and the elevator hums as they move up.  \"No ma'am, my first time.\"  \"It's simple really, but as you get more acquainted and have better training, you'll be on your own in a matter of time.\"  Amanda smiles and thinks about herself behind a big desk with a nameplate typing away on a computer, reading congratulatory emails.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The elevator reaches the floor and they step out.  The walls have framed pictures of runway models strategically placed and underneath each was a plaque.  \"This one is from Spring, 2009.\"  Mrs. Raydon holds a manicured hand out to a picture on the wall next to a large, plotted plant.  Amanda steps over to it and reads the models name and year of the collection on the plaque.  \"It's beautiful,\" Amanda remarks.  \"Good,\" Mrs. Raydon says, \"your first article will be on this picture.\"  Amanda bites on her bottom lip.  \"Okay,\" she says.  It comes out uneasy and she knows it.  She really wanted to sound ready for the challenge, but she really wasn't.  An article? On the first day?  \"Don't worry, I'll give you a few or look at to help you get started.\"  \"Okay,\" Amanda repeats, firmer this time.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mrs. Raydon leads the way to her office.  The hallway is quiet but Amanda can hear murmuring behind closed doors.  As if she could read her thoughts, Mrs. Raydon says, \"everyone is in different meetings right now.  Monday morning meetings.\"  She laughs.  \"There are meetings for the magazine including article writers, illustrators, graphic designers, and so forth.  Those are the meetings you'll be in.  All the others are relatively financial.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They enter a plush carpet room.  The scent of the fresh roses in a vase on the desk smell amazing.  \"You can take a seat for now, I just have to print a few things out.\"  Amanda sits on a leather chair and rolls her ankle.  Her feet ache from the heels but she's willing to wear them for this job. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mrs. Raydon drapes her jacket on the back of her chair and places her designer bag on the dress.  She puts on a pair of glasses and inspects the computer screen.  Within seconds the printer near the window comes to life.  Amanda looks around the room, the walls are painted the faintest pink they could be mistaken for white it one doesn't look close enough.  She can't imagine a speck of dust in this office.  Then she thinks, even the dust must be clean.  Mrs. Raydon's cell phone rings.  \"Yes,\" she answers.  She says \"yes\" again and smiles at Amanda.  \"I don't know,\" she instantly frowns and walks towards the window.  Amanda admires her slender frame.  Mrs. Raydons voice is low as if she doesn't want to be heard.  Voices fill the hallway and drown out Mrs. Raydons conversation.  A blonde steps into the room and Mrs. Raydon hangs up.  \"Isabelle,\" Mrs. Raydon says adoringly.  She holds out her arms and the blonde holds out her silk covered arms and they hold hands and kiss the air.  \"How was Belize?\"  Mrs. Raydon rests a hand on her desk and the other on a hip.  \"Absolutely wonderful,\" the blonde says sweetly.  \"Jason has all the photographs.\"  Amanda looks down subconsciously at the carpet.  \"I do look forward to seeing them,\" Mrs. Raydon gushes.  \"Oh!\" She cries out.  \"How awful of me, Isabelle this is Amanda,\" Amanda looks up.  \"My new assistant,\" she continues.  Isabelle raises her eyebrows and Mrs. Raydon nods.  Amanda gets up and holds out her hand.  Isabelle looks down at it and carefully puts her hand in Amanda's.  It feels like holding a skeleton hand.  Amanda hadn't noticed how thin the girl was.  Her cheekbones were abnormally high giving her cheeks a sunken look, and her collarbones were sharp and precise.  Amanda feels small next to the two women even though she figures she weighs the same as both of them together if not more.  </span></div></div>",
