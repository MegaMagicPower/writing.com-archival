So none of you will be allowed to have or use a shrink ray. Jason is the only student who will be shrunk. He will be grown back for basketball games but he will spend much of his times at less than a foot tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Matthews fished Jason out of his pile of clothes and set the tall, skinny and naked basketball player on his desk where everyone could see.

You just aren't smart enough to make it in college and you realize that all you're doing is racking up debt. The low level jobs you are able to get will not pay enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've heard of this option of turning yourself into a pet and selling yourself. It is legal but there are strict rules that make sure you want to be shrunk. You went ahead and applied months ago not sure if you really wanted to go through with it but you just got the letter saying it's been approved. In fact, someone has already offered to buy you and to pay off all your debt. You won't have to stay tiny for the rest of your life but you will have to stay tiny for five years and then you can renegotiate what you do from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously go to a mansion to meet your purchaser. He leads you into a room where another twenty year old man is laying in a hospital bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my son Roger or Rog for short. He was in an accident and suffered a mild case of brain trauma that the doctors say is temporary. With therapy, he might learn to walk again. He has also developed an allergy to sunlight and can't go outside. This has cost him many friends and left him very isolated. I want you to be a companion to him. He's also forgotten how to be an adult but the doctors say he can relearn. That's why I chose a male about his age to be his companion. You can teach him how to be an adult again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still not sure about this but look at all the pros. You'll be out of debt. You won't have to work such labor intensive jobs. You just have to be a companion to a man who is fairly helpless. So you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you are shrunk to eight inches, it doesn't go as you expected. Roger's dad, Bill, refused to give you any clothes. Bill says, \"You are going to teach him how to be an adult therefore he needs to see your willy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are scared but you don't have a chance as you are put in a cage and the cage is wrapped. It's Roger's twentieth birthday and you find yourself as one of his presents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait to be opened, you hear the conversation around you. You here Bill argue, \"Mickey Mouse? How dare you. My son is still an adult. He may have forgotten some things but we're not going to turn him into a kid again. Keep your Mickey Mouse t-shirt. Roger doesn't want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see light as Roger begins to open the package you are in. You stand there naked and covering yourself as it is revealed to you just how many people are there. At Roger's birthday party is Roger's parents, two brothers, one sister, an aunt and uncle with their son and daughter, a doctor, and servants. None of Roger's friends showed up at the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it is surreal that you are attending Roger's birthday party as his present, a naked, shrunken, human pet. Your cage gets set off to the side while Roger opens other presents and soon you are ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger's brother Steve comments, \"So Roger, you going to train your pet to do tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill interjects, \"No, Adam is going to teach Roger about sex. Adam is an adult. Adam, stand up and show us your cock.\"</span></div></div>",
