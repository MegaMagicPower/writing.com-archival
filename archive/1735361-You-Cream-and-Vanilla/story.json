Nothing.\" Cream quickly responded, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finally got home and plop your bags down by the couch.

Vanilla took a pause and said: \"My daughter likes you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this was news to you! No wonder Cream is always so loyal to you. \"You're quite the ladies man.\" Vanilla continued. \"Usually Cream has no interest in boys, but with you, it's a different story. I remember when you come here to spend the night back when you two were about fourteen. I saw Cream in her room making a collage of pictures of you two from since you two were in diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say. \"Well thanks for letting me know.\" Vanilla could've been teasing, so you decide to find out from Cream yourself. You enter the room that you and Cream share and say, \"Um, Cream, your mom said that you have a crush on me. Is this true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Cream's response? </span></div></div>",

Why else would you think I can't sleep at night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember one day, sneaking about on the house last summer. Cream was awake at three in the morning, near the patio drawing something you didn't know what it could be. Ever since then, you found out what she was doing and you found her binder full of drawn images that were basically you and her. You mostly saw the two of you holding hands and running, one hugging each other, a few kissing, and even leaving a wedding. Cream was really in love with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream... I...

Youre a life-saver!You blushed and smiled when she called you a life-saver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom!\" but you overheard Cream object, \"I kinda need his help with homework! And I already got a ton of it.\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry honey,\" Ms. Rabbit assured her daughter, \"he'll help you out soon. This'll only take a minute! C'mon, [Rich]!\" And with that, her white-gloved hand grabbed your arm and she pulled you off with her. Not that you really minded it much being this close to Vanilla, but for some reason she seemed a little more... friendly than usual.<br>\r\n'Eh, it's probably nothing' you think to yourself as you try desperately not to stare at the open top space on her dress that she forgot to unbutton... as well as desperately fight the urge to stroke her white furry cleavage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom's best friend! Mom's best friend! Mom's best friend!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it wasnt that long a while. Vanilla led you to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um... what can I do for you, Vanilla?\" you mustered the courage to ask.<br>\r\nVanilla sighed, \"The stupid florescent light burnt out.\" she pointed up to the one light on the ceiling that didnt light up, \"normally I'd do it myself, but I cant reach it. The step ladder's broke and I'm still not tall enough to stand on a chair and do it. So I figured, hey YOURE a pretty tall fellow! Maybe YOU can get it for me!\" So she wants you to screw in a lightbulb, huh? Shouldnt be any problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sure! Leave it to me!\" you assured her as you grabbed one of the chairs. Vanilla opened a box of those long pole lights and handed one to you. You stood on the chair and reached for the light on the ceiling. Too bad it was still a little too high for you to reach. You'd have to practically get on your tippy-toes to get close enough.<br>\r\n\"Urgh... it's a... little too high,\" you said as you tried keeping your balance on the chair.<br>\r\n\"Dont worry,\" Vanilla assured you as she grabbed your legs, \"I'll hold you up.\"  Her grip on your legs was tight enough to keep you from wobbling. That oughta be enough for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or it wouldve if Vanilla move her hands around every couple of seconds. As you reached to pull out the old light, Vanilla's gloved hands moved up a little higher. You could feel her gripping below your bellybutton.<br>\r\n\"Easy....\" you whispered as you carefully twisted off the old light, \"easy...\" you could feel her hands inadvertently slip under your shirt as she tried to hold you steady. They were gently gripping your chest, keeping you from slipping. Her fingers kinda tickled when she wiggled them a little. You pretended to pay no mind as you continued to do your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. [Richie]? Have you been working out?\" you couldnt believe Vanilla actually made such a comment.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you sweated a little, \"a little... in gym.\"<br>\r\n\"It certainly shows,\" she commented as she tickled your six-pack! Just when you finally got the old light out, you felt her hands move down your waist again. She grabbed both sides of your hips as you tried to slip the new light in. \"I bet you've caught the eyes of a lot of your fellow students, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"N...No...\" your face went red, \"n-not that I know of... anyway...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh dont be so modest,\" your eyes widened when you felt her gloved hands gently squeeze your butt! \"I caught Cream staring once in a while.\" Oh? Cream looks at you?<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n\"She's not very good at hiding things from me,\" her gloved hands were now around your crotch! \"Heck, I remember a couple of years ago when you spent the night here. While you were taking a shower, I caught Cream staring through the crack in the bathroom door.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-e-e-e-ll! That's news! Man, if you'd have only known she liked you that way sooner, you mightve-WHY IS VANILLA MOVING HER MIDDLE FINGER LIKE THAT?! That middle finger is just over the tip your boxers are desperately trying to cover. You felt your rod tingle as she moved her finger back and forth over the tip of it!<br>\r\n\"Let's face it. That girl is crazy about you,\" Vanilla said as she continued to play with you, \"and it's not hard to see why.\" Speaking of hard...<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth and shook nervously, trying to screw in the new lightbulb.<br>\r\n'Mom's best friend! Mom's best friend! Mom's best friend!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Got it!\" THANKFULLY, you successfully screwed in the new lightbulb! You immediately jumped off the chair and switched on the light. Lit up like new!<br>\r\n\"Thank you SO much [Richie]!\" Vanilla smiled at you, \"it's great to have a real man around the house again!\" A 'real man'! It felt like an honor to be called that from Vanilla Rabbit! If anyone was the perfect judge, it was hers!<br>\r\n\"Aw... it-it was n-nothing! Really!\" you blushed and scratched the back of your head. OOPS! That reminds you! You gotta help Cream with her homework! \"Oh right! I better go help Cream out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla nodded and kept that carefree smile on her face, \"Sure thing!\" she stretched out a little, \"now that I'm wide awake, I guess I'll go take a little dip in the pool to stretch my muscles. Try not to study too hard!\" You nodded as you headed off, trying to fight off the image of you getting nearly groped by her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didnt go far before you stopped in place to gaze at the reflected in the mirror that reflects back into the kitchen... you couldnt believe what Vanilla did right then and there.<br>\r\nShe unbuttoned her dress right then and there and bent over to slide the rest of it off! You dropped your jaw at the sight of your mom's best friend wearing nothing but a red lacey bra barely conceiling her large well-endowed boobs and matching red bikini bottoms showing off her sleek and slender hips! Oh, and of course those cute white gloves she seemingly never takes off!<br>\r\nJust when you FINALLY took your eyes off her white furry jugs lightly jiggling in her top, she turned around and headed off, giving you a lovely view of her furry bikini clad butt slowly swaying left to right as her tail swayed right to left in the opposite direction! It was almost as if time itself slowed down as you were mesmerized by the hypnotic shaking off her ass and bunny tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime resumed the moment she opened the slide-in door and headed out it! If you didnt know any better, you'd think Cream's mom really is trying to tempt you! And it most definitely is tempting! But could you really handle the thought of doing something like that to your mom and your best friend?! You know lots of bad things would occur if you tried, but....<br>\r\nDUDE! Just forget it! Dont you have homework to do?!</span></div></div>",

While you two were working, there was an awkward silence in the air. After about forty-five minutes you finally finished your homework. You decided to ask Cream a really important question.<br>\r\n\"Cream...\" you muster up the courage to say. She turned her face to you and looked at you with her big beautiful hazel eyes. This made you feel even more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"Listen, while I was helping your mom in the kitchen, she told me that......\" you took a deep breath. \"...that you liked me.\"<br>\r\nCream had a shocked look on her face for a second, but then she calmed down.<br>\r\n\"She's right, I've always liked you. You were always so nice to me and I've always felt comfortable around you. And you're really cute, too.\" You were flattered by everything she said.<br>\r\n\"I've always wondered if you had the same feelings for me.\" she said.<br>\r\nYou were deep in thought. Wow, she really liked you. You didn't feel uncomfortable anymore, because Cream actually poured her heart out to you. As your mind went back into reality, you saw Cream leaning towards you! Her eyes were closed and her lips were puckered. You were really surprised! She was leaning in to kiss you! You kind of felt the same way for her, but you kind of had feelings for Vanilla, too. Well, what are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

While common sense told you to swallow your foolish pride and kiss Cream, your stubborn heart was telling you it aint right. You really REALLY wanted to tell Cream you felt the exact same way and kiss her like there was no tomorrow... but you couldnt. The woman you really wanted wasnt her... it was her mom. As silly and impossible this seemed, Vanilla was what your heart yearned for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head in shame. Cream, realizing she wasnt gonna get kissed, unpuckered her lips and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry Cream,\" you tried to be gentle, but honest, \"...there's... someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream stared at you in a nearly emotionless look that tried to hide her sadness... then she smiled and laughed.<br>\r\n\"Oh... aheheh, I see,\" Cream laughed nervously, \"well... I guess I understand. If there's someone else, there's someone. Cant blame a girl for trying, right?\" Well, it was nice to see she was taking it well. Or at least pretending to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont get me wrong,\" you assure her, \"youre a swell girl. A lot of guys would kill to get a girlfriend like you. Youre smart, youre pretty, youre fun, youre sweet... but I kinda got my heart set out for someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n!!!! YOURE EYES WIDENED AS WIDE AS THEY COULD GET WHEN YOU HEARD CREAM MAKE SUCH A LUCKY YET OUTRAGEOUS GUESS!!! Your jaw literally dropped as you blinked at her nearly speechless!<br>\r\n\"Y...y.... how did you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream sighed, \"It wasnt really that difficult, [Rick]. I noticed the way you look at her. The face you make when she hugs you. How emotional you get when she flirts with you. The way you nearly drool when she shakes her tail at you!\" Dang. She actually noticed?! \"She was like your very first crush since we first met, wasnt she?\" Smart girl.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you nodded, \"yeah.\" Well, this is awkward. How are you ever gonna live this down now that Cream now officially knows that you, her childhood friend, wants to get with her mom? This is a whole life-changing event right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I cant say I'm surprised,\" Cream shrugged, \"damn near every other boy in school thinks my mom is hot. Why should YOU be any different?\" Wow. She doesnt seem all that upset. Then again, she did already know you crushed on Vanilla.<br>\r\n\"So youre...\" you swallowed, \"...not upset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just finished my homework,\" Cream suddenly changed the subject, \"did you?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah,\" you answered.<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Cream picked up the phone, \"listen, I gotta call Amy and tell her I need to reschedule the private cram session we had. Mind giving me a little privacy?\" She probably needed to be alone.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" you told her and stepped out of her room. You sighed hard, not knowing whether you should be relieved or worried that Cream now knows about your crush on her mom. You might have a hard time getting a good night sleep though. Now that the monkey was finally off your back, you might as well chillax in the living room until Cream's done with her private chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you headed into the living room, you overheard music playing over in the kitchen. Vanilla mustve turned on the radio. She's probably finished with her dip then. It was probably a bad idea, but curiosity got the better of you and you peeked yet again into the kitchen.<br>\r\nYou stared in awe at Vanilla, soaking wet from head to toe in that skimpy red bikini, dancing a little to the music and humming to herself while she ironed her dress. You couldnt take your eyes off those furry white boobs jiggling about in her little dance as her bra desperately attempting to conceal them!<br>\r\nShe resumed ironing her dress as she shook her booty to the beat, her tail swaying like crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to act more like a gentleman and less like a pervy kid, you turned away until she finished her ironing dance. Short period later, Vanilla switched off the music and put her ironed dress right back on.<br>\r\n\"Ahh... toasty,\" she sighed, embracing it's warmth. That's your cue, stupid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vanilla,\" you called your older crush by her first name as you approached. As if already knowing you were already there watching her to begin with, she kept a smile on as she turned around to face you, \"Oh! [Richie]! What's up? If you changed your mind and wanted to take a dip in the pool with me, too little too late! That'll teach you to waste ample time on meaningless things like 'homework'!\"<br>\r\nYou laughed and shook your head, \"No. I need to talk to you about something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla, still a mother at heart, gave you her attention, \"Important?\"<br>\r\nConfessing to someone who's old enough to be your mother, despite being flirty, was a tad tougher than it seemed. For each and every second you thought about the right words to say, your heart raced like it trying to beat out of your rib cage! You started off easy.<br>\r\n\"Well, since Cream already stopped at Subway after school... I was wondering if you'd like to go to T.G.I. Saturday's for dinner tonight. Just me and you! My treat!\" so you werent very good with asking someone out on a date. You had to start it out SOMEWAY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cream's mom just tilts her head in curiosity, \"Why the sudden generosity all of a sudden? What are you up to?\" Ok, so she saw through that one pretty easily.<br>\r\nNo point in lying or holding back at this point, anyway. You pretty much shot down Cream for her mother, so no turning back now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a breath, \"Vanilla... the truth is... I like you. I really like you. I really REALLY like you, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\nYou expected her to start laughing at your vain attempt to confess to the hottest milf you've ever known. But what you DIDNT expect her to do was for her eyes widen in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...what?!\" she was actually surprised by you confession. Her jaw almost dropped from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued, \"I know youre a close friend of my mom. And I appreciate you looking after me after what happened to her. But to be honest, the time I spent with you really drew me close to you. I know you might be joking with me with those times you flirted with me... but the affection I grew with you was real. I mean, youre pretty, youre nice, youre smart, confident, a fun to be around, someone that really knows how to lift me when I'm down... youre perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at a loss for words at the moment. Did she not really think you'd grow THIS kind of attraction to her?!<br>\r\n\"B...but... m-m-my daughter... Cream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you interrupt her, \"you were right about what she thought of me. But even she knows I like you. I dont care that youre older or that you have a kid my age. I'd do everything I can to make it work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[R-Richie]! You...\" It was cute to see her so nervous like this. So THIS was where Cream got her bashfulness from! It especially felt good to finally take the lead with this woman!<br>\r\nYou grabbed one of her gloved hands with both of yours and caressed it while you looked Mrs. Rabbit right in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanilla Rabbit,\" you speak as her cheeks got red, \"would you kindly join me for dinner, movie, and, only if it's alright with you, a night of personal alone-time?\" You FINALLY said it. You finally said your peace. All that remained now was her answered. In your head, you crossed your fingers and hoped that turning down Cream wasnt a mistake...</span></div></div>",

She stretched her arms, yawned and said: \"Ahhhhhhhhh, this is so relaxing.\" She then leaned up against you with a smile on her face. You were kind of shocked, but you just went with the flow. \"You know,\" Vanilla said tracing her finger around your stomach, \"I really should give you a reward for helping me.\"<br>\r\n\"I couldn't,\" you say. \"You letting me live here is reward enough.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I insist.\" Vanilla said. She started to lean closer and closer to you. Her face was about a few inches from yours when she said: \"Here's your reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla then planted a big kiss on you, inserting her tongue into your mouth and swirling it around. Feelings of shock and sheer bliss eradicated your body. It took about a minute for Vanilla to break from the kiss. \"Now, wasn't that great?\" she said with a a smile. Before you could answer, you turn your head to see Cream with a horrified look on her face. Tears started to fall from her eyes. She then turned around and ran away, sobbing. Technically it wasn't your fault. It was Vanilla who kissed you, right? But you still felt guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you gonna do?</span></div></div>",

But ger shocked expression was replaced with an angry frown with tears still running down her hazel eyes. What you said didnt cheer her up. It only made her feel worse. Was that all she was to you?

I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sniff!* Get out!\" she screamed at you and immediately turned away from you, \"Get out now!\"<br>\r\nYou tried to plea with her, \"Cream, wait-\"<br>\r\n\"GET OUT!!!\" she shrieked just before jumping back on her bed and sobbing in her pillow. It was too late. You passed the point of no return. Because she clearly thought of you as more than just a 'friend'.<br>\r\nYou lowered your head and left her room in shame. 'Damnit,' you thought to yourself. You've just single-handedly destroyed a perfectly good friendship. All because deep down, you didnt have the courage to put her before her own mom. As much as you hate to admit it, and despite all the trouble it would get you into, you still had feelings for Vanilla.

After finally registering the action to back the hell away, you realized you jumped into the chest of your friendly seductive bikini-clad guardian, putting her gloved hands to her sleek slender hips!<br>\r\nIt took you a while to push your perverted fantasies aside and realize THIS is the woman who practically doomed your relationship with Cream!<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n\"...W..well what?\" you practically stuttered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is my daughter?!\" Vanilla got a little anger in her voice, \"You know, the girl who just ran away crying?!\" Is she yelling at you like it was YOUR fault?!<br>\r\n\"She's... she's very upset,\" too bad you didnt have the guts to raise your voice at her!<br>\r\nVanilla sighed, \"I shouldve known this was a bad idea... you were the only boy she was ever THAT comfortable hanging around with after all.\"<br>\r\nWhy doesnt she seem THAT remorseful making her daughter cry like that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I have to make it up to her.\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, she'll come around,\" Vanilla assures you, \"there's an extra warm towel in the kitchen to dry off with.\" And with that, she was about to walk off on you!<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" you grabbed her gloved hand! She turned back and raised an eyebrow at you.<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, [Rich]?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course something's the matter!\" you told her, \"YOURE the reason Cream's broken up!\"<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon! She caught you slipping me the tongue back in the pool!\" you remarked, \"how else do you think she'd react?!\"<br>\r\nBut Vanilla wasnt easy to break. The raised eyebrow she was giving you told you she wasnt gonna get beat by the likes of you!<br>\r\nIn fact, the next thing she said left you speechless:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then why didnt you stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What?\"<br>\r\n\"[Richie], I'm not that strong. If you didnt like my kiss, you couldve just as easily pushed me away!\" ....she had a good point! She even cave a cocky smirk, \"...Why didnt you?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh....um.....w....\" you were sweating bullets as your buxom wet friend dripped droplets on the floor as she waited for an answer.<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it,\" she put a gloved finger to her chin and assumed a typical anime-girl thinking pose, \"you were supposed to be doing homework. I never asked you to take a dip in the pool with me. Yet you put on some nice trunks and came running! It's almost as if you... volunteered. Why?\" Damn this woman! She had you cornered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clenched your fists, knowing you were cornered. To make matters worse, it was tough even LOOKING calm while gazing at your best friend's incredibly gorgeous mom barely covered in a rather skimpy bikini completely soaked head to toe.<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Maybe your little anxious friend there can answer my question!\" Vanilla pointed at your 'friend' sticking out in your shorts!<br>\r\n\"!!\" you blushed like crazy as you tried to 'straighten' your shorts out! Damn, as if you werent low enough, your boner had to seal your fate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" Vanilla lifted her chin at you and hmphed, \"I always thought you were better than that, [Richie]! A REAL man would own up to his mistakes... not point the blame on others!\" OUCH! The truth hurt like a sumbitch! Not only did you hurt Cream, it looks as though you lost points with Vanilla, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream's mom didnt even look back at you as she walked right passed you, not even bothering to look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat... you blew it with the two most important women in your life. You carried that heavy weight on your back all the way to your room.<br>\r\nSince youre already feeling worse than scum, wanna quit while youre behind and call it a night?</span></div></div>",

Besides, you share a room with Cream and she already hates your guts as is, so <b>that</b> wouldn't be a good idea. You just decided to sleep in the living room tonight. You felt REAL fucked up. You decide to watch TV, but all the channels were playing romance movies and TV shows. BET was playing \"Just Wright\", Disney Channel was playing \"Starstruck\", hell, even Nickelodeon was playing the series finale of Zoey 101!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to do. You thought about just giving up on life and running away, but it would hurt Cream AND Vanilla deeply, despite the fact that they both hate you right now, <i>especially</i> Cream. Maybe you could crash at Tails' place for a while, but it wouldn't do good to go up to his house in the middle of the night. You needed help, from the great beyond. No, not Satan. Someone nicer...... and less red. You went to the desk in between the living room and the couch and opened the bottom drawer. You find just what you were looking for: an old picture of your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" you started to say. You knew it was a picture, but you needed someone to talk to. \"I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cream was coming downstairs for a drink of water but stopped when she saw you. At first, she scowled in disgust, but she softened up when she found out what you were doing.<br>\r\nUnknowing of Cream's presence, you continued. \"I......... I don't know what to do. I really messed things up with Cream and Vanilla. I know you wanted me to be the man around their house, but...... I just feel like a little boy.\" You lowered your head to the table as you said this. You even started to cry a little. You haven't cried since Tikal punched you in the nose in seventh grade. \"I already lost one of the three most important women in my life. I don't want to lose the other two.\"<br>\r\nCream was shocked. Maybe she went a little to hard on you. It almost made her shed a tear. She turned around to head back upstairs when she saw her mother.<br>\r\n\"Spying on him again?\" Vanilla asked.<br>\r\nCream blushed and said: \"Maybe...\"<br>\r\n\"Go talk to him,\" Vanilla urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream went downstairs and approached you from behind. \"[your name], I-\"<br>\r\nYou got out the chair and were about to run. You didn't want to cause more trouble than you already had, but she grabbed your arm.<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" she resumed \"I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for being so mean to you before. Its just that I wanted to be more than just your friend. And I was mad because I wasn't your first kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what's your response?</span></div></div>",

You didnt even bother to think of the worst case in this situation; where she'd end up pretty pissed off by your suggestion, smack you across the face, and stomp out of the living room. However, it already slipped out of your mouth and there was no turning back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream's eyes widened when she turned back at you in surprise. Not like you had much time to notice, cuz just seconds after saying that, you immediately pressed your lips against hers and acted on that offer before she could refuse! Her eyes squinted in absolute shock as your lips locked with hers, savoring the very taste of them. They tasted just how you imagined a person who's never been kissed before tasted. Sweet and innocent. Kinda sensitive and a little defensive, but still warming and soothing. Not like Vanilla's lips... to you, they had a more mature and slightly dominating taste to them. Not that you minded it... it felt irresistible to you. You were drawn to them. Polar opposite to Cream's lips... they felt as if they drawn to YOURS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok... I'm ready to die now,' you thought to yourself, waiting for a swift smack in the face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" which never came! In fact, Cream closed her eyes and put a gloved hand to your cheek as she returned the fiery passion flowing in the mouth! She only let you go for a split second to take a breath before re-locking her 'innocent-tasting' lips to yours! You failed to notice you were kinda blushing as she was kissing you. Although, you did start to notice your body was beginning to weaken a little from her flaming lips! Isnt SHE supposed to be the one being reduced to putty right now?! You were starting to get the feeling she was lying about you being her first kiss! That sneaky little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" Is it just you or do you get the feeling you have a gloved finger rubbing against the crotch region of your pants?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...heh! Guess it must run in the family! Like mother like daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, just when it was starting to get good, the kiss ended. Your lips parted and you were practically left speechless as Cream gave off a cute little smirk...probably trying to rival her mother's!<br>\r\nYou wanted to say something, you felt OBLIGATED to say something, but nothing could come out of your mouth! Then again, you probably didnt need to say anything.<br>\r\n\"Good night... 'Friend'!\"Cream gave off a clever little wink and gently patted your cheek before turning around and heading back. You just stood there, staring in a daze over what just happened. Speaking of staring, as Cream walked away humming to herself, you coulda sworn you saw a leopard striped thong panty line peeking out her skirt!<br>\r\nOn the plus side, at least Cream no longer hates your guts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you two are guessing along just fine, huh?\"<br>\r\nA familiar heavenly voice snapped you out of your daze! You quickly turned around and got reacquainted with mouthwatering boobs-er-Cream's mom! She was sitting on the couch the whole time?! And now somewhat clothed in a nice pink fuzzy bathrobe... whether she's clothed UNDERNEATH it remains a mystery!<br>\r\n\"V-Vanilla!\" you wanted to shout, but you didnt want Cream to hear you! Looks like your job wasnt done just yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a gloved hand to her curvy hip and she was giving you the very smirk that her daughter probably couldnt dream to match!<br>\r\n\"Shouldnt you be fast asleep by now?\" she said, \" tomorrow's a school day after all.\"<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry,\" you lowered your head... only to quickly raise it back up so she wouldnt catch you staring at her chest! \"I was... I was... apologizing to Cream for hurting her...\"<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" Vanilla laughed, \"that's a heck of an apology! Heh... nice to see her finally stick her head out of the sand and come clean! I knew she had it in her... got it from me, ya know!\"<br>\r\nYou couldnt help but get a little suspicious, \"...T....this wasnt YOUR idea, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk! I only told her to TALK to you,\" she crossed her arms and kept grinning, \"not stick her tongue down your throat!\"<br>\r\nDespite her incredibly playful demeanor, you knew she meant well. It was yet another thing you loved about her. Not just as a guardian and as a friend... but as something closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Vanilla,\" you smiled back at her, \"I'm lucky to be living with someone as incredible as you.\"<br>\r\nHowever, Vanilla's smirk quickly vanished. And what was left behind was a sad frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you dont have to sugarcoat it, [Rich]. I know I'm way too old for a strapping young lad like you...\" she sighed.<br>\r\n\"That's not true, Vanilla!\" you tried to explain as you sat next to her on the couch, \"Youre-\"<br>\r\nBut Vanilla immediately got up, \"I know when I'm beat... I have to make room for the youngblood.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon! Wait!\" you grabbed her hand, but she quickly pulled it away and turned away from you.<br>\r\n\"Cream's obviously your ideal choice,\" you heard her sigh, \"she's young, she's pretty, she's clearly a better kisser...\" 'THAT'S debatable!' you think to yourself, but you dare not say that out loud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm betting she'll blossom even better than I did, too,\"  she started walking off with a bit of a sway to her hips... she was probably faking her depression, but damned if it wasnt working on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lied back on the couch, thinking rather hard about what Vanilla said. Maybe she's right. Maybe you should stick with Cream. She is indeed the ideal choice for you (sorta!) And damned if you dont like her.<br>\r\nWhile Vanilla is most definitely hot, there is still that age gap... she's just about old enough to be your mother. Speaking of, she was your mother's best friend too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you just couldnt toss her aside like that. So what if she's older? You still love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I'm thinking too hard about this,\" you say to yourself as you closed your eyes. You wanted to sleep... but not until you made the choice. Will you or will you not give up on Vanilla? Is it still possible?!</span></div></div>",

She must have gotten out of bed the same time you did. She turns to you with a smile on her face. \"Good morning,\" she says. You give her the same greeting and the two of you get ready for school.

You havent heard a single peep out of any of your fellow classmates regarding the thing between you and Cream. No whispers, no odd stares, nothing! It's not even in an article of the school's sleazy tabloid newspaper, Daily Dirty Laundry. That could only mean that Rouge for once kept her big mouth, unlike her legs, shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was refreshing that you didnt have to explain it to anybody or go into detail about it. For all they knew, Cream was your foster sister and Vanilla was your fine ass foster mom that some of the boys jerk off to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Vanilla...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after last night, you still cant get her out of your head. You had deep feelings for her, VERY deep feelings. Whether or not she felt the same for you or was just teasing you about it, your feelings were still there. You hope she'll be doing alright without you.<br>\r\nEh, who are you kidding? Of course she'll be alright. There's plenty of fine young men in the world that are a much better choice for her than you. A hot single woman like her could have ANY man in the world. What would she want in a dumb kid like you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, why the hell are you thinking such things?! You got a new girl, so forget about the old one.<br>\r\nAt least thanks to Rouge not blabbing it to everybody, at least no one was throwing it in your face and asking you tons of questions and spreading MORE rumors about you!<br>\r\nBecause of this, the school day goes along fine halfway through. You managed to survive all the way to PE, once of your favorite classes. A physical workout to make up for sitting in a chair and listening to boring lectures for the last couple of hours. Not to mention, the perfect time to oggle the girls in tight PE uniforms like cute little Amy and of course Rouge. Despite being a chatterbox, you didnt mind standing on your number behind Rouge during the warm-up exercises.... especially when she bent over to touch her toes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited patiently for your teacher to arrive as the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, your teacher finally showed up. Not your regular teacher, but a substitute.<br>\r\nAnd it just so happens this substitute was a familiar face... with a familiar bod to match!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere walked Vanilla sporting a skimpy red tank top that barely concealed her black and purple polka dot bra strap and a pair of blue daisy duke shorts that showed off her curves quite nicely! You stared in absolute shock while your male fellow students stared in dazed lust. You forgot that she was a part-time substitute teacher at this school... you just never saw her substitute any of YOUR classes before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, kids!\" Vanilla said with a heartfelt energetic smile!<br>\r\n\"GOOD AFTERNOON!\" said the rest of the class while you still stared in shock.<br>\r\n\"Well, as you mightve noticed, your teacher Mr. Hunterson called in sick today. I'll be your temporary teacher, Ms. Rabbit. But you can call me Vanilla, cuz I'm just sweet and tasty!\" She giggled to herself. The rest of the class laughed along with her, probably cuz theyre still in a lust-driven daze! You still stared in shock.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just grest to see such strapping young men and gorgeous young women so anxious to keep their youthful bodies in shape!\" Vanilla said anxiously, \"I'm supposed to do a roll call, but you know what? I'm gonna skip that. Anyone dumb enough to not show up today is just missing out on seeing such nice eye candy, aint I right boys?\"<br>\r\n\"YES VANILLA!\" the class obediently replied.<br>\r\n\"Good! Let's start with some warmups!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the rest of the class did a bit of breathing exercises, arm stretches, leg warm ups, jumping jacks, and of course the bending to touch your toes portion. You tried desperately not to stare down Vanilla's blouse while she graciously bent over along with the class. You also tried not to peek at her succulent cleavage unprotected by the skimpy shirt like the rest of the boys of the class! Each time you snuck glances, you dropped your head back down as if fearing Cream\u2019s was gonna pop out from between her mother\u2019s boobs and slap you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 now that was quite a warmup, wasn\u2019t it, class?\u201d Vanilla\u2019s sigh was beyond heavenly, \u201cnow that THAT\u2019S out of the way, let\u2019s get started on the main attraction. According to these notes, your teach was in the middle of teaching you dodge ball, but you know what? That\u2019s boring and it\u2019s WAY too hot. Instead, we\u2019ll be taking a dip in the pool to cool down!\u201d<br>\r\nDip in the pool?!<br>\r\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re gonna be practicing a couple of strokes. Everyone\u2019ll be assigned a partner for this exercise.\u201d She went down the list of who's gonna be partnered with who. Surprisingly, everyone has a partner... except YOU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, one person short,\" Vanilla remarked, \"well, since [Richard]'s the odd one out, I'LL be his partner!\" SHE'S GONNA BE YOUR PARTNER?! \"Everybody hurry up and get dressed in your swimming clothes!\" And with that, the rest of the class rushed to the dressing rooms to get changed. Everyone, but you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Vanilla, who didnt need to. Right then and there, she pulled off her red tank top,slightly freeing her bouncy chest save the luckiest polkadotted bikini top in the world! You swallowed hard, before you could start to salivate!<br>\r\nShe then unzipped her daisy dukes and bent over again as she slid them off her long lovely legs. You tried not to drop your jaw at Vanilla's gorgeous body clad in one of your personal favorite typical beach swimwear she sports!<br>\r\nYou kept repeating 'Cream... Cream... Cream...' in your head as she headed toward the school pool. She walked away with a hand to her hip as her bunny tail slowly and seductively swung, signaling for her potential mate to come hither!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream... Cream... CREAM!\" you repeated out loud! Do you dare dress up and fit your role for your partner? Or skip out and sit on the side?</span></div></div>",

You shot a couple glances at Cream during the warm-up exercises and you noticed that Cream got more and more irritated as time went on. How dare Vanilla do this to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, being a substitute at the school is Vanilla's <b>job</b>. Unless you wanted to have no food on the table, she had to work.

You expected her to use a teasing tone of voice, but instead she used a more motherly, concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you answer coldly. Part of you regretted saying it like that, but another part of you felt that you had every right to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla had a look of slight shock for a second before continuing. \"Why not?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel like swimming.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're lying to me, [your name]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because a mother knows.\" Vanilla wanted to take that sentence back the second it came out of her mouth. She felt like she had no right to say that, knowing that she wasn't your mother. She thought that she offended you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought that she had no business saying that, but then you felt comforted that she cares about you like any good mother would care about her beloved son.

I'm in a relationship now, and you're making it really hard for me to stay faithful to Cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of silence, then Vanilla spoke up. \"Okay, I understand.\" she says. \"I'm sorry. I admit that I got a little carried away.\" she paused for a second. \"You don't have to swim if you don't want to.\" As she walked out, though, she turned back to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, [your name],\" she said before leaving the room, \"if it's really that hard to resist, then maybe you made your choice too quickly.\" She said that in the most honest, down-to-earth way she could, because she meant every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she said hit you hard, maybe you should stay in the gym to think about what she said.</span></div></div>",

You bounced the stupid ball, not caring if you'd end up cracking the floor (ok, so maybe you didnt bounce it THAT hard!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasnt very long before you got tired of bouncing the ball and chucked it across the other side of the gym, sick of playing with it! <br>\r\n\"Ugh... what am I doing?\" you sighed to yourself, \"it's not the ball's fault I cant make up my mind.\"<br>\r\nMorally wise, you know you made the right choice choosing the daughter over the mother. Cream's right for you. She's smart, clever, pretty, not nearly as overly seductive as her mother, and would probably attain her mother's figure when she becomes Vanilla's age. And you'd be experiencing that joy growing up with her.<br>\r\nBut who cares about morals?! Who cares if Vanilla's twice your age?! Who cares if she's too much for you to handle?! Who cares if Vanilla has a wide selection of men that are possibly better than you in every way?! Who cares if a single sway of her bunny tail on cue to the sway of her round luscious ass is scientifically proven to cause ordinary mortal men to die of a nosebleed?! Who cares if a relationship with her is illegal in this country?! The heart wants what it wants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream is gonna kill me if she ever finds out,\" you say to yourself.<br>\r\nBut the more you try to avoid thinking about it, the more you end up thinking about it! Of course, it doesnt help when you have Vanilla's bikini burnt in your mind.<br>\r\nSince just standing there twiddling your thumbs aint helping, you might as well get some fresh air.<br>\r\nYou open one of the doors of the gym and get a peek outside toward the direction of the swimming pool. Everyone else seems to be having a good time over there, splashing, giggling, practicing exercises, etc. At first you get a few pervy thoughts watching Amy Rose putting her hands on Rouge's skimpy bathing suit, trying to keep her afloat... then you look over near the shallow end and stare at some jerk putting their filthy hands on Cream's body trying to 'keep her afloat'. Even though she didnt seem to mind being touched by another guy, you most certainly did.<br>\r\nThen you looked over to the deep side of the pool and watched some undeserving loser rub his hands up and down Vanilla's scantly clad figure failing to keep her afloat! Simpleton thinks he can upstage YOU?! If you were over there, you'd have no problem keeping Ms. Rabbit afloat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But youre not over there. Youre in the gym beating yourself up over a silly fantasy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass passed by with little to nothing else happening. You went back to the locker room and got dressed, ignoring the gossip and held back the urge to sock the undeserving loser in the breadbasket. By the time you got out, Cream had already left for class. You felt incredibly miserable for thinking about her mom so much and wanted to do something, ANYTHING to make up for it (except give up on her mom, of course!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fate, being the cruel bitch that she is, forced you to get another glance at Vanilla. Sadly, she was no longer in her bikini or even in her skimpy shorts and tank top. She was no sporting a purple business woman's suit that looked pretty good on a bod like hers. The shirt could hide a pair of large gozangas pretty well, and her skirt, though not very high, looked perfect on a pair of legs that could make a grown man cry. ...Damnit, why did your dad have to be a rock-hard Rolling Stones fan?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of grown man, you spotted her chatting it up with a big tall handsome grown man, possibly of bird-anthro origin. Hawk, you think. You knew him well as your 7th period Biology teacher, Dr. Crane Hawkson, emphasis on 'doctor' because he's got a medical degree. He coulda made a living off being a doctor, instead he decided to stick to teaching. Despite being wealthy and smart, he was good looking... uh... or at least as good looking as a bird-man can get. Half the girls in your class drool when he starts an hour long lecture. You almost shuddered at the thought of the time he taught you about sexual anatomy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had everything you wish you had... including Vanilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want to talk to me about?\" you spied on the two talking at a far enough distance, \"you said it was important. Important enough to be late for your next class?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah... my class would.. definitely notice if I was late,\" Mr. Hawkson scratched the back of his head, \"but I'm willing to take that chance! Listen, we've known eachother for almost a year, havent we?\"<br>\r\n\"That we have,\" Vanilla agreed.<br>\r\nMr. Hawkson blushed... any mortal teenaged girl that saw him blush woulda exploded into flames! \"...Yes... and well... I was... sortof hoping we can get to know eachother even more.\"<br>\r\nOh crap. You didnt like where this was going. Even HE has a thing for your crush?! You could hear the sound of your chances plummeting!<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Vanilla tilted her head, somehow ignorant of his attraction!<br>\r\n\"Eh... you know what?\" Mr. Hawkson said, \"maybe we can talk about it more after school. Preferably... tonight... over dinner and a movie? My treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth at what you saw! He's asking YOUR woman (or mother of your woman) out on a date!! You couldnt contain yourself at that moment! You tried to convince yourself that you shouldnt feel jealous, but damnit, you do! Worse even, you know he'd be the perfect man for her! Who wouldnt wanna marry a gorgeous doctor?!<br>\r\nYou should feel happy for her. He's helping you put some sense into your head!<br>\r\nBut.... but....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seemed like an hour of mental anguish but was really about 10 seconds, Vanilla gave him an answer...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You nearly died when you heard Vanilla's answer. It practically echoed in your mind. You had nothing against Mr. Hawkson. He was a great teacher. He wasn't too strict, but he wasn't a whiny pushover either. He's the reason why Science isn't your least favorite class anymore. However, he was asking Vanilla on a date. The shit has hit the fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you plan on taking me to dinner?\" Vanilla asks your teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was hoping we could go to the local diner. Nothing fancy.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's perfect!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize that your next class was Biology. You needed to get there before Mr. Hawkson did. You quietly sneak out of the gym then dash toward the science lab. You walk inside and take the only available seat, which was between Sonic and Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, where've you been?\" he asks. \"You're lucky that Mr. Hawkson is late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" you say, preoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then leans closer to you and whispers in your ear. \"Were you late because you and Cream had a quick make-out session?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Rouge a deadly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late, class.\" your teacher says as he walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Mr. Hawkson.\" all the girls in your class say in unison, while all the boys roll their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what I would like to do to him.\" Rouge mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't enough guys been in your pants already?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your damn business!\" she snaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, Mr. Hawkson stopped you from leaving and let the other students leave. Rouge stuck her tongue out at you when she left. \"Are you okay, [your name]?\" he asks. You're a little... off today. Is something wrong? You're usually very lively in class, but you seemed preoccupied.\" That was another thing about your teacher. He cared about the students' well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, Mr. Hawkson,\" you say. \"Just have a lot of stuff on my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, you were still sulking. Walking home with Cream made you feel better, but you were still sulking. Then you get an idea. If you go on a date with Cream to the same places where Vanilla and your teacher were going, then you could spy on them, and spend some time with Cream, too. You ask Cream to go out with you and what does she say?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No thanks,\" Cream reluctantly answers you, \"I got to meet with Amy for a private cram session later. Mrs. Renard said the next test was worth 70% of the grade.\" Bummer. <br>\r\n...70% of the grade?! So if she aced every homework assignment and every other pop quiz and exam, she could STILL fail?! That is just... unjust!<br>\r\nWait. How come youre more upset about THAT than you are about being turned down for your date?! She just shot you down! You wont get to spend any 'private' time with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you tried to sound more disappointed than you really were, \"...well... I understand. Mrs. Renard can be pretty brutal.\"<br>\r\n\"When she's sober,\" you heard Cream mutter. You pretended not to hear. Your mind was still kinda clouded by Hawkson and Vanilla. \"Anyways, maybe after the test is over!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" you nodded, realizing you mighta sounded a little TOO happy! You should be upset at least. You're gonna want to spy on Vanilla and teach, you'll have to do it by yourself! That should suck, right?! You cant go out on your own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or can you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, along the way, Cream caught up with Amy and headed with her, waving goodbye to you. You stared at the two heading off, barely listening in on their little conversation. Odds are, Amy was probably bragging about Sonic actually talking to her or something stupid. Amy was a cute girl... but there's a reason you wouldnt go visit her. You could image her whole bedroom was littered with pictures of Sonic! If anything, maybe she wears pajamas with pictures of Sonic on it! Hell, you bet she has a tattoo of Sonic SOMEWHERE on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And I let Cream have a private cram session with her?\" you said to yourself. You then shrugged it off and walked home all by your lonesome. You kinda NEEDED to be alone, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little walking, you finally made it back home. Vanilla's car was parked, so she was there too. You swallowed hard as MORE thoughts clouded your mind.<br>\r\n\"Easy,\" you tell yourself and head inside, \"easy.\"<br>\r\nYou try to avoid any contact with Cream's mom. Fortunately, she was too preoccupied with her little dip in the pool to cross your path. Unfortunately, even from a distance, she STILL distracted you! As you fixed yourself a quick sandwich, you could not prevent yourself from admiring the bathing bunny beauty still sporting her polkadot bikini as she splashed around in her pool. Even from afar, you could STILL see how well her boobs jiggle in her top as she swam about!<br>\r\n'Cream, Cream, Cream, Cream!' you tell yourself in your head as you headed out of the kitchen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your sandwich in the living room, then took a nice COLD shower. After cooling down the intensity, you headed to Cream's room to clear your head. Having a lot of homework helped, cuz it took a bit of your time. There was also a Yu Gi Oh marathon going on, so you watched that while you did your homework.<br>\r\nAfter a while of watching, you squinted your eyes at the screen.<br>\r\n\"...Odd...\" you say to yourself, \"is it just me or does that Yugi guy sound an awful lot like Knuckles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock*<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock on Cream's door. You shut off the tv and answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya [Richie]!\" announced Vanilla in such a high-pitched uppity ready-to-face-the-world tone!<br>\r\n\"Hey Vanilla!\" you felt obligated to reply back in a uppity ready-to-face-the-world tone too (although your voice cant go high-pitch!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you were about to ask what she wanted, you noticed her wearing yet ANOTHER brand new costume! This time, she was sporting a cute purple coat over a pink tank top with a picture of a cartoon bunny rabbit, a pretty satin purple skirt that reaches just above the knee, black shoes over white long kneesocks, and a cute pink handbag... with an even CUTER carrot hairclip! And STILL white gloves! A hot foxy lady like her trying to pull off 'cute' would be easier said than done... but with VANILLA, it was a mission accomplished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she already noticed that by the way your jaw was dropping as you stared!<br>\r\nVanilla giggled and asked, \"So? How do I look?\" She twirled around as she showed it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's.... it's incredible!\" was the only word to describe it, \"but.... isnt that CREAM'S outfit?\"<br>\r\nVanilla just smirked and shook her head, \"Actually it used to be one of MY old outfits that I'm letting Cream use! So many years later and it STILL fits me!\" She tried to hold back the urge to cry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.... uh... um...\" you pretended to act dumb even though you already know why she's wearing that, \"...what's the occasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right! Almost forgot,\" Vanilla regained herself, \"I'm gonna go out with one of my associates from work...\" Mr. Hawkson. \"...Er... I dont wanna say 'on a date'. It's not a date. Just a little dinner is all. Nothing fancy.\" Whether she was sincere about it not really being a date will remain a mystery. \"And I know Cream's out studying with that pink girl. So youre gonna be on your own for dinner tonight. I let some money on the table if you wanna order a pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, V,\" you put on a smile and say, \"I hope you two have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla's smile went great with that cute outfit she had on. If she were a couple years younger, she'd be Cream's cuter older sister. If she were a couple years younger, she'd probably end up being your girlfriend instead of Cream... hm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your uneasiness as always, Vanilla frowned, \"L-Listen. Youre... youre not still upset about before... are you?\" Of course it had to come back to this.<br>\r\nIt was a lot harder to answer that question than you led on, \"No! Of course not!  I just... I was out of line when I went off at you earlier. I shouldnt have said those stupid things like I did. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry!\" Vanilla uppity cute voice matched her cute smile and cute outfit, \"a face as cute as yours is worth forgiving!\"<br>\r\n\"So youre not mad at me?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah...\" Vanilla's voice returned to normal, \"just a little jealous. I wish I had a boyfriend as sweet as Cream's.\" She said the absolute perfect response that could cause your face to go red like a cherry! From someone like Cream's mom, it meant a lot. An awful lot. She always knew how to push your buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" your smile was more sincere, \"just be careful what you wish for!\" You even winked when you said it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly crap, now SHE'S blushing! Dang... even the cute blush matched her cute outfit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... oh dear!\" she looked to her watch, \"look at the time! I still gotta get ready or Crane's gonna think I ditched him! Think you'll be alright by yourself tonight?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be fine,\" you tell her, \"you go have fun. Just dont stay out too late!\"<br>\r\nVanilla giggled, \"Yes, DAD!\" And walked off, swaying her bunny tail with ease! You stared at how happy and joyful it swung around as she walked...<br>\r\n\"Stop staring at my tail [Richie],\" Vanilla sensed you were looking... but continued to seductively sway her heavenly hips back and forth, forcing you to keep looking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped back into Cream's room, still thinking about the whole situation. You practically told her it was over and done with... but it really wasnt. Part of you STILL wanted Vanilla and you knew part of her still wanted you. The way she blushed when you made that simple joke... really left a mark in your mind. Could there possibly STILL be something between you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I... or shouldnt I?\" you ask yourself. Should you go spying on Vanilla's date by yourself?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of COURSE there was something between you and Vanilla! The way Vanilla would sway her hips back and forth, the way she kissed you with unrivaled passion in the pool the other day, the way that she would always give you a warm, comforting hug whenever you needed it (or whenever she wanted to see you blush!). This was all proof that at the very least, she didn't see you as simply a foster son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you didn't see Vanilla as a foster mother either. Sure, she was your mom\u2019s best friend who took you in when you needed her most, but she was also incredibly beautiful, sweet and charming. You didn't give a rat\u2019s ass about the age gap, but you also didn't want to hurt Cream. Ugh! You clearly still had a lot to think about regarding the whole \u2018mother-daughter\u2019 situation, and Vanilla\u2019s \u2018date\u2019 with your biology teacher certainly wasn't helping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything though, you couldn't bring yourself to go and spy on Crane and Vanilla. It wouldn't be right to Crane, because he wasn't really doing anything wrong, and it CERTAINLY wouldn't be right by Vanilla. It might sound cheesy, clich\u00e9d, or whatever you wanted to call it, but you knew that it would just be best to stay home and let things run their course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you have a great time, Vanilla...\u201d you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, glossing over the unfinished homework at your desk and doing whatever you could that didn't require too much effort. You weren't able to focus on your homework either, as homework would remind you of school, which would remind you of biology, which would remind you of Dr. Hawkson, which would remind you that he was currently on a date with Vanilla. You had to do something, anything, that would help get your mind off of the soap opera that your life had seemed to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTelevision: numbing the brains of children for decades...\u201d you mumbled. It was decided. You\u2019d spend the night watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading downstairs, you went into the kitchen and checked over how much money Vanilla had left you. You then went about your business ordering a pizza, leaving change for Vanilla. After ordering, you sat yourself down on the couch and switched on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were mindlessly flicking through channels, you remembered that they were showing a new episode of How I Met Your Mother tonight. Seeing as there was nothing better to watch, you shrunk back in your seat, readying yourself for an uneventful night in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you were brought to your feet by a knock at the door. Grabbing the money on the table, you headed over and opened the front door to be greeted by a rather unhappy-looking pizza delivery boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, dude. Here\u2019s your pizza.\u201d the delivery boy said with almost no emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d you said cheerfully, trying to raise the boy\u2019s spirits because it looked like he needed some help. Giving the delivery boy the exact total for the pizza, he then gave you your pizza. You shut the door and went back over to the couch, setting the box down and opening it slowly. The steam seemed to erupt out of the box as it mixed with the cool night time air. You closed your eyes and allowed the aromas of the pizza to waft. Whatever food that Vanilla was eating on her date couldn't be better than this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wound up eating the whole pizza by yourself as you mulled over your thoughts, barely involving yourself with the events of the situational comedy on the television. Eventually, the show was over and you switched the TV off. Throwing the empty pizza box in the trash, you were just about to head upstairs to Cream\u2019s room. You heard the doorknob of the front door twist and turn, causing you to glance back at the door as it swung open with great gusto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned around, you could see that...</span></div></div>",

Hm, Hawkson doesnt seem to be there with her. Normally, Vanilla's the type that would gladly GLADLY invited prized guests into her house, and youre pretty sure Mr. Hawkson wouldnt say no. In fact, he'd probably stick around to spend most of the night pop quizing you on the upcoming exam you still havent studied for!<br>\r\nBut he's not there. Worst even, Vanilla's happy care-free smile she had on when she left didnt come back with her! Her face was practically devoid of any happy smiley sunshiney bliss. It's like she caught whatever that delivery boy had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Vanilla!\" you smiled back at her and waved as she stepped in.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she muttered, not even looking at you as she walked past. The way her bunny tail swayed low with unhappiness told you that the date didnt go well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok, Vanilla?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Vanilla still didnt give you any eye contact. Not seeing her happy made you unhappy. You react the same way if a guy treated Cream bad, so of course you wouldnt let a guy treating Cream's mom bad fly.You got up off the couch and followed her.<br>\r\n\"The night didnt go out well?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ms. Rabbit stopped walking and sighed. \"No, it went great. Crane was such a gentleman the whole night. We had dinner, we danced, we saw Tim Burton's 'The Ten Commandments' in 3D...\"<br>\r\n\"I KNEW IT! I FRIGGIN KNEW HE'D REMAKE THAT MOVIE!!\" you suddenly blurted out of nowhere, then covered your mouth and blushed, \"S...sorry, go on.\"<br>\r\n\"It was wonderful!\" Vanilla said, \"then the night ended and we were gonna say goodbye... then he leaned in and tried to kiss me and...\"<br>\r\nYour eyes widened a little \"...And?\"<br>\r\nShe sighed, \"...And I backed away from him! I chickened out! The guy treated me like a queen and the least I could do was give him a kiss... and I couldnt even do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... oh....\" you blinked for a few seconds, slightly dumbfounded by her explanation of being upset. Didnt seem like something YOU'D be all gloomy about, but you and her are two different species in more ways than one!<br>\r\n\"I cant believe it!\" Vanilla got upset, \"this is not like me at all! I'm the strong, assertive type! I'm not someone who'd just freeze up when a cute guy puckers his lips up close to mine! I'm someone who'd grab him by the hair and shove my tongue down his throat!\"<br>\r\n\"That's for damn sure,\" you tried HARD to hold back a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla lowered her head and whimpered, \"Oh, why did I have to snub him like that? Now he's gonna think I hate him! Why couldnt I have just... I mean it wasnt like it was hard!\" Truer words have never been spoken. She showed absolutely no fear when she kissed YOU... and in front of her daughter, no less!<br>\r\n\"Eh dont sweat it,\" you assure her, \"I'm sure you'll be able to make it up to him tomorrow.\"<br>\r\nUnfortunately Vanilla just shook her head, \"The PE teacher's coming back tomorrow. I'm gonna be too busy with another boring desk job to get in touch with him.\" Bummer.<br>\r\n\"Did you get his phone number at least?\"<br>\r\nVanilla gritted her teeth and facepalmed, as if realizing she just did a stupid STUPID thing, \"No, I didnt.\" Bummer again.<br>\r\n\"...Did he get yours?\"<br>\r\n\"No... he... didnt...\" Vanilla continued to facepalm. Bummer to the third power. \"Great! Now he's gonna think I'm trying to avoid him! How could I be so stupid?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. And you thought YOU suck at first impressions! What a shame. Hawkson would kill to have a woman like your stepmom. She's probably the only woman in town that can match the irresistability he has! You'd be lying if you said part of you wasnt the least bit happy that the 'date' didnt go well, but she was still family. You hate to see her so down like she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, V,\" you try to comfort her, \"if it makes you feel any better, I can help you change a lightbulb in the kitchen again.\" You said with a sly wink.<br>\r\n\"Sorry [Richard],\" unfortunately, it did not work, \"I dont think Cream will appreciate that.\" Oh right. You almost forgot. Cream is getting tired of her mother trying to feel up her boyfriend! You'd be lying if you said part of you wasnt gonna miss that. \"I'm just gonna get out of these stupid cutesy clothes and go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n\"You sure you dont want any company?\" Vanilla just gave you a cold stare after you made that perverted remark, \"...sorry! I was just joking!\" Ugh... unbelievable! Not even flirting works! And flirting ALWAYS works!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late, [Richard],\" she tells you, \"you need to be getting some sleep too.\"<br>\r\nYou nodded, \"Ok. Would you like a good night kiss first?\"<br>\r\nVanilla still gave you a cold stare, \"Need I remind you it's still a school night? And Cream's not gonna be here to shake you up if you oversleep.\"<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and nodded, \"I'm sorry. I promise I'll get up bright and early.\"<br>\r\n\"Good. Good night, [Richard].\"<br>\r\n\"Good night, Vanilla.\" And with that, she headed back to her room. Her tail continued to sag depressingly low as she walked, seemingly out of place with the sway of her-<br>\r\n\"STOP STARING AT MY FUCKING TAIL!\" Holy crap! That was one angry shout Vanilla gave you! Oh dear, she was actually serious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORRY! Sorry!!\" you kept apologizing over and over until she slammed the bedroom door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonderful. What seemed like the beginning of a great night ended with a tragic finish. Vanilla was really broken up about the 'date'. This wasnt like her at all. You, being her number 1 man of the house had an obligation to cheer her up, but not at the risk of ruining your chances with Cream, your CURRENT girlfriend. You tell yourself that it's perfectly natural to feel bad for Cream's mother, considering she was your care-taker for so many years and you love her like a real mother. But you shouldnt get too involved. Part of you still has a tremendous crush on her and if you go too far, her daughter will never forgive you. Besides, it looks like SHE'S trying to be mature about it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suck that feeling back down and head to Cream's room. For the first time in a long while, you slept in Cream's bed. You almost forgotten how comfortable her big soft cozy bed was (since you always had to sleep in the makeshift mattress in the corner). It almost melted all your cares away... almost. <br>\r\nStill, despite how incredibly comfy Cream's bed was, you were having way too much trouble trying to sleep. Just when it seemed like the night was gonna end on a high note, the fat lady pukes up her spoiled lasagna.<br>\r\nBut in all's fairness, youre not the one who's having the problem. Vanilla is. And the way she reacted that pretty much ruined the date seemed a little off. And now she was practically beating herself up over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you wonder why she would be so adamant about it, but then one real good guess came to mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's really that hard to resist, then maybe you made your choice too quickly,\" you repeat the same exact words she said to you and smiled. Could she perhaps have a hard time getting over you? As you ponder THAT, sleep suddenly comes much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning comes and youre up with the chickens. You stretch, yawn, change your clothes, and head to the kitchen, ready to take on a brand new day, despite the day involving school. You headed to the kitchen to make yourself some breakfast, and immediately spot your dear old step-mom sitting by her lonesome sipping on a cup of coffee and eating a slice of toast. She looked a little groggy and worn out. Guess she didnt sleep well last night. Too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was still upset about last night. Despite her telling you off, you wanted to cheer her up. Lift her spirits! But you probably didnt wanna give her mixed signals if she's having a hard time getting over you as you were with her.<br>\r\nBut you cant ignore her. You'd have to cross her path to get to breakfast. Making contact is inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and walked into the kitchen, then...</span></div></div>",

You saw it and she knew you saw it! BOO-YAH!! That kiss totally lifted her spirits! You clearly made your step-mom happy! This single moment made that awful end of last night totally worth it! Your ego certainly swelled up just by making Vanilla happy, but in all honestly, you were always the type that would bend over backwards just to make her smile.<br>\r\nIn the long run, there was very little you wouldnt do just to put a smile on your beloved step mom's face. If she comes back from work feeling miserable after getting chewed out by her boss over a slight misunderstanding (emphasis on SLIGHT), you'd gladly take a shower with the door 'accidentally' left open if it meant peeking her curiosity would make her feel better. Cream would probably not appreciate that, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry about last night,\" you sit down and whisper to her, \"I'm sure Mr. Hawkson'll be psyched for a second date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I made a complete doofus of myself,\" she sighed, \"I mean I put this whole 'gonna get ya' charade and then I suddenly broke down just as soon as he leans in for the kiss.\"<br>\r\n\"He probably thinks he's gonna need to work harder to get that kiss!\" you tell her with confidence as you swiped a piece of toast off her plate and bit into it, \"I bet he's gonna be sweating the next time he speaks to you.\"<br>\r\nShe giggled, \"You really think so?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" you answered with no doubt whatsoever, \"you probably took a stab at that guy's pride. I mean the other girls at my class practically drool over him. He could probably get anybody! It's probably a total shock that the great Vanilla Rabbit failed to become putty in his hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled some more! Success times infinity! Boy are you good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough talking smack about one of your teachers and MY co-worker,\" she tells you, \"hurry up and get your things.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" you smirked, \"but mind if I take a quick shower first?\"<br>\r\n\"You know I never do!\" she said with a chuckle, \"but Cream'll murder me. Just get your stuff and let's go.\"<br>\r\nAnd so you get your things and follow your stepmom from behind to the car, admiring her tail swinging gleefully as she walks thanks to you lifting her spirits!<br>\r\n\"Are you staring at my tail again?\" Vanilla questioned you... no doubt with a sly smile as her hips seductively swayed back and forth, helping rock her gleeful tail left to right.<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" you lie through the skin of your teeth. You hope to God that Cream never finds out what just happened here! You had to constantly remind yourself that SHE was your girlfriend, not her mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre gonna be subbing my class again, today?\" you asked her during the ride in the car.<br>\r\n\"No, not today,\" she answered, \"Today, Principal DeGrey wants me to spend the entire day trying to find out who gratified the school mural again.\"<br>\r\n\"They did it again?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" she answered without even blinking, \"they even drew a nice little gang insignia to let us know just who these wonderful little artists were. Danged if we knew what gang this even is, though.\" Well, that's a problem. More jerks organized together just to start some shit at your school, eh? This looks like a job for the A-team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to talk to Rouge and see if she can get her friends involved in tracking this gang down?\" you offered, but Vanilla shook her head.<br>\r\n\"It's best you dont,\" she warned, \"last week, we've seen a few poor innocent students end up in the nurse's offices bruised and beaten with that same stupid insignia drawn on their foreheads.\" Oh crap. Sounds like they mean business, \"For the time being, it's best you dont say a word.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, I wont,\" you promised. Well youre a bit worried now.  If Vanilla wants you to keep this discreet, this gang must be a threat. You hope your friends will be ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride over, both of you got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you see anything off today,\" Vanilla whispered, \"you tell me immediately, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, absolutely,\" you tell her, \"please be careful.\"<br>\r\n\"You too. And... please keep an eye on my little girl. Make sure she's alright. Youre the only man I trust with her.\"<br>\r\n...Only man she trusts with her. GOD IT FELT SO GOOD HEARING THOSE WORDS COME OUT OF VANILLA'S MOUTH! Hearing something so commemorating as that made you feel so big, you could take on this whole entire mysterious gang with nothing but your bare fists! Cream is super safe in the hands of a man like you! Who da man?! YOU DA MAN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, being da man had it's disadvantages. One, you were walking awfully slow that you wasted too much time and you didnt realize that until the bell for first period rang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph!\u201d<br>\r\nTwo, was that you werent watching where you were going and you didnt realize that until you bumped into a girl. Fortunately, you didnt hurt her, let along knock any books out of her hands\u2026 cuz she wasnt carrying any. She didnt even have a backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry!\u201d the rather cute black haired human girl in thick spectacles quickly bowed and apologized then immediately ran off before you could even say a word. Sheesh, in an awful big hurry, wasnt she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and sighed before heading off to-wait. Does your pocket feel a bit lighter?<br>\r\nYour smile dropped with suspicion as you dug your hand  in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOUR WALLET'S GONE!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDID THAT GIRL JUST JACK YOUR WALLET?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING STANDING AROUND?! GO GET HER!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! No, dont do that. You waste time chase after her, youre gonna be incredibly late for class or theyre gonna think youre trying to ditch. Besides, you remember what Vanilla said. There's a rough gang prowling around. What if you end up bumping into them chasing your wallet back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there are things in that wallet! Not money, youre broke as a joke. Certain things you cant afford to lose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake up your mind fast, youre running out of time! Time to make it to class AND time to catch up with that cute thief!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crap. Crap! CRAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap crap crap crap crap crap crap CRAP!!!! She's giving you that cold glare. You know. The one she used to give when you or Cream screw up REALLY bad. It truly lets the both of you know what you did was wrong and youre in big BIG trouble for it! Sure it was Cream that got the majority of the glares, but the very few times you get it... boy do they stick.<br>\r\nOne of the problems with having a strong assertive step mom that likes to fool around. She's still the strong assertive step mom when she's mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust seconds after being given the 'How Dare You' glare, your resolves shatters like glass after being sat on by Big the Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I'm s-s-sorry,\" you shivered a little and sat in your chair with your head hung low, \"I just... th-thought I could... cheer you up, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla sighed as she spread butter on a slice of toast and put one on your plate, \"Hurry up and eat your toast.\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes ma'am,\" you nodded, quietly eating your piece of toast. After that, no noise at all besides the crunching of your toast. Awful silence echoed through the room. You wanted to say something, anything to break this awkward moment of quiet, but your nerves were shot. Her glare was too much for you and youre pretty sure that one kiss just made things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward quiet continued long after breakfast was over. It continued as you followed Vanilla to the car, you being way too ashamed to stare at that tail of hers, and it lingered over the radio during the drive to school. Not even the oddly placed heavy metal on the radio was enough to warm up the cold mood in the car. And even after the ride and the both of you finally made it to school, the quiet lingered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you got out of the car and Vanilla clicked her little clicker and headed off without even so much as looking back at you.<br>\r\n\"Bye Vanilla!\" you waved goodbye. She didnt even look back let alone reply. Ouch. That hurt like a mother. This was totally unlike her at all. You were actually missing being smothered in that hot cleavage of hers when she hugged you goodbye. It was hard to believe that not getting one of those could make you feel so sad. Then again, nothing can cut you as deeply as when one of the two most important women in your life is upset with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you cant believe youre forgetting someone. CREAM!<br>\r\nYou groaned and shook your head. You gotta just forget about her mom. You are CREAM'S boyfriend, not her mom's! Her mom isnt the one you should be bending over backwards to win the heart of, SHE is! She should be the main squeeze of your life to be devoting so much of your time and effort to make happy! That's right! Let her mom have her little flings with other guys. Darling little Cream is yours. Yep, kindly shake that silly tail of yours elsewhere, old woman. Good ol' [Richie] will be busy having the time of his life with your sweet daughter, thank you very much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat way of thinking not only lifted your spirits a little, it did help you come to grips with reality. And reality is much much nicer without certain trivial milfs in the way of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you walk with your head held high to your first period class. On the way, speak of the devil, you manage to catch your beloved girlfriend in the middle of a chat with some guy you dont know. A fellow human (breath of fresh to see in a school like this, by the way) with fancy slick back auburn hair and a pair of shiny blue eyes that sparkled even in a distance, possibly just to draw attention away from that big nose cast covering his possibly broken schnoz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidnt bother you any, you were still really psyched to see Cream again. However, and this is a BIG however, you only managed a few steps toward her before....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...before you saw the two kissing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw dropped the moment this guy's lips pressed against hers! You were about ready to re-break that beak of his when you noticed Cream wasnt resisting even in the slightest. There was no shred of reluctance on her face when she clearly welcomed that kiss of his and gladly returned the favor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS! Who the hell was this punk begging for an asswhooping that is smooching with your girl?! And why isnt your girl doing anything, ANYTHING to stop him?! This is unbelievable! Why is Cream even.... man, were you shaking. This wasnt supposed to happen. You are Cream's boyfriend, aint you? I mean that one night surely meant something to her, right?! Surely that kiss she gave you meant something, didnt it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSURELY, youre not a goddamn fling like with her mother, are you?!</span></div></div>",

Alright, you would have hid there anyway, but the restrooms were practically in the opposite direction from your form room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you alright [Richie]?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned. \"R-Rouge\u2026 Hey, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat girl looked at you with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I saw you just standing here looking like you were struggling with something big.

The last person you wanna drag into this little affair is somebody who's most likely gonna blab about it to everybody and spread gossip... maybe even bring HERSELF into the affair as a way for you to get revenge on Cream! And as tempting as that was ('tempting' was the understatement of the year), you dont wanna go down that route if you honestly have hope in a relationship with Cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's uh... something personal,\" you tell her, \"I'll handle it though, thanks.\"<br>\r\nThe nosy batgirl still eyed you uneasily, knowing something bad was up seeing her close friend's boyfriend acting the way he did, but fortunately, she stayed out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, [Rich],\" she caved, \"feel free to give me a holler if you need a hand, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" you smiled back at her and quickly walked off to your first class, not even bothering to look back. Smart not to look back, because that way she cant see that incredibly long face you were making. You were in absolutely no mood whatsoever to smile. Even forced smiles were way too much effort at the moment. And first period aint even started yet. You dont think youre gonna make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla didnt substitute your PE class. Some incredibly overweight panda gentlemen with a heavy accent you've never seen before took over as your temporary teacher. As he went through the lecture, you rightfully zoned out, having a lot of trouble trying to clear your head. Millions of thoughts ran through your mind as you pretending to listen to the morning lecture, waited through the warm-up exercises, stared at Rouge's ass as she bent over to touch her toes (and wiggling it a bit as she got back up as if knowing you were staring!), going back to the locker room to change into some swim trunks, trying to hide the tent in said trunks after seeing Amy Rose in her new red and yellow polkadot bikini, swim a little, trying extra hard to hide the tent again as Amy Rose swam blissfully unaware that her bikini top went undone cuz Rouge secretly undid the back of it, went back to the locker room and changed back to your normal clothes. Throughout this, you did notice one anomaly: Cream never shown up for class. Probably playing hooky with that broken-nose jerk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about that moment with him filled you with a bit of rage. Part of you was thinking about flirting with Amy or Rouge as payback. Both were single (despite Amy obsessing over Sonic), both were pretty, and both were great to get along with (despite Amy's obsessing being borderline creepy). There'd be no question they could help you get over Cream's cheating!<br>\r\n If you were even less of a gentleman, you'd go as far as make out with Cream's mom right on top of her bed! ...Er, that is if her mom wasnt mad at you. Ugh, what a way to feel even worse.<br>\r\nVanilla was right. You did choose too quickly. Had you known your own girlfriend would do what she did, you would never have let her mom slip away from your fingers! Had you known Cream wouldve done this you, you wouldnt even bother taking your relationship with her mom slowly. You'd love to see the look on her face when she finds out that her ex-boyfriend just made her a new little brother or sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speak of the damn devil, you spot dear ol' Vanilla and Mr. Hawkson in the way of the one hallway that leads to your second period classroom! It's a damn shame there was practically no other way around to get to your class other than down that one hallway, otherwise you'd have been happy to take it no matter how late it made you! And you were in no mood to crossing Mrs. Rabbit's path after how you rubbed her the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood back, hopefully out of sight, waiting for the two to leave. Unfortunately, she and Mr. Hawkson werent budging. They seemed to be in a rather heated debate that you couldnt hear. Vanilla looked rather uneasy and, to be perfectly frank, almost as miserable as you. Though you shouldnt have, it kinda made you feel better that she seemed as miserable as you did. Maybe she was kinda feeling a similar pain you were feeling. Mr. Hawkson seemed a little cheerful yet content, as if he was trying to cheer her up. It didnt look like his talking was lifting Vanilla's mood any. She even looked away, avoiding eye contact with him as she replied to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidnt stop Mr. Hawkson from trying to get a little assertive. He leaned in, held her cheek and turned her head to face him, then leaned in and gave her a kiss on the lips. You raised your eyebrow and suddenly stopped caring about the class you were supposed to be hauling ass to get to. You stared way more intently than you should have growing impatient waiting for Vanilla's response to that daring kiss her non-date date from last night gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seemed like a whole class period passed, Vanilla...</span></div></div>",

The loyal cute girl you like, and the sexy, sweet MILF you love are both going to give you some \u201clove\u201d You just can\u2019t get that image out of your head. While you keep thinking, they were feeling they should start. First thing they felt was to get dolled up. Vanilla went to her room to pick up some makeup for her and Cream. While you were still zoning out about some possibilities, they were applying makeup. When they spoke when finished, you returned from that zone back into reality. When you\u2019re back in reality, you see two bunnies in makeup. They\u2019re wearing a good amount of makeup with red lipstick and eye shadow. You then see the look in their eyes, as they want you.  Then both bunnies pounce at you and all three of you land on the floor. Then Cream and Vanilla started kissing you wildly, every second there\u2019s a kiss shaped mark of lipstick on your face. Then you started to kiss back. You kissed Cream first, giving her a nice, passionate kiss and made her giggle as you gave her a few good kisses on the cheek. Then you start going for Vanilla. You madly start French kissing her and give a lot of passion in your kiss and make her moan and squeal with delight, especially when you give her a few good kisses and nibbles on her neck. The three of you felt like you were in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be honest, not only did you want to have sex with your legal guardian, Mrs. Vanilla Rabbit, you DREAMT of such an opportunity! Sure, she'd flirt, she'd tease, she'd hug you a little too close, but you never thought she'd actually want to have sex with you! Sure she was a close friend of your parents, but it didnt matter. It didnt even matter that she had a daughter your age. You'd be more than happy to make Cream a brother or sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'WHAT!' was the only moment of dumbfoundedness you gave Vanilla. After that, it was nothing but confidence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked Cream's mom in the eye and told her, \"I'd be honored to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla's eyes widened when you said that. \"W-what?!\" Maybe she didnt expect that kind of answer from a prude like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont think there's anybody in the world I'd rather have sex with than you!\" you confessed to her, \"it would be honor if you of all people took my virginity!\"<br>\r\nShe still looked speechless, \"Er, uh...\"<br>\r\n\"Vanilla, I... I didnt honestly think you cared about me like this!\" you boldly spoke up, \"all this time, I thought you were just teasing me. But... but you really want to sleep with me? You can have any guy on the planet and you chose ME? You have no idea how much this means to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, [Rick]?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didnt stop, \"I know, I know. I'm a little unexperienced, but I promise I'll do my best! I watched a lot of movies, so I think I might know a few tricks to keep you satisfied!'<br>\r\n\"[Rick]....\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! I dont mean to keep you waiting!\" you start to unbutton your shirt, \"hang on, just give me a sec to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[RICHARD]!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla shouted at you, cutting your moment of bravado to a halt! Something told you this was not part of the whole plan. Oh dear, is it cuz you forgot to get a condom from school? That's no problem, it's not a long walk to the nearest drugstore!<br>\r\nHowever, that wasnt the case. Cream's mom started to look at you with a partially embarrassed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking!\" she said with a laugh! Just those three words alone stabbed you deep in the pride! If there were such words out there that hurt people worse than physical violence, it was those three! You honestly poured your heart out over a joke!!<br>\r\nAnd as if your pride wasnt heard enough, Vanilla still giggled, \"Oh man! Wow, I seriously didnt see THAT one coming! I thought you were just gonna freeze up like the cute innocent little boy I cant get enough of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what?! I.... I...\" now YOU were speechless!<br>\r\n\"Hahah! Geez!\" Vanilla wiped a tear from her eye after laughing at your embarrassment for too long, \"I never thought you had it in you, [Richie]! 'It would be an honor if you of all people took my virginity!' Oh, I'm totally having that quote engraved on my coffee cup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went red with absolute embarrassment! Damn it, she got you again! She always did love teasing you, but this one, MAN did she get you! There's no way in hell youre gonna be able to live that down! You shoulda been smarter than that! Of course Vanilla wouldnt have sex with you, stupid! Youre too young, you aint all that great looking, youre the one of an old friend of hers, and you always wimp out like a prude whenever she plays around with you! To think that you actually said those things... now you just wanna crawl into a hole and die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-l-look, Vanilla, I-\"<br>\r\n\"You got a lot of backbone saying those things, [Richie],\" Vanilla commented, \"but you better be real careful saying 'em around the wrong people!\"<br>\r\nYou lowered your head in shame, \"Y-yes ma'am. EESH!\"<br>\r\nVanilla gave you a hard slap on the butt and walked off, \"This little comedy bit's leaving me a bit tense. I'm gonna go take a shower. I'll let ya know if I need help scrubbing some hard to reach places! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!\" And she laughed all the way to the bathroom. That laughter would haunt you for years to come!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalmed for several minutes reflecting on how much of a damn fool you were. And when those several minutes were up, you realized you forgot to button your shirt back up cuz youre such a damn fool! You shrugged as you buttoned up your shirt, trying to push this humiliation aside. This whole episode just wasted precious homework time. Homework... what you SHOULDVE been doing instead of being suckered by Vanilla!

Just focus on Cream and getting homework done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, not even THAT was gonna happen. Cuz the moment you walked into Cream's room, Cream was already standing up and looking at you with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... it's an honor to have my mom take your virginity, huh?\" You cringed as your blood went cold! Fuck... she heard you say that! You gritted your teeth as you mustered the courage to look back at Cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, she was...</span></div></div>",

She had on a leather bondage suit and was holding a whip. You then see that that woman......

Besides, if she was mas at you, she would have shot you a nasty look like she would usually do to somebody that she was mad with, but she blushed and ran away from you.

You had your natural abilities from your father, Sonic's speed, Cream's jumping ability, Silver's accuracy, and Blaze's competitive edge. (Plus you wanted to talk to her.) Your team eventually whupped Knuckles' team, inevitably pissing him off. Coach Lincoln sent everyone to the locker rooms to change. Cream comes out of the girls locker room and you tell her that you'll meet her outside. Blaze was the last to walk out of the girls' locker room. You casually say \"Hey.\" Blaze starts to run away, but you grab her arm before she was able to take off. \"I just want to talk, Blaze.\" you say. Blaze sighs and says okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk over to the bleachers and have a seat. \"I wanted to ask you something.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Really?

Then, she planted a soft, deep, passionate kiss on your lips. Your eyes widened in surprise. When Blaze released you from the kiss, she said. \"It's because I love you. I've been in love with you for a very long time, and I really want to be your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your ears! THIS was why Blaze acted so weird! She was in love with you!

You close your eyes and start thinking about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou envision her standing in front of you, the cat holds her arms shyly as she tries to look back at you.

You rubs your nose gently, holding back tears from the hit. Feeling peeved, you look up &amp; see who happen to have opened the door. Your eyes widen as you see its Cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh my goodness!\" Your adorable foster sister squeaks, she quickly kneels down to you &amp; pulls you up on your legs. You stare into Cream's eyes, never getting a good look at the color of them, a cute cinnamon brown that match's her creamy looking fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seem lose in her eyes as you barely realize that Cream was using her handkerchief to clean some of the blood on your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream smiles warmly at you \"Whats the matter [*Your Name*]? You looks a bit dazed..~hehe\" she giggles. You blink as your mind comes back from cloud-coco and back into your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush slightly &amp; scratch the back of your head in embarrassment  \"Oh hey Cream...hehe\" you chuckle nervously. You kinda forgot that she has the second period class as you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream keeps giving off that cute little smile \"I was wondering where you were, Mr.Dingleduck was about to mark you absent, so I was gonna go look for you\" she tells you, you notice she's twiddling her fingers as she says that, even a little blush on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back at Cream, she's saved you skin from being tardy a lot in your days of living with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat Cream's shoulder \"Hey, thanks a lot Cream, I'll get you some ice cream after school\" you promise her reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute little rabbit's eyes beam happily at the mention of her favorite dessert. Cream claps her hands happily \"Eehhe!! Thank you [*Your Name*]!!\" she says with much enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the bell rings again, signaling that class is now in session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream jumps up slightly, seems like everyone is forgetting the school bell these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. [*Your Name*]!\" she says in a hush tone as she quickly scampers inside the class room,letting the door shut right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, realizing you just had a conversation...in front of your own class room...and are now late cause of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take a step forward &amp; are about to open the door again, your eyes catch something that Cream must of drop. You lean down &amp; pick the little paper up. It's from a notebook &amp; appears to have been written on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder if you should see whats on it right now before going inside the class room, or respect Cream's privacy then give it back to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour choice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You nearly drop the slip just before you head inside. Luckily, Cream was far away from your seat, so no trouble would've occurred. But just seeing how innocent she looks and the way she doesn't harbor anger or hold grudges just made in inconceivable that Cream would actually write that stuff, especially to Blaze!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nonetheless, you had to hide this. After school, you remind yourself to burn the note so no trace is left. But you also had to tell Blaze about it. She can't just be in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForget it for now. You needed to focus on this boring lecture of social studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that you think about it, not that you decided yet, Cream does seem like a nice girl, hell, the only one close to you as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to that second eye you bumped to each other, nose first for you. The eyes, the very sweet, innocent cinnamon brown eyes, the very contrasting fur color that balances it out, the ears that act so much like pigtails which you always found cute. Idiot, wake up! You like Blaze remember!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, but you agreed to go get ice cream with Cream, lol, later on. You're starting to wonder how things are gonna turn out. Complete irony, extensively with the fact that it's your foster sister. Albeit not biological, it seems... wrong, in a way. You just hope you meet up with Blaze first then hang with Cream later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally done with the day, as usual, you wait for Cream over at the main hallway. But Blaze usually leaves earlier than her, so you figured you have time, and since Cream spends some time chatting with Amy, Rouge, and Tikal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at a stairway, you see Blaze coming downstairs, with a slight sadness in her expression. You pull her down to the other side of the casewith some yelping at first, before you covered her mouth, and when she looks at you, her expression now changes from frightened to shock and lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Your name), what are you doing?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What's wrong?\" You hand her the note. She was shocked at what it had said. \"You aren't considering being with Cream, are you..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that her eyes start to tear up a bit. \"No, Blaze. Even I'm shocked. But I told her we'd get ice cream later on since she saved me from being late again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she doesn't consider it a date,\" Blaze hopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get home, you always started in the homework once after you greet Vanilla, who, everyday, you always thank her, indirectly of course, for taking you in after your mother passed away. After everything was done, you ask Cream if she wanted to get the ice cream you promised. When she replied, she was a little excited.

Your mother and Vanilla (Cream the Rabbit's mother) were very good friends, an after your mother died, you started living with her and Cream. You go to high school with Cream and her friends and you're all seniors. Despite the title, you can choose your main love interest at the beginning of the story. Here are your choices. Amy is NOT one of them. Deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream the Rabbit, 17, your best friend since who knows how long. She's really loyal to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla the Rabbit, 36, Cream's mom. She's your legal guardian, but she kinda uses her sexuality to mess with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze the Cat, 17, kind of shy and reclusive around you. She does really well in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge the Bat, 17, The seductive one. She flirts with you A LOT, but she's still your friend and she's got your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you can also interact with other characters in the Sonic series. Please don't introduce anyone new. No guy/guy stuff. The main characters are you and your chosen love interest. Try to make long additions, and once you choose a love interest, that MUST remain your love interest throughout the storyline branching from that choice. Yes, you can have sex with your love interest. (Rated 18+ for a reason.) Enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: Rule Change: When you chose a love interest, you can change the love interest as the story progresses, but let it tie in with the story.</td>",
