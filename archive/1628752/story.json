            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Welcome to Sam's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam is 5 foot 10 inches tall and has always been athletic and sporty. He plays on the college Men's hockey team regularly and likes to swim in his free time. He has warm brown eyes and a handsome face, with slightly tanned skin and brown hair which normally falls in perfectly messy curls. He is the envy of all the boys at college, and is adored by girls (and guys, of course) who fight to be his friend. We now join Sam at the start of his journey, on the hockey field during the first game of the semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys.... Men. I know you can do it, but most of all YOU know you can do it\" began the coach. \"They're getting aggressive and ruthless and it's time to do the same. Fight hard boys, let's make this game the best, let's make our team the one to beat this year! Now get out there and do me proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach's speech had all the boys raring to go. His words had managed to dig deep into the boys bodies and liberalize what little energy they had left. They ran back onto the field with an intent... the intent to win! Sam gave his best friend John, also in the team, their signature good luck move: a belly bounce. They run towards each other, jump into the air and touch tummies shouting \"come on\" at the same time. It had been a while since they had been able to do this, as last year John had suffered an injury and hence had only just rejoined the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah John\" says Sam \"what's this?!\" Sam Laughs and squeezes John's small but noticeable belly \"I bounce a bit further away than I remember last year buddy!\"<br>\r\n\"Haha\" Laughs John \"Yeah, I must admit, I'm about 25lbs heavier than I used to be last year, but I'm sure being back in the team will help me lose it!\" John lifts his jersey and shows his smooth new tummy.<br>\r\n\"Awww I wouldn't worry buddy\" replies Sam, \"I think it suits you\". Sam throws John a wink and then the pair rejoin the team on the field and prepare to fight for the win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words from the coach obviously made quite a difference, and Sam's team were beating the opposition, outclassing them in every way. The opposition began to get angry and frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, we've nearly got them\" shouts Sam.<br>\r\n\"Shut up, pretty boy\" whispers a rough and bulky member of the opposition into Sam's ear with a nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam could tell the guy was angry and tried to stay away from him on the field as much as possible. Competitive as he may be, Sam hates conflict and wanted to avoid it! However fate wasn't on Sam's side today, and whilst attacking Sam was faced with the bulky guy in front of him! The tackle was hard, high contact and, quite obviously, a foul! Sam tripped and flew through the air, landing awkwardly on his ankle with a shriek. The crowd gasped as Sam rolled around on the floor clutching his ankle, it's unlike him to fake anything!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"... and so no intense exercise for at least 3 months, you have to take it easy and I'm afraid the hockey must stop until christmas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's words went round and round in Sam's head. Sam was at college and was studying Biology and Life Sciences and was going to start a Medical degree next year. Although that was important to Sam, at the moment hockey was his life! What was he going to do now he couldn't play?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was waiting in their dorm room for Sam when he finally returned from hospital. Sam and John shared a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy\" began John when Sam came through the door \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n\"My ankle hurts like hell and I can't play hockey until after christmas dude, not feeling great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn rushed over to Sam and gave him the biggest tightest hug that he could manage \"Look, my leg is hurting after the game too, I think maybe it was a bit too early for me to be back in the team. We can get through this together, you know, concentrate on our work and take some much needed relaxation time to get ready for next year.\"<br>\r\n\"What would I do without you John\" says Sam.<br>\r\n\"Right. Well your Mother called round on her way to work and she's left me this card for you and $50 so we can enjoy ourselves tonight. I'm betting you're not up for walking around town with a sore ankle. So I went to the store and.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn lifts up his duvet and reveals that the bulge underneath was a pile of DVD's, a few packs of beer and enough food for three weeks, all snack type foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to make me podgy over the next few weeks aren't you John' Sam says and a cheeky smile appears on his handsome face.<br>\r\n\"Haha, like this you mean?\" John lifts up his t-shirt to show off his smooth tanned tummy again and gives it a shake. They both laugh. \"I'm going to make you relax first, but if my experience is anything to go by you may need some bigger jeans some time soon haha!\"<br>\r\n\"Well then, in that spirit\" says Sam, \"lets.........\"</span></div></div>",

The two boys ordered a pizza and snacked on junk food and beer while they waited.  <br>\r\n\"you know.\" John confessed patting his stomach, \"You need some heft to handle a rough game like hockey.  I could really feel the difference today.  This extra weight gave me confidence and did you see me find off that big guy? A few more pounds and I could dominate this game.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute big guy.\"  Sam interrupted.  \"I could see that you were slower out there today.  Any bigger and you would find everybody skating circles around your big ass.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" John continued.  \"It's just the weeks off practice slowing me down.  When I get back on my game, I'll be just as fast as ever.  Plus this leg still hurts.\"<br>\r\n\"Forget the leg.\"  Sam told him.  \"Have another beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I intend to stuff this baby nice and full.  We may be off the rink for a while longer so let's drown our sorry in a good feed.\"<br>\r\nSam was amazed to see how much John could eat and even more amazed that he didn't notice.  Sam was  stuffed while John just plowed on through their stash.  No wonder John had that belly.  Sam thought again  about their plan to enjoy the break from sports. What if he get as fat as John.  Maybe he needed a plan  B.<br>\r\n\"You know,\" he told John who was lazily scratching his  stuffed belly. \"You ought to keep in  shape while your leg heals.  We could  train together. I could still work out my upper body.</span></div></div>",
