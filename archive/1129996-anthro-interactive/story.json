It's been hours, and probably a lot of them, since you passed out, as you actually feel hungry again. Speaking of food, you start feeling around your body, and wrestle yourself into a sitting position. You were already about 500 pounds, and now you're even bigger - every part of your foxy body is fatter and more rounded. You have to guess, but the three or four inches added presumably represent about 100 pounds. You look over at your lion roommate, who not only is awake but sucking on the food tube again. He's even bigger than you, and it looks like he's getting even larger by the minute, as he's actively trying to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if it sensed you're awake, the tube drops down to you again.

Before you ask, Cow Fat and Whale Bites are both kinda the 'medicine' here...You hafta take them constantly otherwise you go insane and become a 'four-y'.

These two kingdoms hold two lion species, the mountain lions and African lions. They had disputed many topics and had many arguments, fueling fights and segregation between lions. The borders were guarded heavily, in case any side wanted to attack. War was up in the air and has yet to be decided, but was coming soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Both sides had an odd military. The Forest kingdom had hoses connected to pipelines, rivers and reservoirs, while The savannah kingdom had gas darts and pointed weaponry. Gender ratios have also said that there was a higher amount of females in the former and more males in the latter, almost making a battle of the sexes in this rivalry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You are an assassin and spy for one of these sides, prepared for sneaking passed the border, snooping around, maybe inflating the current ruler of the opposing side.

Both there attention is on each other while Im still snapping my fingers. \u201cThis is going no were.\u201d I said in a pout. might as well do a cancel spell I thought <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cspells gone good, spells gone bad, lets stop this one because it is bad!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time dad stoped he looked like a jiant ball of furry flab. The dragon (nick was his name I remember now) got back his muscles and grew ten feet so he could rubb dads belly, and I was pinned down by enorrmis flab next to his head. I turned towards his head and I gave him a small kiss on the cheek and said \u201cgood morning dad.\u201d he said \u201cso you did this.\u201d almost imedetly he shrinks back down and is back to his normal self. 700 pounds 10 feet high, while im 90 pounds three foot five. nick had poffed off some were so it was just me and dad like usal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh a noramal day</span></div></div>",

But I mean a more dtailed memory is something girls were proven to have scientifically. Wait a girl?! It explains the extra bit of shrinking and the add of color to your sight but it seems that this glowing stone did more than your age and species!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you stumble around you quickly fumble the shirt on and would try the pants but it obviously doesn't fit, the shirt was luckily short-sleeve so your arms reached out of it and it reached down to your knees which helped your sense of embarrassment from being destroyed completely at least.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You Think of a quick place to hide the stone before the people who put you in this laboratory find that you have managed to escape their watchful eyes, find a secret tunnel, and obtain a magical stone. You see the stone has stopped glowing and was now just a creamy soft white like cream. Luckily it matched your fur which gives you the idea of hiding it. You move the stone into the shirt and wrap it up in the grey hair of your fur so it wouldn't fall, this fur was definetly yours as it felt attached to you, or felt like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you did not realize was that the stone was not magical any more, whether it had a recharge time, or you absorbed the power it wouldn't function anytime soon. You look around seeing no exit anywhere in sight and sneeze once because of the cold tunnel air. You could smell the dust and particles in the air and you could hear the footsteps of distant scientists and other personell, probably soldiers considering their little \"project\" got away and is wandering around a sensitive area. They could not find you down here as everyone of them did not notice the way into the hidden tunnel. But even with your accurate sense of smell, slightly better sight(girls were proven to be able to see colors more distinctly and it would help looking around in a dark place), and knocking/tapping around you found yourself trapped, dead-end! You could not stay here forever or you would starve so you have to get out somehow, and they were looking for you, no, they were looking for an adult male, you were vastly different now, you seemingly were lighter on your feet and smaller, perfect for sneaking around if you had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You could try sneaking out the smart and steady way either to an exit if it isnt already locked down, or you could try to get over to some sort of control room, there you could set everyone here free and sneak out in the crowd or unlock any lock placed on the compound but it would be long and tedious and it does not seem like young kids liked waiting as you found yourself tapling the ground quickly over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to decide quickly!</span></div></div>",

She sighs to herself and begins to review the paperwork they had, the assistant was marking the stuff down, one of the things included your name, soon they get up and leave with your turn to sigh after hiding there like that. They most likely started looking where you came from, the tunnel area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You jump out the room and make one last dash to the security door, if there was a fire, then they would need fire exits, this has to be it you yell to yourself twisting and yanking on the security door immediately after finding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door is ______(opened/locked)</span></div></div>",

You have to get far away from this place first, it didn't matter where, you could feel the wind filter you, the nature embrace you and the sunrise welcome you to freedom itself. Your fur feels so warm and you could feel the happiness of what you accomplished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Making a quick stop at a lake you quickly toss off the big man-sized shirt and take out the stone, it was still cream color so you wrapped it back into your cream fur with your deep red fur complimenting your cream fur on the outer and back part of your body. You dive into the water for a swim and bath,you haven't bathed in so long it was practically new, and how you were able to swim was probably thanks to your instinct. You soak in the water for a while appreciating the scenery and the senses input. It was kind of odd bathing as a girl but you got over it and eventually forgot about the lab, it wasn't until you exited the water that you remembered them again, upon exiting the water you put on the shirt you had on earlier, the one you wore when you were a normal young adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You seem hungry above all else and upon looking around you find some fruits in the trees, you don't know the name because of your isolation though, running up to the tree you test your 'new abilities' by first running forward and leaping forward before flipping off the base of the tree and onto a tall branch but you being unused to this body flips over it and bumps your now soft skull against the branch. It took slightly under an hour to get used to the abilities you now posses, you were lighter but weaker, more flexible and athletic but smaller, and finally you managed to get enough fuit to eat, you had a smaller appetite because you were smaller/younger though. Drinking just a little bit of water and making sure the shirt has finished drying you head out to expand the distance and start some sort of new life. You stop after an hour or so and look around, still no one in sight, you had to use the bathroom real quick, on instinct you reach down for pants but find none, you look down and realize that now you'll have to go to the bathroom as a different gender now, may as well start now. You close your eyes and hold yourself against a tree to make it easier as you relieve yourself.(not going to say anything more than that, just saying it so the story is at least somewhat realistic in a sort of nice way to show the changes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You were walking down a path you recently found when you hear an ear-piercing tweet of birds. Other birds were somewhat annoying but this one was especially, there seemed to be plenty of downsides to go with the upsides of this change. Then you had an idea not wasting any time taking out the stone and holding it in your hands, it was still cream colored, did you absorb all the specialness of this stone, maybe you absorbed the magic and power into yourself, anyway. You put it back up against your chest but as you do you hear a rustling behind you, undergrowth being moved around. You waste no time sprinting away from the sounds and off the path to escape the unknown, you could not take any chances. You move some plants out of your way, dive under branches and leap over logs but it seems you were in pursuit. The chaser yells out for you to stop or \"...at least slow down.\" You probably would have had you not been under captivity all your life. But you are forced to stop when you reach a dead-end at a rock formation curving around to trap you. You out of desperation runs up the wall of rock in a last ditch attempt but you slip and fall landing hard against the ground, oddly enough it feels as if some sort of magical force made it a slightly softer landing, or you didnt realize how soft your fur was. It didn't really matter though you were already caught by this stranger. The silhouette of the person you saw was a young man, seemingly and presumably a normal person with a normal life offers to help you up offering his hand forward as he says he was hiking and wanted to know why you were all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Option 1:he never saw an anthro on this side of the world(or at all)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Option 2: he pays 0 mind to it, almost as if it is common or doesnt exist and treats you like a normal common human)</span></div></div>",

To my thoughts I could come up with the thought that somehow I had entered a fantasy world which is good and bad with their own respective ways. My eyelids close in fear and when I open them again I was arriving to a village in a carriage next to a few goods or trade items he had. He waits until the coast is clear when he sneaks me out of the carriage and into a small alleyway so as to not connect me to his carravan, he wasn't my parent nor did he know me anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After some time passes I head out seeing the friendly traveller gone, but also, I see beautiful fantasy village, those years of confinement was all the more worth it as I see a huge amount of people walking around in a setting like the medieval but slightly better without plagues and such. I walk around, it seems like that, I could luckily speak language so maybe this was just a parallel world or something, I don't know because I was studied in confinement for so long anyway. Apparently there is a guild which you enter slightly nervous and excited, the first thing you saw though was many people enjoying each other, talking, preparing themselves, did this world truly change somehow, if it was that facility then they probably messed around where they shouldn't have. You walk up to the counter which was taller than you, even when you jumped -normally- your eyes could barely be seen by the person at the counter, instead you just sort of stand there with your wild hair partially reaching enough to be seen by the receptionist and the tip of your fox ears as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Uhh, hello little miss, did you come to order a quest to the guild?\" The receptionist says politely still treating you as a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No, I would like to join it instead, and I hope that I can recieve good training as well.\" You say smiling but she couldn't see your smile, only could she hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, are you sure, I know we didn't put an age limit on the guild but a young g-\" she tries to say but you had other things in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You make a quick hop, you were more physically fit after all as you land on the counter, then you make a sad face up to her, it was kind of amusing since even though you were standing on the counter that was taller than you, you were still barely shorter then the receptionist who was not even average height, it made you sad which made the act even better to act out. She reluctantly makes you follow her behind the counter and through a door which led to a somewhat dark room, no problem with your keen eyesight, before letting you continue walking as she left the room closing the door. There was someone in robes sitting and waiting for you, but your intuition tells you the just dressed in that a few seconds ago just for this task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The robed figure was sort of slim in appearance and seemed very calm and collected, or had that kind of aura, \"When joining the guild usually you need skills if you want to survive or accomplish tasks. I am not sure about your skills so we will do a magic examination, we would probably do more examinations but you seem like there is no need for it so we will leave it at that, you have your guild card revoked if you fail to complete three quests in a month, but since you are young and have no one helping you I will personally cut it down to two. Now place one hand on this piece of paper.\" The what seems to be the guild master, feminine by the voice it seems, she lays a scroll down on the table which I sort of ignored until now, it seemed unnecessarily wide. Although I doubted I had magic since I came from another world without magic so I held the seemingly magic stone in my left hand, I had it hidden thanks to the sleeve but the guild master noticed and had me release the stone, she looked at it closely and realized it had no magic whatsoever so she allowed me to hold it which made me wonder curiously but I ignored that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I placed my hand on the scroll carefully, I feel some lifeforce, probably magic touch the scroll, I wasn't sure if it was alot or a little because I have never sensed it before. Then words appeared on the scroll as if they were there all along: light, dark, fire, water, wind, earth, special, and one that made the guildmaster gasp in surprise again:nature. Seven words in total, after a small amount of time numbers began to form above the words, the odd thing was the numbers came in a very long sequence and it was oddly changing in the process, it started with 5million but it was very slowly changing, it went up by two for every 10 seconds, I thought it was like some mana recovery rate but the guild master even though surprised explained that this is my total mana capacity, after a minute we realized it speeds up when my emotions are in effect but when I calm down the rate nearly stops increasing which is very odd. The guild master recovers shock and stands up, it looked like she was very serious, but you looked very confused and dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I am not sure how you gained this ability but I am not going to ask a child their backstory so I will say this, apparently you can use every type of magic, and your magic, I am not sure but it is higher than mine and perhaps even higher than all the guild members combined excluding the new members and lazy or old members who can't do as many quests, although judging from your looks you don't know much about magic. I was hoping some guardian would show up and claim you but perhaps not, you can probably guess what the magic types are but special is a type of magic that has unique abilities, most individuals with this type have spells only they, their family, or their close friends or people can use. But this is different, I don't know what is this but it seems you are a made for a guild, if you would like I could help you learn.\" The guild master says taking off the robe whilst talking and kneeling down to me to talk to me on an equal basis, 'not equal basis she is still taller than me, how can this be!!!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You smile in a sort of cute but shy way, you weren't sure how to answer so you stay silent, eventually you nod yes to her request, she walks you out of the room and judging by the reactions of the guild members which is apparently also called adventurers for some reason, now that you had a good view you could see more races, the guildmaster was an elf, which was a race that had high magic and apparently was one of the few races with nature magic available if they are born with it. You saw some half animal half humans as well, the other races escaped your view as the guildmaster brought you to an empty room, but a big room at that as you see it was a wide open space. You see the elf(guildmaster) stop and face you once more, thanks for coming and such, \"I hope I can help you enjoy this guild, you look like someone special, my name is rhehri, and you are...rebbecca? Nice to meet you\" I make a sort of cute smile to show that I was happy but I was confused, apparently the guild card they made showed my name as rebbecca, probably thinking that I named myself, or titled myself rebbecca when talking to the traveller which confused me, I threw the thought aside though.</span></div></div>",

I leave Rhehri to do guild stuff and meanwhile I was told to walk around the guild and meet people, at first I was approached by an elf who seemed curious but nervous at meeting someone who was so little and so important to the guild master, I said a quick greeting noticing her look at me and she decided that it was okay to talk to me thanks to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hello, I am Syf, I was hoping I could figure out why you joined this guild, although it is shocking how well you impressed the guildmaster when first meeting.\" She bows for greeting, she was more curious then nervous and comparing sizes, she was tall compared to others, probably going to guess 3.5\u00d7 taller than me, I have to admit that I don't like being a short young kid and all but I feel I'll get used to it eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I am Rebbecca, I joined because I am not sure what else I really could do other than this, nice to meet you sef-syv-syuf\" I was getting really frustrated with myself, it was three letters, how couldn't I say it properly, Syf chuckled a bit before telling me to simply call her \"Ms. Sy\" to make it better, I felt so embarassed that I saw the world change to red with my face for a couple seconds. \"Sorry, I will try to get it properly.\" I look down at my self, I was mentally older so why couldn't this work out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I was wondering if you would like to join my party, I don't think others are used to elves yet and you seem to be lacking a party if you would like?\" She offers, I look around the room and many of the people had faces that told me their thoughts, they were seemingly saying with their face, \"Don't she is an elf. Two non-humans, this is not worth my time. What is up with this little girl's ability to mingle well with elves, there are only two here at this guild. I want to join their party\" and the sorts like that. I sighed at them before walking towards the board, then I hit what seemed to be a glowing moth, I mentally yell to myself, how do I miss something glowing that bright with my size and keen senses anyway. I look forward and the \"moth\" was a fairy and the fairy was trying to get ky attention when I bumped into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Sorru\" I get flustered but repeat myself, \"sorry sorry sorry!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I am okay even if you bumped into me, I am a fairy and after sensing your power I thought I would like to join your party, I can't let someone as cute as you go out and get into danger anyway, you can call me whatever seems fit to you\" she smiles, or I think she does, she was small, and she wouldn't stop flying around, she was airborne of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I wanted to keep looking like a kid so I looked for an easy name, I don't want someone like Syf to make a name my seven year old body cannot pronounce yet. \"It is nice to meet you miss...how about, Miss Daisy, and you are very cute yourself.\" I smile to her and put out my hand for her to land on to make it easier to hold a conversation, the fairy decides to agree and lands on my palm sitting down, Syf was watching and if it was modern day she would be screaming cute and video taping it. I try to snap them out of their trances by changing topic, \"I can't see the requests so can you help me find a quest to try out?\" I face the guild board which was filled with paper, I without Daisy or me realizing it started to pet Daisy. Her wings sparkled prettily during the day time so how would it look at night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Neither I, nor anyone else in the guild noticed, but I shrunk in width a little bit becoming skinnier and my magic skyrocketed, I also had invisible fairy wings made out of a special magic that I didn't know so I could make them disappear and form like fairies. Without realizing I gained the dna make-up of an elf and a fairy, it was probably because I liked those two races and I made close friends with two of those species but I would soon start to learn that the stone drained of its magic power would grant me more abilities than I really knew, but even if it gave me a lot of magic power, it wasn't even 10% of my full magic capacity, it was weird but it was because I came from another world, the stone did grant me the ability to perform all of the types of magic and if I were to find out about it, I would be grateful for the chance I was given to live outside of imprisonment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look at the guild board as I pout on the ground waiting, I didn't know what quest we would do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took not long but the fairy floated down landing on my wild hair, I hadn't combed it because it just recently got like this but I don't think it would be something I would enjoy doing. Daisy smiles even if I cannot see her, \"We are going to another town, it is going to be so exciting and we will be protecting people and you will have so much fun!!! I heard that another party is going to take the mission as well!!!\" Now one would not think that people can take the same quest but here there is the request and then the people who complete them, if you fail then the one who requested help as well as the guild recieve minimal loss, you just get a bit bruised whether mentally or literally. \"They say the town we are headed to has all sorts of protection and support for the citizens there!\" Daisy twirls a little joyfully on my head and even begins petting my ears after settling down.<br>\r\n   The comfort she brought to ky ears was overwhelming as I fell over, Daisy held on but never ceased as she only pet more vigorously, you could feel the torment of your demi-human features, 'This is unbearable, it is so comfy but so...this is just amazing but even so my senses are so amazing, I can't take anymore!!! I am a grown person, this can't be!!!' I begin laying on the ground in comfort as the fairy controls my part animalistic body with my ears. Eventually Syf saves me by picking Daisy up and allowing me to stand back up, we walk over to where the caravan of people are and see some explorers in armor, 3 in total ready to defend the caravan, they looked overly equiped for it perhaps so maybe this was just some extra mission they tried to take real quick. As I hear the clients say that we are going to be riding in the back or the front I decided to ride in the back and Syf made a special plan where Daisy would stay with me because I was new and she would ride up front so that we could support her, and with that we were off, I saw 2 of the 3 adventurers and they seemed to be the other party members, the leader was riding more in the front with syf, we were like the eyes and ears of the caravan and the front was our current strongsuit it seems. Even though the difficulty was low, what we didn't know was that someone had been targeting this caravan for quite some time and that now would be a great time to attack.<br>\r\n   I sense a movement from the wilderness and stand up which surprises Daisy a little who looks around as she begins to flutter about, the other adventurers asked me what happened, since I wasn't sure I sat back down confused, about a minute later a massive bird or something swoops down at hundreds of kilometers per hour, I mean, it was diving after all. We saw it was after the front so I began running towards the front, Syf concentrates her mind as she pours out an energy to cause roots from the ground to reach out and grab a talon of the bird, but after that the bird releases fire from its feathers setting it free. The adventurer leader or whatever got into a composed stance for it's return as it loops around, eventually I reach the front and the bird begins diving again, the speed became very fast as it was blurring with the wind, the adventurer raised his shield and sword to block, the result was a shattered shield and a badly cracked sword. He slides back a couple meters but uses this chance to switch swords and run forward, the sword was much stronger and seemed to be his strongest. He swings it into the bird but it only shattered against the feathers of the bird, he felt devastated from it. As for me I found an opening and ran at it, it had strong offense and defense but I had to at least try, I leaped with my great physical prowess and ride it as it tries to knock me off, I saw its feathers were hot so I tried to pull it down to the ground. I had no way of doing that though so it started to fly away with me on its back, its feathers began to burn me so I raised my foot behind me and kick it with a lot of power, the bird fell down and crashes down into the ground hard.<br>\r\n   The adventurer was surprised at how a seven year old kicked a bird down with feathers that were burning and too hard to use a powerful sword on. I myself was unsure but that is the magic of it I guess, even if I didn't use magic. The adventurers clapped for me before we saw some gooey sludge tiger monsters or something, they headed towards the cargo so we ran towards them, I ran forward and tried to punch it, the body jiggled a bit and my hand got stuck, I tried doing a sidekick which caused the form of the creature to disfigure and get blown away almost completely, ALMOST. It held onto my leg as it began to attach to me, Syf used some nature magic which caused some stream from somewhere nearby to change its direction, next thing I know I was underwater for about 10 seconds before I felt the water shut off and the tiger that was on me gone completely. \"Thank you Miss Syb, miss Sip, miss zip...miss sy\" I say regrettably as we continue on our way. On the way Daisy managed to put some bandits to sleep and we stol-confiscated their dangerous weapons to prevent them from stealing but we left them one short sword to protect themselves from monsters, it was more of a last resort as it wasn't the best condition.<br>\r\n   As we arrived to the next town the client stamped a piece of paper and handed one stamped paper to each party, we said our farewells and headed to the central plaza to look around, a seven year old with messy red hair(previously brown but the stone has been changing hair color over time)and demi-human fox features, a tall elf with skinny appearance, blond hair in a pony tail to keep it out of the way of adventuring but otherwise she would let it down usually, and a small glowing fairy with a pink glow and pink wings. It was odd since I still hadn't had a change of clothes, they probably didn't bring up the clothing I wear now because they think it is a personal reason, absence of parents and man's shirt for my clothing, either that or they think it is an actual dress and not a shirt, it certainly did look like a dress the way I wore it.<br>\r\n   Daisy was blunt with this being her energetic and playful personality she said it to me and Syf, \"Let's get you new clothing Rebbecca!!!\" I sighed at this as I haven't wanted to or ever really been in this shopping situation, they gave me no choice in the matter and I ended up wearing a red dress that matched my fur color of my ears and all that, it had a magical enchantment that allowed my magical potent to multiply by my physical ability, they got similiar clothing in other colors and I was just not satisfied, as I held the shirt in my hands I thought of how I would carry it and for some reason I managed to activate some sort of ability similiar to when I first found the magic stone. The shirt glowed and then disappeared though since I could sense magic I saw it turned into mana and travelled inside of the stone almost like an item box or something, I did the same with the new clothing they got to their surprise, I didn't know I could do it either.<br>\r\n   We got ready to leave and on the way to the guild they asked if I had anywhere to sleep, I said no so they came up with an idea, apparently Syf had moved from somewhere in the SouthEast and was going to find an inn to stay at, Daisy had decided that she wanted to spend the night with her new friend me, and kept shouting out sleep over, she fell asleep in 3 minutes. We got the reward which wasn't too much but plenty enough, then we headed home to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was very late at night when I woke up, I grumble as this is just the first night and I am already having problems. I use my paws to hold Daisy before setting Daisy down gently and walking to the window to get some fresh air. I open it up and look outside while taking a deep breath of fresh air, it was relaxing to say the very least. I then saw the full moon and frowned to myself, I clamped my muzzle down with my left hand and shut the window, the urge died down and I breathed a sigh of relief, I walk over to Daisy, pick her up, and walk to Syf's room. Even though I was older mentally, it proved nothing to my transformation and my will with it as I lay in bed with Daisy and Syf, Syf felt like a mother and Daisy like a playful sister even though it wasn't like any of those. Before my eyes closed completely, I thought I noticed a smile appear on Syf's face.<br>\r\n   It was morning and I could feel the morning air, Daisy began bouncing on my face and Syf was shaking me awake. I opened my eyes and saw them smiling at me urging me to keep walking forward, \"Good morning Ms. Daisy and Ms. Syt, I mean Ms. Sy\" they smile but began to have me get ready because we needed time to do the quests and hopefully enough to finish and have extra time. I felt ready to go and began to run to the exit door but then I feel my hair get yanked and I fall backwards to the floor. I see Daisy with a disappointed face towards me which screams out, \"you aren't ready,\" she points to my hair and I see it is all knotted and such and try to decline but eventually Daisy manages to get me to the bathroom to brush my hair properly, Syf was just giggling and smiling as she thought it was cute.<br>\r\n   I push the brush through my hair one more time before putting it down, standing up, and saying, \"I am done!!!\" at the same time which in turn causes Daisy to shake her head at me in a \"what am I going to do with you\"kind of way, Syf also did that with her and we ended up going to the guild.<br>\r\n   As we arrived Rhehri greeted us upon entry and shakes hands with Syf, it seemed they didn't think I would understand because I am young but they use gestures to say, \"I leave her up to you now\" I play the ignorant and we head over to the guild request board again, Syf holds me in a hugging sort of way but it was great because now I could see the requests. One quest in particular stood out because it was a reconnaissance mission, to study movements of some oddly dressed individual who travels with two other individuals, the difficulty was higher than you'd think but I decided it looked important so I choose to attempt it with my intuition.<br>\r\n   \"Rebbecca?! What is it?\" The fairy asks flying around in front of me. Syf also looked confused and curious in a similiar way. I stare at it a little more before heading out, \"This quest describes the targets of interest strangely, white and two others dressed with some weird camouflage like clothing.\" The fairy reminds me, it sounded familiar and it was strangely interesting to me.<br>\r\n   Syf leads the way as we begin to head to the direction the people were said to have gone, the client says they ask strange things like if a disaster happened or if a man came by with strong magic capabilities and such. Eventually Syf spots something and pulls me and Daisy behind a wall, I looked and confirmed it, scientist with white lab coat and two soldier people with guns and such, but why would they be here, where they still after me? I began to visibly shake, my body freezed up, I held tightly onto Daisy but released my grip to not hurt her and I sat down breathing deeply but silently, Syf had enough info to find out these people were terrible so she casted some wind magic toppling over the three, then she moved around the corner and casted light magic to restrain them like hardened light perhaps. They were held down and people nearby gasped surprised, eventually they were brought and arrested by the guards of the town, I was panicking because now more would come and find me and...<br>\r\n   Syf and Daisy shake me and I just stared blankly, I felt a blackout but in the middle of blackout I mumbled \"We need to run away, they have guns and and and...\"</span></div></div>",

This was the first actual day for me to wake up in this new body, it felt different as time moved on and I could feel a certain fairy(Daisy) sleeping in my ear so I left her be for now. I looked over to Syf and she notices me awake so she turns her face to face me but keeps on walking.<br>\r\n   She smiles to me and it feels motherly in a way, \"I heard you say that it was bad to stay so I told the guildmaster that we would travel around and to watch out for those strange people, I told her not to interact if they really are scary, just tell us if you need anything sweety.\" I sort of nod but the first thing that comes to mind is...<br>\r\n   I fully wake up and ask Syf, \"Sy, can I ask where we are going?\"<br>\r\n   \"We are going to the elven village of secrets, its name is manasia named after the magic flowing within the village, it is where my parents were born and I think you will be safe more or less there.\"(Syf)<br>\r\n   \"U-u-u-uh...o-ok...thank you miss Syghe, I mean Sy\"(me)<br>\r\n   She giggles a bit, \"That is just fine then, your welcome Rebbecca!!!\"(Syf)<br>\r\n   Eventually she lets me down and I begin walking on my own as I carefully follow Syf who obviously knows the way around, but my senses are oddly telling me which direction the village she was talking about is, I think the -elven village of secrets-? Either way I felt like I could see the whole area with my nose alone. I then see the village with my own eyesight and look at Syf who smiles to confirm, this was the elven village of secrets she mentioned. She also mentioned while we were traveling that the village held secrets but I couldn't see them unless I was filled with some elven blood. As they brought me to a room some unknown Elf came in and spoke so fast I couldn't understand, Syf was confused but seemed to have gotten the message. Their faces told me that they were worried or are worried about Syf in some way. I lay Daisy down on a small bed before sitting down myself. I look at my paws and think about the eoves of this village, they looked very happy, but then the image in my mind became more focused and clear, and real, like my mind was creating something.<br>\r\n   I saw magic begin to flow from my chest and as I looked down at my paws I saw them change to regular human hands, even the fur began to go away, I quick looked in a mirror to see what had happened and it looked like I was a normal little girl with red hair, except for two things, my tail stayed there, and my ears stayed the same. But I noticed my eyes, they changed into the colors of the rainbow and it looked magical for some reason, I quickly stopped thinking about how peaceful this village was and my body began to turn back to normal, except for the eye color, I looked in the mirror in disbelief, and panic mode. As I began to panic my fairy wings appeared from thin air and began to flutter and I flew straight up and hit the ceiling of the wooden shack I stayed in, I was physically strong but it caught me by surprise so I grasped my head and fell down my wings disappearing. The sound of the ceiling collision and my gasp of pain woke up Daisy who flew into the air looking for who scared me and a bunch of elves including the worried one who was wearing red white and black robes and Syf who left with her all rushed in to find the source of the panic. I was lying on the bed with my head being held in my arms the bump clearly visible to many of them.<br>\r\n   Syf went to my side and petted me to soothe me, it felt good so I managed to relax and forget about the pain, as I opened my eyes, everyone in the little house/shack gasped. Daisy Syf, the new elf and everyone else who came to see the visitor saw me and my rainbow glowing eyes, they all crowded around me and I began to get scared and nervous, I froze and my body stiffened, then I passed out right after that.<br>\r\n   \"...and after you all examined the cause of these special eyes it led you to conclude that she has mixed genetics?\" I was curious and confused of course but my knowledge as someone who learned what others say about you helped me deduce that they were talking about my rainbow eyes.<br>\r\n   \"Yes, it seems she has demi-human, elf, fairy, human, and some of her genetic makeup is pure magic, we don't know what to think of it, we might not even be able to understand it.\" It was that elf from earlier, the one who talked to fast for me to understand, they at least talk normally now though, or did I just subconsciously adjust to it, I might never know.<br>\r\n   \"So that means she qualifies as an elf? And a fairy? IKNEWTHISGIRLWASSOOOOOOSPECIALICAN'TWAITUNTILSHEWAKESUPANDWETELLHERSHEISELFF AIRYHUMANDANDDEMI-HUMAN!!!!!\" I am shocked and freeze on the spot shivers up my spine and they notice me awake by now.<br>\r\n   \"So I am a weird mix of species? What do you mean you can't find my actual species?\" I begin to panic out loud to them.(me)<br>\r\n   \"I am tuieya(pronounced tee-ah) and it is confusing because their is magic fluctuating, almost like you are deciding on whether or not you want to be a demi-human, elf, and monster or maybe demi-human, fairy, and dwarf. It seems you can change your race at will as long as it includes demi-human in it, maybe try to become a fairy let's see how that works?\" I look at her for a few seconds disbelieved eyes and get hopeful eyes in return. I sigh to myself and close my eyes before imagining myself as a fairy, I concentrate hard and give a lot of effort and eventually the effort pays off as I open my eyes and I am much smaller, I seemed to be glowing to, I probably could make my wings appear if I wanted to but they didn't because I wasn't prioritizing that. Daisy hugs me friendly smiling all the while.<br>\r\n   \"You are so cute as a fairy, and it looks like you kept your cute ears and fluffy tail!!!\" She was treating me so kawaii and it was kind of embarrassing but I didn't want to focus on that, eventually I changed back by focusing on myself, i needed to focus on the image to change myself it seems.<br>\r\n   \"So it seems you can change as long as you keep your tail and fluffy ears, not a bad exchange at all, as they are so cute!!!\" Tuieya smiles to me but I look shy and nervous as well as flustered.<br>\r\n   \"Does this mean she can be considered an elf for this village? She is young and means no harm, I am sure she will not cause any problems. You know if she is considered an elf citizen she can be accepted by any elf and she will have permission to see the secrets of the village but she won't cause trouble I promise.!!!\" Syf seems to ask of Tuieya.<br>\r\n   The Elf thinks and nods, \"The leader(s)(you can decide if one or more leaders later) have agreed with it beforehand but alright, your plea is accepted, Rebbecca is now an official elf in sociality among the elves!!!\" I was shocked and held my mouth open for awhile, but this was just the beginning, I was a true elf now.<br>\r\n   -The next day-...</span></div></div>",

I hover a few inches off of the ground and I get lifted back up onto the bed. I smile and look up to see the cause of both the attack and the heroineism, Daisy woke me up and prevented me from hitting the floor, I mouth the words thank you before getting up from bed and the hovering. Daisy flutters over to me and lands on my shoulder before I head on over, I brush my teeth and begin to deal with the basic necessities like hygiene and stuff and all I have to say is that Elves can make relaxing baths. I then dress in the clothes Daisy reccomended most to me, a green dress instead of red, it was a nice choice in color for now and it had the same effect as the other dress but the next part was harder, much harder.<br>\r\n   \"GET BACK HERE REBBECCA!!!\" Yes, Daisy was chaising me across the room while making a brush float over to me, I obviously declined, the time I have to brush my hair is the time I give in to the world, I was fine just the way I was and that is that, but Daisy just kept chasing me around trying to brush my hair. As she almost catches me I leap over the brush narrowly avoiding it then run over and grab Daisy before embracing her in a warm and cozy hug, the brush fell to the floor and she was trapped as I held her close to my heart, I was hoping this cute act would be enough to avoid the painful brush and luckily I was right, I managed to get her to forget about brushing my hair. Soon I let go of her and she sits on my head by the time they return. The two elves Syf and Tuieya arrive at the same time, 'Maybe they knew each other when they were young' I wonder to myself.<br>\r\n   \"It has been decided that we will try to teach you elven magic, from what we know, it seems you can use all the types of magic, but according to Syf here you haven't used magic but just physical ability.\" I nod to her as I haven't learned any form of magic, \"We will start as soon as you are ready.\" Daisy gives a thumbs-up to show I am ready.<br>\r\n   \"U-u-o-o...mmm, a-a-a-alright miss tyeya, I mean teeyee, I mean Tiyah. Sorry for messing up your names Siv and Teea.\" I sigh to myself.<br>\r\n   \"Haven't I always been happy with you, you don't need to get our names perfect, how about you call Tuieya here Tui(pronounced Twee) for short or lady T if you want to be really formal.\" Syf says after both of the elves giggle to themselves a bit, it seems this young body just butchers the name's of all elf kind, but I should get it by the end of the year or so...hopefully.<br>\r\n   -hour later-<br>\r\n   I was in the middle of an open field and an elf I had never seen before was instructing me, they were happy that I had already learned to feel and control my mana so they began to teach me the nature magic. They started with simple enough exercise and according to them I was learning really quick for my first time, but personally I felt like I was moving too slow, like I was exhausted and currently couldn't reach my potential. It took me ten minutes after they instructed me on the basics for me to try out what they taught me, feel the life force, help the force of nature grow and connect. Extend out to it and use the essence of your magic to protect and to gently care for the nature. I felt my mana holding the plant like a parent would a child and I protected it with all that I had, my love reached out to it and when I opened my eyes I saw a tree, but I mean't to only grow a little bitty sprout, this was way bigger than expected. The instructor was surprised at furst but soon changed to a proud and happy face like that of a carpenter admiring his famous works or an artist who has his piece in a museum dubbed \"priceless\" the elf was truly happy at my progress and I was just plainly surprised, so I could also use the other elements? Fire, water, wind, Earth, light, dark, special as well as this? It was very happy feeling for me, but then I thought, nature includes more then just plants right, I mean, Syf controlled a stream before. This thought was pushed out as I smiled thanking the instructor and hugging Daisy. Then I released her and waved bye to the instructor, she didn't have me master it, just the basics, a few tips, some training to get used to it, and some words of advice for me to grow with it over time.<br>\r\n   When we arrived back Syf was sleeping in her bed, Daisy looks at her and then yawns because of her, what I didn't know at the time was that since we arrived to this village they have been meeting with Syf a lot and Daisy in the meanwhile has been watching over me when I was training as well as while I slept for this first night here. They looked kind of cute there so I left them, I was able to sleep and it was still morning so I decided to try walking out into the village and meet the Elven people. I stepped outside and began walking in a direction without much thought into it.<br>\r\n   After a bit of walking a kid slightly older than me- NO I am mentally older by much!!! A little boy greets me and obviously his pointed ears are seen even if one is half-covered by his half-very light and half-very dark green hair, the dark and light part seemed to be mixed together so it didn't seem like it but if you counted each individual strand you probably would. He started by greeting himself, his name was uuwuuis which again seemed outrageous to me in terms of names, it sounded like: ooh-wouis or in a kids perspective: owies which seemed sort of weird to name this kid, what if their is an elven language, if so then maybe it would help my pronounciation? I found out he excelled at mixing water magic, Earth magic, and swordsmanship, or at least he wanted to say he was good at it. He can use swords and those two elements but they aren't very strong right now as he is young so he isn't really able to use them all in a real fight yet, I see he probably will do well in the future as he looks like that but not now, we ended up saying goodbye because I wanted to meet more people and his family needed him real quick.<br>\r\n   The elf in charge of magic weapons greeted me and I headed on over to him, he asked me what a little girl and the fairy are doing with Syf when she is an adventurer and I simply told him we formed a party as adventurers, he lightly chuckled at himself and asks why and I explain that it was the best option for me at the time. He doesn't ask for my abilities or for me to quit because he probably had Syf's trust, maybe everyone here knows her, no, maybe they know her parents and she is a lot like them? That seems to be the case, \"Well, then I have one more thing to say.\" I look at him curiously, \"I don't want to send a young elf out there unprotected so how about a gift from us to you, any one thing from this place, they are magic weapons so they aren't a run-of-the-day monster hunting tool or self-defense.\" I sigh, it would probably be too hard to refuse the offer as I am officially a little girl and an elf in their eyes so I browse the shop and skim my eyes over everything and my eyes stop on something, the bow. I don't know why but the bow just caught my interest, I looked at the magical description and it said provides special effects for the race that wields it, and a second effect that gives a bonus to physical abilities to its user based on magical abilities, and the second effect seems to work even without touching the bow, this was amazing!!! I brought it up to the elf up front smiling to him and he smiles back, he probably wouldn't care if I took his best work but this was just an extra bow that people didn't want, it did have a very odd magic effect though. I stored it in the crystal which when I tried to sense it it seemed to have no magic in it which was even more weird now. I headed outside in a wide open area and tested out the bow, it was amazing and it worked well with my sharp animalostic senses improving the accuracy and such by a lot and the arrow destroyed the target I hit which sort of made me jump in surprise, putting it away I rushed back inside and snuggled up to Syf and Daisy, I don't even understand what really hapoened there either but I fell asleep in the afternoon to the sound of Daisy and Syf's sleeping breaths.</span></div></div>",

I look over and see Daisy sleeping on a pillow on a nightstand safe and soundly. I then stand up quietly because Syf woke me up, I assume she can read my confused expression and she does but first grabs my hand gently and leads me outside from which I begin to see a major gathering of Elves, elf convention? Or celebration? The one who has been interacting with Syf and me the most, Tuieya, was the one who went up to me of course but it seems like she isn't the leader, she is probably the leader's left or right hand elf.<br>\r\n   \"I know this is sudden but usually when a newborn child enters our village we hold a celebration to commemorate the new addition to our family, and for you that would be this, some humans consider it a welcome party or for newborns a baby shower.\" I now understand the gist of it thanks to Tuieya and I look at everyone who came and they were all smiling at me, this sort of made me very nervous so I just sort of looked dumb standing there smiling, but it was easy for all of them to figure out that I was too nervous to move. They all came closer and started welcoming me in their own way, some would be silent and do something simple like a hug but those gestures you could feel the warmth of a family just from one. Other times people would give gifts to help me, some even started talking to me just to let me know the importance of this, it was sudden for everyone so I was genuinely surprised at some of the gifts or things they did which just made it all the more heart-warming for me, I ended up thanking everyone in gratefulness.<br>\r\n   It was 2 hours later and Syf began to lead me to my room, the gifts I recieved was a bag of cookies which I began eating so they wouldn't get ruined, a set of arrows for my bow which had notes attached to each one to show their magical effect, after I ate the cookies I began to organise the arrows based on their effect, I also got a stone, I was told the stone worked like what modern day people would call a phone. There was a bag they gave me to hold stuff and I thought it would be fine because my \"magic stone\" was very abnormal as it was, and finally I recieved a small dagger to protect myself if someone ever tries to use a sword or spear to fight me with, it was more to protect me if someone used a blade as I was a kid and I didn't have long arm reach. The magic tool maker told me he would show me how to make some magic tools later and I was really grateful for that and with all these things that I treasured in my heart I fell asleep.<br>\r\n   Morning came like usual with Daisy bouncing on my head to wake me up, \"Time to get up, this is going to be a great day, I can just feel it!!!\" She anounced to me energetically, I nod and go to the bathroom to get ready, I come out after a bath and all the basic functions and this time Daisy wanted me to wear a blue dress that matches the blue sky, she said it was because she found a place that was perfect for us to go to, I smile to let her know that I feel ready but when I see her swing the hairbrush in her hands smiling at me we continue yesterday as I begin making a mad dash away from her before Daisy follows me around the room.<br>\r\n   Syf heads into the room, Daisy and I stop and look at Syf who now stood there looking well dressed even though she was only wearing an elf adventure clothes she still looked much better than usual, maybe it was just the atmosphere, she was much happier than usual anyway. Yeah, not that we want to leave but we have to continue being adventurers or we would simply be freeloading, so Syf, Daisy and I headed out to a village Daisy said was not well known by the people around the previous village where we met but it was a great place for adventurers and had all sorts of places that would make it easier for people like us in terms of the people looking for me. Daisy like usual rode on my messy hair as we walked down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Since we were pretty far away(another benefit of the new location we are heading to as it is safer this way) and the place we were going to was in the middle of the continent we had two options, stop and make camp or travel at night</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>~after hours I feel piercing gazes surround me and my instinct is making me shake in fear~<br>\r\n   I resist the urge to look back but we were walking and Syf as well as Daisy were staring at me expectantly, I said we should keep walking to the village and it was night time, maybe because I was a fox but I didn't feel sleepy, wide awake in fact, Daisy wasn't even on my head but floating, but I kept walking, better than being near those people who are looking for me. Then I had an idea, maybe as the people try to look for me I can invent some disguise magic or something? I agree to myself to eventually learn it but then a thud and a sound of sparkles like fairy wings changes my thoughts as I turn around to see Syf on the ground sleeping and Daisy sleeping in her long elf ears. I sigh to myself and carry Syf with my left hand holding her head and my right hand holding her legs some would call bridal style. I remember Daisy mentioning it was pretty close so I could enter the town while they slept, lucky that adventurers don't get taxed I think to myself.<br>\r\n   I begin to approach the town and see it is surrounded by guards in armor and stone walls with a metal gate close at the moment torches licking the darkness and swallowing it with light flickering everywhere there was a torch. The guards all had animal ears and tails though, that sly Daisy is going to get it when she wakes up, she thought I would fit in perfectly, I was in the middle of the road so I was easily spotted but luckily I managed to shift out of my fur and other animal characteristics so I only had fox ears and tail, I smile at the two guards with tiger ears and tail and the other a tasmanian devil(not the cartoon but the actual ones found in Australia).<br>\r\n   They let me in silently as I show them my guild card and I recieve info for the closest inn, it was strange but other than the guards there was a lot of people out at night, the difference with the guards though was that they were all nocturnal-ish creatures, owl, wolf, possum, cat, panther and like me fox. I was approached by a family of foxes and they all looked like normal people with fox tails as their ears were covered by hair or hats, almost like they wanted to hide their ears but their personality told me it was just coincidence. \"I see that your friends are an alf and a fairy, haven't seen you before and haven't seen a fox demi-human that wasn't in our family, where did you come from?\" I look at the mom fox person who asked me and I show a little fear but to hide it I look away, it was already obvious though so the mom changed the subject, \"Although I haven't travelled a LOT so maybe...well maybe I can see you later.\" I sort of slowly nod ye and head to the inn, I enter pay a quick sum and the inn keeper was looking surprised to have seen this especially considering I was carrying them everyone else assumed I was using magic but the innkeeper could sense I wasn't using any magic which I was okay with for now, I bring them to our room and head out to go for a walk, I couldn't sleep after all. I say hi to many of the families and demi-humans I see and conversate with a few of them some of them like the wolves or cats also had a great conversation with me which helped strengthen my ties to this town pretty quickly, but when it was going to be morning the kids were told to run inside to sleep by their parents and a bell sounded throughout the town, I was confused and didn't move as my friends probably woke up right now I looked around confused in the middle of town wondering about what the bell signified.<br>\r\n   Some of the parents of the families whom I saw at night looked at me and said stuff like \"run\" but it was already too late, like rush hour in my world the streets filled with all sorts of demi-humans of all sorts nocturnal and not so much nocturnal creature people, they all were dashing past each other, making me dizzy in the process, and heading to work in their respective place like blacksmiths to their huts to blacksmith stuff like they do and shopowners to their shops. But about 75%of adults maybe 80% ran to the guild, as demi-humans they were all physically skilled and those with magic would be considered a skilled adventurer already, I could hear Daisy calling out to me from the inn but I didn't know where I was anymore and I grew dizzy from all the rustling about, many of the townsfolk left the town to do quests most of which were outside of the town(obviously). It was calm enough for me to move after three and a half maybe close to 4 hours, it was somewhere near 11'o clock I assume with the sun, I head to the inn and Syf crushes me with her arms and chest suffocating me, I was fine thanks to my strong physical abilities but I frown to let her know that their is a lack of oxygen in there, Daisy sticks to my face like a sticker hugging my cheek as they welcome me back from the streets of death, next time I will dizzy the townsfolk, from what I saw they were all far away from my physical abilities, not that they were weak, but I was very strong.<br>\r\n   We all head to the guild but a mother wolf stops me and Syf and Daisy stop to wait for our conversation, \"Hey, little fox there, yeah, you! I see your pink dress and though it compliments your red fur nicely I see that its quality is probably one of a human settlement maybe down west?\" I nod and I changed into my pink dress recently, it seems she is trying to thank me for talking to her last night, and because last night I kept her children company like a friend she was being extra nice to me. I listen to her some more, \"If you want I can improve your dress or dresses if you have more, or I can make you even better clothing that will make you so adorable and will keep you much safer than these dresses!!!\" I take the latter, it may take time to create and since she is creating many it'll take more time but it was a much better offer, I begin to take money out but she says it is a gift so I stop. I say words of grattitude and we leave as we head to the guild. The wolf mother said that the new clothing would be better, my magic bow increases my physical power according to my magical power in multiples, and the dresses the wolf was making had a similiar effect of mine, mine increased my magical power in accordance with my physical power but she said she would add an effect like my defensive power for physical and magical defense would jump by the same amount as the magical power. She also said it would resist certain things like magical affinities, the ones we mentioned earlier, and status effects although I already had a natural resistance to it so it probably didn't matter. It seemed the dress would also be able to hold magic power, I didn't understand that though so I just said ok as if I did understand it.<br>\r\n   We get to the guild and see that all the requests were taken and there were about two demi-humans writhing in defeat as they missed the chance to get requests. One of them was mumbling how this happened again who was a snow leapord and the other was a young girl with bunny ears, she looked like she was 12 or 10 by the looks of it, I approached her and she jumps so high she practically disappeared in the rafters of the ceiling before dropping down, I was amazed at her speed, I could tell she was special and I shook her shy hand to let her know I want to be friendly, \"Sorry, anyway, there are no requests, I have nowhere else I can think of but the library, want to come?\"<br>\r\n   I think that this is perfect so I agree instantly no time to think this over, I could learn magic after all, \"Syf, Daisy, want to come, we are heading to the library\" they nod and walk over to us, \"I am Rebbecca, nice to meet you...\"<br>\r\n   The bunny girl grips my hand and greets me properly, shy people rarely warm up fast but maybe I had some magic friendly aura because she greeted me, although she had trouble keeping still or talking at all so she was obviously still shy, \"I-I-I am F-Flora\"<br>\r\n   \"Nice to meet you Flora, how about we have a race, I saw you were fast, like amazingly fast!!!\" I compliment her and she blushes to let me know she knew it but it was hard to talk because of her shyness.<br>\r\n   \"A-a-a-alright, but I am the fastest in the town so please don't be sad after you lose.\" She smiles prettily to me almost like an elder sister, I nod and Daisy and Syf started saying no with gestures, they were probably worried about losing track of me and I smiled and told them it would be alright, I already saw where the library was so I knew where to go. Syf eventually signalled ready set and..............go.<br>\r\n   A smokescreen appeared instantly from the dust lifted from our take off, I feel the wind crack if that is possible and hear the sound cut off from Flora as well as me as we smash through the speed of sound and since this is really heated competition we did more than that and started moving past the speed of light, eventually I was running so fast I could no longer touch the ground, instead I began leaping from the buildings and anything my feet could reach, I may as well had been flying and Flora, I could guess was doing the same, but I couldn't turn my head to look or my speed would drop. I see the library and smirk then drop into a frown, I am going too faaaaaast!!!<br>\r\n   I fly through a conveniently open window and land on a couch, I was dazed and about 13 seconds later Flora flies through the window and knocks both of us down on the ground as we lay sprawled next to each other making snow angels without snow. Then we get up laughing at each other before Flora looks at me with sparkling eyes of admiration. I wasn't too tired but I could tell that even if foxes and my physical abilities SHOULD give me an advantage in stamina, this Flora girl clearly has more stamina, meaning she had been training hard, and her speed was close to matching mine, the town was very large so she was very skilled too!!!</span></div></div>",

Your running form is terrible and yet you run soo much faster than me!!!\" She still had those sparkling eyes and it sort of scared me even if I was supposed to say something like 'I wasn't that fast...' And this just held me in place, it was a big race though and both sides were skilled it was more my physical ability that was better but her form was much better than mine so it shouldn't even be fair.<br>\r\n   I muster up enough brain power to reply, \"I haven't weally had a good teacher.\" I curse myself in my mind for fumbling again but Flora looks at me even more, this didn't help as I looked cute and adorable, I was probably only faster because I was a kid but this just shows that Flora can't be separated from me any time soon.<br>\r\n   The bunny girl wraos her arms around me embracing me with a hug and starts shaking in excitement, if I saw her tail it would be wiggling repeatedly but I probably could see it if she turned around. My tail was being pet and my ears rubbed and over a minute of time I fall on the floor with a forced smile and my arms and legs in a position where one might think your dog position is saying, 'pet me more' and I couldn't stop myself, I was trapped in horror as the bunny girl pets me with her super speed, I nearly lose consciousness until my friends daisy and Syf shows up and Flora stops petting me which enables me to sit up gasping for breath, \"Daisy and Suive you came to save me.\" Curses I fumbled again.<br>\r\n   Flora looks happy and hugs Syf and Daisy in a tight embrace too tight for them to resist even though Flora was much younger then them at the age of 10, \"my name is actually s-\" Syf gets interrupted by the embrace.<br>\r\n   Flora squeals in delight, \"Suive is so cute!!! Daisy is just adorable!!!\" I laugh at them but then Flora goes back to petting me causing me to fall over in torture and forced delight.<br>\r\n   Having her breath back Syf restates, \"she mean't to say my name is Syf, and it is nice to meet you too, but may I ask where are your teamates?\" Syf hugs Flora and Flora just smiles, demi-humans seem to have low resistance to petting and kindness. I get up and make a small leap back before breathing a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n   \"It is nice to meet you all, Syf, Daisy, Rebbecca, and I lost my teamates in the snowy mountains, one of them caused an avalanche and all of them froze to death, I managed to keep away thanks to my speed and jumping ability but they were not okay, I think the places exact name was frozen alp of the zen? It had a weird name of course!!!\" She says in a sad but then 'everythings alright though' voice, she was very cheerful.<br>\r\n   I walk up to her and give her a hug, \"we are a pretty new team and you can join us if you want, but what you learn about us you keep secret okay?\" I smile to her welcomingly.<br>\r\n   The bunny ears straighten out kind of in a respectful way but her face was still just purely seeing the cuteness of the team. She nods yes and I look around carefully seeing that no one is around I revert back to my normal form, Flora's expression told me that she saw it with curiousity and not confusion. Then I raised both of my hands and closed my eyes, colors of all kinds floated up, the colors for the elements. She smiled with sparkles in her eyes once again.<br>\r\n   I release the magic and return back to what I did when I met Flora, my demi-human form I guess. \"Do you want to check the board again? Maybe they put up more requests, we came from a days travel, west of here.\"<br>\r\n   She agrees right away, \"Yeah, and while we are at it I can show you the best way to run. Also, Suive looks too tired so she and Daisy can wait here at the library and we can deliver the request.\" She says but it looks like instead of fumbling the words she said 'Suive' on habit even if it hasn't been that long. Syf laughs a bit from how cute Flora is and agrees, she saw what I can do so she usually wouldn't allow this for a child but I am a first. We wave 'see you later' and me and Flora begin running fast but not too fast as she begins helping me learn to run better. We arrive at the guild and see only one mission available, it had the objective of delivering a letter across the country, I look at Flora in confusion and she looks back the same way, the difficulty was a question mark, in fact, almost everything was.<br>\r\n\"Quest: deliver letter across the country past a few kingdom's borders<br>\r\nDifficulty:?<br>\r\nEstimated time of completion:?<br>\r\nReward:?<br>\r\nClient:?<br>\r\nDeliver target: bring it to the one with a scar across his eye, he has three clawmarks across his face and is blind but he can still read it, I am not sure how to find him but I know he is somewhere past the kingdom to the South of here.<br>\r\nExtra info:?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake a quest with no info<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust relax maybe read books for the rest of the day or have fun.</span></div></div>",

Curiously, your eyes quickly descend downwards as you gaze upon your body and the now large floorboards. To your surprise, your shirt and loose shorts manage to shrink along with your entire body sending a small surge of relief over facing sudden embarrassment. As you let out a momentary sigh of relief, your brain was still trying it's best to process over your sudden situation. Here you were, shrunk to half a foot in some strange building with no idea of how to return normal. While the whole incident did sound like it was ripped straight off of some cartoon episode, this was in no way an animated adventure. Scared and confused, you gaze about the strange interior at your new size trying to find any sort of out of place item or something that will aid your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'come on...there has to be something!' you think aloud as your eyes once again start to scan across the vast valley of floors. After squinting and slowly making a 180 around the room, you suddenly spot an item upon the floor that immediately snagged your attention. With no hesitation, you quickly sprint towards the strange object only to discover it being what looked like some sort of old stone charm. \"huh?\" you instinctively tilt your head to the right in a curious fashion as you gaze upon the strange charm. Just by gazing down at it, you quickly estimate that the stone must've been about half your size in both height and length, or at least that's what it seemed like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of just what this strange artifact was, let alone what it was doing on the floor, you slowly extend your furred hand out to place it upon the solid surface. At first nothing seemed to happen as your hand was adorned upon the rough textured rock, but in just a matter of moments you suddenly begin to feel a strange surge of energy begin to enter straight from within your hands. Startled by the sudden feeling, you quickly retract your hand back only to shockingly realize that the strange feeling continued to course down your arm and soon your entire body as well. In just moments, the odd surge causes your entire body to momentarily shudder as if your entire form was altering once again. </span></div></div>",

You were only about six inches tall now, barely much bigger than a mouse, not a respectable size for a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the room, everything was so much bigger now. You were still inside the house, and now it seemed to be a lot more menacing. Broken floorboards and small holes that were beneath your notice previously were now large enough to to be actual pitfalls. The legs of chairs stretched high above your head, and you had no hopes of seeing what was on top of shelves or tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled down from atop the shirt you had been wearing and nearly tripped as your feet touched down onto the wooden floor. It had seemed pretty smooth earlier but now it was a rugged full of ridges that felt rough beneath your pawpads. Sitting next to your discarded clothes on this floor you saw something else. A shiny perfectly smooth black stone. This was the stone you had stepped on without noticing earlier. Now the stone sitting on the ground was almost as tall as your waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the rumor about magical artifacts in this house were true! But you hadn't expected to get shrunk like this without warning! Maybe the stone could also reverse it?

You slowly edged up to the stone walking on the tips of your toes as your tail was held perfectly still in tension. Your ears folded back against your head and every hair on your body stood on edge.

It was like being in an entirely new world, full of giant broken furniture, stairs with each step taller than you, and cobwebs that could cover your entire body. Those were cobwebs right?

There had to be something else in this house you could use to try to get back to normal size. You'd just need to be a little more careful as you explore so as not to step on anything again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven your current stature, that shouldn't be to hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly advanced across hole riddled boards, occasionally having to leap across a board to keep going. You were back in the foyer, and trying to decide where to go next. You looked to your right, seeing the old decrepit stares again. Perhaps you'd look up on the second floor last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again... With your luck, if there was something in this house that could change you back... It'd be in the biggest pain in the butt place to get to... Meaning somewhere upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was totally gonna be upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, and quickly ran to the steps. Each step was taller than you were by about a head. Luckily, cat, so climbing was kind of what you were best at.  Bringing out your claws, it was easy to climb right up over the first step with no problem. And with the first step out of the way... There were only about 29 more steps to go. This... This was going to take a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep by step, you climbed up. Even at this small size, you felt like the stairs could give out beneath you any moment. Much of what was left of them was made of rotting wood, and there were more than a few holes. Perhaps your small size was a bit of a blessing here. Weighing so little you weren't actually at a huge risk... But you'd have to make sure once you were back to normal sized you were careful on the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached the top of the steps, feeling somewhat fatigued, but determined to move on. You were now in a long hallway with doors lining each side. All of them were closed, but with as bad a condition as this place was you were fairly confident you could find a way into each of them. It was time to start exploring these rooms one by one till you found what you were looking for. But who knew what the next artifact you found would be.</span></div></div>",

There was no possible way for you to get it open again, but the rotting wood had left a hole underneath it just big enough for you to squirm under. You ran on, leaping down the front steps, a task that proved to be somewhat terrifying once you realized it felt like a ten foot drop! Luckily, cats landed on their feet, and you were no exception. Though, you were surprised how light the impact was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went down the other two steps slightly slower... Hanging on to the top of a step with your paws as you slowly lowered yourself down. Once back down on the ground you resumed running to distance yourself from the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon lost in grass nearly as tall as you were. If you stood on the tips of your toes you could just barely see over it. It was like a jungle out here! Maybe inside the house had been safer. Still, at least you could kind of see which way you were going, and after running around in the grass for ten minutes eventually reached a sidewalk. Of course, it was gigantic now, each slab as wide as an entire house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow far was your home from here again? About six blocks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked off into the distance, the sidewalk a giant concrete  desert seeming to stretch forever. It... It was going to be a long walk home. But what else were you going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a little calmer, you moved on. Having had time to adjust, it was kind of amazing to see the world from the vantage. Street lights shot up into the sky higher than you could see, dandelions were big enough to climb, and a discarded cup looked like a cave. Actually... It was kind of fun. The world was like a giant playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd mere moments after thinking that, an ear splitting roar erupted near you, as something impossibly large screamed pass on the right.You let out a yeowl as your eats flattened and the fur of your tail puffed up! What kind of horrible demon was that!? Spinning in place frantically, you saw the source of the noise. It was just a car that had passed you by on the road. However, it had looked like some kind of enormous steel monster and sounded like the devil himself! For a moment you would have thought you were being attacked by Godzilla before it was far enough away for you to make out the whole shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis drove home how small you were again... And suddenly you felt very vulnerable standing there naked on the sidewalk. What if someone was walking by, didn't even see you and stepped on you! That would be a rather embarassing way to go. Maybe you should move into the grass and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that scream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears perked up as you heard a voice, it was one you actually recognized...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt a shadow fall over you as the source of the voice came near, and turning around you found yourself facing a pair of giant black paws. Craning your neck up, you saw as it shifted to a more orange color as you made out the shape of the enormous behemoth that stood before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name was Christopher, but you usually just called him Chris, and he was a fox that was in the same class as you. Actually, you had known him since kindergarten. Technically, Chris was your best friend. But you preferred thinking of him as a rival! You were just rivals who hate lunch together, had sleepovers together, attended each other's birthday parties and well... Okay, maybe if you had to testify under oath, you'd admit you were really fond of him as a friend... But admitting things like that out loud just wasn't the type of relationship you two had. And now that relationship had a new dynamic now that he was absolutely giant compared to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always been a bit bigger than you, usually by a head, but now he stood over you like a titan. As he saw you, he crouched down to get a better look at you, making it easier for you to make out most of his features. Right now, he was dressed in simple pair of green jogging shorts and nothing else. It made sense, he ran track at school and you had seen him out running like this several times to stay in shape. You supposed you should be happy he had noticed you before stepping on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That yowl sounded like...\" Chris muttered as hie eyes grew wide when he recognized your small shape. He said your name with a laugh, as his giant tail began to wag behind him. \"What the heck happened to you?\" He fell back onto his bottom and fell into a fit of giggles. \"You look like a mouse! And wear are your clothes!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny!\" You hissed and stamped a paw. In truth, despite his reaction, you were happy to see a friendly face. He might be able to help get you home a lot faster... Especially since you both lived in the same neighborhood. But... You weren't about to ask for help while he was having a laugh at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! It's just...\" Chris took a deep breath as he sat up properly. \"Seriously, why are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" You thought back to the house, and the strange stone that had shrunk you. Suddenly, you had something of a wicked thought, that if you lured Chris into the house, he might suffer the same fate as you! That'd teach him to laugh at you! Though... Then again that would make getting home harder... But at least there would be two of you to work together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted from your thoughts as you suddenly felt something punch your tail. Chris had grabbed it between two fingers and lifted you up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MROOOOOOOOOAWRL!\" You let out a screech. \"Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on, when am I gonna get a chance like this again?\" Chris asked as he let you swing back and forth for a bit while you squirmed. After a few moments of this, he set you down in his other paw and held you up to face level so you could talk easier. \"But seriously, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" You had to consider how you went about this here. Being full sized, Chris could explore the house easier than you to look for an artifact that could change you back... Of course, you could also try to get him shrunk too... And that might even make him more motivated to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was no guarantee there was any magic in that house that could change you back, and going back in might be risking all kinds of chaos for both of you. Maybe it'd be best if you were a little evasive for now and just asked him to take you home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to tell Chris about the house. Sure, the two of you were contractually obligated to give each other a hard time, but when push came to shove, the two of you would help each other out. Though, maybe not before causing a bit of mischief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... So... Here's what happened. You know that old house we've been told since we were little to never, ever, ever go into under any circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Chris tilted his head and looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I sort of went in there... And uh... Well you know all those playground rumors about how that place is cursed and full of strange magical artifacts well...\" You gestured at your own tiny body. \"Turns out, it's true! And one of them did this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you weren't currently able to fit into the palm of my hand I'd accuse you of trying to pull one over on me.\" Chris squinted. \"But given current evidence, regardless of how farfetched it sounds I think I can take your words at face value.\" That was good, it would have been difficult had he chosen not to believe you. \"So... What now? Are you just stuck like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" You thought to yourself. \"But... Maybe not! I mean... If something in the house could shrink me, it only makes sense there might be something else that could change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Why are you out here rather than back in the house?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because right now I'm barely bigger than a mouse!\" You threw your paws up in the air. \"That place is huge! It'd take forever for me to go through it on my own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you need help.\" Chris grinned. \"And now you're about to ask  me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Well... Yes...\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fair, fair.\" Chris nodded. \"You do seem to have a tiny little predicament. I feel like a really bad friend if I ignored your little problem. I mean, I wouldn't want you to think that I think that little of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop saying little.\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright fine! I won't say little, I wouldn't want to do anything to make you feel small.\" He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just enjoying this.\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" His smile somehow widened. \"I mean, I'm going to help! But... What are the odds I'll ever get a chance like this again?\"Despite his tone, he tend seem like he was ready to help. He slowly lifted you up to the top of his head and let you perch up there while he moved forward. You stepped off his paw grabbed the side of one of his now giant ears to steady yourself as you knelt down and made yourself comfortable. His fur was actually really soft... In fact, hanging out here was almost pleasant. \"Of course, you're going to owe me big after this. Alright... Let's head to the old house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Chris much less time to get to the house than it had taken you to make your way here. That made sense. Every 50 steps for you was only one step for him. Before too long, you found yourself in the familiar decaying house where this had started. Chris became a little slower here... And though you knew he'd never admit it, you could feel his fur standing on end around you. It was clear this creepy old manor got to him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Where exactly do we start looking?\" Chris spoke somewhat hesitantly. \"I mean... I don't even know what a magical artifact looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I till I walked into one...\" You muttered as you remembered the item that shrunk you had simply been a smooth black stone. You hadn't even noticed it, just stepped on it while looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I found your clothes!\" Chris pointed at the discarded shorts and shirt that lay on the floor not too far outside the foyer. He began to stroll towards them, and his mood seemed to lighten as he suddenly came up with new ways to tease you. \"You know... This may be the first time I thought your britches were too big for you instead of the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha haaaaa.\" You growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred to you at this point. It was pretty dimly lit in here, and as a cat your night vision was far superior to Chris' and yet even you hadn't seen the small black stone until you stepped on it. Unless you warned him, he'd probably stumble right over it himself while investigating your clothes. You -should- probably say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course... He had been giving you a hard time for a bit. If he found himself cut down to size a bit, it might make him a little more understanding. Of course, that'd make the house a lot harder to explore to look for a way to reverse it... But at least there would be two of you working together, and that made you feel a bit braver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just a few steps away from your old clothes, if you didn't say something soon it'd be too late.</span></div></div>",

You decided to stay quiet about the stone. Sure, getting around the house was going to be harder... But hey, you were two clever kids, you could come up with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it was pretty unlucky your clothes didn't shrink huh?\" Chris was still chattering away. \"Don't know which must be more embarrassing, being tiny or being naked. I  mean... Not like we haven't seen each other naked before... Granted we were two years old last time but still and-\" He paused. \"Wait I think I just stepped on something... Your underwear was half covering it so I didn't see it and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt yourself fall slightly downward, the reason was obvious. Chris was shrinking now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... So... I think I found what shrunk you...\" Chris suddenly sounded very nervous. The fox was shrinking. You could feel him getting smaller beneath you. As he did, it was  becoming harder to maintain your perch atop his head. His jogging shorts quickly fell down around his ankles, leaving him as naked as you as he quickly dwindled in size. After a few seconds, it was soon impossible for you to keep your balance as you tumbled off of him falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a sudden moment of panic. If you landed on the stone, you might shrink even smaller! Maybe this wasn't the best of plans... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you turned around, you found yourself facing one of the few students in your class who was still smaller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy. He wasn't someone you had ever really hung out with before... Mostly because he was a mouse, and you were a cat. Ignoring the obvious tensions that came from that, you were just several times his size and so hanging out would have just not been that practical. Or at least... You used to be. You were still bigger...  But instead of being about the size of one of your paws the mouse was now level with your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse wasn't wearing much, then again most mice didn't. They less owned clothes, and more scraps and cloths they had managed to snag from something bigger. Right now, Randy was only wearing a simple blue cloth tied around his waste as a makeshift loincloth that ended just above his knees. Other than that, his brown fur was completely uncovered, leaving him mostly naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich left him slightly more dressed than you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you saw the mouse's eyes widen as he stared at you, your ears flattened again as you felt yourself blush beneath your fur. It was bad enough to be seen like this by someone at school? But by a mouse? You'd never live this town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy called your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... That really you?\" He grinned slightly. \"What... Happened? You're so... Small!\" He suddenly bounced around you, studying your diminutive body all over. He paused as he noticed your still puffed up tail. \"Did something scare you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" A new form of embarrassment took over, as you quickly licked one of your paws and began to rub your tail fur back down. Randy being a mouse, faced a giant world like this every single day. There was no way you were going to admit how terrified you had been! Anything a mouse could do, a cat could do just as easily! And that included living life from a lower viewpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really... Cause... Your ears are flat against your head.\" Randy stuck his tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are not!\" You forced your ears upright and glared at the mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy... Easy...\" Randy took a few steps back.\"So... Um... Seriously... What happened? And... Are you aware you're currently naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It's fine!\" You hissed without thinking. \"And...\" You paused and glanced back in the direction the house was in. There was still the possibility of something in there that could change you back... And as much as you'd hate to admit it, Randy could be a big help. He was already used to this giant world, and could easily show you how to navigate the enormous house without getting hurt. Plus... Having someone in there with you would make you feel a little braver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, that would involve admitting you needed help. And as a kitten, you had a certain amount of stubborn pride. This was not a good time for it, but it was there.</span></div></div>",
