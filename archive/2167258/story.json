The two brothers stood still for a moment, watching as the figure walked toward them, before Dean erupted in a loud belch and returned to his eating. Sam didn\u2019t quite like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Dean\u2026Stop acting like a pig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please, Honored guests. Be calm. There is no offence to be seen. We are glad that you enjoy the bounty of Mother Earth. I\u2019m Rakhar, I\u2019m the shaman of this humble village. I speak the language of your people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure spoke calmly with a firm and yet soothing voice, as it moved closer to the thrones where the two had been placed by the tribesmen and left to eat for the previous week. The shaman then bowed his head low as he murmured to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, do not be alarmed. I\u2019ll now perform a ritual for my people. Alas, they\u2019re not as educated as me I the ways of the New World. Please, have patience and then, I\u2019ll answer all of your questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that he stood up suddenly, as he began to perform a series of moves, as if he was dancing and moving like a bird on land. As he did so he also touched both brothers, feeling their paunches and how well their bodies were toned, if at all. As the shaman oved and danced, Sam watched entranced, while Dean simply stared, while eating still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the show was over, all the tribesmen shouted the word \u201cKoud\u201d and then simply turned away and returned to their previous duties. Some of them went hunting, others back to their gardens, and a few kept bringing more platters of food to the brothers sitting on the thrones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you again for your patience, Honored Guests. I, Rakhar, will answer any question you have. \u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dean seemed to be engrossed with cleaning out his current platter, Sam took the word, while still eating from his current dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had come I these parts seeking for a\u2026a monster. Yes. Something that is not usually seen. We are FBI agents, from the united states tracking this monster down. Er, if you could help us to find this monster, we would be grateful. Also, why this food and why keep calling us Honored Guest? Not that I\u2019m offended by that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have no clue to what this 'ef bi ai' might be but from what you say you are warriors, am I correct? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will ask around in the village and we will help as much as we can to find about this monster. The food and the title is since my people have met few of your kind so you are almost as deities to them. Plus, is our tradition that guest have to be treated with all honors during the time of \u2018Rakhaneschu\u2019\u2026it is a feast for the abundance to the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe will be glad and happy to have you here if you wish to stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Dean, that had been silently gorging on the food, piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long will it be?\u2026*urp*\u2026and about the food\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman bowed low toward them once more as he made a sign to his people nearby, as they scurried away, returning moments later carrying big platters of roasted animals of various shapes and sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRakhaneschu will last for three more weeks. It would be great dishonor if you were to leave us now. Many would be offended, I believe. Food will be brought to you and, when you will want, we will be happy to let you indulge in the beauty of our village. <br>\r\nNow, please, enjoy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the villagers brought forth more dishes, Sam launched a glare at his brother, which answered back with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you wouldn\u2019t want to offend them? They will search te demon for us and refusing a gift isn\u2019t nice, Sam. Relax and enjoy something for once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, Dean. Still, try to keep it down. You\u2019re looking chubby there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s just bloating\u2026will pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two kept eating, so the villagers kept bringing. Dishes full of delicacies reached the two hunters and, after a few minutes, were brought away empty as more full dishes were brought forward. Both brothers soon lost themselves again to the taste of the delicacies they were being showered with. Between them Dean seemed to be the faster but, Sam too was able to eat for longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the villagers began to bring different plates to the two brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean found himself having, more and more often, platters with massive portions of meat and fruit, often followed by casks of a strange, and yet tasty, purple drink. Sam, instead, had noticed that what he was getting most where bowls of stew and soup, with a soft and yet very tasteful bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both kept eating, so they started growing anew. Already Dean was getting stuck in his throne like chair more often than before, while Sam noticed that he could barely see his own feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman smiled widely watching the two men eating so much and with such appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, the older one sure is greedy. We will enjoy him very much and very soon. The other one has better capacity. But need to be greedier. HE will grow well under our tutelage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDearest brothers and sisters\u2026\u201d he then said turnig to the villagers surrounding him \u201cWe will treat our guest with all honors, letting them to grow big and fat for us\u2026so that we will be able to offer them to Koud when they will be good and helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Great God, Koud The Devourer, will grant us a Grand feast with them\u2026I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The balance and texture of it were amazing and it was just right to eat not too hot and not too cold. Of course, unlike his brother has wasn't a savage when he was eating.  He took his time and slurped it with delight. This food made by the natives here was superior to all the times' Sam and his brother had to stop take fast food joints to get something to eat. The meat and vegetable flavors mixed well into the liquid of the soup. The bread was delectable as well it wasn't hard or anything, it was like eating a cloud. Sam was lost in a haze of bliss as he continued to eat. Sam had never let himself go like this but he was loving it, after living such a brutal lifestyle just being able to have a day of decadence was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIPPPP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam came out of his haze of pleasure after hearing an awful sound, it sounded like something was tearing. he thought his brother Dean ripped his pants or something but as he looked to his brother he saw Dean looking at him with a smirk. Sam wasn't sure why but has he looked down he saw his shirt was starting to rip, revealing his tan flesh pouring out of his shirt. Sam instantly blushed to a bright red embarrassed how he had ripped his shirt. His shirt had split on his lower belly unable to contain his weight anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man seems like it snuck up on you\" Dean teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Dean,\" Sam said as he tried to cover the rip. He couldn't believe that he had eaten so much that his shirt had ripped. Sam looked over to Rakhar who was still watching over them, \"Sorry I just have seemed to rip my shirt\" Sam said trying to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRakhar chuckled. \"Please Sam you have no need to apologize, we consider it to be a compliment that you enjoy our food so much,\" the shaman said with a soft smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man this stuff is delicious\" Dean said as he continued stuffing his face which Sam only rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRahaka couldn't wait to see how the brothers turned out once they expanded with fat.</span></div></div>",

I just wished to inform you that, since it has been already three weeks since you arrived, the management decided to offer you a loyalty reward for being here with us until now, hoping that you will stay here even longer. In a few minutes some of our staff will come and assist you to collect your prizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Darren left, the three men couldn't contain their excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! This place has to be the best in the world, wouldn't you agree guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Joey, smiling, as he kept munching on a cookie taken from a bowl at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Best vacation ever! *Mphm*...It's so good I don't want ever to leave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMumbled Chandler as he kept munching on the chicken wings his robot was feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Urp* Heck yeah. Joey, can't stop thanking you for taking us with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three kept eating, three beautiful girls entered the pool, each of them was scantily clad and moved with grace toward the three guest, helping them standing as they started to guide them toward their 'Loyalty awards'.<br>\r\nA short moments later, the three girls led the guys to a vast hall chocked full of balloons and banners, on which there were printed the names of the three guests. The girls, though, didn't stop there and guided forward the three americans each toward a table dedicated only to them, not so close that they could touch each other, but neither so distant that they couldn't talk between themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from behind a column, emerged the figure of Facilier, as sh addressed the three chubby guys, with a smile plastered to her face, as she did her best to not lick her lips too hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, Chandler, Ross, we wanted to show you our pleasure in having you all here in our resort and so we decided to prepare a party for you guys.<br>\r\nAnd to show you how good it feels to have you here, at the end of the party, we will also give you three an award.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, enough talking...and let's start partying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said the woman clapped her hands and from behind her appeared some other beautiful girls, each bringing within their arm a large, golden, cloche plate. as they arrived beside each of the guys they opened the cloche and left the plate full of food in front of the guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked at his plate and couldn't believe at what he was seeing. In front of him rested a large platter with the biggest hamburger he had ever seen. it was easily as wide as his open hand and he saw that there were at least three big patties inside, along with melted cheese and various strips of bacon. As he stared at it, he could feel his hunger, fueled by weeks of excessive meals, demanding him to eat that thing as fast as he could.<br>\r\nAt the same time, Chandler, took a good look at what the girl had left in front of him. At first he was envious of Joey but, as he saw the large bowl full of fried chicken, covered in barbecue sauce, with at the side a smaller, but not by much, bowl of onion rings he licked his lips in anticipation. Last, but not least, Ross received his plate and he too began drooling at the sight of his course. On his plate was resting a very large square of lasagna, within it he could see the cheese, the meat and the sauce all mixed together to perfection. So enthralled he was by it that he couldn't stop himself from sniffing it, enjoying its aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacilier words suddenly brought the guys back to the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to wait, dear guests. This celebration has just started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said the three Americans began eating in earnest, each of them enjoying the flavor of his own dish. Joey, began taking big bites out of his burger, munching and, quickly, swallowing each load, loving the fact that the bun was so compact and meticulously prepared that not even a drop of sauce fell from it. Ross also had started to cut his lasagna in smaller pieces, eating them as fast as he could. After the first bite he felt in heaven and, if he only could, would have taken the entire thing within his mouth so good it was.<br>\r\nChandler, instead, had decided to go whole hog with his chicken and, without caring of the grease covering his hands, he started to tear as much meat as he could from his plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying themselves immensely the guys made a quick work of the plates they had received and the room began to fill with the sounds of their appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as Facilier had said, that was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after they had cleaned their plates, more girls began arriving toward them, each of them bringing forth a new deluge of treats for them to consume, and that they did. Plate after plate, course after course, the three guys kept eating, enslaved by how good those plates were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it showed. Each of them was now sporting a good sized potbelly, slowly filling up with tastier and tastier food. Facilier enjoyed the view of the three porker growing, still she knew that soon, due to how heavy were those dishes, they were going to stop. But she couldn't have any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, the three of them had grown chubby since their arrival but the yearly festival of her people was due by the year's end and she needed the three guest of honor to be in Full shape for that time.<br>\r\nTaking aside one of the waitresses, she explained to her to start using that 'spice' on the next dishes they were going to serve.<br>\r\nThe girl gave back a quick nod, while smiling widely, showing her own pure white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChandler, meanwhile, was caressing his own tight packed belly, while burping in one of his hands. He had never eaten so well and still, he was beginning to feel full. After his chicken fried feast he had devoured a large steak with fries, he still could feel the meat melting in his mouth, a seemingly small mountain of chicken nuggets and some delicious deep fried sausages in various sauces, loving every minute of it. He had loved it so much that, even though he was feeling full-ish, he didn't want to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss and Joey were in similar positions, both had eaten a massive amount of food, but instead of feeling sickeningly full, they both were enjoying so much that they wanted more. Joey, while massaging his stomach, kept recalling the delicious oversized hot dogs or the massive portion of burger-lasagna he had just wiped out. Similarly, Ross, was recollecting of the large pasta dish he had received at some point. It had been so full of cheese, cream, eggs and bacon that he had loved every bite of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir thoughts were suddenly interrupted when three more plates were brought to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys, even though were wishing to continue, started to feel full and were worried that this marvelous feast could soon become a nightmare if they kept at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacilier smiled at them, knowing full well the effects of the spice she had ordered to apply to the plates, and tried to goad them to eat some more. She knew that they were getting full, it was enough to check their full tummies to know it but, she also knew that if they brought the spice within their systems everything would have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spice in fact was a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Facilier smiled as she saw Joey getting a bite out of the big bacon burger that he had just received and her smile got wider and wider when she saw also Ross and Chandler getting on with their plates. The spice she had ordered to be mixed in the plates was a natural appetite stimulant and that would ensure that the three men would surely keep eating a little bit more, before stopping.<br>\r\nSure, she wasn't going to give them more of it that same night, for as it gave hunger, it didn't have any healing property toward the digestive tract, but every once in a while she knew could give it to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following hour and half the three guys kept shoveling food down their throats as if they were starving and, from their point of view, they surely were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey, as soon as he had swallowed the first bite of his bacon burger, felt himself ravenous. His hunger seemed to spike out fo the blue, but he was too under it to wonder the why's of it. He simply inhaled the bun he had in his hands and eagerly started on his next course, which was rapidly delivered by one of the waitresses, as he sent a glance toward his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't in a much different position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChandler had just given a small bite to the chicken drumstick that one of the waitresses had brought him when he felt himself compelled to eat more. Like an animal he began cleaning drumstick after drumstick, his lips and cheeks getting covered in grease, while one of the girls stood at his side cleaning him every time she could without interrupting his frenzy. Ross instead, as soon as he had swallowed the small forkful of Fettucine alfredo's felt a strange taste in his mouth but, any thought related to that got overruled by the hunger he felt growing within himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time passed, each of them began slowing down. Even though they were still feeling peckish, each of them was stuffed as their full, and taut as a drum, bellies could prove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...*Urp*...Can't believe how much I ate...'t was good though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChandler mumbled by himself as he kept burping and belching, trying to relieve some pressure from his lead ball of a stomach. Ross and Joey agreed whole heartedly as they too tried to relieve some pressure, while the waitresses cleared their tables and, after that, returned to their side to massage their stuffed bellies. In all of this, Facilier, had seemingly disappeared, as she had consumed her own small meal,  but quickly returned when the guests were being massaged by the beautiful girls at their sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the dinner was up to your tastes, honored guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss answered for all, as he saw that the other two were way too taken with the massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Never, ever, have eaten such good plates. Almost wish it could be like this at every meal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Facilier with a smile \"...I think that it can be arranged, if that is your wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe-*Urp*-Awesome!\" shouted Joey with excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, though...\" started again the woman \"It's time for your rewards! My husband, Mazu, will give them to you right away. <br>\r\nMazu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the end of the hall a set of double doors opened and in entered Mazu, followed by Darren and by one of the waitresses. The three of them had each an object within their arms but, as it was covered with a sheet, it wasn't possible to understand what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazu stepped forward, taking the word and addressing the three Americans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As my wife has said, we thank you deeply for your presence here. We're honored to have you all here with us and we hope you'll want to stay as much as you want. But enough of that, I am here because we have a gift for each of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motioned to the waitress to move, and she did so until she was at the side of Ross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you Ross, we have decided to assign to your persona one of our own waitresses. She'll be at your side to pamper you and to assist in your every whim, for all the time you'll be at our resort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl then took out the sheet and revealed a glass case containing some kind of remote, which she swiftly gave it to Ross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that remote...\" contined Mazu\"...Ross, you'll be able to call for her assistance whenever you need, at whatever time you'll need her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss gave a look of uncertainty toward the girl, which just blushed and whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Suzana, it's a pleasure to assist such a good man\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ross began to blush beet red, Mazu turned toward Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, For you we decided to give you something you may have desired since arriving here. Darren, if you would?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren walked toward Joey and, when he was at his side, revealed the content of the box he was holding. Inside there was a simple looking pin. As Joey took it in his hand it began to glow and a mechanical figure emerged from behind his table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, Joey, is F33-DR, but we simply call him Chef. We saw how excited you were with Chandler robotic assistant and so we all agreed to provide you with a similar model for your own use. He'll be always ready to answer any of your calls at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey, even though was still enjoying the massage, couldn't refrain himself from raise his arm and shout in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yeah! Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mazu finally turned toward Chandler, which seemed to be envying his two friends, but also quite excited at the prospect of his own incoming gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chandler, for you we have discussed long and hard on what to give you. We wanted to show you our appreciation and so we hope that this will suit your tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mazu spoke, he also moved forward and extracted a little remote from the box he was holding. As soon as Mazu used the remote, Chandler heard a light whirring sound and actually saw the floor giving away from him. At first he began to feel scared until he realized that the chair he was own wasn't a normal chair but a floating one. Suddenly excited he began looking at the hundreds of buttons that began to appear on the handles until he just smiled in happiness toward Mazu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear guests\" Facilier took word moving to stand by Mazu \"We hope you enjoyed this celebration and we wish for you all a wonderful rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I just spoke to our personnel in the kitchens. As you asked, from now on, all of your meals will be arranged as they were for this celebration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three friends walked/waddled away, helping themselves with their gifts, Facilier, Mazu and Darren moved closer to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a good idea you had, dear wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mazu, Between the gifts we have given them, the spice that we will use from now on and the every day multi courses meals, they will sure fatten up until they reach the right size for the Yearly Festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle? Aunt? How big do you think they'll get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As big as we can make them\" Facilier answered \"But we need to keep them stuffed, in the dark and as lazy as they can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as night time approach...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, you\u2019re right on time. Please, sit anywhere you like.\u201d \u201cWhen is everyone else supposed to get here? I thought this was an audition.\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cOh, yes. Good news! I\u2019ve decided I\u2019d prefer you for the role I had in mind.\u201d \u201cReally?!\u201d Exclaimed Jackson. \u201cThat\u2019s great! What\u2019s the role, exactly?\u201d \u201cIn due time. In the meantime, eat your fill. You\u2019ll need to put on some pounds for this role.\u201d The two looked at each other uncertainly and began to peruse their options.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have to say, you have such a trim figure. I\u2019m almost jealous.\u201d Jim said with a slightly mischievous tone. \u201cThank you?\u201d Jackson said confused. Jackson exchanged some perplexed glances over this sudden comment on his appearance. \u201cLooks like that\u2019s a thing of the past. Keep eating.\u201d Jim said with a smirk. The boy continued eating plate after plate, but began to slow down, eyes watering in discomfort. Finally, he  leaned back in his chair, belly round and distended. \u201cUgggh.\u201d Jackson moaned in discomfort. \u201cI can\u2019t eat any more.\u201d<br>\r\n\tJim\u2019s eye twitched in annoyance. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop now. You can\u2019t stop until you eat everything on that table.\u201d He said sternly. The boy\u2019s eyes widened in shock, looking at the veritable mountain of food that still lay before them. The buffet was enough to feed well over 20 people! \u201cI can\u2019t eat that much!\u201d Cried Jackson. \u201cI thought you really wanted the part. This is to show me you\u2019re committed. Now eat. Once that table is cleared, we can discuss your  role.\u201d Jackson  exchanged some looks and reluctantly went back to eating, doing his best to ignore their aching stomachs. After just one more plate, he recoiled and grabbed his throat, caustic bile welling up and threatening to come spilling out. Swallowing, he leaned back in his chairs and took a few ragged breaths, only just barely having avoided throwing up all over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(how will they continue the \"epsiode\")<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking through the comments he saw a lot of fans saying that they enjoyed his music and loved him through a few comments caught his eyes all saying stuff about one of the comments read \"Wow Justin really plumping up \"reading a few more of the comments he looked at himself in the mirror notching his belly sticking out 'I must just still be bloated from last night but there was a few comments about my weight maybe I should ask Jenny she wouldn't lie to me \"thought Justin as he left his room and made his way to the Kitchen and saw Jenny making the large breakfast that he had became use to \"Hey Jenny can I ask you something \" asked Justin standing next to the table <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can \"replied Jenny with a kind smile as she started to put dishes on to the table <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think am getting fat because there was few comments on my Instagram post saying am getting fat am not right ?\"asked Justin his hand going subconsciously to his potbelly .Jenny couldn't help but smile at Justin progress he already had a potbelly and small love handles through Jenny also cursed herself mentally she should have known fans and social media would case a problem she couldn't let Justin fans see how fat Justin is getting she would have to think of way to fix that later right now she quickly answered Justin <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not you still fit and have a six pack those people who commented your getting fat are just being haters \"said Jenny giving her best smile it seemed to work because Justin smiled back <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your right they just being haters am still fit anyway am starving \"said Justin taking his seat drinking his milkshake before starting to stuff his face with bacon before quickly moving on to the next one it wasn't long before Justin had finished all the food and was fast asleep on his chair.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James Podrick had distinctly changed many players in his career, moving from club to club he had managed to bring down many champions form their top form to become his top meals. Yet, due to his natural charisma, his leadership skills and his trustworthy appearance, he had never been caught or been suspected of anything when those players shamed themselves on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking them easy prey for him to consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, his reputation increased, even without producing any notable progress in the teams he worked for. Now that he had the possibility to catch one of the most famous players in the world, he wouldn\u2019t miss it for anything. Quickly he had arranged a meeting with the team owners of Cristiano\u2019s team and had been granted to train the team, with the small clause that he could focus on one of them if the case was to arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat in his office, looking through the reports of each player, he quickly fished out the file of Cristiano Ronaldo and scanned it for any bit of useful information. The person was a mean killing machine, the perfect soccer player and yet, he had to bring him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James had an idea, The idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked tirelessly the entire afternoon to put in motion his plan, by making calls, by spreading false information and even coming down to directly bribe some important people. In the end he had everything staged and ready to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to change the dietary plans for Cristiano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day an insane number of medical reports was going to be issued by the medical section of the team owner\u2019s company.  Each and any of these reports were going to prove that Cristiano was in a severe health condition, that he was so malnourished that in a few months his organism could simply collapse under the stress. Then he, James, was going to be chosen to make sure that Mr. Ronaldo followed through with the new diet to balance his condition before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course everything was a complete lie, even the diet was going to be prepared by him, and he for sure was going to pump his new meal-to-be full of countless calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day events progressed just as James predicted. It was a day full of shouting, of people phoning other people, of experts being called and of proofs being verified. But in the end, as the day progressed to its end, he received a call from the CEO of the team\u2019s company, granting him full power to manage and \u2018restore\u2019 Cristiano well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the following day, James called Cristiano to his office. He knew the player wasn\u2019t happy about those reports, Cristiano openly said that those were complete lies but, within himself he was scared that it could be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Cristiano, I think you know why I called you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about yesterday, isn\u2019t it? Man, I can\u2019t believe it. I feel fine. I don\u2019t feel \u2018malnourished\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you do. To be completely sincere I don\u2019t think this will last long. Still, no harm in play along for a bit? If it\u2019s a lie, as you said, you\u2019ll just have lost a few days\u2026but if it\u2019s true, then you\u2019ll have the upper hand, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano thought deeply about this and had to admit that his coach was right. What had he to lose? At worst, he would have to spend a few more days in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026Yeah I get you. Ok. So, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimply put, they have sent me your new dietary plan. Therefore, I\u2019ll follow you at meal times, and whenever you need me, so that I can give living proof that everything is going on as they asked. Don\u2019t worry, everything will settle down. You\u2019ll see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow come, since we are both here we can start already. The earliest we start, the earliest we finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames began to lead Cristiano to the mess hall of the training facility they were in, where a full team of chefs were already hard at work in making sure that whatever Cristiano was going to order, he was going to get it at the best of their abilities. <br>\r\nJames led Cristiano to a table and told him to wait him there as he went to speak with the man at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m James Podrick, Cristiano\u2019s coach. I\u2019m here to make sure he follows the proper nutrition as per his medical records. So, since it\u2019s almost lunch time I would say that you can prepare a couple of things for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, let me show you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, as Cristiano and James were idly chatting at the table, a waiter arrived and left some platters right in front of the player, uncovering them and quickly moving back toward the counter in wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano stared wide eyed at the food he had received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in front of him, there was a big plate of macaroni and cheese, with a heavy looking sauce coating the whole plate, then there was a slightly larger platter with a large steak, almost two inches of height, with a conspicuous amount of fries and fried bacon as a side dish. But there was also a last plate with a seemingly small-ish slice of devil\u2019s food cake and a large bottle of soda, should he feel thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? You\u2019ve gotta be kidding me\u2026This is my lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember Cristiano, what have you to lose? You can fight against it and people might find that suspicious\u2026or you could just do as they say and if something doesn\u2019t go as planned, you\u2019ll have the upper hand. Plus, a break from all those skimpy meals doesn\u2019t sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm. Didn\u2019t thought about that. Thanks, Coach! Man, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get used to these massive portions, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano then grabbed his utensils and began scooping up the rich and heavy pasta, softly moaning from the rich taste at each of his bites. It didn\u2019t take long for him eat most of the pasta but, in the end he had to stop from cleaning his plate, as he moved toward the steak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, as morsel after morsel found its way into his mouth, he couldn\u2019t stop from moaning in pleasure. The steak was perfect, neither too cooked nor too raw, it simply seemed to melt on his tongue. Same thing happened with the fries, which he covered in lots of ketchup and mayo, blinking toward James who watched him raptly, finishing then with almost clearing all of the bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping in pleasure, Cristiano stopped for a bit, as he massaged his bloated stomach with one hand, as he felt all that food rest peacefully in his belly. With a few minutes rest, he finally brought closer the slice of cake and once more the taste almost overwhelmed him. It was so rich, and yet so tasty and light that he found himself wishing idly for a little bit more as he realized he had practically inhaled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026*Urp!*\u2026Oof, \u2018scuse me, Coach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. So, how was everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUtterly perfect, Man. So good\u2026Will I eat like this at every meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes. Mostly. Think you can manage for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano grinned to James, as he patted his full, slightly bloated, belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get used to it but, Ok. I\u2019ll bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days began to pass, so James kept close watch on Cristiano as he began his descent into the hedonistic pleasure of gluttony. Still, even though he began eating much more than he had ever done, the guy was still working out in the gym and performing training and exercise on the field and so the changes in his body weren\u2019t so visible as James had hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good. If he keeps working out, he\u2019ll never become tastier. Need to have him to stop for a bit. He has to slow down\u2026Or maybe would be better to just increase the numbers of meals he\u2019ll have to consume?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmh\u2026must think on it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For that reason he had to stop altogether. That, along with the heavily caloric meal plan he was on, would surely fatten him up good. James rapidly took the phone and began making a series of calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I need to speak with Mr. Clarkson, the deputy CEO. Yes I\u2019ll wait on the line. Hey Frank, yes, it\u2019s me. I need to call in that favour\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? Can I speak to you in private?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure Coach. \u2018Sup guys? See you later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cristiano left the team and reached James he was still sweating a little from the exercise session he had on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Coach? What\u2019s the matter? I\u2019m following the meal plans as ordered\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know you do, Cristiano. But\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d Here James did his best to appear as if he had been ordered to do something he hadn\u2019t agreed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the Administration team of the Company thinks that having you sowing on the field could provide a \u2018Marketing Apocalypse\u2019, as they said, if you were to collapse. For that they\u2019ve instructed me to \u2018ask\u2019 you to take it easy on the training for a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano grew angrier by the minute as he understood where James was going with his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? They\u2019re still yapping about those health reports? Man, I\u2019m fine!\u201d<br>\r\nJames quickly brought one hand on the shoulder of the player, encouraging him.<br>\r\n\u201cI know how you feel and I tried my best to let them understand but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut those wussies think only of the money\u2026I know I can count on you Coach. So, what I have to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBasically they\u2019re asking you to take a two week long vacation in an hotel they\u2019ve provided, without performing any kind of physical exercise. Naturally, I\u2019ll come with you to help you and be there if you need me. Who knows, maybe you will see that it can\u2019t be as bad as you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoach\u2026Thanks. Sheesh\u2026some people really believe anything, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes they do, Cristiano. They totally do.\u201d<br>\r\nSaid James as he grinned like a cat with a cornered mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple days later, Cristiano and James were in the fancy resort provided by the company, which in turn had received the suggestion from one of their own, who was secretly on the pay check of James Podrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had chosen very carefully the place where he had to keep Cristiano for those two weeks. After all, he had only this chance to change the soccer player to turn him in the sluggish and lazy glutton he needed. The resort was located on a private property island in the Mediterranean Sea, near the coast of Greece. Moreover, most importantly, it catered to only a certain set of people; those who were in the fetish commonly known as Feederism. <br>\r\nHere, in this resort, James was sure that he was going to be able to turn Cristiano from the fit player he was to what He really needed him to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA delicious, fattened, meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo, Coach, what I\u2019m supposed to do here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Cristiano, you could go and take some tan on the beach, or maybe do some sightseeing around the place. I have heard from one of the girls at the counters that every day there countless activities and shows to have around here. As long as you don\u2019t exercise and you keep on following the schedule they\u2019ve given you, I don\u2019t think there will be any problems. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMh-mh\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano didn\u2019t sound too convinced but, he wasn\u2019t there for his desire. Still, the idea of having nothing to do for two weeks was new to him and so, as first thing he decided to just relax and enjoy his first day there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Coach. I\u2019m gonna just try to rest a bit for now. Could you, please, ask them to send me my lunch here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, Cristiano. I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the soccer player seated on the bed watching some TV, James went out of the room and called for the room service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Coach Podrick. Yes, the guests of the luxury suite. Yeah, I wanted to ask you to bring up to our room one of your own Lunch Combo Special meals.<br>\r\n Yes. No, the other guests isn\u2019t\u2026affiliated so to speak, I\u2019m sure you understand.<br>\r\nOkay, thanks. We\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome fifteen minutes later, just as James was going to call back the kitchen, the waiters brought inside the suite, right next to the bed where Cristiano was laying, a couple of trolleys. With an efficiency that James had rarely seen, the two waiter girls quickly placed all the food on a mobile tray so that Cristiano could eat without leaving the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Sir. As per instructions received from your company representative, we\u2019ve got here your lunch. Please, enjoy.<br>\r\nIf you are in need of anything else, don\u2019t hesitate to call us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano suddenly found himself surrounded by a plethora of food. In the past few days he had gotten used to eat a little bit more on the heavy side and so he didn\u2019t said anything aloud but, he could see that the people here had been forewarned of his coming. There was no way that the meal he had under his nose was something not prepared for him specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stared with a satisfied glint in his eyes, the place was known to cook on the heavy, and fattening, side of things and the meal they had brought wasn\u2019t short of his expectations. Still, Cristiano didn\u2019t seem to mind as James saw him start the meal without any of usual fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James watched, Cristiano began on clearing plate after plate, fried shrimps with a sweet, but highly caloric, sauce, then some fried mix with various tasty bits of various fishes. Passing then onward toward the main courses, clearing out bowls of Chinese pork noodles, made extra tasty with heavy addition of oil and grease, then some fruit candy, to freshen the meal, without losing any calorie gained. And finally , dessert, a rather large slice of a strawberry cake.<br>\r\nEverything along with a couple bottles of fine French wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cristiano cleared out almost everything, he felt completely stuffed and yet, he still couldn\u2019t say that it was starting to feel good to have this kind of diet implemented into his life. Still, as he lay on the bed, caressing his bloated stomach, he began checking the activities of the resort through the digital pamphlet on the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames though, had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh. Cristiano. Don\u2019t forget why they\u2019ve sent us here\u2026As much as I don\u2019t like it, if They hear that you\u2019ve followed a beach volley tournament here, we\u2019ll both be fired.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cUrg\u2026*urp*\u2026and so? What should I do then?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here today, rest a bit, watch some TV\u2026and maybe later on we can go to the arcade. I heard that they\u2019ve got quite a big soccer simulator in there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTrue? Well\u2026alright\u2026*yawn* I guess I\u2019m getting a little bit sleepy\u2026I guess we can go there\u2026tomorrow\u2026to check it\u2026out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, due to the heavy meal he had just cleared, Cristiano fell asleep on the bed, while James moved closer, as the player was loudly snoring, and began to rub that bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Cristiano. Eat, sleep and do nothing else. I need you to grow more for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first three days passed uneventful for the duo, James and Cristiano didn\u2019t do much in those days, except for staying in the room and eat, or going to the beach for some tanning and eating. Cristiano began to see the truth in James words, as much as he had loved going to the gym, there was something in staying all day in bed, eating his meals and, occasionally, having a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Cristiano wasn\u2019t having only a few snacks along the day but he was more grazing throughout the entire day. Still as the first week passed away without any incidents, James could see as Cristiano began to act more lazily. Not only he had stopped waking up in the early hours, preferring to rise not before the nine in the morning but he also seemed to grow more apathetic against the world surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the fourth day that something seemed to be starting to stir in Cristiano\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

James quickly intervened, he had to make Cristiano as lazy as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? What are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh? Just\u2026just cleaning up a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHere, get on the bed and don\u2019t worry. Attendant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as James called two beautiful girls entered the suite, one began to clean everything around, while the other moved beside Cristiano, massaging his shoulders and, occasionally, giving him a few pastries to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see? It\u2019s their job. You wouldn\u2019t like to steal it from them, would you Cristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, once more comfortable on the bed, began once more to watch the TV, as he kept munching on the pastries that the girl beside him kept on giving im.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026Coach. Man\u2026sure is tiring\u2026being here\u2026gotta admit there is something to\u2026just rest.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit! Now, rest some more and then I\u2019ll have Dinner brought in.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYup, Coach. *Gulp*\u2026Dinner shounds\u2026sho good\u2026*urp*\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first week passed, James could see he was onto something. Cristiano barely had moved from the bed as he kept eating all of his meals and kept on grazing throughout the days  on all the snacks the attendants brought to him. Sometime, just to be bold, James tried to double the player intake during lunch or dinner and the results had been optimistic. The player managed in both cases to clean out almost everything and still he kept on snacking through the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames could already see the first effects that this new lifestyle was having on the player. Since Cristiano had dropped the gym and the exercise he was really starting to chub up, his belly now began to droop a little on his tight shorts, giving him a slight muffin top, while his moobs had also begun to bloat up becoming small puffy hills. Overall he was getting chubby but, for James, chubby wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhi, Coach? I\u2019m putting on weigh or what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026what do you mean, Cristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer player was now checking himself in the mirror and was particularly staring at his torso, noticing the soft layer of pudge he had on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean this Coach\u2026Did I have it already? Man, I\u2019m confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames played it as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything different. Wait; let\u2019s see from an external opinion. Girls? Do you think my friend here has changed in any way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two attendants, which passed basically all their time in the suite with them, turned and looked meticulously to Cristiano but, both smiled as they answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSincerely? I just see some guy who could look really great if he wasn\u2019t so thin.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSeems just the same. I can\u2019t see anything different\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Cristiano? I think you\u2019re just letting your worries getting to you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026you\u2019re probably right Coach. Anyway, Coach, what about having lunch earlier today? And, about that soccer simulator you told me about, well maybe we can go there tomorrow? I don\u2019t really feel up to it today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cE-Earlier lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was caught off guard and so answered back questioningly, but the player didn\u2019t seem to worry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019m getting hungrier than usually. Must be that I skipped breakfast today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick grinned wickedly within himself. <br>\r\n\u2018Skipped breakfast? But if just today I gave you two times as much as you usually have? Well, if you want more, I\u2019ll give you more\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Cristiano. It must mean that you\u2019re getting back our strength if you\u2019re getting hungrier\u2026 I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James left the room, Cristiano went back on the bed and began once more to do some zapping as one of the attendants fed him donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026so good. Keep \u2018em coming babe.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir. As you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, James was talking with the kitchen staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, It\u2019s Podrick here. Yeah. No, actually, my friend here is asking for something earlier today. Yes. Yes, I was thinking of two of yours Lunch Combo Special meals and an All Dessert Dream to close the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I\u2019ll call you back to let you know if it need to be made the new normal from now on. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James returned inside the room, he smiled as he saw Cristiano. The guy was really becoming an hopeless lazy glutton, just what he needed to be. Still, it was always better to play it safe and so he decided to bring in the game a weapon he had learned to love when it was time to fatten up quickly someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano, Lunch should be here soon. Meanwhile, why don\u2019t you try one of these health bars\u2026The sponsors guaranteed that they\u2019re the best. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano gladly took the oversized chocolate bar from James and quickly unwrapped it, as he kept muncing on the donuts that the attendant fed him. He looked at the bar for a few second, apparently without noticing how big it was, and as soon as he had swallowed his morsel, he gave a big bite to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh\u2026*gulp*\u2026Damn, Coach! Theshe are good! Tashtiest health bars I\u2019ve ever had\u2026Strange though\u2026I\u2019m starting to getting hungrier\u2026Who cares. They\u2019re health bars, so they\u2019ve got to be good for you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExactly so, Cristiano. Eat as much of them as you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano began to take bites out of the chocolate bars, but still he kept having mouthful of donuts as well, munching on both the soft texture of the donuts and the delicious flavour of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed, his stomach seemed to bloat out faster than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yes, Cristiano. Eat as many as you want. There are enough calories in there to equal a normal meal, and the hunger stimulants that they contain will give you the extra boost you need to grow in the meal I need you to become.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment the doorbell ringed, as the waitresses entered the room with the oversized lunch, easily three times as much food as Cristiano had ever previously had. Yet, the player didn\u2019t seem to find anything wrong in it, as he felt starving, and so literally dived into the food like a beast, beginning to clean each plate they had brought to him. There was only one last dessert to clean out and he would have finished everything, but he didn\u2019t feel up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026*urp*\u2026I think I ate too much\u2026Can\u2019t keep on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames though had other ideas. He wanted to speed up the process and needed to have Cristiano as fat and lazy as possible at the end of that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Cristiano? Why don\u2019t you have just one more Health bar? Just to, cleanse the pallet, as they say?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Coach\u2026I don\u2019t think I can fit anything else in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish the sentence, as James had given one of the bars to the girl seated beside the player, she broke a large piece of it and pushed it in the player mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat up, Sir. It\u2019s good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano could only swallow but, as he did so and tried to say something, another piece of that chocolate bar was pushed between his lips. As he munched on it he began to feel his belly rumbling for more. Confused he looked at the bloated belly he was sporting toward and at the last dessert that still was under his nose. Burping with satisfaction he quickly motioned to the two girls to keep feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were\u2026right Coach\u2026Must be\u2026hungrier than I thought. Maybe I truly was\u2026malnourished\u2026to begin with. Keep going girls\u2026give me\u2026some more...bars and donuts. I need\u2026to grow healthier\u2026isn\u2019t it right, Coach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you but\u2026Yes Cristiano, I think you are way too thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026*urp*\u2026We will change that\u2026won\u2019t we Coach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can bet on it. Just follow the plan and you\u2019ll be in your top form again in no time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano smiled at that as he kept eating, deaf to the rumbling of his overworked belly, as it began to bloat out to a gut with a thick layer of fat on it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

IF he had to give an estimate, he would have said that Cristiano now was edging in the two hundred pounds range, more or less. Still, James had to be sure that once returned to the training facility Cristiano kept on with his lazy lifestyle. <br>\r\nTo verify that he had already concocted a devious plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had checked the local soccer simulator and had verified that it was just what Cristiano needed in his life. Within the simulator, the player would feel just as if he was on the football field, but without the discomfort of having to move around and all that. If he could make Cristiano addicted to that machine, he could then just purchase it for the soccer player when they were back home and so he could keep on fattening him up while maintain the pretense that the player was still training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. James had only to convince the now lazy Cristiano to leave the room in which they had arrived a dozens of days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? Cristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player was on the bed, staring transfixed at the screen of the TV as the two attendants kept on feeding him, one giving him those health bars, the other stuffing him full of pastries and chocolates. He munched on, as if unaware of what was happening around him. And, James knew, it probably was so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had started to call them \u2018Cristiano\u2019s Eating Trances\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a certain point the soccer player just zoned out and kept on eating whatever it was offered to him, without making any fuss or any complaint, even if his belly was stuffed full of food already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, James had work to do and so, shushing the girls away he moved closer. He still couldn\u2019t believe how big Cristiano was getting. His whole body had started to round up, growing a thick layer of fat everywhere. Even his arms had begun to form some small bingo wings, as a double chin was forming under his face. His belly then, pooching down over the shorts he was wearing, starting the slow descent toward his crotch, while at the side his muffin top grew larger and larger. And how could he forget about his moobs? For sure he was going to need to wear a brain order to contain them if he ever had needed to run back on the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he could run for long, no sir. Not with chunky legs he had developed.<br>\r\nOverall, he had fattened up quite well, but James had to make sure that he kept on fattening up and so had to wake him up from his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? Cristiano!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh? Wha\u2019? Oh. It\u2019s you, Coach? What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano, do you want to come with me to chek that soccer simulator we spoke about?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMm..I don\u2019t know, Coach\u2026I just don\u2019t feel it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is true but, don\u2019t forget that you still need to have some activity throughout the day. This simulator seems the right answer to our problem. Think about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as of now you cannot play on the field due to this illness that you have right? But, if you don\u2019t practise at all you\u2019ll end up ruining you\u2019re A-game. With the simulator instead\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Oh! I see. Man, that\u2019s\u2026why you\u2019re\u2026the Coach. With that\u2026thing, I can practice\u2026but without\u2026 exerting myself\u2026and so I don\u2019t\u2026risk any collateral effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s cool! Alright, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, as Cristiano tried to rise from the bed he didn\u2019t manage it on his own. His muscles had slightly atrophied and so he stared confusedly around him as he tried to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano, Don\u2019t worry\u2026that\u2019s just the illness that has to be manifesting with its first symptoms. Here, I\u2019ll help you stand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long trek, during which Cristiano still managed to drown several slushies and even some of his health bars, they finally reached the arcade room and soon, in front of them there was the soccer simulator. It was a large sphere of metal sheets, inside which there was a comfortable looking chair, an helmet with some tubes coming in and out of it, some gloves for the virtual reality immersion and some more gadgets. Quickly, James had Cristiano seated in there, wearing the helmet and the gloves. As a final addition, he placed one of the tubed mask that were linked to the cabin, onto his mouth and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re all set to go. The gloves and the helmet will provide you with the audio, vision and touch senses. The mask, obviously, will provide coverage for the last two senses. This way, you\u2019ll fell just as if you\u2019re on the field. <br>\r\nReady? Go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James started the simulator, Cristiano found himself plunged into a soccer field, with his old body as he began sprinting and playing, running around as he played a mock game with his AI controlled teammate and adversaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, instead, James and the two girls could admire Cristiano as he seated comfortably and, at his every movement, how his body fat jiggled this way and that. It was a magnificent show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls? Have you brought what I\u2019ve asked you to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two attendants smiled widely as she showed a small trolley filled with large water flasks full of a brown liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. We melted as many of those \u2018health bars\u2019 as we could and filled them in these bottles. Can we proceed?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, be my guest. Pour it all in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James kept on watching, the girls began to pour the melted chocolate bars into a nozzle on the side of the simulator, as a meter began to rise showing how much liquid was stored inside the machine. At the same time, the brown colored sludge began to travel inside the tubing of the simulator until it reached the mask attached on Cristiano face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stared gleefully as Cristiano began to swallow the heavy caloric, appetite stimulant sludge without any fuss as he kept on playing at the simulator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Cristiano. Enjoy the game\u2026Soon, that will be you only way to be in a soccer field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, an overstuffed and bloated Cristiano shut off the machine and barely managed to stand from it, as James and the girls quickly gathered around him to help him stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Cristiano, how it was?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026Oh, Coach,\u2026that is\u2026awesome! I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t stop\u2026 your idea was\u2026the best. I really\u2026need to\u2026have one of these\u2026back home.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll call the Company and will make it happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks man. God, I feel as if I run for hundreds of miles\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Cristiano. You did. It was a simulation but you still ran that long.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Gotta be right\u2026So hungry though\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames grinned as sent the tired ex-soccer player to return to his room helped by the two girls, as he moved toward one of the help desks of the resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Cristiano. Since your exercise was so harsh, I\u2019ll ask them to send something more tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Coach\u2026so\u2026So Hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James saw the three move away, he could clearly see the two girls began feeding Cristiano with the remaining bottles of chocolate sludge, and he drank them all without any care in the world. He, instead approached the young man and began his order for Cristiano\u2019s meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi. I\u2019m Coach Podrick. Can I order? Wonderful.<br>\r\nLet\u2019s see\u2026for tonight dinner, is your Humongous Combo Meal the one with the breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert feast, all in one? Good. Send two of them to our room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom tomorrow, instead, you can easily triple the current normal order for all of his daily meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that would be all. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, Cristiano, I\u2019ll make you huge.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn those last two days at the resort, Cristiano seemed to blow up with fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was, almost, always hungry he ate without any break. And as he also spent as much time as he could on the simulator, he felt like he was really exercising and so didn\u2019t find anything strange in the fact that his meals had gotten suddenly huge. Another factor was that since he had accepted the idea of being ill and of having been malnourished up to that moment, he stopped questioning his physical changes. <br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t see them but, more that all those around him told him there weren\u2019t. So he decided that it had to be his mind playing tricks with him, as it was supported from his Coach, who had always been at his side.<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t be lying, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the final day rolled to a closure, since the following morning the two of them had to return home, Cristiano decided that a celebratory feast was in order and so asked James to order as much food as possible. Very soon, countless trolleys of food entered the room, filling every nook and cranny with food as an oversize Ronald kept on laying on his king sized bed, almost filling  a good three quarters of it all by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was still beside him, admiring his masterpiece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow  Cristiano\u2019s gut now was divided in two large rolls that covered up to his crotch. Or his now very definite triple chin, as it cascaded down on his neck, or his pendulous moobs, so large and puffy that were really gonna need a bra to be kept in check. And what about his ass. What a masterful piece of art. Those two huge, flabby, jiggly mass of ass cheeks Cristiano now had as a rear. James could have sworn that he could have used that ass as a desk for his laptop if so he had wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Cristiano had transformed hugely in those two weeks but, better yet, he now was ready to be brought to the next level. He was now enough of a lazy glutton to be able to keep on getting fat until he got immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all that mattered was to bring him home and manage to let him stay still on the team roster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut James already had various aces in his sleeves\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As James and Cristiano moved from the resort, there were some snags bound to happen. Naturally, James tried his best to play in advance and he could compliment himself for a job well done. Foreseeing mobility\u2019s issues with Cristiano, he had enlisted the help of the two resort attendants as if they were personal nurses. And they proved their value as they assisted the overfed soccer player in moving around, boarding the private jet and kept him always stuffed to the brim during the entire duration of the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother issue arose as soon as they arrived at their destination. As much as they tried to move in secrecy, some journalist had heard the scoop and tried to take a few shots at them. Luckily, James had already hired a decoy, using an actor to imitate Cristiano, thus managing to land the real deal in anonymity.<br>\r\nFinally, as soon as they were in the training center, the last problems already were taken care of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had thought that the other team members might victimize Cristiano, if they were to see him, so it was released the news that he was ill and had to follow a harsh regimen of rehabilitation, before being able to join them all on the field. This way, the renovations done to Cristiano\u2019s room were also justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick smiled as he and his entourage entered the new rooms of Cristiano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed had been reinforced and enlarged, and a huge television had been added right in front of it with as many channels as possible. The Soccer Simulator also had been installed and upgraded as per James specifications. With a maximum weight tolerance of five tons, it had to be sturdy enough for Cristiano. In addition, just to be sure that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 didn\u2019t ever leave his room, a Chef, personally chosen by James, had been hired. So that the guy could be fattened up without any issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to be right on par with James plans for Cristiano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy himself didn\u2019t seem to take too much notice in all of the changes, he simply waddled slowly toward the bed, helped by the two girls at his side and, as soon as was there, he relaxed on top of it, huffing and puffing as he had overexerted himself in just walking around for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026Gotta recover\u2026 soon, from this\u2026illness.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cristiano. I\u2019m sure you will. Now, since it\u2019s almost time, I think we could have an earlier breakfast, but before that don\u2019t forget about your health bars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano, at the mention of food, began to feel a low rumbling from his large gut, as hunger began to manifest itself within him. Yet, even though breakfast was going to arrive soon, he still began to motion to his girls to start giving him a little snack. Both girls, quickly moving on both side of him, began giving him food, alternating between his health bars and brownies. Cristiano ate both moaning in pleasure, as he felt his belly grumble more and more noisily as the hunger stimulants began to have their effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes later that the Chef began to bring forward the breakfast platters to Cristiano, which helped himself from those huge platters without realizing how big they were. As he seated on the bed, he moved closer the mobile tray with the first platter, easily covering his own width with its size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn it he saw that there were almost a dozen peppered egg whites, with a side of thick and heavy fried bacon slices, along with some huge fried sausages, easily the size of a small coke bottle. As He began to ate the meal, the chef, brought forward another platter, placed on a mobile trolley, leaving a second tray chocked full of massive hot dogs, heavily loaded with sauces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano simply grunted in acknowledgment, as he began grabbing some of those hot dogs, using them as bread to collect the eggs from his first platter. Useless to say that he soon began to cover his face in grease and other sauces, as the residuals of his meal began to accumulate on his cheeks and on his triple chins. The attendants though were there to clean him up and to push more and more of his health bars, within his mouth whenever they could. Therefore, the overfed player kept on eating, feeling his hunger grow to higher levels at all the times. As he cleaned the first two platters, he began to slightly rub his swollen, bloated gut, burping away freely to ease some more space in there. Still the Chef kept coming, bringing him more to consume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he placed a vast bowl as close to him as possible, this salad bowl was chocked full of fried chicken pieces, along with even more fried bacon strips. Then he left on a nearby trolley another tray, this time they were burgers, huge five decker burgers, and each patty at the very least two hundred grams of pure pork meat. These were left beside him, as a small pool of grease and oil began to exude of them in the same plate. Yet Cristiano began to scoop them up, taking vast mouthful out of them, enjoying the rich flavor, feeling the grease and oil flow down his chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stood still, enjoying the view. Here he was, watching one of the most proficient soccer player in the world eat himself toward true obesity. Even now, as he imagined him at being almost at three hundred pounds, he still wasn\u2019t content. Cristiano had to grow more before being considered acceptable to become his meal. Yet, he also had to maintain a modicum of pretense in order to appease to what little resistance the player could still bring on.<br>\r\nAs the Chef brought forward more tray, each of these loaded with desserts, James moved closer to his pupil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Cristiano, enjoy your breakfast but after a well needed nap, remember that you\u2019ve gotta practice some more in the simulator, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player just grunted his agreement to that request, as he dived face first in the large assortment of cakes that they had brought to him. As he did so, his belly continued to bloat out more and more, growing more stuffed at each morsel he ate, and yet he kept on eating, careless of what damages he was inflicting upon his figure.  When he finally had cleared all dishes, Cristiano was already feeling drowsy. All the food, stuffed in his bloated gut, was already being digested and so he simply fell asleep as the pounds already seemed to appear on his growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, the girls woke him up softly and, as they helped him stand, they brought him forward toward the simulator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Coach?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Cristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI do\u2026want to\u2026practice but\u2026I\u2019m getting\u2026hungry again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019ll ask the Chef to whip up something for you as a mid-morning snack. Now go work out a bit in the simulator.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, Coach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days began to pass by, a sort of schedule began to take form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would feed a large pre-breakfast to Cristiano, right as the sun emerged at the horizon, only to let him sleep on it for a couple of hours, waking him up just in time for a hearty breakfast, which would keep him occupied for almost an hour. Then he would nap a bit more and then practice in the simulator, as more desserts and his health bars sludge was fed to him through the machine, right until lunch time. It was then that the Chef would go all out on Cristiano, feeding him a whole seven-course meal, letting him have as many seconds he wished for, keeping him there for at least three hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was going to be once more naptime for the over engorged player, until was time for another snack, and right after that some more practice in the simulator. Along with its complementary sludge feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs practice finished, Cristiano would be so hungry that James knew he could keep him eating right up until dinnertime and beyond.  Then, right before midnight, after a small nap, they would wake him up once more to fed him an all dessert meal, keeping him eating for as long as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was going to be a new day and the cycle would start all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the schedule, James also reinforced in Cristiano\u2019s mind the idea that for all his practice with the simulator, he was spending precious energies and so had to eat always more than the day before. Cristiano, soon, convinced himself of this and, even when not exercising, he would always request more and more food, thus eating and stretching his stomach every day more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames kept watching from the sidelines, as he began to detach from the now obese player, as he kept on growing fatter and larger, enjoying how big Cristiano was getting, In just a few days, Cristiano seemed to have grown of at least another hundred pounds, bringing him to a very obese four hundred pounds\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cristiano Ronaldo woke up with a yawn, his sleep interrupted by a growling sound he had become accustomed to hearing. As he woke up, he slowly began the arduous task of placing himself against the bed stand. It never dawned on him that it shouldn\u2019t have been such a hard task to perform. Still, by pushing with all his might (for what strength he still had), he managed to place his back vertically, reaching a seated position on the bed. Yet, he was now left tired and covered in sweat, as he wasn\u2019t used anymore to exert any kind of exercise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as tired and hungry he was, help was right beside him as one of the two \u2018personal nurses\u2019 was right beside him, with a large platter filled with donuts and pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Sir, here have some of your pre-breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano didn\u2019t even reply, he simply opened his mouth and began eating away at whatever he was receiving. The nurse, Nastassja, was enjoying the presence of the fattened-up player. She had accepted that job because she knew that he had the potential of becoming one of the biggest. She had enjoyed working in the Resort, the possibility to be around feeders and feedees, to be there watching them grow and be stuffed was something she loved but, they always left after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when Coach Podrick had asked her and her colleague to join him she accepted at the condition of being able to stay at Cristiano\u2019s side forever. Nastassja was brought back from her reverie when she heard a pitiful whining just beside her, looking down she realized that Cristiano had already cleared out the platter and was whimpering from hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, Sir, it isn\u2019t over yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply placed the empty platter on the floor and quickly took a second one from a nearby trolley, starting once again to push more food into Cristiano, as he began to fall into his eating trance once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames watched from afar, through one of many hidden cameras he had placed in the room. He spied on Cristiano, watching as he kept on eating and growing fatter. It had been already a week since they returned from the Resort, and yet the player had never said anything against the deluge of goodies that everyone around him kept pushing on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled wickedly at the thought that soon the player was going to be shamed publicly and, as soon as he was going to be left alone, He could swoop him up and do with him as he pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick licked his lips as he imagined the massively obese Cristiano slowly roasting in a pan, prepared just as if he was a Thanksgiving turkey. Yet, the obese soccer player could still grow more and so he brought those thoughts back into the deepest part of his mind. As he resumed watching Cristiano standing up and preparing himself for the, almost only, exercise he kept on doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Standing, while kept upright with the help of the two nurses, Cristiano looked even bigger than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face had softened to the point that his cheeks seemed to be stuffed with small balls, his three chins were almost constantly jiggling, as a fourth one began to make its appearance. His moobs, huge globular sack of fat, fell blobbily on his chest, slowly moving to either side of him, pushed away by his ever-growing gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a belly it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDivided in three belly rolls, it truly was an apron of a gut, covering his man part and, lately, starting to reach for his knees. His belly button was deep and wide, it could almost suck two fingers within itself. His hips had also grown wider, other than fatter, forcing him to waddle slowly to avoid, as much as possible, to chafing his thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Cristiano had truly reached a new level of obesity and Podrick saw confirmation in this when he checked the scale hidden inside the bed through the laptop he was using within his private room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u20186-8-4 \u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix hundred eighty-four pounds of ex soccer player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt his head spinning as he read that three-digit number. Cristiano, world known soccer player had grown past six hundred pounds of fat in one month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, James had had to use chemicals and stimulants to push him further and further but, still\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, the guy didn\u2019t seem to notice. Well, also that wasn\u2019t true. Cristiano had tried to fight back but, thanks to his ill placed faith in him and the constant onslaught of food, any thoughts of going back had simply disappeared. And thus, the New Cristiano had been created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn always hungry eating machine, which passed more than twenty hours, each day, stuffing his mouth even though he wasn\u2019t aware of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n James decided to close his laptop and join the nurses into Cristiano\u2019s room as he saw that the player was going to enter the simulation to start his exercise session for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Podrick entered the room he was greeted with the magnificent sight of Cristiano as he tried to place his titanic ass on the small-ish seat of the simulator. As the player realized that his coach was there, he tried to turn toward him, while still being hand-fed by his nurses, only to find himself stuck inside the simulator cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Cristiano, already up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesh Coach *ulp*! I wanted\u2026to practish\u2026shome more\u2026before going\u2026to breakfast\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good but, don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re still on rest, so don\u2019t push yourself too much. If you don\u2019t feel up to it, just let it go for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026really\u2026think\u2026so\u2026Coach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Cristiano. It never pays to over-exert yourself. You might end up hurting yourself even worse.<br>\r\nC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go back to bed. Take a break for today and tomorrow you will practice some more. Rest up and load up on energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano burped quite loudly as his body continued to process and digest the massive amount of food it already contained, trying to make room for what more was coming.  And yet he smiled at the thought of taking it easy with his practice sessions. He always felt tired and utterly spent of energies after his practice on the simulator, but he couldn\u2019t realize that in truth it was his own body that was making him so tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his atrophied muscles, and all that fat on his body, it was already a miracle he could still waddle, albeit slowly, but for James it wasn\u2019t enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano had to become an immobile blob of a man before becoming his meal. And yet, the thought of seeing a barely mobile Cristiano, wearing his way too small soccer suit as he moved slowly on a soccer field, under the silent stare of thousands, made James shiver in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was that the correct course of action? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Cristiano was still able to move, he still could be saved. While if he was to be fattened up to immobility, the chances of him recovering were very slim. But to lose the chance to utterly humiliate him and disgrace him in front of thousands of witnesses was very alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a Cannibal Coach to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following day, as Cristiano was waking up and beginning his daily activities, he saw his coach enter the room with a huge smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo\u2026Coach\u2026what\u2019s\u2026the good\u2026news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames simply smiled even more as he quickly ordered the two nurses around to help Cristiano stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Cristiano. I just got news from our sponsors that you\u2019ve been selected to try a new kind of fitness therapy. Thanks to this therapy, so they say, your recovery should speed up way faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrsitiano smiled weakly at the news, only the mentioning of any kind of physical activity was unconsciously treated as a bad news from the overfed soccer player. Still, for his coach to be this excited it had to be something so, he simply nodded and, helped by his nurses, he slowly followed Podrick toward the bathroom in his room. Once there, he saw that the jacuzzi pool wasn\u2019t actually filled with water, but with some yellowish liquid which, in truth, caused his own belly to rumble hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026is...that...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, Cristiano, is melted butter. Apparently, it should help relax and reinvigorate your body. As per the new therapy that you\u2019ve got to follow, you\u2019ll have to have at the very least two immersions each day. Don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m sure you will love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano didn\u2019t seem as excited as James was but, with nothing to lose he moved his body toward the pool and slowly entered it, until only his head was breaking the surface. As a few minutes passed by, he began to feel nice in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe melted butter was kinda greasy but, its warmth was doing wonder to help relax the ex-soccer player. As he sat in the pool he didn\u2019t seem to realize that he alone was almost occupying the entire pool and, before he could muster any thoughts, his nurses came to him carrying with them a funnel, some small kegs of beer and several trolley\u2019s worth of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Sir, as your Coach instructed, we will proceed with the new therapy plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per instruction received, as you dip and relax, we will provide you with booze and food, the first will help you reach a deeper sense of calm, the second will be part of your new diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cristiano could say anything the two nurses had placed a tube into his mouth and, through the funnel, they began pouring liters of beer inside of the obese soccer player. He, from his side, couldn\u2019t do much but sit back, relax and swallow, and so he did. After a while though, Cristiano felt the tube between his lips being taken away, as his two nurses moved closer, bringing him the food for his new diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rubbed his blubbery gut with slow circular movements, starting to enjoy the feeling of all that butter surrounding him, he saw that the first platter they brought to his lips was a huge triple decker burger, with lots of sauce and fried bacon. That burger was so greasy that already a small pool of it was starting to accumulate on the platter but, for Cristiano nothing mattered but to have that within himself in the shortest time possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor almost two hours the nurses continued to feed Cristiano with greasy food and beer, until they noticed that the level of melted butter in the pool had drastically reduced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the two helped Cristiano get out of the jacuzzi and, still dripping buttery goodness, they brough him toward a large massage bed nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Sir. Please to lie down here so that we can provide you with a nice massage. Afterward, we will move to your bed so you can rest a bit before having your daily exercise regimen into the simulator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, absentmindedly licking his own fingers, simply did as he was asked and soon found himself in a new kind of paradise. As he lay on the bed, one of his two nurses massaged him slowly but forcefully, kneading every inch of his fattened body, while the other brought to him even more snacks and food for him to consume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat up, Sir, you need to load up all the energies you can muster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano felt in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween his still sensitive skin being massaged and the delicious sweets that he was eating he honestly felt at his best. Still, for one moment, he began to wonder why he was eating so much but, it was nothing but a fleeting thought, soon swept away by the avalanche of delicious goods passing within his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, feeling full to bursting, Cristiano was slowly moved from the bathroom toward his room and, in the fifteen minutes he needed to change room, he began to feel himself grow hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind that he had eaten all morning, he just felt his stomach rumble hungrily, demanding sustenance. Food had become his staple and the absence of it something that his body feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nurses smiled between themselves and, without even asking, they began once more to push more and more goodies into Cristiano\u2019s mouth. He greedily accepted everything that was given him, it didn\u2019t matter anymore about his \u2018illness\u2019 nor the thought of his needing to load up energies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate because there was food within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as James realized that Cristiano was stopping to care about his surrounding a wicked smile twisted his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Between the new Therapy and the constant feeding, if I can get to have Cristiano forget about anything but eating, then he will be one step closer to being ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost seems a shame to be so close to my objective but, I\u2019m also excited to know how tasty he will be as soon as he reach the ton mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t take long at this rate\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day, Cristiano began to have his therapy baths two times each day, along with the beer drinking, food stuffing and body massage. As good as he was feeling he simply stopped caring about everything else, all that mattered was to reach that heavenly feeling and to have his gut full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from that, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick closely followed Cristiano as he plunged deeper and deeper into the gluttony abyss, as he forced him to have each meal bigger and more fattening than the last. Between those and the buttery baths, Cristiano seemed to balloon even faster, adding to his body another two hundred pounds in less than a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one fateful morning, almost two months since meeting with Podrick,\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two more months had passed, and Cristiano had done nothing more than eat and sleep, while taking the occasional butter bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick couldn\u2019t have been prouder of how big and fat the once soccer player had become. The guy was now almost completely immobile, he could barely stand, and only with someone\u2019s help. The once soccer player was already beginning to lose his own human shape, growing more and more like a small blubbery mountain. His arms had grown so large that were roughly the size of another person thighs, and his legs were even bigger. His whole body was beginning to overtake all his legs, when seated, leaving out of this belly apron his blown-out feet\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seemed to be capable of ruining the momentum that Cristiano had reached but, alas, something did happen. On a fateful morning Cristiano had just finished having his buttery bath, and was now enjoying the feeding/massage session with his girls when, out of nowhere, as James passed in front of him, the hugely obese player blurted out something that made James feel a cold chill behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Coach\u2026was\u2026wondering. Can...I meet\u2026my girl\u2026one of\u2026these days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, unable to give a proper answer right back, took time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t give a clear answer and was glad when the nurses started again to feed Cristiano, shutting him up for the moment. Still here was an issue as big as a house\u2026better yet, as big as Cristiano! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from the Company, the rest of the world knew that Cristiano Ronaldo was in a sort of break, nobody knew what had really befallen him but, how could James prevent Georgina Rodriguez to reveal the truth to the world? He had only one possibility.  <br>\r\nCristiano was going to meet his girl\u2026but she wasn\u2019t going to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had thought long and hard on this and finally, as he was surfing the net, an idea came to his mind. What if Cristiano could meet someone that seemed to be the exact copy of his fianc\u00e9e, but wasn\u2019t really her? There were risks, no doubt about that but, there didn\u2019t seem to be much of a choice. Quickly James began to contact people from the shady part of the deep web, handsomely paying in advance for a certain product that would allow him to play the role of a certain someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he paid quite a hefty sum to have the product finished in the shortest time, a month still had to pass before the product was finally within his hands. As James observed the item he had just received, a wicked grin appeared on his face. With this he could take two doves with one stone. It was an oversized VR device and, along with it, came a nice little DVD package containing the installer for the custom-made software requested by Podrick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter toying a bit with both the VR and the software, James felt confident enough to bring the good news to his soon-to-be overfed meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James entered the room, he clearly saw that Cristiano was starting to grow restless. Although being constantly fed with a deluge of treats and sweets, there was animosity on his swollen face. James could see the anger growing within the ex-player as he munched harshly on whatever bit of food he had in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Urrff!* Yeah\u2026Coach? What do\u2026you want\u2026now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wanted to thank you for your patience. I may have figured out a way for you to meet with your girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the ultra-obese began to distend himself, letting go of the anger he was nurturing within himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u2026Coach? But\u2026you said\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was James turn to make everything believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said that you couldn\u2019t meet her in here, since nobody has to know about your condition. In fact the Company would react harshly if I was to ask for something as foolish as to invite someone in here, when everything is done in secrecy to keep you hidden. <br>\r\nBut, with time and a little bit of\u2026ehm\u2026grease in the right places\u2026 I may have found a solution to this problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano began to jiggle in excitement, although he managed to move for barely a minute before stopping, feeling himself tired and void of any energies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026Feel\u2026there is\u2026a but\u2026somewhere\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, Cristiano, there is one. You shall not be able to meet her in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, through some friends I may have smuggled something from outside to here and to your fianc\u00e9e house. Something that will enable the two of you to be in contact, even though only visually, with one another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that James showed to Cristiano the VR device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis, Cristiano, is a last generation full immersion headset. With it, one can go and meet someone in a previously prepared setting. Basically, while in a room like this one you could\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could\u2026finally meet\u2026Georgina!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! As I\u2019ve said, though, it would still be a connection through internet but, thanks to this headset, you\u2019ll be able to experience almost any sensation while using it. Sense of smell, of taste\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026is so\u2026Cool! Thanks\u2026Man! It\u2019s a\u2026shame\u2026I cannot\u2026meet her\u2026 face to face\u2026. but\u2026How\u2026Can I\u2026repay you\u2026for all\u2026these\u2026troubles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour happiness and confidence in me are all the gifts I may ever want. Trust in me, Cristiano.<br>\r\nIf you\u2019ve got a problem\u2026I will find a solution.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames brought the device to Cristiano, helping him to wear it as he explained to him how to make it work and letting him know that his girlfriend had been already instructed on how to use it. All Cristiano had to do was to call and wait for her response. Ronaldo smiled as he grabbed the strange looking helmet and put it on, but his smile grew wider when he turned the machine on and found himself in this 3D recreation of the same room he was in. Although he couldn\u2019t see his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in front of him he realized that a form was beginning to appear, grinning excitedly he slowly saw the form of his fianc\u00e9e appear right before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Georgina? Is it really you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled as she watched him, bringing a finger to her lips, as she bit slowly her nail while smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure am, Baby. I was getting worried about you. But then this Podrick guy contacted me and\u2026Wow! We\u2019re finally together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl said so she launched herself at Cristiano, which in turn hugged her back and felt her body against his own, felt her perfume in his nostrils. She was there, with him! True, they weren\u2019t physically there but, feeling as he was in that moment, he couldn\u2019t care less about reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Georgina\u2026I\u2019ve missed you so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Cristiano jiggled to and fro on his bed, carefully watched by his two nurses, James was sitting comfortably in his own private room, as he checked and clicked on his personal computer. On the screen he could see the avatar of Cristiano and, at the bottom of the screen, whatever he was saying at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes\u2026This has been a marvelous idea. Not only that fool thinks to really be with his girlfriend, but I could even use Georgina\u2019s to push him even more into the abyss of gluttony! All I must do is to keep using this Georgina model to trick Cristiano and soon I could have him do whatever I wish\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, I could even force him to\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanks to his sessions with the VR headset, he managed to explain to the fake Georgina all of his troubles and of his apparent illness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction he got from her left him speechless at first but, as she insisted on it, he quickly adapted to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you see, Georgie, due to this strange illness I\u2019m forced to stay away from the field and, since they don\u2019t know yet when I can be considered stable\u2026Management has decided to keep things silent and as more quiet possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, Baby\u2026But are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Apart from feeling tired all the time I\u2019m good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, I know my man doesn\u2019t like being ordered around but, this time, do it for me\u2026Do as they tell you. If they want to keep things quiet it must be that they\u2019re afraid of something so, don\u2019t go against them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t, Georgie\u2026for you, anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano sat on the verge of the illusionary bed, in the holographic room he was in, while keeping within his arms his fianc\u00e9e, completely unaware that the person he was talking to was, in truth, James Podrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, babe, I must say that you\u2019re looking terrific. Whatever they\u2019re doing to you is making wonders on your body\u2026I wonder what would happen if you asked to intensify your treatment\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano began to feel excited, it wasn\u2019t often that Georgina came onto him like that so he quickly nodded to her proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u201d he stammered a little \u201cI\u2019ll see what can be done but, are you sure about that, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, love. Whatever it is, you seem to be way more buff than you ever were\u2026If things keep going this way I\u2019ll have trouble not to think about you\u2026all day long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cristiano finally ended his session on the VR he felt hot and bothered, he would have loved to be able to stay with Georgina in real life but, he knew, that it wasn\u2019t yet possible. Still, thanks to his wonderful coach he at least, could see her occasionally and that was good enough. As he placed the visor on the bed, he soon found himself once more to what his life had become. Him eating as girls at his side fawned around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he kept on eating, he tried to look at himself and, although he couldn\u2019t see much, he seemed to convince himself that what Georgina had told of him had to be true. He truly seemed to have been growing bigger (and in his deluded mind buffer) than before. And yet, the proposition of his fianc\u00e9e had taken root in his mind and when he saw Podrick coming to see him he broached the subject to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Coach\u2026 Was\u2026wondering,\u2026 the\u2026therapy\u2026and\u2026all\u2026seem\u2026 to\u2026 be \u2026 going\u2026great, but\u2026maybe\u2026we\u2026could\u2026enhance\u2026 it\u2026a \u2026bit\u2026more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Podrick, who had just entered the room, had been waiting for that request for a long time. It had been two long weeks of him impersonating Georgina until he managed to convince Cristiano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, he had managed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, he had to maintain his image and so he adopted for a dubious glance toward the massive man, almost completely paralyzed on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnhance it? Mmm\u2026I don\u2019t know, Cristiano. I don\u2019t make the rules here. <br>\r\nI just bring you what the Management has agreed upon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026yet\u2026if\u2026I\u2026was\u2026to\u2026increase\u2026the\u2026pace\u2026wouldn\u2019t\u2026I\u2026 heal\u2026faster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s true. But are you sure about that Cristiano? If we increase the pace, you will have less time to spend with\u2026 you know who.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026I\u2026know\u2026that. Still\u2026I\u2026guess\u2026could\u2026be\u2026better\u2026for\u2026me\u2026and\u2026my\u2026career. Please\u2026Coach\u2026I\u2026feel\u2026I\u2019ve\u2026gotta\u2026do\u2026all\u2026I\u2026can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll ask for them to produce an enhanced plan for your recovery. I\u2019ll let you know by tomorrow morning what they decided to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following days James gleefully watched as Cristiano went under a drastic change in his daily schedule. <br>\r\nHis rest times were cut by half and substituted with intensified feeding sessions of the \u201chealth bars\u201d sludge he was growing addicted to. Moreover, it was included into his mealtimes a special feeding session in which he was instructed to consume a double lunch meal in a liquefied format. This not only meant that he could ingest more calories than usual, but also that his overfed, apron like, belly would absorb the nutrients at a faster pace than before, forcing him to feel his hunger grow again sooner than before. The liquid diet, also, had the exceptional advantage that didn\u2019t seem to tire him out, since he had only to swallow without any chewing from his part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a week passed with the enhanced diet and Cristiano already began to grow steadily fatter from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf before he had seemed to slow down in his gains, with the new regimen he pushed himself out of the plateau and began to grow bigger and larger once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames could barely restrain himself watching the ex-soccer player inflate with food and fat, as more time passed, it was getting harder and harder for him to not show his own desire to prepare Cristiano as his own meal. Often he found himself caressing the bloated and/or stuffed form of the player, massaging his belly rolls and playing with his belly fat as he imagined him ready to be placed in a roasting pan. Other times he found himself all over the guy as he was passed out from his eating, hugging as much as he could of the man body wishing only to sink in his fat and sleep there. Yet, everytime it happened he managed to recover himself before Cristiano could notice him doing and so, without arousing any suspicion. Yet, it was becoming increasingly hard to just watch the fattening of the soccer player without any of his participation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano, instead, was pushing himself more and more to increase his own mass, still delusional about what effect that diet was really having on his body. No matter how hard he found it, he constantly pushed himself to consume always more than the day before. In his mind were engraved the words of his fianc\u00e9e, which wanted him to grow bigger and stronger than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this objective in his mind it wasn\u2019t long before he\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the beginning James had done all he could to maximize the soccer player laziness and gluttony and he finally had managed it. The problem now was to try and keep Cristiano satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a problem he hadn\u2019t imagined before, and yet, between the liquid meals and the constant assistance from the two girls, everything seemed to be feasible. Cristiano itself had started growing once more, growing bigger than ever, even losing his normal humanoid shape in the process. The ex-player in fact had begun growing so fast that his body couldn\u2019t really keep up. Apart from his head, which had also softened, the rest of his body seemed to be growing fatter every minute, giving him a blobby and flabby appearance. Already his head had begun drowning in a sea of flabby chins, as his body grew wider and larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis moobs, for example, had grown hugely, spread apart on to each side of him they touched the ground near his bed, with aureole\u2019s as big as platters. His belly then cascaded down onto him, covering almost all his body, with only his swollen feet emerging barely from under it. That tent like gut also stood proud and high, divided in four large belly rolls, since it was becoming difficult to have it filled up. Finally, his hips and ass, there the gain had also been astonishing, giving to the ultra-obese player cheeks so much filled with fat that any kind of movement sent them into a jiggling frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew it was almost time to finish it with Cristiano and yet, he postponed it, thinking that maybe he could grow some more before reaching his final size. What he didn\u2019t know was that all this delay was going to present him, soon, with a difficult choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days later, as James was busy impersonating Georgina and fawning over the still over-confident Cristiano through the VR internet connection, the door to Cristiano\u2019s room opened as someone entered slowly, as to not disturb the ill player. This person, though his intentions had been all in the right places, didn\u2019t realize of the dangers he was exposing himself to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as he stepped inside, he initially saw only a couple of hot girls dressed as maids, a strange looking machine in the middle of the room and a rather large bed completely covered in a huge mass of some kind of gelatinous brown-ish thing. Perplexed, the person turned around and verifying that he was indeed in the right room, he realized with a start, that there was a large hose connected into the jelly-like mass, pumping who knows what inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, after a few seconds, he also realized that the hose wasn\u2019t only pumping that thing up\u2026it was also that thig that was gulping down whatever substance the hose was bringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis realization forced his troubled mind to really see what he was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brownish mass, so jiggly and flabby, was in truth a human being. Someone so hugely fattened that had completely lost any resemblance to a normal human shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since he was in the room of the soccer player under the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the one who had fell ill long time before, it was rather quickly that he realized who that human being was, even though it was unrecognizable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cristiano\u2026!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the person shouted that name, Podrick was forced to close the connection hastily with Ronaldo, hastily making up some excuses with his Georgina character, and hurried through his bedroom door to the main room where Cristiano was, realizing that someone had just entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw the guy he didn\u2019t recognized him immediately, James had bigger problems than that. He had now to figure out a way to keep the intruder mouth shut, while keeping the news of the fat Cristiano from being spread around. In truth there were a few methods to do that, and hastily he acted toward them as he approached the guy from behind and knocked him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the intruder fell to the floor unconscious, James had finally time to see who it was and, based on that, on how to keep him quiet\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The most obvious, and the most satisfactory for him, was to force the new guest to stay there with them, to be fattened just like Cristiano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only a few problems with that plan. First he had to figure out why the guy had come and for which reason he was in the building. Then he also had to make sure that he had contacts in high enough places to cover for the disappearance of the new soccer player. Swiftly he began to pace around the room while making calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun had begun to set on the horizon James had finally managed to solve most of the situation. Thanks to some blackmailing and to the calling of old debts, he had managed to make it so that Sergio Aguero would be considered infected with the same illness of Cristiano, forcing him so to remain there along with the other player to try and cure himself. Always under James guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also managed to find out why the guy was roaming in their building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player had heard of Cristiano illness and had wanted to visit to just comfort the player. James almost laughed out loud at the ingenuity of his new guest. Yet, there was one last problem that had to be solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready with Cristiano in his current condition there was barely space to move around, if James were to add another player, the room wouldn\u2019t surely be enough. So it was time for renovations since they couldn\u2019t move Cristiano from where he was, due to his huge size. Was it expensive? Yes, but the company that James contacted was renowned for their capacity of keeping a secret so, not one of the workers that came to bring down one of the walls, to  merge Cristiano\u2019s room with the following one, said anything as they worked in record time to provide the enlargement requested by Podrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than three days, James\u2019s Sanctuary was now large enough to host two people of Cristiano size and, since Cristiano did nothing but being stuffed with his gain shake, there was room and time to take care of Sergio Aguero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer player, woke up rather groggily feeling as if he hadn\u2019t had a single drop of water and/or food in the last few days, which was actually true since James had been forced to keep him pharmacologically sedated. But now that he was awake, he blearily looked around trying to figure out where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast thing he remembered was seeing a hugely mass of jiggly jelly which, at the time, he had thought to be Cristiano Ronaldo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to get his bearing, he realized he was strapped down to a bed, unable to move. Just as he was going to scream for help, he saw a figure approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? Why am I strapped to this bed? Where are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Aguero. I\u2019 deeply sorry of having to make your acquaintance in this way but we had no other choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames spoke with a grave tone in his voice, trying to make it sound as if something very wrong had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to explain things to you calmly but first, you need to have something to drink. I\u2019ve been given this serum which will provide your body with the basic nutrients needed for a fast recovery\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that he moved, closer to Aguero, an unmarked container with a straw emerging from the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio began slowly to suck from the straw, accelerating his pace as soon as the liquid passed on his taste buds. James smiled within himself, please to see that yet another player trusted him completely just because he had the face of a simple man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was true that the shake was full of nutrients, it also had some of the chemicals he had used to facilitate the fattening of Cristiano. As Aguero kept drinking, Podrick continued to explain the situation to the player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, as you probably know Cristiano Ronaldo has fallen prey to a strange illness which had forced him to retire from the scene. What you probably didn\u2019t know is that this malady is also mildly infective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was chosen to take care of him due to my immunity to the illness but, as you entered in contact with him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Aguero, which had quite rapidly consumed all the content of the provided container, began to close his eyes, already knowing what the guy in front of him was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince the encounter, you have been tested and the results indicate you\u2019re positive to the illness. I\u2019m truly sorry but, you must remain here and follow the treatment as we try to have you avoid the same fate of Cristiano.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then, seeing as Aguero had begun to lick his lips quite often, while being completely unaware of the slight rounding out of his stomach, rapidly offered him another unmarked container, this time filled with a home-made gain-shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, sir. Have some more of it. Doctors told me you may have a craving for it at first...it should pass in a couple of days...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, still unable to move began drinking once more, stopping only once to ask a question to James, before returning to his drinking, still unaware of the effects that drinking all of that gain shake was going to have on his athletic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. So, who are you and what\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m James Podrick, former coach of Cristiano and now his caretaker. You\u2019re in a wing of the quarantined area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here on out you\u2019ll be staying here following the treatment that the higher up decided for you to follow. One thing I can guarantee you is that you won\u2019t have any contact with the outside world, since nobody has to know about this situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Podrick continued to speak, Sergio assumed a more relaxed stance, as the intense hunger he had felt in the pit of his stomach was getting abated by whatever he was drinking. Still he began to grow worried once more when he heard James talking about the loss of contact from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026*hurff*\u2026What do you mean? I...*urp* whew...that stuff sure is good...But, you mean I can\u2019t contact ...my family while I\u2019m here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but any contact is denied. Your family will be informed by the company legal representative.<br>\r\nNow, if everything is clear I\u2019m going to untie you but I reiterate. You\u2019ll have to follow what they tell me to have you follow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following days, Sergio was able to stand freely in his room, although he couldn\u2019t leave it, not even to talk with his fellow player Ronaldo. That was bothering him but what troubled him the most was that he had still cravings for that strane shake thing he had been offered when he woke up. Not that it tasted bad, the problem was the opposite. As he drank it he felt like he could keep drinking it for months, and that scared him a little. True Podrick had warned about that but, lately, he was finding hiself wishing to always have more of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t make any sense to him that he wanted more of that thing, since he was feeling well but, as his caretake had said to him once \u201cThe issue is that also Cristiano said the same some time ago. At that time the company didn\u2019t press the issue\u2026and now you\u2019ve seen the results.\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, although it made him mad that he had to abandon his vegan lifestyle, he kept drinking that shake, even though he noticed that, somehow, instead of reducing the quantities, they seemed to be giving him always more than the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, as he was secretly spying his new guest through hidden cameras, could only smile as he saw the player dig into the new  oversized pitcher of Gain-Shake that one of the maids had brought upon him. If with Cristiano he had to be pushy and force the player to follow the \u2018Diet\u2019, with Aguero things were easier. After all, Sergio didn\u2019t want to share the same fate of Cristiano and so complied immediately. Probably they could pass him the full gallon size of gain shake before placing him on the fattening diet that forced Cristiano to stay in bed all the time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had only to decide what to do with his new test subject\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the following days the situation of Sergio Aguero become to return to a semblance of normality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe no longer ad cravings for that nutrient shakes, but still he kept consuming it in large quantities, and he himself began to see his staying there as an extended vacation. For that reason, he began to pass his days laying on the bed, watching television and doing not much else.  As James saw that the guy had started to relax, he knew it was the perfect time to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith four days of permanence in the quarantined area, James entered the room where Aguero was staying, he kept a grave expression to let him understand that the situation was dire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr.Aguero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player was currently laying on the bed, watching a tv show, but he turned the TV off and moved his gaze on his caretaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? And call me Sergio, please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Sergio, I\u2019ve just received new directives regarding your stay here and the illness you\u2019ve found yourself subjected to. Basically, the Medical division has given me a plan that you\u2019ve got to be following with extreme precision. I\u2019m truly sorry about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAguero didn\u2019t say anything for a log while then, suddenly he burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Man! I\u2019m not dead yet. You\u2019re just too serious\u2026What is it? They already have taken me out of any exercise. This is basically a vacation\u2026so, no worries man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the player took the meal plan that James was bringing him, his expression first seemed shocked, then seemed to be growing angry and finally showed simply acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, they want me to follow his massive diet, uh? Well, what to do\u2026If that\u2019s what they want.<br>\r\nI\u2019ll just lose the extra weight as soon as I\u2019m out of here. No point in wasting time, bring it on and I\u2019ll chow it down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that morning Aguero began to follow the massive meal plan that Podrick had brought to him, starting to eat almost constantly throughout the day. At first the guy seemed to show a little of resistance but, after a few meals, he simply began to lay back and accept whatever it was brought to him. Podrick couldn\u2019t believe how easy it seemed to be. Even now, as he was watching Aguero going through his third breakfast, devouring it with a voraciousness that he had never seen before, the guy kept eating without a single complaint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when his belly began to bloat outward, over the shorts he was wearing, he didn\u2019t voice a single peep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the following days the situation remained unchanged, Sergio Aguero kept swallowing whatever they brought him and, naturally, his body began to absorb all those calories turning them into fat. Already Podrick could see that Sergio\u2019s body definition was faltering, his six pack had melted away, substituted with a small potbelly, with related love handles that pooled out on his shorts, giving him a little muffin top. His legs had also lost definition already, as his arms did as well. Yet, for some reason, what seemed to be growing at an outstanding speed were his moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, they were practically nonexistent, as it normally is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as more and more calories were pushed inside his system they seemed to be growing out at an outstanding speed. Already, with Sergio losing his muscles and replacing them with jiggly fat, his moobs seemed to have reached a size between the A and the B cup. Aguero though didn\u2019t seem to be noticing it. In fact, apart from following the \u2018Diet\u2019 he didn\u2019t seem to be recognizing much else. As a test, James, brought to him a double portion of his current meal, a pre-first lunch snack, which meant that instead of two Baconators meals with related fries and two slices of apple pies, he was currently bringing him four of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Sergio seemed to simply lick hi lips as he assaulted the trays of food, gorging like a starving beast on the food. James noticed that he was starting to eat a bit more messily than usual, uncaring toward where globs of sauce were ending to, as long as more food went into his maw. And yet, the footballer, managed to consume everything up to the last fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo\u2026man. This is good. Really good *urp*\u2026So, they\u2019re upping the portions now? <br>\r\nS\u2019good\u2026s\u2019good\u2026was getting mildly hungry lately. *belch*\u2026And we can\u2019t have that\u2026can we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat James couldn\u2019t know was that Sergio Aguero had reached a conclusion in all that story, between his illness and the massive diet he had to follow. They wanted him to slow down. Maybe he had been going too fast on his conquests on the field, or maybe his prices were too high. Still They wanted him to get down and be a humbler player. That had to be the reason for all that scene about the illness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he was still scared of what happened to Cristiano Ronaldo but, he was sure that something like that couldn\u2019t happen to him. After all, all he had to do was to follow their diet and become what they wanted him to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I can stop whenever I want. They haven\u2019t hooked me with their lies, I won\u2019t fall easily into their trap.</i>\u2019 He thought smugly, although a second thought snaked into his mind, unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Still it\u2019s all so good\u2026I wonder if I could get some more to munch on\u2026am starting to feel quite hungry again\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, in truth was began to get worried. It was way too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be something that he could do to verify why the player was so willingly accepting that treatment. Although he could just forget about it and push even more food onto him. Still he had to come up with something later, for now he had to meet Cristiano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Podrick changed room, going into the one now occupied by Cristiano Ronaldo, he remained, once again, mesmerized by the size of the ex-footballer. Cristiano had lost all contact with the human world, becoming a huge amorphous mass of fat which had still similarities with a distorted human figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head, now definitively sunken beneath a cone of blubbery chins, was hidden from view, unless James went up a ladder to see things from above of the fleshy fat wall that his chins had formed. His shoulders didn\u2019t exist anymore, merged into a sea of fat which ended with his fattened finger emerging barely from the overlapping fat of his arms. Everything else was hidden behind the hugely mass of his ultra-fattened belly. It covered everything from his torso down. Even his feet were submerged, and the girls in charge of cleaning him out had to wear breathing mask when they had to go under it. It was too risky otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, between the constant feeding and the VR headset, Cristiano was blissfully unaware of anything. Sure, he had to wear it 24 hours a day, now, for t was the only way he could still be able to talk, but James didn\u2019t care. He was so happy with the astounding size of him that he truly wasn\u2019t sure if it was worthy to transform all that jiggly beauty into a meal\u2026or if it was better to let it grow more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after admiring that work of art, feeling his inside grow fuller and fatter every minute, James returned to the sums of his issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, If Sergio was so willing to eat more, who was he to stop him, especially since it served his scope? OR maybe it was better be careful and see what Aguero was thinking before going all out on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cristiano\u2026Turn him into a most delicious meal or not? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Push Aguero to his limits, uncaring for the reason behind his willingness James starts to up his portions day after day, wanting to have a bigger Sergio, as quickly as possible. Cristiano sadly has reached his potential and need to be dealt with, also with the space freed James could find someone else to share te space with Sergio. Fattening two footballers at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 Investigate on Sergio, go at him through hypnosis and find out why he\u2019s so willing. While he\u2019s under hypnosis James could always make him see something, he shouldn\u2019t be able to see anymore. Take care of Cristiano, turn him into a vast reserve of ready to be consumed meals, maybe they could become so good to be addictive for James? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 Push both players to consume even more. Let Sergio mingle with Cristiano, let him understand what his future is going to look like, maybe Aguero will show some fight then, when he realize he\u2019s truly trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 Or maybe something else entirely, maybe someone else finally decided to break through the quarantine zone and find out why great Footballers are vanishing so suddenly. Someone might have noticed, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 Writer\u2019s choice\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James knew that, as much as he wanted to taste Cristiano Ronaldo, he couldn\u2019t. In all his career he had never seen any man reaching such a size. The guy will to live had to be as big as his current size and so, how could he stop him now? If Ronaldo could grow more, why should he stop him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoreover, with Cristiano around, he could push more and more on Sergio only to show him his future by letting him mingle with his predecessor. Yes, James knew that his idea fascinated him a lot. He wouldn\u2019t lose his trophy and would recover the missing meal with the new footballer. <br>\r\nWith his plan in motion, he moved to the room where Sergio Aguero was resting. He found the footballer lazily laying on his bed, watching something on tv, as he snacked away with a bowl of buttery popcorn one of the nurses had brought to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Sergio?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph\u2026Oh, it\u2019s good, sir. Would prefer doing something other than laze in bed all day but, if that is the \u2018diet\u2019, I shall comply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026Good. Then, I\u2019ll leave you to your next mid-morning snack\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Sergio voiced over James, as he kept licking his fingers now that he scraped along the almost empty bowl in his arm. \u201c\u2026Wanted to ask you something, if I can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stopped as soon as the footballer called for him, turning around to face him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Never worry about asking me something. If I can do anything to ease your time here, you just need to tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, didn\u2019t want to bother you\u2026Knowing you\u2019re busy trying to help Cristiano but, I\u2019m still finding myself craving those drinks you guys gave me when I first arrived here and so I was wondering if there is something wrong with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled inwardly, thinking that it was normal for Sergio to feel cravings for those shake, since those were nothing more than addictive chemicals in a bottle, yet he couldn\u2019t say that out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the doctors told me the effect could last up to two/three weeks and then it would slowly vanish away but, if you want some more of them I can ask to send a few more shipments to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio, already tasting those shake again in his mouth, could only nod in approval as his stare was suddenly moved from James toward one of the nurses which had just entered in his room carrying with her a tray loaded with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Aguero\u2026I have here your second mid-morning snack, no need to move, I\u2019ll bring it directly to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames grinned as he soon was completely out of the picture for the footballer, as all of Sergio\u2019s focus was now on the tray loaded with goodies that was being moved right under his nose. The coach stood there silently admiring how the soccer player was getting engrossed with his food, noticing that the nurse had rightfully thought to bring to the guy some baked sweets, along with the same health bars that they had used on Cristiano.  Aguero didn\u2019t seem to mind about the large sized portion that he was been giving, instead he focused only on the tasty morsels that were soon going to be within his lips. As the footballer ate with abandon, James cleared his voice a bit and approached the player trying to be less invasive as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr.Aguero\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you, already. Please\u2026mmph\u2026call me, Sergio.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSergio, apart from those shakes, there is anything else I can provide you with to help you with your stay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026now that you speak of it\u2026I noticed that these portions seem\u2026inadequate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn-inadequate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I mean\u2026such small portions\u2026isn\u2019t it possible to have some more\u2026normal sized meals around here?<br>\r\nI know that they\u2019re trying to slow me down but, starving me seems\u2026excessive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026well, I\u2019ll see that some fairer portions are brought to you, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks man! Although, if one of Cristiano's nurses would like to be with a more\u2026shapely guy, I\u2019m sure they know where to find me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will err\u2026 relate the message. One more thing, Sergio, just wanted you to know that I would like you to meet Cristiano in the short future. We still have to receive clearance from the Medical team but, if you shall result asymptomatic, I would like for you to meet with him to, hopefully, cheer him up a bit. It has been hard for him in the last few weeks as his condition\u2026worsened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer player, laying on the bed, didn\u2019t seem to have heard a word, focused as he was on his current meal but he still nodded, before going to town on a rather large bowl of ice cream that the nurse had brought him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded back with a little smile, before leaving the room, letting the footballer to enjoy his snacks in peace. As he exited the room, he thought about the requests Sergio had made. It was too soon to be the effects of the bars, and still he asked for an upgrade in the meals brought to him. All this situation puzzled the coach. The player seemed genuinely unaware of the quantity he was eating, even though there weren\u2019t almost any chemical induced agents in his system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, if Sergio wanted more, James could only comply.<br>\r\nTaking out his cellphone he quickly dialed the chef\u2019s in charge of supplying the footballers with their meals, hoping that the feeder chef wouldn\u2019t enjoy too much the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAntoine? Yes, It\u2019s James Podrick. About Mr. Aguero\u2019s meal plan, please to triple all the portions related to him. Yes, that is a direct request from him. And please, try to refrain from making full twelve course meals for him. He\u2019s not ready yet. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick turned toward the humongous blob that was Cristiano. The hugely mass of quivering fat had stopped being human shaped since a long time already, yet that didn\u2019t stop him from growing more and more, gulping down the nutrient goop that was brought to him through the feeding tube. James, sensing some discomfort into the blob like ex-footballer, quickly went into his private room and donned the VR device, entering in contact with the virtual world in which Cristiano was living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he stepped through the virtual room, he saw the normal sized figure of Cristiano, rendered to perfection thanks to the device, laying on his bed as he was currently watching some old tv series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCristiano? Are you feeling okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes coach\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it? You know that I\u2019ll try to help you as much as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that\u2026It\u2019s\u2026Well, it\u2019s Georgina. Lately all she talks about is how healthy I\u2019m becoming and how much beautiful I\u2019m getting but\u2026she never touches me\u2026she never holds me\u2026 It\u2019s as if my life has become a fake distorted version of reality. I know that she can\u2019t come here in person but, still\u2026I\u2019m a man, you know? I have some\u2026needs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Ah.</i>\u2019 Thought James \u2018<i>That\u2019s the problem. He hasn\u2019t realized yet that this world his living in is not the real world but, the lack of personal contact is getting to him.<br>\r\nBut how can I\u2026mmh. Maybe there I something I can do.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get your point, Cristiano. Sadly, you know as much as I that she cannot come in here. Still, there may be a solution to that issue. If you want, I can try to talk with her and see if this potential solution of mine would be acceptable. What do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026 I... I don\u2019t know if I want to know about it, do I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let me first verify with her. If you know not about it, you can\u2019t be blamed, can you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue\u2026mmm\u2026I\u2019ll leave it to you then. Thanks coach\u2026mmm\u2026getting hungry. Must be almost time for my meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Podrick saluted Cristiano, he left the room and took out his visor, returning to the room hosting the huge blob named Cristiano Ronaldo. James still couldn\u2019t believe that the guy had yet to see the truth behind the VR device. How could he fail to notice that he was living in a virtual dream was beyond James comprehension, still it worked to his advantage so there wasn\u2019t any loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, as he approached the personal nurse of Cristiano, he laid out his plan to her, knowing full well that the fake nurse would hardly refuse the deal he was giving her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the second nurse was still in Sergio Aguero\u2019s room, standing beside the player as he kept munching on through a seemingly endless stream of snack food. The player wasn\u2019t currently feeling hungry but, the presence of the beautiful girl at his side, pushing him to keep on eating was enough to let him push towards his own limit. Only when his PJ\u2019s pant ripped, letting his overfull belly have finally some room to grow he seemed to snap out of it but, the girl was quickly at his side. She rapidly diverted his attention toward her own assets, distracting him enough to forget about his rising belly or the pain he felt in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio was happy as a clam. Not only he had managed to get some normal meals, instead of the rabbit portions he was receiving, but there was also this beautiful girl at his side, attracted to his finely shaped physique. As risky as it sounded, since he still wanted to get out of that room, he had begun to think that maybe he didn\u2019t want to actually lose the treatment he was subjected too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lost himself in the two beautiful assets of the nurse beside him, he didn\u2019t oppose any resistance as she pushed within his lips yet another of those health bars he was starting to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man, it\u2019s all so good\u2026do I really want to get out of here?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks had passed already since Sergio Aguero had ended up in the quarantined zone where his fellow player, Cristiano Rolando, lived in. Yet, Sergio, although he had wanted to get out of there at the soonest, lately he was having some second thoughts on that. For once, he was finally enjoying some good old portioned meals, no more rabbit food in both taste and quantity, and also there was Susie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie had been initially one of the two nurses assigned to Cristiano but, as Sergio arrived, she had seemed to have taken a shine for him. Not that he could blame her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could anyone feel anything but disgust in seeing the blob like ex footballer? Still, between the meals and the presence of the nurse he was reconsidering his permanence there. As of that moment, hardly past 11:00 AM, Sergio was laying down on his bed, eating away at a quite large burger, courtesy of the nurse who had brought him a little snack, while one of those shakes he was loving was waiting for him as soon as he finished with the burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had noticed that his middle had seemingly grown a bit fluffier but, with the busty nurse at his side there was something else that caught his attention. And yet the girl was relentless, everytime she spent some time with him, she always brought something for him to eat. Not that he minded, but it was becoming strangely enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, as he was now awaiting her arrival, he realized he was waiting for both her presence and her delicious treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as she entered his room, and sashayed to him with her curvy body, he began to have eyes only for her\u2026and the tray she was holding. As she sat on the verge of the bed, beside the footballer, she quickly began to tease his lips a bit with her fingers, until she simply pushed within his mouth a fragment of the healthy bars he was getting in love with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio, without noticing, was growing addicted to those bars and, although he was loving them he seemed unable to check what all that food was doing to his figure. Passing all of his days laying in bed already had forced his body to lose much of his muscle mass, but the sudden influx of heavily calorific food, in large quantities, boosted his body production of fat. Already the player was looking rather chubby, his six-pack vanished, replaced with quite a chubby belly, which Susie often played with, as his overall from began to grow heavier and softer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, for those two weeks, Sergio did nothing but eat his large meals, consume an ungodly number of snacks thanks to Susie and lay in bed all day. As soon as he cleaned out the tray, Susie offered her breasts to him, which he thoroughly enjoyed fondling. As he lowered his arms, feeling content and satisfied, Susie knelt beside him and began whispering in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Mr. Aguero\u2026I\u2019m sure all girls tell you this but, I find you extremely cute. If only you could be more of a man\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan? What\u2026What do you\u2026*urp*\u2026excuse me\u2026What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse snuggled closer to the footballer, pushing her body against his, letting him feel her every curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019re looking more like a kid than a man\u2026if only you could grow somehow at a healthier weight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt that luscious body against his own, Sergio was barely able to think, but the girl words did register in his brain, although he didn\u2019t think about connecting this advance with the situation of Cristiano. He simply smiled as he felt that wonderful body moving closer and closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would just have to eat some more\u2026wouldn\u2019t that be pleasant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting downright aroused, unable to think clearly but he couldn\u2019t do much but agree that he could use to add some pounds to his physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could start now, I could feed you sometimes\u2026and you would be able to feel my body\u2026.wouldn\u2019t you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sergio was lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply nodded and slowly opened his mouth. No matter that he had just finished eating his mid-morning snack, here she was this beautiful girl, ready to give him paradise and all he had to do was to eat a few sweets? He would have been a fool to refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as days passed, James smiled seeing as his latest scheme began to bring fruits. The use of Susie as focal point for Sergio had been a great idea and, knowing the girl and what kind of tremendous feeder she was, Podrick was fairly certain that Sergio was going to fatten up by a whole lot in no time at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay by day the feeding sessions between Sergio and Susie began to grow both in length and in quantity of food consumed. Sergio soon found himself pending from her lips, a single moan from her side could let him eat throughout a seven-course meal. And still, she pushed him for more, forcing him to eat more bars, more sweets, more junk food. It wasn\u2019t long before all this indulgence would show up on the footballer. Barely a month had passed since Susie entered in Sergio\u2019s life and yet the Player had already asked, twice, to up his daily meals portions. Without including all the snacks that he was consuming by the hands of Susie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely stricken with lust and under her control, Sergio began growing bigger and bigger, reaching soon the 240 lbs. His whole body had puffed out. His belly had grown humongous, always stuffed full of food, it had enlarged in size growing up and out, even starting to cover his lower regions. A second chin was beginning to appear, as his moobs started to inflate. Overall, he was getting definitely chubby. But, forced under such a training, he soon found himself more and more attracted to the simple act of eating, then by the simple reward of having her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day started Sergio awoke with a start, his sleep interrupted by the loud rumbling of his belly. Although he had just woke up he didn\u2019t even tried to move from the bed, while he simply moved his hand toward the night stand where he knew there were going to be a few sweets that Susan was leaving for him. Sergio quickly destroyed the contents of the full box the nurse had left for him and, he polished so quickly that he felt his hunger barely touched by the consumption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready he was going to shout toward the door when the same opened up, letting Susan enter with a couple trolley\u2019s worth of food trailing behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Lover boy. Are you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio, already salivating at the sight of the food coming toward him could barely speak, instead he nodded vigorously as his growing double chin wobbled a bit with the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I need my boy to grow up to a big and strong man\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan reached the player\u2019s bed, she began to unload the first cart, basically surrounding the growing out forms of Sergio with dozens of breakfast food, all in their quite large plates. Before Sergio could even utter a word, she grabbed a forkful of pancakes, dripping with syrup and melted butter, ad moved it toward Sergio\u2019s mouth. Surprisingly for her, Sergio didn\u2019t make a single request but, instead, he simply opened his mouth and gladly accepted the load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his acceptance, she tried to give him right away another load and was mildly surprised when he simply accepted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, she decided to take advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio was feeling rather good with himself, here he was, eating away a good meal, served to him by a beautiful girl. He had noticed that, lately, he seemed to be growing out quite a bit, but with the girl fawning over him and the good food she brought to him, he could care less about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely even registered the fact that Susan was feeding him faster and faster, as morsel upon morsel was getting pushed within his mouth, forcing him to chew more and more rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in that exact moment that he realized something about his current situation\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sergio realized, as more and more food was pushed into his mouth that all his thoughts of leaving the place and returning to his career or his family had been simply washed away. It was a mind-blowing experience for him. At first all he had wanted was to get it done and return to his career, but now, he couldn\u2019t see himself out of that room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why would he leave it? He had everything he needed right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn amazing girl fawning over him, good food and all the rest he could ever enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on his lips, uncaring toward the crumbs and grease around his lips, he began to eat way more greedily at whatever Susan forced upon him. As she saw that he quickened his pace, so she matched it, as she started using two forks to keep his lips always full of something, forcing him to gurgle and snort piggishly, and yet he kept going. For almost one hour and a half, Susan and Sergio seemed to battle for control until, the soccer player was feeling full. It was then that he began to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Susan had other plans in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Lover boy? Already getting full?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio burbled something, his lips still closed on the last morsels she had pushed on him, as he desperately tried to chew and swallow. But his bloated middle was a clear indication that he had reached his limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the girl kept on taunting him, bit by bit, until she struck a nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is you wondrous Stamina? Oh\u2026 I get it. You\u2019re really just a boy, aren\u2019t you? A little boy unable to finish his meals and who go \u2018wee-wee\u2019 when he doesn\u2019t want to continue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, something fiercely emerged from Sergio as he finally managed to swallow down the latest morsel but, instead of the angry reply he simply opened his mouth, waiting for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nurse smiled at that and, as she pushed a slice of strawberry cake within his lips, she moved her own lips toward his burgeoning belly, kissing it softly, never taking her eyes away from his. Sergio, although full to burst, could see he had managed to get back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was implying that he was but a child, uh? He was going to show her that he was a full-grown man. Bite after bite, morsel after morsel, he managed to lick clean the residual plates, although he felt rather ill after that. And yet, seeing as the girl seemed to glow with pleasure, he felt as if he had won against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that feeling in mind he simply fell asleep in a deep, restorative sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ex-soccer player slept, Susan kept caressing his bloated gut. In the short time she had been with him, it had been the first time that she managed to get him so full. Taking note of his pride, she smiled impishly as she realized she now had a new weapon to use against him. Podrick was going to be very happy with her job, Sergio was going to be fattened up really quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, as soon as Sergio woke up from his latest food coma, he found himself still laying on his bed. IN the shadowed room he looked lazily around, as he unconsciously caressed his softening stomach, trying to figure out what he was doing there. For a moment, thoughts of returning to his career came back to him but, the memory of the curvaceous body of Susan, tightly pressed against his own, quickly put those thoughts away. For a moment he almost wished to rise from the bed to walk around the room for a bit but, almost immediately he rejected the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Why should I rise from here? I\u2019m so comfy here\u2026and it\u2019s not like I need to train, I\u2019m in the best shape of my life\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought that, his belly grumbled a bit, requesting the nutrients it had been trained to expect by this time. Just as that sound filled the room, almost as if Susan had been waiting for it, she entered the room carrying with her a small little train of trolley\u2019s with Sergio\u2019s meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Handsome.  It\u2019s time for your pre-dinner meal, you\u2019re ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026I\u2019m always ready\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse moved closer to the bed, sitting beside Sergio, as she uncovered the first platter, she had brought to him. It was a rather large bowl filled with fried spring rolls and overfilled gyoza, these lasts were so stuffed with meat that seemed ready to burst at a moment notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go, enjoy it, Lover Boy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio, taking a more seated position on his bed, quickly grabbed the bowl and began to stuff his mouth with those delicacies. With each bite he felt in heaven, everything tasted so delicious on his taste buds that he even began to take bigger and bigger bites, trying to stuff as much as he could within his mouth. Even the heavy oily and greasy taste didn\u2019t seem to disturb him anymore but, instead, pushed him to greedily eat faster. Sooner than he would have liked he felt his fingers scraping the end of the bowl, but before he could frown about that, Susan took the empty bowl and brought to him a large container with fried Chinese noodles with pork and egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, we\u2019ve just started Handsome\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio didn\u2019t even reply, he just picked the fork and began scooping up forkful of it bringing it into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the taste was incredible. He already had Chinese food before, but it had never been so good, so tasty. Going at it faster and faster, he began to smear his mouth with oil and sauce, yet he didn\u2019t seem to care, nor he was noticing how his stomach was bloating up, filling up with the food he was devouring. It took him less than ten minutes to clean out the large container but, as before, Susa quickly swapped the empty one with a new one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was white rice with Takoyaki sauce and fried pieces of beef. Before that, though, the nurse offered to him a milkshake as she began to slowly kiss his bloating belly, as if urging him to continue. With such encouragement Sergio began to guzzle down the milkshake, feeling it landing heavily into his gut and, a few minutes later, as he burped in satisfaction, he felt his hunger rising stronger than before. Overcome by this feeling he attacked anew the container he had been given, eating at it like a starving animal, sending rice and sauce almost everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter, he wanted nothing but to sate his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal continued in this way for more than two hours, with Sergio feeling his hunger growing every time he downed one of Susan shake\u2019s, yet he never did question it. He was just too hungry to discuss it on the moment and, when he finally finished his ten-course meal, he was way too spent and full to raise an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he gobbled up the last fortune cookie, he burbled stupidly for a moment before exhaling an exhausted burp, feeling his stomach once again overstuffed with food. As Susan helped him lie down once more, it didn\u2019t seem to matter that his belly blocked his view with how large and stuffed it was, he was just too tired to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I\u2026do\u2026*urp*\u2026good?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting there, Handsome. Now, rest for a bit\u2026I\u2019ll be back in half an hour to bring you your first dinner\u2026sleep well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that she kissed him softly on the lips, feeling herself the greasy taste of the food, he had ingested in those two hours. Sergio, trying as hard as he could to overcome his exhaustion, did all he could to kiss her back but was too tired to keep gong and soon fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept he dreamed of being in a nice little house, sitting at a table as Susan, dressed only with a cooking dress, was busily working herself at the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, Handsome! Welcome back, your lunch is almost ready\u2026I\u2019ve prepared you a snack on the table. Be a good boy and have at it while I finish to prepare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, he saw that the table had seemingly filled with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire banquet table was now covered in platters and bowls, each of them full of delicacies for him to have. <br>\r\nDreaming Sergio didn\u2019t even question how all that humongous spread of food could be counted as snack, but he immediately began to dig in\u2026or at least, he tried to. For some reason he couldn\u2019t move his arms too well, yet, almost magically, Susan appeared beside him, as she began feeding him morsel after morsel, spoonful after spoonful. Sergio had only to chew and swallow, and he felt he was working at it just like a pro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder his own eyes, the food began to dwindle from the table, vanishing as he kept eating it until, finally the entire table had only dirty platters and crumbs of food. Burping in satisfaction, he tried again to move his arms but still, he couldn\u2019t manage. <br>\r\nHe tried to look down, but something was blocking his view. Still, Susan brought his stare up high again, as she kissed him with a passion he never had felt before. Melting under that kiss, he wasn\u2019t surprised in seeing that the table was quickly being refilled by his lovely Susan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatters upon platters of food being piled on it until it was completely refilled and, once more, she appeared at his side helping him to eat every single crumb of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreaming Sergio felt in paradise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept eating at the endless meal he noticed that he was slowly growing, getting wider and wider, his body rising higher from the ground, as his entire forms seemed to inflate with food, but it was of no importance to him, even when Susan had began climbing his body to push more food within his lips. Nothing had importance beside having Susan beside him.<br>\r\nAnd more food to sate his hungry, growing, body.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sergio woke up suddenly, he couldn\u2019t remember much except that he was strangely ravenous and that Susan was the best thing that had ever happened in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw the door opening and she entering he idly wondered why he had wanted to leave that place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Susan loves me, and food is good \u2026why should I ever leave this paradise?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would take some time, but Sergio was going to grow and then, James could finally make a meal out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, instead he had to focus on how to make Cristiano a happier man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather simple, really, he had already discussed it with his Nurse, Nastassja, and she had agreed wholeheartedly to his plan. While Cristiano was living in his fake universe through the VR, James was going to warn him to lay down on the bed for he had a surprise for him. Then, all Podrick had to do was to mimicking Nastassja actions on the Georgina character he had made into the VR, so that Cristiano could finally be relieved from his\u2026manly needs. Naturally, James would make it appear as it was all agreed beforehand with Cristiano girlfriend but, done that, everything would go smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, after having prepared everything between the software and the hardware, James entered into the virtual world Cristiano was actually living in and warned him that in a few Georgina was going to arrive and explain him how things were going to go. Podrick, beforehand, had already created a link to a sub chat in the VR system. Every time Cristiano, who was already living in the VR (although he wasn\u2019t aware of it), were to place the VR on his avatar\u2019s head, said sub chat would open letting him believe to having just been moved into the VR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Georgina\u2019s character appeared and, while mimicking the nurse movements in the real world, it began getting closer to the player currently sitting on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe. I\u2019ve\u2026um\u2026I\u2019ve talked with your Coach about your needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEurgh\u2026Ok? And\u2026what\u2026what have you decided? You know that I\u2019ll follow your wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virtual Georgina moved closer to him, a smile on her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re a faithful partner, sweetie. That is why I\u2019ve agreed with our coach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I\u2019ll be here sharing this with you\u2026someone else will be giving you the relief you need. Don\u2019t worry though, I trust in my man, especially since he's growing so handsomely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following hour, Cristiano believed to be in paradise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only he was feeling the relief he so hardly had needed in the real world but, since his eyes told him that it was his fianc\u00e9e performing it he couldn\u2019t have been happier. Still, he seemed somewhat distressed to be feeling tired after only one go at it but with Georgina there complimenting him and reminding him to be having still need for time to recover from his malady, the player stopped worrying about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hour passed, Georgina moved away, telling him that she had to go but that she would be back for a similar experience whenever he wanted. Shortly, they agreed to make it a weekly appointment to let him release steam. Sometime later, James character appeared in the virtual room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cristiano\u2026so, how did it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026\u2019t was\u2026fantastic\u2026coach. So tired\u2026though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry Cristiano. Just follow the diet and you\u2019ll be ready to go soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more of a chitchat, Podrick left the VR room and returned into the real world, there he went ad complimented the nurse for the marvelous job, then he turned his stare toward the blobby mass that was Cristiano Ronaldo. Weighing roughly over the ton, the guy had already become an amorphous blob of jelly like flesh, and still, given the voracity with which he was slurping on hi feeding tube, James could see that these \u2018relief sessions\u2019 were going to add so many pounds to the already hugely mass that the soccer player had become. Still, as much as Cristiano was gaining, Podrick dreamed of an even bigger version of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Cristiano was now happy as a clam, Sergio Aguero was getting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving renounced to a life out of that room, the increasingly fatter player was now starting on his adventure toward becoming Cristiano\u2019s rival, although he wasn\u2019t aware of that. Yet, as time passed between the almost constant meals provided by Susan and her company in said moments, Sergio began to notice that he was growing increasingly less interested in her physical touch, and more passionate about the goodies she was bringing him. Still, he didn\u2019t make a fuss over it. It didn\u2019t matter to him the why\u2019s of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he needed, lately, was food in his body and her presence at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, as he heard Cristiano moan, he smiled for the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Eh, I wonder who Coach Podrick hired to take care of that huge mass of lard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor lady. Not like my Susan, who can get her hands on someone of my caliber.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sergio had thoe thoughts he could not imagine that he was starting jut as Cristiano had before him. The player, in fact, was currently laying on his back, on the bed. At one side a bowl with those health bars he loved, on the other another bowl with several donuts and, right in the middle, his growing belly. His demeanor changed, though, as soon as the door to his room opened. As if he had been trained to answer to a pavlovian command, as soon as the door opened, he began feeling hungry, even if he had done nothing but eat the entire afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting a bit he tried to heave himself off the bed, so to seat more comfortably but, without Susan intervention, he wouldn\u2019t have moved. None of this was noticed by him, all he seemed to care at the moment was to gorge on whatever Susan had brought to him. And plenty she had brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go, Lover boy\u2026your first pre dinner\u2026afterwards, you will continue for your next three dinners and then, maybe a few desserts too\u2026what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmf\u2026yeah\u2026I\u2026I need it\u2026give it to me\u2026give it all to me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan bega bringing him plates she could see that he was getting nice and greedy, trying to gorge on everything he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes. Good Piggy. Keep on eating, keep on growing\u2026You\u2019ll be so Fat by the time I\u2019ve finished with you\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of these encouragements were needed though, Sergio Aguero went at it like a starving beast, stuffing his face with a ferociousness that Susan had never seen before. He gorged like a madman, eating and gorging almost non stop, he didn\u2019t even stop to drink his milkshakes and, what left stupefied Susan was that after a full ten course meal, he still turned to her demanding more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMfhm\u2026*Burp!*\u2026mmm\u2026so good\u2026need more, though\u2026much more. Su\u2026Susan? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas something...happened to...the diet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m back to\u2026*urp*\u2026rabbit portions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse smiled seeing him reaching a new level on his gluttony, here he was, having eaten enough food for two, a feat that usually left him tired and spent, and yet he had just asked for more. She couldn\u2019t believe her ears, and still, she was very happy to let him indulge some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Job, Handsome\u2026You noticed it. I was just checking if you were faking it or not\u2026don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got your back\u2026eat up and grow like any man should, baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said so she exited the room and brought in a new set of trolley\u2019s. Initially she had wanted to use them to goad him to have some more but, if he was really requesting an increase in his portions size, who was she to say no? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffering to him a massive platter covered with sausages and fries, deeply immersed into a thick gooey BBQ sauce, she kept staring as his already overfilled belly kept growing bigger and larger as more food he ate with reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Oh God\u2026it\u2019s all so good\u2026I need more of it\u2026She brings me so much happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant her? No. Food first\u2026then maybe some snack\u2026and later on, maybe, her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. It\u2019s all so good\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

True, under her guidance, Sergio had managed to finally lose any conscious thought about leaving the place, preferring to stay there and enjoy both her company and the food she brough to him but, for Susan, this wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for this reason that, as morning came and she entered Sergio\u2019s room with her deluge of treats for his four breakfasts, she decided to play the situation a bit differently than normal. As she moves closer to the bed, where the soccer player was still sleeping, she marveled once more at the sheer size he had managed to reach. As he was laying on his bed, she could see that he already had swelled up quite a bit. A larger than most paunch already on his torso, having completely erased his washboards abs. His moobs starting to grow large and jelly like, as a similar fate were subjected both his arms and legs. As she inche closer to him she could clearly see that his thighs were touching and would be separated only if he consciously moved them apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face, though, hadn\u2019t yet gotten bigger. It was somewhat softer but, there wasn\u2019t still any sign of a big, juicy, double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, She needed more of him and so, as she woke him up, seeing his hungry tare she decided to start his training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Sergio, it time for your breakfasts\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh..? Oh\u2026yea\u2026breakfasts sounds\u2026good. I\u2019m hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut before we do that, Sergio, what do you say of a little game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio Aguero, having been \u2018trained\u2019 by stuffing his belly to the fullest, wasn\u2019t really interested in any game but, since it was from His Susan that the request was coming, he decided to let herself explain, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026Don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019m hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon\u2026It will be fun\u2026and the prize is good too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026prize?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Susan smiled as she grabbed from one of the trolley she had brought with her a large, five liters, jug, choked full of the melted health bars he had grown addicted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you win\u2026you get to have this jug here\u2026even if you shouldn\u2019t have it before lunch\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sergio realized what the jug contained, he began feeling the urge to drink from it, to empty it all into his gullet. Feeling as a Drug addict would in front of a cache of his favorite drugs, Sergio was acutely aware and waiting for Susan instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now, all you\u2019ve got to do is eat\u2026Normally you should have four breakfasts\u2026But if you want the prize you shall eat eight of them\u2026will you do it for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer player, although knowing that he usually felt full after his first three, managing to clean the fourth out of sheer willpower, vigorously nodded to the request, his eyes still glued to the jug full of health bars sludge. The nurse smiled, seeing this as the first stepping stone toward her goal of having Sergio obey all of her commands, still, she quickly began to pile the food around him, helping him then to maintain a more comfortable seated position on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex-soccer player, now that had food all around him, quickly began to clear out plate after plate, scooping out at times, whole plates, only to let their contents flow down in his mouth to be chewed and swallowed. Still, as he cleaned away three breakfasts worth of food he began to feel himself getting stuffed up. Yet, he truly did want the prize and so he plowed through another two full breakfast, before feeling himself overstuffed and unable to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Big Boy isn\u2019t able to continue on this measly little meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and puffing from both the fatigue of having eaten way too much and the feeling of all the food weighing him down, Sergio tried desperately to continue but he found himself unable to. Almost crying he looked at Susan, pleading and begging for help. The nurse, smiling inwardly, moved closer to him, massaging his overfilled gut, helping him in finding more space, although she still whispered in his ear something that both worried and aroused the soccer player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Alright\u2026I\u2019ll help you out this time but\u2026this mean that tomorrow you shall do better than today\u2026all on your own</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Susan help, both in massaging his belly and in the end, with seven meals downed, with a bit of force feeding from her part, Sergio managed finally to clear out all the meals that Susan had brought to him. The player was mostly left in a similar state of shock, as he felt himself so full that he got the feeling of be ready to burst at any minute. Yet, as full as he was, when he saw Susan giving him the jug, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from bringing it to his lips as he started chugging it, swallowing painfully all the sludge in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he released his hold on the jug a massive belch escaped from his lips and quickly, he fell asleep back on his bed, as his humongous filled and taut stomach churned and burbled angrily having been filled way more than its supposed capacity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weeks passed, Susan kept providing more and more food to Sergio Aguero, pushing him every time to go over his limits and, as time passed, the easier it quickly became for her to order him around. True, some time he couldn\u2019t reach the quota she had ordered him and, in those instances, she had to punish him by giving him less to eat but, soon he practically had become a slave to her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was proven that morning, a full month of training under his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan entered the room, she marveled at the sheer size her pet had managed to reach. Sergio, overfed by massive quantities of food, had grown astonishingly fast. After a month of eating almost to bursting point, already he had increased his mass of several times. His torso had swelled up hugely, as he now sported a gut that completely covered his crotch and that he was unable to hug with his own two arms. Both arms and legs had softened up similarly, forcing him to keep them rigidly, since it was becoming harder and harder for him to bend them. Even his hips and ass had widened considerably, although not as massively as his belly. His ass had quickly become a massive set of cushions he could use to sit even on the harshest grounds, without feeling but a minor discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, what Susan loved more than anything, his face finally sported a large double chin, with a third roll starting to appear underneath his other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with her inspection she moved closer and softly patted him on his wobbly gut, waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Pet\u2026How are you doing today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmrf\u2026m\u2019hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. A hungry pet is a healthy one. Stand up, then, pet. Do it for me.<br>\r\nDo it for your Mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio, used now to having Susan as a Master, slowly began to move from his reclined position. Sweating profusely, he moved both of his legs to the side of his bed, as he mustered all of his energies to comply with what Susan had ordered. He took nearly twenty minutes but, in the end, he managed to stand although he couldn\u2019t do it for more than a few moments, before falling on his behind, managing to keep himself seated on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, Pet. Here\u2019s your reward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan then left on his fattened thighs a humongous triple layered cake, covered in frosting, which the soccer player quickly proceeded to devour as if it was nothing more than a light snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Pet, show me how good of a pet you are\u2026 Today I will give you twice as much as you usually get. You will eat up to the last crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you manage\u2026I\u2019ll have a good prize for you\u2026but if you fail\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026Won\u2019t fail\u2026Will eat all\u2026I\u2019m a good pet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026Eat up then\u2026will bring you your  doubled mid-morning snack soon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surrounded by the two fattest soccer player the world had ever seen he rarely thought back at how the situation he was in had started at all. Yet, suddenly, he was forced to wake up from this dreamland and face the real world once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, well into the they year and something since Cristiano had vanished from the scene, one of James informants let him know that the CEO had grown restless and was planning a \u2018surprise\u2019 visit to see how the two players were faring. Luckily for James, the informants told him that the visit was going to happen in a week, so there may be going to be just enough time to find a solution. Podrick, although initially in a panic, managed to calm himself and think rationally. With his web of contacts, for sure he was going to find a solution for the CEO impending visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedical records weren\u2019t going to be an issue. Everything that had been done to both Cristiano and Aguero, had been accurately masked under fool proof papers. The real issue was, unfortunately, Cristiano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, under James wishful desires, had grown way to massive to justify any kind of treatments intended to cure him from his \u2018Illness\u2019. As much as the thought destroyed him, James was seriously thinking that Cristiano had to go. Although there were a few people that would share with James the bounty offered by the massively ultra-obese soccer player, James didn\u2019t like the idea of getting rid of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, a fantastic meal was going to come out of him, a literal bounty that would keep James and his friends fed for a long time but, he had grown rather attached to Cristiano. Almost as if he was a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, James didn\u2019t see any other escape route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t transfer the player away safely. He had no one that he could trust to take care of Cristiano, keeping him alive and fed, and he couldn\u2019t let the CEO to see the blobby mountain that Cristiano had become. There were papers but, even a fool would have realized that, at that size, a hospital would have been a better choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. There was nothing to it. With only a last resort in his head, James did what he needed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called Georgina. The real fianc\u00e9e of Cristiano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he talked to her he told her a series of disturbing lies, something that seemed to shock her out of the blue, after having missed her boyfriend for so long. And yet, James knew it was the only way that he could keep Cristiano alive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026So, Miss, I know it may be hard to believe but we had no other choice. The higher-ups wanted to shut down what had happened, make it so that Cristiano had died due to this strange illness\u2026Yet, I couldn\u2019t do it. So, I hid him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve kept him hidden as the illness wreaked his body, as he lost almost all things that made him the Cristiano Ronaldo I\u2019ve known. And yet, it was better than having him\u2026taken off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sorry to call upon you in such a dire circumstance to reveal you this secret but\u2026I\u2019ve got no other choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, Georgina Rodriguez was speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tried time and time again to reach Cristiano but they had always told her he was gravely ill with a very infective malady and so she couldn\u2019t manage to contact him. But now, as she heard the words of his Coach, as she felt the pain in his voice, she was crestfallen in realizing how horrible those people were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo even think of disposing of her fianc\u00e9e as if he was nothing more than a rag on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026but\u2026But What I can do to help? Why are you telling me all of this? You want me to go public?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No, going public would only make matters worse. I may have a place where he could hide, but I need someone trustworthy to take care of him as the malady run its course. I can\u2019t think of anyone else but you, Miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you really love him as much as Cristiano told me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgina, even though she didn\u2019t know what to expect, didn\u2019t wait not even the blink of an eye to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need of me? I\u2019ll do all I can to save him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Miss\u2026 I\u2019ll organize his transfer by using a flatbed truck with a massive refrigerated container on top of it. Cristiano will be moved in there and then transferred to the safe location I told you about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need you to get on board of the truck and assist Cristiano as much as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Georgina\u2019s help, James began to organize everything. Swiftly, a secure transport was arranged, and Cristiano\u2019s bed swiftly moved from the room he was, into the container that was going to hold him until he reached the safe location. Moving Cristiano proved to be a massive feat and yet, somehow, they managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was sad in letting Cristiano\u2019s go but, the hope that he could still be alive, and reachable, was enough to make it all become a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, James would have preferred to give Cristiano to his friends but, as big as he was, he was sure that they would have fallen prey of their own hedonism and needs to feed. No, with Georgina guarding him, he at least could hope to meet Cristiano again and then made a meal out of him when situation had calmed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all James had to do was provide some new papers, certifying the death of Cristiano Ronaldo and wait for the CEO to arrive. When the fateful morning came, Podrick made sure of looking sad enough to convince anyone of what had befallen to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and yet the CEO didn\u2019t seem truly perturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man entered the rooms, wearing a full hazmat suit, James noticed right away that the old man was rather excited and lively for one who had been just informed of the demise of his most precious player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, James played his part to the best of his capacities, he even showed Sergio to the guy, telling him that Sergio too seemed to be falling under the same fat of Cristiano, although, he was faring a bit better and so they hoped for a recovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, after all the followers of the CEO left the room that had once hosted Cristiano, the old man turned upon Podrick, taking him apart and speaking to him in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, James\u2026 May I call you James?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sure, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. You see, James. Most people think I\u2019m a baffling buffoon. Someone that has all the power but knows not how to use it wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too, for example, have thought that this\u2026this charade was going to be enough to fool me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know what you did. And I know that Cristiano is still alive, secluded somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was baffled and stunned. He tried to say something, anything, but the old man shut him up with a gesture of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now\u2026let me finish. Did you really think you could do something in here, without people telling me what you were doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there is no reason to worry. Instead, I wanted to give my congratulations to you for a job well done. I, sincerely, have no idea why you find fattening up these guys so fascinating, but it doesn\u2019t matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time that Cristiano Ronaldo was\u2026out of commission\u2026 Not only we managed to hire new younger players who shows a lot of promises but, thanks to this \u2018Illness\u2019 we hadn\u2019t to spend a penny for his Contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you can see, you\u2019ve done us a huge favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly, I wish for you to keep doing it. I\u2019ll personally grant you, and your staff, all the funds you may need to keep people under your care, for as long as you want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short list of names will soon be provided to you, targets that you will have to\u2026work your magic upon. Nobody will put the nose in what you do, as long as the people on that list will be taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m especially surprised at how you\u2019ve dealt the situation of Mr. Ronaldo. I was expecting to see him in here, all blobby like and yet, you managed in a few days to have him out of here and with forged papers stating his death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonderful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, at this point was stunned into silence. All of his silent jobs, trying to be as stealthy as possible, and yet the old man had known it all along. Even more worrying still, the guy wanted him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was this, a dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 Sir? With\u2026with all due respect\u2026what should I\u2026I mean, how should I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. As I said a list will be given to you. How you acquire the persons on that list will be up to you but, to seal the deal, you must make sure that none shall be wiser about what\u2019s going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne word to the media and\u2026if we go down, you\u2019ll be coming with us.<br>\r\nClear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Crystalline\u2026Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! Now, Enjoy the rest of your day. We will fax you the list within the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the old man, the CEO, left the room, James literally crumbled upon a chair. He still couldn\u2019t believe that the guy was aware of what he was doing and, even more stupefying, he was allowing him to continue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, his targets were going to be specific but, he could keep doing what he had for the past year. And, most importantly, as soon as the situation calmed down, he could bring back Cristiano!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking about that, the printing machine came to life, printing out a simple paper sheet with some names on it. There were no markings, no indications. Only those names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome he recognized them immediately, after all they belonged to famous soccer players. Others, instead, he noticed were of a few girls, probably partners of said soccer players and then, at the bottom of the list, even a few managers of their own group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he scrolled through the list, he wondered how he should approach them and, most importantly, from whom was better to start\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As per instruction received there was no real order that he had to follow in order to reach his target. Due to that and, considering the closeness that one soccer player had had in particular with Cristiano Ronaldo, he finally decided to set his target on Paulo \u201cLa Joya\u201d Dybala. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following days, as James made sure that Sergio Aguero was still being taken care from the nurse assigned to him, he began to lay down his plan.

With the hidden assistance of the top management it was child\u2019s play to make it believable that Paulo was showing symptoms similar to the alleged ones related to Mr. Ronaldo\u2019s case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a week, Mr. Dybala found himself sitting in a spartan white room with Podrick sitting in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? They\u2019ve told me to make myself available for a private meeting here but, nobody explained me exactly what the meeting is about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, offering a cup of coffee to the player, smiled at him as he checked his papers for a bit and then, finally addressed the player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Dybala, may I call you Paulo? Thanks.<br>\r\nSo, Paulo, you\u2019ve been called here due to the results of your last medical examinations. Apparently, something out of the ordinary was found within your organism and, after more in depth checks, it was confirmed that you seem to be suffering from the initial symptoms of a rare, and yet extremely virulent, illness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, God! Am I going to die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026Well, in truth, it shouldn\u2019t be that grave of an illness, at least in the early stages of it. Do you recollect of what has befallen to Cristiano Ronaldo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, Dybala, looked puzzled for a moment until he answered back.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026As I recall he had been removed from the roster due to a sudden malady that forced him to be placed in isolation\u2026recently heard he was risking his life but, apparently, they managed to stabilize him somehow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames grinned within himself. Thanks to the CEO support, the lie that Cristiano had died quickly changed into he had risked to die, until they managed to save him by his hairs. Forcing them to keep him secluded somewhere, until a cure was ready for him. This way, in the future, James could easily access to the mountainous blob of a man he had created. But, now, he had to focus on the new target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, exactly so. I\u2019m Podrick, James Podrick. I\u2019ve been following Cristiano as he fell prey of this illness, trying my best to have him to follow the medical advices we received in order for him to recover from the illness but, alas, Mr. Ronaldo kept thinking that he knew better and the situation evolved as we know it today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Paulo, seem to be affected by the early stages of the same illness that Cristiano had. Due to this, and to the fact that I\u2019m somewhat immune to it, I\u2019ve been assigned to you so that you can receive the best treatments and advices in order to avoid the direst consequences of this illness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sorry to inform you, also, that starting from this moment, you will be relocated in a secluded facility with no connection to the outside, your family has been already informed but you shall not have any contact with any of them, except through me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo seemed stunned by the turn of events. He at first didn\u2019t believe a word of what this man was telling him but, as the guy kept talking about Ronaldo\u2019s situation, the more Paulo began to be afraid. He wasn\u2019t sure what was going on but, everything seemed too official to be just a joke. Still, he had to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2019re joking, right? Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid not, Paulo. The threat here is very real. I can understand how overwhelmed you may feel, Cristiano had been feeling the same but, I can assure you that this is no joke. Most importantly, if not treated correctly, the illness may advance of its stages pretty quickly becoming a serious menace for your health. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is for this reason that I urge you, once again, to follow the prescribed treatment under my care, so to avoid the advancing of the illness to a more dangerous stage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Paulo, seemed to deflate in defeat. If it was really such a dangerous situation he was in, what could he do but comply to what Mr. Podrick was telling him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026God\u2026Ok, I\u2026I\u2019ll do what I have to\u2026I\u2019m in your hands, Mr. Podrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me James, and don\u2019t worry Paulo. I\u2019ll do my utmost to help you overcome this situation, as well as try to make your permanence in the facility as comfortable as I can. If you ever shall need of something, let me know and I\u2019ll do my best to provide it to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, James escorted the soccer player to the renovated structure that was now going to be used only by Podrick and his \u201cill\u201d patients. In the week that had taken to plan the fall of Mr. Dybala, the entire building was renovated, providing to every needs and comfort for those that were going to inhabit the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more restricted to a single floor, Podrick had now at his disposal an entire five floor building, with four wings, giving him no less than twelve apartments, three on each floor, where his patients could reside for as long as James dictated. One wing of each floor was going to be dedicated to the staff that was going to be following each patient and, the top most floor given mostly to those that were going to take care of all general services, as catering, laundry and similar, and of course, to James penthouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paulo saw the place where he was going to live he stood dumbfounded by the luxury of it, often turning around giving Podrick a puzzled look as more and more of the lavish apartment was revealed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre\u2026Are you sure we\u2019re in the right place? I mean\u2026it\u2019s not that I expected a three-star place but this\u2026this seems beyond the five-star!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPaulo\u2026\u201d James said \u201cAs I said to you before, despite the illness that has befallen you, we truly are trying to let you stay in the most relaxing and comfortable place we can provide. So, yes. This is all true and will be yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, I must warn you that the treatment to assess and cure your malady, can be pretty harsh. Especially or someone used to certain rhythms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn example? Starting from today, a strict \u2018No Exercise rule\u2019 is in place. Physical activity is often a trigger for the advance to more harmful stages of the illness. Your mealtimes and snack times will be provided by a group of dietitians who has followed closely Cristiano\u2019s illness and you will have to comply to what they will schedule for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are only a few examples, but I think you\u2019ve got the idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, seating on a nearby sofa, turned his stare upon the figure of James, sitting quietly on a nearby chair, as he realized that what was happening was really true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026it is true. I... I was still thinking that maybe this was all a joke\u2026a test of some sorts\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames moved closer to the player, closing his hand on the guy shoulder, gently squeezing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Paulo, but yes. It is all true. Unfortunately, you are in a dangerous situation and the Company is doing all it can to save you from reaching a critical situation. All we can do is follow the treatment they will provide you and take the medicines they will order you to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, before I forget. Here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then brought forward an unmarked bottle, containing a hundred or so, of small blue and white pills, leaving it in the hands of the player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026these are the first batch that the doctors told me to give you. You\u2019ll have to take two of those before every meal, swallowing them with a glass of water. As they said, these will soon become your staple, for at least the first few weeks of your permanence here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeeks!? You mean I\u2019ll have to stay here for more than\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. We hope to keep you isolated for the shortest time but, considering how virulent the illness is and how resistant it is to pharmaceutical treatments, it may take a few months before you\u2019re allowed to leave the premises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, utterly destroyed by the news, simply stared at the floor, as Podrick took his leave, reminding him that he was always available, no matter the time, if he needed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust pick the phone and dial \u2019 5 5 5 \u2018 and I\u2019ll come to you as fast as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Podrick left the player to adapt to his new home for the next few months, he smiled widely knowing that thanks to the appetite enhancers he had given to him, the guy was going to be ravenous at every meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left Paulo\u2019s room he quickly went to check on Sergio, finding the guy in a deep sleep onto his bed. As he moved closer, he saw that the guy was stuffed up to his gills, as he let out trembling breaths in between of burps. By eye estimation, Sergio had to be already at around 500 lbs, if not more. His overall form had grown quite a bit, with his belly creating an apron like avalanche of fat tissue over his crotch, his face was the most remarkable feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks were soft and cascading onto his neck, fighting for space with his third chin, his eyes constantly forced to be squeezed, forcing him to squint around without being able to fully look around and then, his lips. His mouth was so covered in fat, surrounded by it that, for sure, he wasn\u2019t able anymore to speak normally but was forced to grumble his requests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James enjoyed the view, he reminded himself to grant a bonus to Susan, the girl had done an amazing work with Sergio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only to decide who he was going to visit first in the coming morning\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James, in the end, decided to let Sergio Aguero in the care of Nurse Susan, while he and the other Nurse would focus instead of Paulo Dybala. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning came, first thing he did was to collect the fake papers that he had asked to be prepared to confirm Paulo Dybala\u2019s situation, in case the player happened to resist to his lies. Then he moved through the building until he reached the apartment of the player and, upon entering the place he saw that Paulo had just met with his personal Nurse. As James entered the room, in fact, Paulo was sitting on his bed, amiably chatting with Nurse Nastassja, as she handed him quite the rich breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the player lap, in fact, was lying a tray with five one-inch thick pancakes, drowned in chocolate syrup and melted butter, while right beside that plate another one was filled with fried bacon strips and fried eggs. To close the meal, two milkshakes were on the nearby bedpost. Seeing as the nurse was taking great care in doing the talking as she, gently and slowly, fed the player, James swiftly returned from where he came, deciding to wait a few minutes before entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, the door to Paulo\u2019s room opened and out came the Nurse, smiling widely, as she conspiratorially leaned in toward James, making sure to let him see that the tray and both shakes were empty. As Podrick entered the apartment again he made sure to cough loudly so to make his presence known to the player, watching with a little smile as the guy seemed to be enjoying his stuffed stomach very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Paulo. Hope you\u2019ve had a good night sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026Hey, Sir. Y-Yeah\u2026it was...good, I guess...\u201d as he composed himself, trying in vain to cover his stuffed belly with his too short shirt, the player turning red for the embarrassment, and yet, seeing as Podrick seemed unaware of anything, he quickly relaxed and acted more normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Sir, what news have you got for me? I have, really to stay here for weeks\u2026if not months?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. In fact, right this morning I\u2019ve received the diet plan and medical treatment you\u2019ll have to follow as the doctors will try to find a permanent cure for this illness. Here, is all in these documents, if you want to check\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paulo took the papers, he didn\u2019t seem as upset as he had been the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, Paulo, have you met the Nurse that will be following y\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Uh\u2026I mean\u2026yeah\u2026eh eh\u2026I\u2019ve met her this morning\u2026she seems a nice girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly the best for you guys. Still, I\u2019m not here only to chit chat. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve also to let you know how your daily schedule will be from now on, unless new updates will arrive from the Medical dept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from today you will follow a four meal per day treatment, which will be served by Nastassja, your personal nurse, whom will also be at your disposal for any additional request you may have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time, or when you will need it, I will also come to assist you in following additional medical therapies as soon as the Doctors will inform me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, now starting to feel the effect of the heavy breakfast didn\u2019t seem to take great care in James words, as he nodded to him a few times before falling asleep in a well-earned digestive nap. As Paulo slept, James called to his side the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you gave him, apart from the breakfast, also the pills, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, a slender example of feminine beauty, with long dark braided hair, smiled as she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Sir. A matter of few minutes after and he didn\u2019t need coaxing to clean out the tray. Will I be taking care of him, Sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you will. One thing though. Although I appreciate the results brought forward from your colleague, I would prefer not to have Paulo here, to follow the same path of submission that Sergio is taking with Susan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse, as she turned to Paulo, caressing his face delicately, and then his stuffed belly, whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, Sir. I\u2019ll be gentle with this one\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later, Paulo woke up slowly, feeling a bit groggy. As he woke up properly, he looked down and saw that his belly had greatly reduced in size, sig that his large breakfast had been completely digested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mind eased by the disappearance of the bloated stomach he grabbed the papers that the coach had brought him and began reading them, starting to realize that the prescribed activities in there didn\u2019t seem very healthy. Still, the signature on the bottom was the one of the Medical dept. Chief so, he couldn\u2019t really refuse to follow them, and yet, it was all so very strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man, four main meals each day\u2026plenty of snacks pauses throughout the day\u2026no exercises\u2026Basically they want me to stay here in bed all day long and eat what they bring me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t seem the classic diet but, I guess, this illness isn\u2019t a common one\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was going through the papers more in detail, he heard the door of his apartment open up and, looking in that direction he saw the nurse he had met that same morning, coming toward him while pushing before her a small-ish trolley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey\u2026I guess this is one of the\u2026snack times, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight you are, Sir. It\u2019s mid-morning snack pause. I\u2019ve got here something for you to have right away and a few things to tide you up until lunch time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse moved closer to the bed, Paulo could smell a marvelous aroma coming from that trolley and, without noticing it, he began to slightly drool in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore that Sir, there are the vitamins you\u2019ve got to take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, she gave to him three pills, same as the ones he had that same morning, and to wash them down she gave him also a tall glass filled with milkshake. Paulo, partially following the medical instruction and, partially, in awe of the girl before him, rapidly took the pills and drank all the milkshake quickly, before adjusting himself against the back of the bed in order to be more or less seated with his back against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, the nurse left on his lap a tray as big as the one received in the early morning, and yet this time there was a small bowl filled with donut holes, a plate of butter cookies and a similar plate with a slice of chocolate cake and two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. Alongside of these, there were also another two tall glasses of milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Sir\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, as surprised as he was for the large quantity of food in front of him, began to actually feel pretty hungry and so, began eating, quickly clearing out the donut holes and the cookies, taking then a breather to wash it all down with the first shake. As he ate, his belly began anew to bloat out and yet, thanks to the nurse gently rubbing it, he barely noticed any distress from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as he began eating the slice of cake, he began to feel himself pretty much full, not used to eat as much sugary goodies in one sitting. Nastassja was there to assist him, though, as she gently took the spoon from his hand and began to gently feeding him the rest of the cake slice and the remaining ice-cream, as she also kept rubbing his taut belly with one hand, easing his discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the tray was cleared, Paulo felt himself stuffed to the gills once again, idly promising himself to not overeat this much again\u2026although the gentle touch of the girl beside him left him feeling nice and not too much burdened by pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, Sir. Now, a few more vitamins for you to take, these ones will slowly work into your body, easing it and making you feel much better, you\u2019ll see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, feeling drowsy once again, didn\u2019t question it and quickly swallowed the new pills, barely noticing that they were different from the ones he had taken before the mid-morning snack, washing them down then, with the last shake the girl had given to him. As he felt himself fall asleep one more, he barely heard the girl telling him that he was going to leave a few treats for him, if he should have felt hungry before lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastassja, instead, watched with rapt fascination as Paulo fell asleep once more, forced by his body in order to speed up the digestion process of the large meal he just had. Quickly she left beside him a large bowl filled to the brim with cream filled donuts and a similar bowl chocked full of assorted chocolates, knowing well enough that, with the additional appetite enhancer she had given to him, although less potent than the ones she had given him prior the meal, he for sure was going to keep eating all morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the room, letting Paulo to enjoy his much needed rest, she could only eagerly wait for lunch time to come, just to be back at his side, watching him stuff himself full of all those calories he was going to need to grow big and fat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he took the first bite to the chocolate bar he was holding, a smile appeared on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t read the brand of the treat he was eating but, it was by far the most delicious thing he ever had. Speeding up, he began to take larger and larger bites, smearing his lips with chocolate, uncaring of how uncouth he may seem to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man\u2026This thing is delicious\u2026I\u2019ll have just one more\u2026 and maybe another one next\u2026Then I\u2019ll stop\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, he didn\u2019t stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything else he began grabbing those bars with both hands, stuffing his mouth with both bars at once, as he felt the pleasant feeling of his stomach filling up, and yet, his hunger didn\u2019t seem to be cinched at all. It was only when his hand moved to the pile to grab another bar, finding it empty, that he stopped. And yet, as he burped loudly in satisfaction, as his belly rumbled hungrily, Nastassja made her appearance bringing with her a couple of trolley\u2019s loaded with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir? It\u2019s lunch time. Can I come in?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026*urp*\u2026come forward\u2026I\u2019m rather famished\u2026today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is good, Sir, a healthy appetite is the sign of a healthy body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse approached the player, he stared silently at her, as she began to place tray upon tray on the bed and on his lap, as the bed began to be covered in plates and platters. Before he could feast, however, she handed him the three vitamins pills he was getting used to take before each meal. As soon as he had swallowed them, she began laying on him the platefuls of food he was going to be having as lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, today, as per your program, Lunch will consist in the following servings\u2026<br>\r\nAs a starter, we have a dozen chicken nuggets with a side of fries, all surrounded by BBQ sauce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, while listening to his nurse, already was grabbing the small-ish nuggets and fries, stuffing his face with them as he softly moaned for the taste spreading into his mouth, as he pushed handfuls upon handfuls of both into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Then, as first course, we have fried pork noodles, with ham and fried eggs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paulo cleaned the nuggets in record time, he began assaulting the plate that the nurse left in front of him, taking massive forkful of the noodles, fueled by the growing hunger he was feeling deep within himself, unaware of how his belly was filling up as more and more food was being pushed in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst second course, pork steak in a buttery sauce, a chinch of wine added in to give it a bit more flavor, with a side of roasted potatoes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, burping loudly in satisfaction, his senses overridden by the delectable flavors on his taste buds, licked clean in record time the noodles, and the he proceeded to demolish the rather large steak awaiting him, helping himself to the sauce, as soon as the steak had been consumed, with a loaf of sweet bread.<br>\r\nAt this point, although massaging his own belly with one hand, the player didn\u2019t seem to be fazed by the fact that his toned abs seemed to have vanished, replaced by a growing softer middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond second-course, a six-eggs stuffed omelet, with cheese on the top and filled with a mix of beef and pork cuts of meat, all coated together in a sauce similar, and yet more delicate, of the previous course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paulo cut the large omelet, he could see the sauce dripping out from the middle of the omelet, the arome coming from it only fueling his hunger and desire for having a taste of that delicacy. As soon as he had the first mouthful he found himself ensorcelled by that taste. With a furious pace he rapidly glutted on the omelet, clearing the plate clean in a record time, as he huffed and burped in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all\u2026 so good\u2026 give praise\u2026to the Chef\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, Sir. As Mr. Podrick says, only the best for you\u2026 Now, Sir, it\u2019s time for dessert\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she didn\u2019t say a word as she left a plate with a large quarter of a chocolate cake right under the player eyes. The massive sweet was covered in a thick chocolate coating, and inside it was made mostly of chocolate with paper thin divisors made of some kind of cookie crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, although starting to feel full, and yet still so hungry, he quickly took a forkful of the massive slice and loudly moaned as his tastebuds were overloaded with pleasure as he tasted the cake. No matter how full he felt, he began scooping larger and larger pieces from the cake, relishing every second of that delectable taste within his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his fork scratched against the empty plate he seemed to wake up from the reverie, feeling full and yet, not completely satisfied. Before he could utter a single word, though, Nastassja left under his nose a new plate, offering him a platter with a dozen donuts, some covered in sugar and sprinkles and some cream filled. The guy, flashed her a thankful smile and resumed his eating, finally starting to feel contently full and a bit stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastassja was watching the soccer player eating with attentiveness and, as soon as he cleared the last donut, seeing him as he breathed out in tiredness, she took the empty plate and tried to coax him into continuing by leaving a new plate in front of him, giving him a few gooey chocolate brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, would you like some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I really\u2026 shouldn\u2019t\u2026already overdone it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Sir, you\u2019re in need of your energies. The Illness might\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I understand but\u2026I feel so full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as full as he felt, with the treats so close to him, enticing him, he could barely resist the temptation to give in and enjoy. Plus, Nastassja, he noticed, seemed to be quite intrigued with him and he thought that she may remain somewhat deluded if he was to refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026J-Just this once\u2026though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiredly, he took the first brownie and brought it to his lips, biting into it he felt the gooey chocolate spread within his mouth, filling his taste buds with pleasure. Moaning softly, he tried to bring what remained of that treat to his lips but found himself too tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as he was trying to keep going, the nurse began to bend over him, gently feeding him the chocolaty treats, one by one, giving Paulo time to chew and swallow until he finally fell asleep, stuffed to the gills. As Nastassja cleaned him out, and took away the empty plates, she took her time caressing and massaging his bloated and taut belly, as she wished to see him growing bigger and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day, a sort of routine started to form for Paulo Dybala. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hunger enhancers slowly worked within his system, he began to feel perpetually hungry, forcing him to almost constantly snack through the day, going full on at the main mealtimes. But it wasn\u2019t only his stomach that was pushing him forward, it was also the presence of the nurse, which seemed to be growing more and more attached to him. And yet, as he passed his days lazily on the bed, stuffing himself up at every occasion, it wasn\u2019t long before he began to notice that his clothes seemed to be growing rather tight on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he denied that fact, forcing himself to believe that they had just provided him with a wrong sized PJ then, as the discomfort grew, he lied to himself saying that they had been just shrunk in the washing machine. But, after two weeks of constant indulging and plentiful meals, something had to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost midnight and Dybala was currently finishing his late night snack. In truth, by the sheer quantity of food he had eaten up to that point, it could have been considered a full-fledged meal, and yet he wasn\u2019t paying attention to that. All his focus was now on the half sheet cake that Nas was feeding him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter that he had eaten himself to stuffing point up until that moment, as the girl offered him that last treat all he wanted, no. All he needed was to have that delicacy within himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouthful after mouthful, his stomach billowed out more and more, filling up even more, growing rounder and higher as more food and calories were being pushed in there. But, as bottomless his hunger could be, the same couldn\u2019t be said for\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Paulo had been in bliss for the last two weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the loving gaze of Nastassja and the endless onslaught of food, he had almost forgot why he was being quarantined in that apartment. Such a gluttonous lifestyle had left its mark, though, on the player. Gone were the trained muscles, the sculpted abs, the toned arms and legs, his entire body had softened up quite a bit under the vast deluge of treats and the constant snacking he did on his own. Already a soft layer of pudge covered every inch of his body, making his face appear softer and pudgy, as well as having a small potbelly sprouting where his abs had once been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the guy didn\u2019t seem to mind, engrossed as he was to enjoy this treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, after a full day of eating, having finished his midnight snack a few minutes before, he found himself pleasantly full, but not yet stuffed. A status which he had gotten used to feel in, one that he was doing all he could to feel again. For this reason, although full after the last official snack time, he didn\u2019t say a word as Nastassja brought to him half of a sheet cake. He had eyes only for the massive cake and, especially for the forkful of it that the nurse was bringing to his lips.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he was fed forkful after forkful, as the feeling of being stuffed to the gills came closer and closer to be reached, Paulo suddenly heard an ominous sound that was starting to make its appearance around him, more and more often. As he kept chewing and swallowing, the creaking sound began to resonate more and more loudly until, as he swallowed one of the last few pieces of the cake, the creaking turned into a ripping sound, as his clothes were torn to pieces by his enlarging middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoking a bit in surprise, as he saw with his own eyes his shirt rip in shreds around his middle, he stopped eating and tried to rise a bit more from the distended position he had on the bed. The nurse too had been affected by the scene, distracted from her duties she could only watch in amazement as both shirt and pants had ripped open, unable anymore to contain the growing girth of the fattening soccer player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, in the past weeks, had constantly lied to himself about his gain. He had consciously decided to forget and ignore those feelings that were warning him of growing fatter and pudgier, but now, having it seen with his own eyes he couldn\u2019t lie to himself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026? What happened? Have I\u2026grown so big\u2026that I\u2019ve ripped\u2026my clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse, seeing that the situation was turning for the worst, tried her best to assuage her charge, to distract him but, met only partial success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Sir\u2026Maybe a pound or two. Nothing to worry too much about. Just last week I\u2019ve told you that we\u2019ve been having issues with the washing machines. Your clothes probably shrunk and have been weakened with further washings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026but still\u2026I can\u2019t let go\u2026myself like\u2026this. Gotta get\u2026in shape\u2026be healthy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the shock was way too recent, the nurse didn\u2019t oppose him, instead, offering aid\u2026from the following morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand how you feel, Sir. I know that it is against the rule but, from tomorrow, I\u2019ll help you doing some exercises if so you wish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...Nas\u2026you\u2019re an\u2026angel\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paulo, proved by the sudden shock and the humongous meal he had consumed, began to fall asleep, the nurse cleaned him of any food stain and let him rest, preparing herself mentally for the following day, to sabotage his plans as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning came, Paulo woke up at around 10 AM feeling refreshed and, already, a bit hungry. The situation he had seen the night before was still within his thoughts but, as he had gone for almost nine hours without any food, it seemed to him almost secondary against the need for a breakfast. He slowly moved within the bed, seating with his back against the wall when the door to his apartment bedroom opened and in came Nas, bringing him his breakfast. Since a couple of weeks had passed already, and with the acknowledgment of Podrick, Nastassja had started the next phase for fattening up the player, as she was bringing him now some news about this diet, along with his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Sir. Did you sleep well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Nas\u2026Yeah\u2026like a log.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. Now, I\u2019ve got your breakfast here but, before we get into that I\u2019ve got some news for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm-mh\u2026Tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Podrick has received words from the medical division, I\u2019ve talked to him about your will to do some light exercise and they have agreed but, including some slight changes in the diet plan you\u2019ll have to follow. Basically, you\u2019re allotted some time during the day for some light exercise but, due to this, your main mealtimes have been increased from four to six per day and your snacking time has also been extended abit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctors understand your will to exercise but, they feel necessary to have you consume enough nutrients during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, enjoy your breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said her piece, she began handing him his trays of breakfast food, passing to him a  tray full of pancakes smothered in butter, chocolaty cupcakes and buttery cookies sprinkled with sugar, then a second tray with one massive platter filled with four fried eggs, a rather large mound of bacon strips and four hot dogs, along with two, tall, shakes and the three pill sized vitamins he had t take before all of his meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paulo began to dig in, feeling his belly demanding for sustenance, he already began to plan for his exercises. With every morsel passing through his lips and falling down his throat, as his soft belly started to fill up, he laid down his exercise schedule into his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, between thinking of doing something, and start doing it, there was a massive difference. <br>\r\nAs Dybala cleaned all the food that Nas had brought to him, he caressed his bloated and stuffed middle for a while, telling himself that in a few minutes he was going to go for a light jog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as time passed, so did his desire of partaking in any exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I should go and run for a bit\u2026but I\u2019ve just ate. I can\u2019t run like this\u2026I should at least wait for my meal to digest a little\u2026But what if I fell asleep?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Paulo began to move toward the side of the bed, putting down both of his legs from it and, slowly, standing up from it. As he did so, he already felt strangely short of breath and yet, he knew he had to do a bit of exercise, even if only for a few minutes. Seeing the soccer player rising from his comfortable position, the nurse grabbed a plate from under the trolley, bringing it closer to the guy<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSir, if I may be so bold, we could try with a simple reward-based exercise. Every few repetitions, I shall give you a reward for your performance. In this way, you shall be able to both exercise and refill the energies you will spend working out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo smiled at the idea and quickly nodded, as his belly grumbled noisily in background, clearly approving the idea. As he stood, his nurse directed him toward the couch, pointing to him to seat there. Clearly confused he did as he was told and tried to pose a question about the routine she wanted him to do but, before he could, she showed him how to do a few reps of some simple exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Sir, extend your arms parallel to the floor\u2026yes, just like that, and bring them up and down. You could start with a three by three series.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, confused a bit by the simplistic exercise, raised both of his arms and then brought them down, feeling curiously embarrassed for doing something so simple. As he was starting to raise them up again, he saw Nastassja place in front of him a large quart of chocolate cake from under the trolley she had stationed nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Job Sir\u2026here\u2019s the reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, although dubious about the true effectiveness of such an exercise, could not deny that between his moving around and his routine of snacking every moment, he was feeling pretty hungry already. So, without waiting anymore, he began digging into the cake reward he had been given. As he munched on it he thought that, maybe there was something good from exercises if this was the rewards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost two hours passed this way, with Paulo doing something as easy as lifting or curling his empty arm and being rewarded with a massive treat. In these hours, only about twenty minutes were spent exercising, the rest of the time he spent it on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, after two weeks of lazily glutting himself, even such an easy activity was extremely tiring for his fatter body. So much so, that as Nastassja told him to stop, he was covered in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026how long\u2026did I\u2026workout?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed, Sir. Two whole hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor someone under such a strict rest-oriented regime, you\u2019ve done greatly on your first session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, Sir, let me help you get back to bed. You must feel absolutely tired after all this work\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the nurse assistance, Paulo managed to return to his bed, tired but satisfied. As he laid down in the bed, catching his breath, he gladly accepted a few more donuts to snack on as lunch was going to roll around in less than an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he had to do now was to follow the diet regime he was on and continue doing these exercise routines with Nas. As he munched on the donuts, he couldn\u2019t be more satisfied of how it had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>A few weeks of this and I\u2019ll get for sure back into in shape! Sure, working out is tiring but, nothing I can\u2019t recover with a few good meals\u2026Mh\u2026I\u2019m feeling quite hungrier than usual. <br>\r\nThe workout must be already working then!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James Podrick was reviewing the security tapes from Dybala\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy, for who knows what reason, had requested to do some exercises a few weeks before. At first James was going to reject the idea, he needed his guest\u2019s fat, not fit. But, as he mulled it over, he realized that thanks to that request he had an opportunity to having the guy grow even bigger. So, he had consented it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstructing Nastassja on which kind of exercises she was going to let the guy perform had been quick, and even quicker had been applying the modification to the player diet. Sure, everyday Paulo Dybala \u2018worked out\u2019, sitting on a comfortable couch, raising and lowering his arms for twenty minutes tops. But for more than one hour and half, the nurse forced on him treats and sweets with the highest content in calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, Paulo was moved from four to six meals a day, including a mid afternoon meal and a midnight feast to his previous schedule, while also increasing the quantities of snacks he had around all day long. This exercise routines had surely boosted the guy ego, but he hadn\u2019t stopped growing, far from it. If anything, he was gaining even faster than before. Due to Paulo\u2019s exercising he was getting hungrier faster and, with the addition of the metabolism reducers and the appetite enhancers, he could barely stay a few moments without eating something big and filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James watched the screen, he could see the guy struggling out of bed. <br>\r\nIt was morning, the usual time when Paulo did his routine. That morning though things seemed to be harder than before on the guy. James drank in the figure of the once soccer player. One month of constant indulgence and chemically induced hunger had managed to turn the fit player into a fat version of himself. Getting toward the 250 lbs, Paulo\u2019s arms had remained mostly the same, as were his legs, although a small layer of pudge was visible. His face had softened up even more, with a second chin making its appearance every time he craned his head. But his torso had taken the brunt of the weight. Once lean and fit, he now sported a pair of moobs which jiggled whenever he moved and a small-ish gut had already started to protrude forward, cutting out of his vision even the point of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, although he had finished his breakfast not so long ago, he was still feeling quite hungry but, he knew that now was time for his morning working out. Slowly, as he felt his legs weighing him down as if they were made of lead, he began to rise from the bed. He didn\u2019t seem worried about feeling himself so heavy on these days, for him it only meant that his muscles were sore from the workout and so he only had to keep exercising. As he managed to place himself on the verge of the bed, Nastassja came forward to help him stand. She had scolded him a few time in the previous weeks for working out too much, forcing her to help him stand but, he took this as a small price to pay to return to his usual shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few steps, she helped him sit on a couch nearby, at first he had thought that the couch had been farther away but, since he always felt tired he told himself that had to be another result of his working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Nastassja had moved the couch closer and closer to the bed, knowing full well that at the rate he was growing, soon he wasn\u2019t going to be able to reach the other room on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Sir. Now, for today\u2019s workout we will work on your hands tendons. For this reason I want you to open your hands at the maximum, wait a few seconds and then close them to a fist as fast as you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo had never heard of these kind of workouts but, had to admit that they really were working wonders for his body, not only he always ended up tired and sweaty, meaning he was doing the right thing to get back into shape, but he also was feeling more and more hungry as he kept exercising, which meant in his mind, that he was consuming a lot of energies. Huffing and puffing, still a bit short of breath from having moved from the bed, he quickly opened and closed his hands, just as hs nurse had shown to him. As soon as he had done it, she gave him a tray with four double bacon cheeseburgers as a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Sir. A good reward for a job well done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, without any ado, began tearing the burgers apart, feeling his rumbly belly getting hungrier by the minute. As he munched on the burgers he seemed to notice the strangeness of such a reward for a so simple exercise but, as used as he had become to have bigger and bigger rewards, he didn\u2019t lost too much time thinking about it choosing to dedicate himself to the food on his plate, instead of worrying about probable nonsense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, so his exercises began to be easier to perform, while the rewards from each repetition grew only bigger in size, due to this Paulo kept growing larger and heavier. But, more importantly, he was reaching that kind of size for which were needed custom clothes for him. Nastassja, to avoid another surge of suspect toward his clothes, had started already to measure him at night, ordering his clothes online but still, week by week, each new dress was getting tighter faster. She knew It wasn\u2019t only due to his \u2018working out\u2019 that he was expanding so rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from the influx of the Rewards, Paulo ate constantly and in massive quantities, indulging especially during the humongous meals he was receiving six times a day. In truth, since he ate with reckless abandon, more than once she had seen him gorge on meals lasting from dawn to the middle of the afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, although busy most of his time thinking about food, had noticed that something seemed wrong. He was now with two months of work out sessions with Nastassja under his belt and yet, as he looked around everything around him seemed to be smaller than him. The same bed that had seemed so huge when he had arrived, now it looked to him as big as normal bed for two people. Also the remote for his TV seemed to have srunk. All these examples told him that something was wrong but, since stuffing himself full had become his favorite activity, he didn\u2019t want to lose too much time dwindling on something so strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastassja had noticed that Paulo was getting confused and, to help him remaining focused on what she deemed important, raised a request to James, request that was happily accepted and readily implemented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, just as Paulo had finished his two-hour long workout session, Nas brought to him an anticipated lunchtime meal, eager to see his reaction to what she and Podrick had prepared only for him. The guy, seeing the most filling meal of his day, as far as he thought it, being anticipated of almost an hour tried to question but, seeing that there were much more trolley\u2019s being moved toward him than what he was used to see, he began drooling unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026already\u2026lunch time\u2026Nas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sir. I hope you\u2019ll find it of your pleasure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t\u2026be any\u2026different\u2026you guys\u2026have the\u2026best cooks\u2026around\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Sir, for your kind words\u2026Here\u2019s the first course\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that she brought onto his gut a massive bowl filled almost to the top with pasta covered in a thick cheesy sauce. From Paulo point of view the massive bowl looked like the usual plate of food he had always received. In truth, the bowl was so massive that had in it enough food for at least three people. Dybala, using a ladle, which he mistakenly confused with a large spoon, began taking massive mouthfuls of pasta, enjoying immensely the delicious taste of the plate, although many large dollops of sauce fell from the ladle every time he brought it to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Sir, the next course\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the now empty bowl, she left in front of him a platter with a veritable pyramid of burgers and hot dogs, each of these were hand made to be three times bigger than their normal size. It had costed them a veritable fortune but, seeing as Dybala began scarfing them down, not anymore worried by their little size was profit enough for both feeders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, from his side was enjoying this meal more than usual. Finally, something that seemed to have remained of the same size he was used to, grabbing one of the burgers with both hands and biting into it, he munched it in silence, happily aware of not having wasted energies on asking about the shinking things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the meal he was having, it had all been in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs five long hours passed, Dybala had finally reached the end of his \u2018Lunch\u2019, having scarfed down enough food to feed an army, his body had bloated up so much that he himself was having trouble seeing what was in front of him. Still, although feeling much fuller than he had ever felt before, when he saw Nas coming to his side, offering him what he thought was a short cake, he couldn\u2019t stop his gluttony from rise to new levels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastassja, trembling with excitement, seeing as the guy had eaten himself almost completely round, could not resist from tempting him with one last treat. Lifting the massive cake with both hands, she moved closer to him and began feeding it to him, feeling more and more enthusiastic as the cake was swiftly demolished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*BURP!* Uff\u2026that...was\u2026a\u2026good\u2026meal. <br>\r\nFeel\u2026strangely\u2026full\u2026though.

As they had shown him the path of the sloth and of the glutton, the guy had adapted to it so fast that it had almost seem a miracle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even Sergio Aguero had been turned so fast into gaining weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano? He at least had tried to fight back at the beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo didn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, probably unsure of himself, probably smitten by Nastassja, had fallen into their trap without raising any fuss, excepted for the working out session he requested. But, even as fake as those were, he never raised any complaint\u2026up until that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same morning, as Nastassja had brought him his breakfast, he told her that had the need to see him. What made the thing worrying was that he didn\u2019t started to eat until the nurse didn\u2019t confirm his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worried James. Paulo was growing so rapidly and to such a size that in a few more months, he could finally enjoy his first soccer player meal. But what if Paulo had realized what they were doing to him? True, he hadn\u2019t many ways of escaping or means to tell anyone, but if the guy managed to get one word out, it would be all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James hurried along the corridors, he managed to calm himself down just in time to enter Paulo\u2019s room. As he knocked and entered, he saw that the guy was lying on his bed boringly watching the television as he ate mindlessly from several snack filled bowls surrounding him. As James approached him, he saw that Paulo had grown larger still since the last time he had checked his weight. Last time he had been around the 250\u2019s, but, standing now beside him, watching his humongous gut rising and falling as he breathed with difficulty, staring entranced to his moobs as they had grown into jiggly, hills full of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his fingers that were growing to look like stuffed sausages, or his legs, having grown to tree trunk size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Paulo Dybala had to be around the 400 lbs now, and wanted something from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026*munch*\u2026Coach\u2026*gulp*\u2026wanted to\u2026speak with\u2026you about\u2026a few\u2026things\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, Paulo. If there is something I can help you with\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about\u2026my\u2026hunger. I\u2019m\u2026always hungry\u2026nowadays\u2026and yet\u2026meals\u2026 are getting\u2026 smaller and\u2026 shorter\u2026 is there\u2026a change\u2026in the\u2026diet? Also\u2026although\u2026.I do\u2026the work out\u2026sessions\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026seem\u2026to see\u2026much\u2026improvements. Can I\u2026ask for\u2026some more\u2026intensive\u2026training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see.<br>\r\nYes, Paulo, we received a request from the Medical division to reduce for some time your meals. It was a test of theirs to see how the Illness is advancing\u2026if at all. Starting from this afternoon, your meals will return to the normal schedule, I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you should be happy to know that, thanks to the diet and regime you\u2019re following, the Illness seems to be slowing down on its advance against your system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, for your workout session, I don\u2019t think I can do much. <br>\r\nAlready it was a hard battle with them doctors to allow you to do them. Fighting even more about them, could easily have them removed as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat we can try is to extend their duration, if you feel ready for it. Instead of two hours we could try with three\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James said that, Paulo stopped eating and slowly turned his head toward the coach, staring at him with a slow smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026happy\u2026about the\u2026illness\u2026and\u2026I think\u2026I can\u2026do longer\u2026workouts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, Happy to have helped, although I couldn\u2019t do very much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more\u2026thing\u2026would be\u2026possible\u2026to have\u2026more\u2026energy\u2026shakes? I\u2019m\u2026often\u2026feeling\u2026very\u2026tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames moved closer to the massive ex player, patting him on the shoulder, enjoying how squishy the contact felt against his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem at all. You just need to ask or let me know if you need anything. I\u2019ll make sure that, starting tomorrow, Nastassja brings you\u2026let\u2019s say, six shakes every five hours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo\u2019s smile grew a bit larger, his belly already rumbling in pleasure, although he never stopped bringing more and more delicacies to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026*munch*\u2026.Coach\u2026.*gulp*\u2026for\u2026everything\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs James left the apartment he couldn\u2019t refrain from almost collapsing against a wall in the corridors. As big as he was getting, as much as he was eating, Paulo still thought of his portions to be small  and his mealtimes shorts? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames couldn\u2019t believe it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Maybe, it\u2019s better if we stop giving him the appetite enhancers for a while and see how well he performs without them within his body.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he mentally noted that, he also added to double the order for the weight gain shakes to be brought to him everyday, under the disguise of energy shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>My god\u2026How big will he end up? Will he get as big as Cristiano\u2026or even bigger? No, focus James. Three more months and then he will be my meal. I deserve it.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing back to his room, James quickly verified how heavy Paulo had gotten. Quickly checking with the digital wifi scale mounted within his bed, he stared speechless to the numbers on screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>462 lbs! This is his current weight !? <br>\r\nTrue, gotta take out ten or so pounds off this number due to the still undigested food into his belly but, my god\u2026he\u2019s getting huge! And he wants even more to eat\u2026I can\u2019t wait for these three months to pass\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, I need to rearrange his schedule as he asked\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days passed, with his meals getting bigger and longer, with all the weight gain shake he was drinking on a daily basis, Paulo Dybala\u2019s working out session reached a point of no return. As he prepared himself to move from the bed toward the couch, he wasn\u2019t really sure he wanted to keep working out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit that for a while it had seemed to be working but, lately, he wasn't seeing any improvement coming from it. He had tried for a bit to increase the time, as Podrick suggested, but it didn\u2019t seem to work. What Paulo wasn\u2019t able to see was that although he nominally exercised for three hours, he spent only ten minutes doing something that could barely be considered as exercise. The rest of the time it was only him being fed by Nastassja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, on that morning, as Nas moved closer to the bed to help the humongous obese guy to leave his bed, he decided to stop entirely with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I must\u2019ve reached my plateau weight. Can\u2019t seem to lose more than this. Oh, well\u2026it has been fun until it lasted.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, ready for your workout?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMph\u2026not\u2026today\u2026Nas\u2026not\u2026feeling\u2026about\u2026it. Would you\u2026please\u2026bring me\u2026 some snacks\u2026though? Am getting\u2026quite\u2026hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>It\u2019s true\u2026apart from eating, I don\u2019t seem to be capable of doing much else. I wonder why\u2019s that? Workout did work at first, so I\u2019ve got to have lost some weight\u2026and yet\u2026Can\u2019t manage to lose more weight than this.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a couple of weeks passed, Paulo began to notice that something was strange indeed. He had thought that the workout had been working since he felt tired all the time. And yet, now that he wasn\u2019t doing it anymore, not only he felt tired the same but, also, he was starting to find harder to move his arms or his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling curious about this phenomenon he began to watch carefully what happened all around of him. As he drank the energy shakes, he noticed that he needed much more of them than before to feel the rush of energy through his body. As he gorged at his meals he soon realized that he was spending, on average, since some time he got distracted, more than four hours to clean each one. And he also saw that, not only his bed was still shrinking down, but also Nas appeared much smaller than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed it a few times as she brought to him one of his plates, which he thought to be right sized for him but, in Nastassja hands it seemed to be huge. But what set him off the most was himself. He could have sworn that, when he had just arrived, he was able to watch the TV by laying down, whereas now he was forced to lay with his back against to wall, otherwise he couldn\u2019t see the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he kept following the regime, he tried to mull it over, to find something that would make it believable for him to ask around. He didn\u2019t want to appear crazy to both Podrick or Nastassja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as things and persons around him kept shrinking down compared to him, he began to think that maybe, since it was a strange new illness, it could be a symptom of something far more serious. Suddenly afraid for having been so foolish about not informing anyone about this, considered his conditions, he called his nurse to him and asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNas? There is\u2026something I\u2026 need to\u2026 tell you.<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t\u2026want to\u2026 sound\u2026 crazy, so\u2026. I stayed\u2026 silent\u2026 but\u2026 considering\u2026my situation\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t\u2026want to\u2026 make matters\u2026 worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately\u2026 I\u2019ve\u2026 noticed that\u2026 apart from\u2026 the food\u2026 everything\u2026. around me\u2026 you included\u2026 seems to be\u2026 shrinking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I\u2026hallucinating\u2026or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastassja, not knowing how to respond called Podrick, which, understanding the situation hurried to Paulo\u2019s room, ready to defuse the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPaulo\u2026you should have said it sooner\u2026you\u2019ve got to trust us. We only want to get you back on your feet and into the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I\u2019ve got to tell you that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A doctor will be coming in the next few days to give you a more thorough check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of now, they're not sure why you\u2019re having these hallucinations. In any case, what they suggested to do is to continue with the regimen you\u2019ve been treated so far, although including a few more vitamins and some more calories into your diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, please Paulo, let us know beforehand next time. We were lucky that the Medical division were already aware of this possibility, otherwise it could have gone terribly wrong\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Podrick, giving a few pats to Paulo, left the room leaving the obese guy only with the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026sorry\u2026Nas\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled at the guy, giving him a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sir, we understand how you\u2019re feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, let\u2019s not make a bigger issue of this, alright? Now, how about a snack to ease your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she left the room, quickly returning with a few trolley\u2019s trailing behind her. As she neared the massive guy she began surrounding him with platters filled with food. Paulo began drooling as he saw quite large trays filled to the brim with massive sized burgers, hot dogs and even, he could barely believe it, am entire fried chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as he might, although he had managed to sit with his back on the wall, he could not reach any of the platters that were surrounding him. Luckily for him, Nastassja was still beside him and she began to bring tray after tray nearer to him. With a guttural moan, Paulo began to grab burger after burger, keeping them tightly within his hands, as he munched through them as fast as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating like a savage, letting his hunger taking the wheel, bits of food began to fall on both himself and his bed. The guy didn\u2019t seem to mind as he swallowed each bite, only to give an even bigger one on the next treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse stood there, watching raptured Paulo as he gorged through the massive meal sized snack she had brought him, wondering how could he not be aware of how much he was eating. For hours, Dybala kept eating, gobbling up whatever was around him, even mixing fast foods and dessert altogether, until he seemed to reach his stopping point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse noticed that out of the trays she had brought him only one had been barely touched. Lifting it from the bed, she moved it closer to the engorged guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, care for a few more pancakes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Ouarp!*I\u2026I\u2026really\u2026don\u2019t know\u2026if I\u2026can\u2026feel\u2026so full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastassja, though, knew that by giving him enough time she could convince. For this reason, she moved the tray even closer, letting the aroma from the platter to reach Paulo\u2019s nostrils. The guy, although he was feeling full, as he sniffed the tantalizing smell, couldn\u2019t refrain from feeling his hunger awakening deep within himself, forcing him to stuff himself even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I really\u2026oh\u2026a few\u2026 more\u2026wouldn\u2019t\u2026hurt\u2026right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you are correct, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hand-fed him pancake after pancake she could see he wasn\u2019t joking when he had said that he was full, his gut, fully bloated and round as a balloon, pushed more and more out as she placed the last few pancakes within his lips, until the tray was empty and Paulo was way more than stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Job, Sir. Now have a rest, I\u2019ll return later with your dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of days passed without any further trouble. Under Nastassja supervision Paulo Dybala was left stuffed to the gills at his every main meal, while the gluttonous guy kept eating throughout the days snacking by himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was five days later that James entered Paulo\u2019s room, before his mid-afternoon meal, informing him that the doctor from the medical division had arrived. As Paulo collected himself, as much as he could, Podrick opened the door to the supposed \u2018Doctor\u2019. This one was none other than another feeder hired on the spot by James to fill the role of medic, as well as try and speed up the gain of the already obese Paulo as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, sweating a bit from the nervousness, was soon left alone with this guy entirely covered in a hazmat suit. The guy moved a few steps forward, before presenting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Mr. Dybala. I\u2019m Doctor Joshua Fleming, I\u2019ve been informed that lately you\u2019ve been suffering from hallucinations, seeing things smaller than they actually were. Is that correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026it is\u2026correct\u2026.Doc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Doctor got closer and closer, he kept talking to the guy, chatting with him trying to keep him at ease, until he managed to calm him down from the visible nervousness that was shaking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Paulo, I need to do a few exams and to ask you a few questions. Can I? If you\u2019re not feeling at ease we can recall this meeting and the division will send someone else. I want you to be comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026we\u2026can\u2026proceed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Tell me, then, how many meals you have each day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, trying as hard as he could not to stuff his mouth with the food surrounding him managed to answer as best as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 at six\u2026 main\u2026 meals\u2026 per\u2026 day. <br>\r\nAnd I\u2026 snack on\u2026 something\u2026 every so\u2026 often\u2026 through\u2026 the day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMh. Next question, at what time of day you get most often sweets and sugary treats?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doctor kept asking him question, he prodded and touched the massive body of the ex-soccer player, staring in amazement at how deep his hands sagged within the belly fat of the guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis procedure kept going for almost an hour, until the doctor moved aside, calling toward the door for Podrick to enter the room. As James sat beside the massive Paulo, the doctor gave his results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, these are only initial tests, we shall analyze blood and cellule samples to have a most precise answer. As I\u2019ve seen, though, there are no physical trauma\u2019s that could have caused the hallucinations. For the moment I would suggest to ignore them and carrying forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I must admit that I\u2019m surprised to hear that Mr. Dybala here has been following a diet of only six meals per day. As per his physical condition I would suggest to increase it up to eight, if not ten, meals per day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis not only would reducing the snacking but would also grant Mr. Dybala the healthy nutritional amount he needs to let his organism fight the illness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, but take this only as a suggestion, I would say that he needs more sugar and iron in his diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I would suggest an increase in sweets and meat based meals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor made to leave the room, but before doing that he turned once more toward Paulo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you all the best Mr. Dybala. And remember to follow the diet, you are in a critical spot, the minimum loss of calories could have terrible repercussions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they remained alone, James turned toward the fattened guy laying on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPaulo, everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. He\u2019s\u2026 been\u2026 kind. So\u2026 what\u2019s\u2026 in the\u2026 future\u2026 for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stood from his chair, trying to look pensive as he knew already how to answer to the massively obese soccer player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs the doctor said, I think it best to follow his advices. So, we will bring you up to nine meals per day, doubling the main meals of the day and turning snacking time from morning to night into focalized meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from that, I\u2019ll make sure that sugar, proteins and carbs will not be missing anymore from your regimen. Then, we\u2019ll just wait for the medical division to analyze the samples and give us a more precise way to fight this symptom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new diet was implemented Paulo noticed right away that something was going to be different than before. If before he had to snack constantly just to feel himself full for most of the day, with the new mealtimes added into the plan he barely had to since he was just able to stuff himself up to his limits and beyond, almost every three hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, thanks to Nastassja support and assistance, Paulo began to grow even faster than before, much to the pleasure of Podrick which wanted to see how big and fat Paulo could get before being turned into the meal he was destined to be. In barely that week, due to the massive avalanche of high calories foods that were thrown at him, Paulo managed to reach the big 500 and go over it just as quick, stopping his gain at 535 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humongous guy was now finding himself almost immobile on his bed, requiring the assistance of Nastassja more and often and yet, as the nurse kept reminding him, it was the illness that was sucking out all of his energies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, forced on his back to eat massive quantities of food every few hours, could only agree to the nurse, as he kept eating and fattening up. His face had softened up even more, his cheeks puffing out and his third chin completely covering his neck. His arms and legs, too, had started to catch up to the rest of him, growing bigger and jigglier. His moobs, too, had taken quite the brunt of the weight, growing out to be as big as most women\u2019s chests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most impressive had to be his huge gut, constantly engorged, had grown so big and vast that was starting to shift toward his legs, covering his crotch while growing so much in height that he could not see over it when laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept gorging endlessly throughout the week, Nastassja came to him one day to give him some news about the hallucinations he had in the past\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Paulo Dybala didn\u2019t do much after the encounter with the doctor from the medical division, he passed his days laying on his bed, following the diet and, when he managed, looking at the tv screen. His mind focused on only two things, food and television, had already been dulled since his initial arrival but, with the new diet for him to be followed, it slowed down even more; up to the point that he was barely capable of following discussions more complicated than a grocery list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, naturally, worked as an advantage for both Podrick and Nurse Nastassja, although the latter one felt a bit of pity for what had befallen on the once soccer player. Still, the two of them made great care of using this new weakness against the already supersized man. With him following the new scheduled diet, there was barely time for Paulo to snack anymore. Those few moments under which he wasn\u2019t involved into a meal, he was too stuffed to eat anymore. Even those little tricks that Nastassja had often used on him weren\u2019t working anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, for Podrick, the guy wasn\u2019t big enough yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Nurse had been informed that Paulo had reached the 600 lbs, she had thought that Podrick would grant some slack to the overfed Paulo, but it didn\u2019t happen.  When the nurse went to discuss the question with James, she remained shocked in hearing the coach telling her that Paulo wasn\u2019t big enough yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe will force on him a diet based on appetite stimulants and liquid calories, in the form of a weight gain shake. We will feed him continuously, on a daily basis. I\u2019ll provide him with the medical justification and will find something to distract him through the feeding. The most important thing is that Paulo keeps on growing. I would like for him to reach Cristiano, if it is feasible, in the shortest time possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, Nastassja was currently bringing the first breakfast to Dybala. But this time, she was going to bringing him not only food. As Nastassja entered the room, she saw his opulent form sprawled on the massive bed, she noticed right away that he was starting to grow so big and large, that his own body fat was soon going to go over the edge of the bed he was resting upon. Seeing him asleep she decided to check him out first.  Paulo, after having followed the new nine meals a day plan for a week, had grown quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 600 pounds of weight, he was currently losing his humanoid shape, getting closer and closer to resembling a massive sphere with vestigial legs and arms. His face, completely covered in squishy fat, forced him to lay down, unable anymore to even bend his neck, since he barely had one anymore. With four definite chins jutting out under his visage, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to move his head if he tried. His arms, they were so covered in fat, that he was barely able to lift them anymore. Forcing him to keep them constantly close to his face, so that he could bring food to his mouth. His legs too, had inflated with fat, literally rendering him immobile, without considering the enormous apron like gut that covered them up to the knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of this, Dybala seemed oblivious to his current conditions. Constantly stuffed throughout the day, forced to lay back on the bed, barely able to see the television over his engorged mountainous belly, passing his days loudly chewing through the plethora of meals provided to him by Nastassja. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished checking him up, she began crawling on the bed on all fours, trying her best not to hurt the fattened player still asleep. As she neared his face she quickly woke him up with a quick loving peck on the cheek, letting him open his bleary eyes, squinting a bit as his massive cheeks pushed against him, without letting him open his eyes at the fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm..?... Nas? Is\u2026 that... you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sir. I\u2019ve brought you your first breakfast. Although there is something that we need to talk about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026about\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesterday has arrived the results from your medical. The coach told me to inform you that your diet need to be changed some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl\u2026right\u2026what\u2026need\u2026me\u2026to\u2026do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, as per the medical results, you\u2019re simply skinny. Podrick is working on a schedule that will let you reach a healthier weight in the shortest time available\u2026 Otherwise your illness may pass into the next, and more serious, stage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala took the news well enough. Of course, since he wasn\u2019t able to recall a time when he was smaller than how he currently appeared, he took for granted that his size wasn\u2019t really big as he thought it should be. Yet, as food was being discussed, his dulled-out mind   sparkled for a moment, letting him focus a bit more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-How? More\u2026 food \u2026is\u2026 welcome\u2026but\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 know\u2026 if\u2026 can\u2026 have\u2026 even\u2026 more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, you underestimate yourself. You\u2019re just skin and bones. For sure, you can manage to be healthier than this\u2026Look at you, you barely have the energy to move. You\u2019ve got to eat more, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nastassja said that, she grabbed one of his thick belly rolls and shook it a bit, as if that was demonstration enough that he wasn\u2019t yet healthy as he can be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, unable to see what was happening over the massive dome of his engorged gut, could only moan a bit as he felt the touch of the nurse on his body, as his gluttony began to steer his will toward having more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Maybe she\u2019s right. Maybe I\u2019m too skinny. She\u2019s right on something\u2026I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m so weak that I can\u2019t move\u2026but was I able to move before? And if so, why can\u2019t I move anymore? Is it due to this illness they talk about?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse stood by his side as she fed him tray upon tray of massive sized breakfast foods, ranging from pancakes drowned in syrup and butter, to chocolate covered waffles, donuts and, even, a few short cakes. As Paulo glutted himself, he grabbed whatever he could from the tray\u2019s pushing it within his maw, although, after half an hour he found himself utterly tired and unable to move his heavy arms anymore. Nastassja was right beside just for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she saw that he couldn\u2019t move anymore, she began to take massive forkful of his breakfast, feeding them to him, forcing Paulo to constantly chew and swallow until everything had been cleared from the numerous tray\u2019s.  As he laid there, his belly once more engorged and tauter with food, she began caressing it, kneading it a bit, helping his digestion process, as he burped away some small pockets of gas from his intestines. As he began to feel drowsy, she left his side, informing him that for second Breakfast, it was going to be Podrick to help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, just as the sun began to rise at the horizon, James entered Paulo Dybala\u2019s room. As he entered, he saw immediately, through the open doorway, the massive figure of the fattened player laying down on his bed. Moving closer he could see that his belly, although had deflated a bit since the digestion process had already started, remained proudly engorged. Still, as much as James would have loved nothing less than jump himself atop that veritable mountain of lard, he was there for a job. Moving closer to the bed, he began fastening a series of tubes all around the obese player, leaving one end atop his face, while the other end at floor level beside his bed. As soon as he finished, James began to gently prod the player, until he managed to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Paulo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm? *Oarp!*\u2026uh\u2026oh\u2026Sorry\u2026 Coach. Morning\u2026 to\u2026 you\u2026 too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you\u2019ve slept well after your first Breakfast. Now, as Nastassja probably already told you, the results of your medical arrived and we\u2019ve had to reconsider your diet plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyeah\u2026she\u2026told\u2026me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Let me explain to you how it\u2019s going to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from this meal, you\u2019ll be having your meals directly in a liquid form, expressly from this feeding tube over here\u2026 All you will need to do is to place the nozzle into your mouth and swallow whatever comes out of it. For your comfort, there are these two little tubes that you\u2019ll have to place into your nostrils, so that you\u2019ll be able to freely breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo, already feeling his hungry belly rumbling since it hadn\u2019t been fed in few hours, decided he didn\u2019t have time to ask any questions and grabbed the nozzle mask, placing it atop of his mouth, making sure to push the nozzle deep within his maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, James, ecstatically, placed the small tubes into his nose, letting him get used to having them to breathe, before connecting the feeding system to the pump that was going to shoot countless liter of weight gain shake down Paulo\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player, unable to speak by having the nozzle in his mouth, simply nodded slowly as he began to feel the feeding tube tighten within his maw, until a veritable flood of delicious shake began pouring out if it. As soon as the shake was in his mouth, Paulo began swallowing it as fast as he could, getting soon used to its flow and even managing to suppress his gag reflex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, the flow kept coming until Dybala was completely stuffed, until not even one inch of space was available within his digestive tract. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the guy wasn\u2019t aware of was that the machine was programmed to fill him up as soon as some space was freed within his body, rendering him stuffed to the gills all day along, either by day or night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames couldn\u2019t be happier, as he watched Paulo Dybala breaking out of his plateau and starting actively gaining once more. Leaving the nurse to always station nearby Paulo, to read to him or to simply talk to him, he made sure that Paulo would never grow bored, as he kept fattening up at a ludicrous speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a couple of days later, one month short from his scheduled end and Paulo had\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Paulo Dybala was kept constantly interested via interactions with Nastassja, there were moments in his day when he found himself alone. In those instances, as he was now unable to speak due to the feeding tube in his mouth, he could do nothing else but think. And as he thought about his situation, about the fact that two weeks had already passed and still he was attached to the feeding tube, about his limitation in moving around, he realized that something wasn\u2019t right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he had these stray thoughts about himself, which were soon forgotten as soon as Nastassja sat beside him, entertaining him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as time passed, he began to focus on those thought, silencing anything surrounding him, even the nurse words or the flow of the shake passing through his lips. His mind began to wake up from the slumber in which it had ended, returning to work properly as it had been before he was subjected to the \u2018Illness\u2019. And as his mind strengthened, so did his memories, and through this process, he began to remember everything that had happened to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow everything had started, why he was there, on that bed, being fed gallons of shake day after day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Everything started with me resulting positive to an illness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA highly contagious illness to which Podrick and Nas seems to be immune. From there they\u2019ve both started to feed me loads of foods, they\u2019ve told me to take pills to help curb the illness\u2026but I\u2019ve grown only hungrier and hungrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, they provided more and more food to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s strange\u2026what kind of illness requires this many calories pumped into you? <br>\r\nHow would this massive diet plan counteract the fact that Cristiano Ronaldo grew hugely? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless this is all a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut could they do that? Those two on their own, could they be able to make up something like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that\u2019s crazy\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paulo couldn\u2019t believe these thoughts, he didn\u2019t do nothing to stop himself, resulting only in growing fatter and fatter. And yet, as days passed and he saw himself growing wider and heavier, feeling his back being crushed by the sheer weight of his fat, those thought returned stronger and stronger, as he tried to make sense in what was happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I\u2019m growing bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I drink this stuff\u2026 the fatter I become. But why would they do this? What reason could they have to make me as huge as I currently am?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it for the money? No, that can\u2019t be. If money were involved, they would have stopped long time ago, as soon as I wasn\u2019t able to move\u2026instead they push me constantly to grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Nastassja does it! <br>\r\nShe tempts me every day, talking about food and cooking, but why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of interest could drive them to have me grow as big as I am?<br>\r\nYet\u2026doesn\u2019t matter the reason. They\u2019re doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019re fattening me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPodrick said something about a couple of days with this machine\u2026but weeks have passed and yet, I\u2019m still being fed these shakes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m growing huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo big I can\u2019t even see over the massive belly I\u2019ve got\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days kept on passing, bigger and bigger Paulo grew, gaining at breakneck speed, as time passed, he seemed to be growing wider and larger, until he himself felt parts of him he couldn\u2019t see, touching something very cold. Forced to lay back, his head on several orthopedic pillows, his field of vision was restricted by the humongous gut he sported. So, he was unable to see how his moobs had grown so large and massive that, due to gravity, they had fallen on both sides of his bed, ending up against the cold floor of the room he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ass cheeks, similarly, were starting to spread on both sides of him, pushing out of the confines of his bed, getting closer and closer to the floor, as his body added strata upon strata of thick, heavy fat, trying futilely to store the humongous quantities of calories being forced within its confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Paulo began to see his horizon changing, moving from his constantly engorged belly, to a small valley created by his own chins, multiplying all around him as his body hadn\u2019t anymore space to store all those calories he kept swallowing day after day, at that point, Paulo began to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Nastassja, didn\u2019t even notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just so hard to see any difference in the massive blob that had once been Paulo Dybala. Applying this liquid diet to him, made it easier for him to gain weight, since digestion time were mostly halved and, feeding after feeding, quantities kept increasing. Still, after a while, as she at beside his massive engorged body, through the whirring of the feeding machine and the harsh gulping of his own, she began to hear a little sob, every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, she climbed on the bed, forced partially to climb also his body, and then she saw tears escaping his squinting eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly afraid of hi being in pain she contacted Podrick through the internal line and stopped the feeding, fearing that Dybala was crying in pain. When James arrived in the room he stood a moment in an ecstatic reverie. There it was, his soon to be meal, having grown almost as big as Cristiano, laying on his massive bed which, he noticed with a smile, it had broken all four of its legs who knows when. Returning in himself he moved closer to the Paulo\u2019s face, ignoring the almost panicking nurse, as he tried t understand what Paulo issue was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Paulo? Any issues?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2026Y\u2026yheesss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala forced himself to speak, using a tongue that had grown atrophied by haven\u2019t been used for so long, making him croak few words, instead of being able to talk normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.havhe\u2026.prohb\u2026lem\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it? Paulo, please, let me help you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYouhhh\u2026 Youh\u2026is\u2026 prohb\u2026lem\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYouhhh\u2026fatthed\u2026mehh...too\u2026much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy\u2026? Stop\u2026.nohhh\u2026mhore\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James stood from his seat, standing atop the bed, right beside the jiggling mass that Paulo had become, he smiled. Apparently he had been found out by his first guest. As James looked at his creation with pride, for a moment, for a brief moment, he also flashed a grinning leer to Paulo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, you ask, Paulo?<br>\r\nBecause I can. Because I like seeing you unable to stop me. Because I love the feeling of control I have over you. You may be crying now over your old physique, wishing to have it back, deciding to make a stand against me\u2026 But if I were to leave you without food for one hour, you would beg me to satisfy your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstand this, Paulo, I\u2019ve changed you into a Glutton. An hedonist glutton unable to see after his next plate of food, unable to stop, unable to return to your old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purpose behind this? There may be one\u2026but you will find out only when I decide you\u2019ve grow enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as of now, for me, you still have room to grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Podrick was saying that, he moved closer and closer to Paulo\u2019s face, watching raptly as the guy\u2019s tears flew down from his squinting eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCry all you want\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter to me. In these weeks you\u2019ve almost doubled your weight\u2026You\u2019ve grown from the big 600 to an astounding 1.128 lbs. You are one of the very few who managed to reach this size in a, almost, healthy condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you will grow more for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a few hours\u2026as soon as the hunger building inside of you will reach painful levels, it will be you begging me to give you more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I will give you more, enjoying much more knowing that as much as you despise me\u2026you\u2019ll be unable to stop yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, please, take your time. Be angry at me, promise vengeance against me\u2026in the end, you will crawl to me asking for more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only have to wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, laughing maniacally, James moved away from the gigantic blob of fat that Paulo had grown into, from his multiples chins, forcing his head to sunk down amidst of his own fat, to his apron like gut, which covered everything up to his ow feet from view. From those huge sack of lard that had once been moobs, to his own double door wide ass cheeks, overflowing the broken bed he was forced to lay upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of this, as Paulo cried angrily at the betrayal of what he had considered a friend, he realized that Podrick was probably right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I\u2019m so addicted to eating that for real I may have to beg him to give me more of it\u2026But I\u2019ve got to try and resist\u2026even though already  I can feel my hungry gut rumbling in anger, demanding sustenance\u2026<br>\r\nI\u2026.<br>\r\nI have to\u2026<br>\r\nTo\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And yet, the words of the coach still rang in his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<b><i>And in a few hours\u2026as soon as the hunger building inside of you will reach painful levels, it will be you begging me to give you more food.<br>\r\nI only have to wait</i></b>\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, tears over his swollen cheeks, began to lightly jiggle all over himself, trembling out of fear and already feeling the need to have food stuffed within himself. Yet, he didn\u2019t want to give up, he didn\u2019t want to end up bigger than he already was. He wanted to be able to get back to his field, to be able to run, hell, even being able to move would be a step up from its current situation. Still, despite his thoughts, all his body wanted was more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastassja had watched from the sidelines, seeing how Podrick revealed his intentions to Dybala, seeing how the guy was trying to resist, to fight back. In a sense, Nas was feeling proud of Paulo. Although he had been transformed in an almost eating machine, the guy was doing all he could to resist. This, in her eyes, increased the value that Paulo had. Yet also she had similar desires to the coach. Now that she had seen how easy it had been for Dybala to almost, double his own weight, she wanted to see what his limits were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if Paulo wouldn\u2019t eat, he wouldn\u2019t grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she began moving closer to the bed bound, jiggling, mass of lard that Paulo was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex-player wasn\u2019t in any position to look behind. His body had accumulated so much fat, in such a short time, that even if he had the strength to move, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to, given the fact that he wasn\u2019t used to this body of his. So, as he felt the painful hunger pangs coming from his humongous, bed-sized, gut, he closed his eyes and tried to focus only on the need to show to that bastard that had fattened him up, that Paulo Dybala wasn\u2019t an easy target as he had thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, closing in himself, he didn\u2019t see the nurse creeping closer and closer, while holding a single innocent looking cookie in her hands. As soon as she was standing beside Paulo, she began to stealthily move the cookie from her hand to his mouth, until she managed to have it fall from her grasp, falling into his open maw. Paulo didn\u2019t notice immediately what was going on, so focused he was on trying to resist that he dismissed all sensations coming from his body, focalizing only on his hunger, trying to keep it at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body, though responded well enough to Nastassja actions, trained by weeks of constant stuffing, without his conscious thoughts, his lips opened for more when the cookie was quickly swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNas didn\u2019t waste the opportunity. While holding the feeding tube, moving it inches from his open mouth, she started the flow of weight gain shake, watching with passion as the shake went from the tube into the fattened player mouth. She never pushed the nozzle into his mouth, afraid that the guy could wake up from his reverie, instead she held it there, letting the shake freely flow, as Paulo\u2019s trained body did the rest.  <br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Dybala noticed that his hunger seemed to be quieting down and began to grunt and moan as he tried to release the focus, he had on himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as the guy was waking up, Nas quickly stopped the flow, and moved back, noticing to be just in time as Dybala began to assess his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Did I do it? Have I managed to resist? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hunger seems to have calmed down quite a bit, so I think so\u2026yet, I don\u2019t feel starving. I was expecting my body to react badly from not giving it any food and instead, everything seems to be working fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a glaring success! I\u2019ll show you, Podrick! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won\u2019t back down so easily!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo happy he was from his success, that he failed to notice the lingering sweet after taste that still was in his mouth, as his body began once more to digest the shake, converting it into even more fat tissue on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese events kept replaying more and more, during the week, with Dybala focusing on himself to resist his hunger, while Nastassja fed him gallons of the shake without his knowledge. Paulo, once again, began to grow even more. With his will to resist he had managed to stop for some time but, thanks to the nurse intervention, he rapidly began anew to grow. Day after day, his body swelled larger and larger, becoming a veritable sea of lard, his forms growing so big that he began to cover the entire bed he was on from view, only with his body. His arms, pumped full of fat, grew bigger and rounder, pushed by the same fat on them to lay down straight from his shoulder, unable to ben anymore. His hands, and even his fingers, began to be swollen with fat, resembling more fat sausages, than the finger they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis torso and shoulders expanded hugely, both on the front and on the side. On the front, weighed down by his monstrous moobs, which had grown so massive that two persons were needed to lift one of it. While on the back a countless slide of back rolls made its way up to his ass. His neck had vanished from view, his head was actually being dragged down as a multitude of jiggly chins created a sort of funnel around it. His gut, though, was the one that had grown the most. Overflowing the boundaries placed by the bed he was in, it overflowed it, reaching the ground and covering the front of the broken bed he was laying upon, everything from his feet to his crotch, was hidden under it, completely covered by the sheer mass of adipose tissue that filled his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala, though, wasn\u2019t aware of these changes. As big as he was, he didn\u2019t think he could grow any bigger, without considering that he firmly belied to be showing restrain in his eating habits. He was so convinced of what he was doing, in fact, that for the last three days Nastassja had pushed the nozzle right within his mouth once more, and yet the guy didn\u2019t seem to notice it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nurse was joyously happy about this although, she knew from Porick that, in a few short days, Dybala was going to leave their care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir? What do you mean, leave our care? You\u2019re going to release him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the evening before the last day that James had scheduled for Paulo, and he was currently explaining to the nurse, what the future was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, Nastassja. Still, he\u2019s grown so big that we can\u2019t keep him here contained. That is why tomorrow, since is your day of freedom from this work, I will have him moved somewhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the new facility he will be going to be placed under a better care than we can provide here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastassja, who was growing rather attached to the mountainous tanker of lard that Dybala had become, tried once more to get a clear answer from her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why move him when I\u2019m not around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNas, you\u2019ve grown rather\u2026affectious with him. I don\u2019t want to fight every step of the way as he\u2019s moved somewhere else. That is the reason we\u2019re doing his transfer tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that when you get back, you\u2019ll find a new guest for you to take care of.<br>\r\nUnderstood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, as Podrick entered the room hosting Dybala he was ecstatic. <br>\r\nHe had to let loose of Cristiano, force by events, but now Dybala was more than ready to substitute him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes. Paulo will be quite an excellent source of food for me and those like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only need to look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s almost at 1.400 lbs, and while I\u2019m sure he could keep growing a bit bigger, it is high time I get my reward.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood Morning, Paulo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, don\u2019t answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t do it anyway. You\u2019ve grown way too fat to be able to speak coherently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI admit that you didn\u2019t beg to be given more food. Still, whether you realized it or not, we didn\u2019t stop feeding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Paulo, as you concentrated yourself to resist, you never noticed we had started to tube feeding you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And now, now you\u2019re more than ready for the end of this journey\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he watched him, he licked his lips feverishly, already imagining the taste of such a scrumptious dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Paulo, although he couldn\u2019t move a muscle, noticed the strange stare that Podrick was giving him and, with a trembling voice, afraid of what the guy had in mind for him, tried to speak. Unfortunately for him, even his speech had been taken away from him as the fat had amassed onto his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, hearing the gargling grumble coming from Dybala, only smiled even more, as he began bending on his knees, moving closer to the guy as he whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be afraid, aren\u2019t you, Paulo? Well, you should be\u2026for I\u2019m going to reveal a secret to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, it\u2019s not only a passion of mine to see you guys balloon up and grow bigger and fatter. The main reason behind this all is due to a catering of sorts that I\u2019ve to provide to myself and to those like me that are unable to sustain themselves.<br>\r\nYou see, we are an insignificant percentage of the world population and due to this, and to the fact that many abhor what we do, we are often left empty handed or, even, hunted down as if we\u2019re criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe, my dear, dear Paulo, are only seeking a way of sustaining ourselves.<br>\r\nAnd to do that, we have to rely on people like you who, knowingly or not, offer themselves to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is why I\u2019ve done the utmost to let you live a life without any stress, without any disturbances\u2026So that when the time to offer yourself comes, you can go without regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I\u2019m digressing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Paulo, will end up becoming the staple for my people\u2026and there is nothing you can do about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paulo heard James whispers, he began trembling in fear, faster and faster as he thought that the guy was crazier that he had ever thought. Still, that last phrase, the one in which James referred him to as \u2018the staple of his people\u2019 made him worry even more, although it also confused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you haven\u2019t understood yet. No worries. I\u2019ll try to be more explicit.<br>\r\nWe, me and my people, are Cannibals, Paulo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, instead, are our meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you understand now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James said that he quickly grabbed the topmost roll from Dybala\u2019s belly, shaking it for emphasis, as he squeezed harshly the thick strata of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of this\u2026will soon become our food for months to come\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDybala froze in terror at first, too shocked by the revelation but, as James began to move away, he tried with all of his strength to move, to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get away from that maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was all for naught. Buried under almost 1.400 pounds of flesh, Paulo could do nothing more than jiggle his body in a frenzy, making himself shake and wobble as a massive, blob shaped, jelly. As Podrick moved away, four men entered the apartment, each dressed in hazmat suits, they brought with them a small mobile crane. James watched from the sidelines as the brutes he had hired to move Paulo, began their work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were unnamed workers, similar to mercenaries who were interested only into their pay.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had already organized everything. Already had been in strict contact with one of the few places where those like him could go to get a freshly prepared meal. The people there, once had heard of his proposition, were dubious at first that an opportunity like that could be real but, as they saw surveillance videos of Paulo Fattening up, they immediately agreed to help James when the time arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, it was that time. Finally, after many months of waiting, James could get what he desired the most.  An expertly made meal from a famous soccer player. He truly couldn\u2019t wait to have a nice grilled steak out of Paulo\u2019s thigh, or maybe a stew made with his moobs? Possibilities were endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before he could lose himself in those dreams, he swiftly followed the brutes to their transport truck, joining them as they made together the final trip for Paulo Dybala. The trip in itself was uneventful, but when they arrived in the underground location, where Paulo was going to be treated, from there, James began to have fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn not even an hour, Paulo had been moved from the truck to a special pallet like structure and placed on a mechanical belt, which began to take him away from the cargo area. As James watched interested as his soon to be meal was moved away, he noticed two figures approaching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a middle-aged man, white haired and with a similarly colored moustache. He had to be the contact to which James had spoken to when organizing this exact day. The second one, instead, was a young bubbly red headed girl, clothed in a dress two sizes too small for her she walked slowly behind the man, as she nibbled on some sort of doughnut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Podrick, I presume? I\u2019m Edwards. Ralph Edwards, we spoke on the phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure to meet you Mr. Edwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe, instead, is my secretary, April. She usually takes care of showing our facility to the guests but, considering the specimen you\u2019ve brought to us, I\u2019ll do the honors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved through the underground facility, James noticed quite rapidly that April seemed to be doing nothing much apart eating quite a lot, as he was at a safe distance from the girl he began to enquire with the owner beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve noticed then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, April is helping us out on testing a new serum our lab guys have been tinkering with for some time. Naturally, she isn\u2019t aware of this but, considering the way less than satisfactory job she\u2019s done lately, she deserves a little punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, the results are optimistic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Edwards talked, James quickly looked at the girl ambling behind them, as she stopped wuite often to any vending machine she found on their way, purchasing snacks upon snacks, which she then proceeded to devour just before the next vending machine was beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Edwards, I must admit that this serum of ours seems quite interesting. I wonder if it was possible to receive some of it, as soon as the final product will be released.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I knew you would have been interested. Unfortunately, there are still some issues with the current batch of serum. To name a few, the test subject find itself so addicted to the stuff that will grow aggressive if none is given within half an hour and the nature itself of the serum, which has to be prepared with a taxing process, and so it isn\u2019t easy to be manufactured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, we\u2019re improving it and, in the next few years, we may be able to give you a final version, free of any issues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded at that, as he kept stealing glances of the young woman behind them, still eating as if her life depended on it. He could only imagine how easier his job would become of he could simply inject his victims with such a serum. HE wouldn\u2019t have anymore any need for subterfuge as they would eat themselves fat without any worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Edwards, after a bit, noticing how James was daydreaming, coughed a bit to make him aware of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, Let\u2019s talk business, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you\u2019ve brought us a really nice specimen. Although quite dangerous since he\u2019s a celebrity, he still is one of the biggest we ever received. And you managed to do this all by yourself? That\u2019s impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, as I mentioned to you through the phone, we can proceed in two different ways\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither, we treat him right away, making sure that he\u2019s moved straight to production, so to start immediately the process of turning him into a prepackaged mountain of A+ Grade meat; Or, we can have him moved on the Kobe Treatment. Following this second procedure he won\u2019t be immediately available on the market but, when the three months of treatments have gone, we will have a final product that will surpass any other you\u2019ve ever tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, I must confess, we let our experts deciding who follows which treatment but, as this is a particular case, one where the Client himself provided us with the main ingredient, I\u2019ll leave you, Mr. Podrick, to the choice\u2026 \u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn\u2019t exactly sure on what made Mr. Podrick tick, he seemed to be an efficient feeder and yet, he didn\u2019t seem to be relishing the gain of his targets as much as she or the other nurse did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she pushed away those thoughts, she had her own toy to play with, one named Sergio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last few weeks she had been content in ordering him about, every time pushing him to his limits, making sure he was always stuffed to the gills and wanting nothing else than being fed by her. Still, as of late, this routine seemed to become boring for her, so she thought about spicing things up a bit. As she entered the room where the fattened player was resting, she marveled once more at his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio was laying upon his bed, sleeping above the covers, wearing nothing but a tight pair of shorts and a way too small t-shirt, leaving his ample gut to protrude forward and at his sides. As he kept eating whatever she brought to him, his gain rate kept being constant, as he already was having issues moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting beside him, as she watched him sleep, she gently caressed his dome shaped gut, feeling it gurgle as it digested the last meal he had consumed, barely an hour before. She had been quite cruel to him, bringing more than the double of what he usually was having. And yet, such was his loyalty to her, he managed to squeeze every last crumb within himself, even if at the end he had almost begged her to push the last few items into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was proud of his transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had first arrived there, Sergio Aguero wanted nothing more than dominate her, to impress her with his toned body, as if she was below him and she had to be grateful for his company. But Susan quickly changed the attitude of the guy, shoveling mountains of food into his gullet, making him so addicted that he had to submit to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil, recently, when she made it clear that he had to call her \u2018Mistress\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sergio obeyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, as she caressed his gut and his pendulous moobs, he murmured into his sleep about her, hearing that, she quickly stood and began taking out the breakfast she had ordered from the kitchen, making sure to be as loud as possible, until she saw that Sergio began to stir into awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMh? Wha\u2026? Oh, it\u2019s you, Mistress\u2026Is time already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>No, it isn\u2019t but I\u2019ve gotta make you bigger\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sergio\u2026it\u2019s time for your third breakfast\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026\u2019M hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio Aguero, although feeling still pretty sated from his latest meal, know better than admit it in front of his Mistress. She was all he needed in his life and yet, she could be nice and gentle as a kitten, and just as easily become callous as a snake. In the past he had tried once or twice to go against her wishes but, soon learned that it was better to avoid such situation. Slowly, as he pushed against the bed to reach a seating position against the backwall, he rose from his sleeping position, preparing himself to receive his breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was usual, he began to receive the trays with his food directly under his nose, without realizing that Susan was placing them directly on his already massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Pet. An eight eggs omelet, with half a pound of sausages, same quantity of fries and a full pound of fried bacon strips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClean it all and I\u2019ll give you your next course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy sniffed the aroma coming from the plate and, quite rapidly, began to clean out the tray she had brought him, chewing and swallowing both eggs and meats as fast as he could. As he did so, the grease and the oil from the fries began to slowly leak on his face and down on his three chins, still he didn\u2019t mind. All he wanted was to please his Mistress. As of late, he had noticed something peculiar, something which didn\u2019t made lot of sense for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had noticed that he was having troubles moving around, even rising from his own bed had seemed to become quite the chore, and yet he didn\u2019t trouble himself when food was presented to him. He barely could maintain focus on what was going on around him as he focused mainly on eating what he had in front of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio Aguero had grown much in the time he had been quarantined, yet he had stopped caring about that. True, he wondered sometimes at what was going on outside of those four walls that made his own apartment but, with food under his nose and the gentle touch of his Mistress, he could care less about everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guy cleaned the first tray, Susan bent toward him, cleaning his lips and chins with a napkin, before giving him a quick peck on top of his gurgling belly, just before passing onto him a new tray, full to the brim with more delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Pet. Second course is ready for you\u2026we have a couple of cakes and a few dozen\u2019s donuts\u2026also, there are three shakes for you to have. Doctor\u2019s order\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t even reply, simply grabbed a quarter of the first cake and began to mow it down, pushing it as much as he could, into his open mouth before starting to chew and swallow. As he kept eating, so his gut began to fill up, starting to rumble noisily. Yet, just as the first hint of discomfort crossed his face, Susan smiled to him and began to massage gently his overworked stomach, making space for him where to store more and more food. Aguero felt himself, not for the first time, as if he was in paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful woman at his side as he could eat whatever he wanted, without worrying about anything, and yet, he had a nagging feeling that he was forgetting something, something important. Something that seemed related to his presence there. But with both the pull from the food and from Susan, he pushed away those thoughts, focusing only on her and his meals. As the meal progressed, and Susan brought to him his sixth course, she noticed that he was starting to slow down, as the energy he had to move his arms was starting to dwindle to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, Pet\u2026you don\u2019t want to stop, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No! No, Mistress\u2026*oaurp!*...just...so\u2026tired...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026my poor little pet is tired\u2026well, let Susie help you then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she sat on the bed, in what little space was available beside the massive guy, taking notice of what was available on the tray, seeing as it was filled with powdered cream puffs, eclairs and a quite large sheet cake. Taking a spoon from the tray, she rapidly filled it as much as it could ad brought it toward Sergio\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, open wide, Pet\u2026Let\u2019s make sure you eat all of your meal, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio didn\u2019t do much except opening his mouth and  eating what she gave him, and yet, feeling her so close to him seemed to give him the power to clean out everything on his last tray, although he was beginning to feel pretty much stuffed. Still, he didn\u2019t want to upset her, knowing full well that an upset Susan would mean no food and no touching for days. As he swallowed the last morsel of food from his final tray, he burped quite loudly, already starting to feel a bit drowsy and yet, he saw that she was moving closer to him,  her hand roaming his gut as she scooted even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, Pet. You\u2019ve eaten well\u2026but what would you say if I mention that there is another tray, waiting for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio, full as he was, feeling her soft touch on his taut gut, could hardly refuse. As he managed to burp once more, trying to make some more room, he nodded slowly, as he saw her turning around and offering him\u2026a tube? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe he\u2026oopsie daisy\u2026it isn\u2019t a real tray but, more of a keg of beer\u2026can you do it, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAguero didn\u2019t even reply, as he opened his lips and closed them around the tube into his mouth, biting on the tube so that it wouldn\u2019t escape his grasp. Soon, he felt the refreshing taste of beer on his tongue and eagerly began to swallow, gulping it down without stopping himself, timing his breaths so that he hadn\u2019t to stop for oxygen. In barely fifteen minutes, the small keg had been completely empty and Sergio, now feeling tipsy and drowsy, began to lay down once more on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a good little Pet you are. Now sleep well, I\u2019ll return with your next meal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan saw that Aguero had fallen asleep like a log she admired her job for a minute more, seeing his gut, all filled up like a beach ball, rock hard to the touch as it loudly digested the massive meal he had already consumed, and yet a bit sloshy too due to the liters of beer she had managed to have him swallow. Without his noticing she had, once more, increased his portions and reduced the resting time between one meal and the next, and yet Sergio had managed to clean out everything just as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bent down toward the end of the bed, she rapidly moved some cover away as she revealed the scale mounted into the bed, eager to see how big he had grown since the previous week. She quickly scanned her notes and smiled widely in seeing he had gained no less than 34 pound in less than three days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she quickly did the math, she proudly realized that Sergio was finally approaching the big 500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I\u2019ll have to make him a special meal when he reaches it\u2026just to make sure he keeps on growing properly.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sergio slept, he began to dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dream he was still on the field, playing the ball toward the opponent\u2019s goal but, just before he could kick the ball to score, an oversized hot dog appeared in front of him, forcing him to open his mouth and swallow it whole. As he gulped the strangely appealing snack, he felt himself full of energy and made to move forward toward the enemy goal but, he realized he wasn\u2019t anymore standing in front of the goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was actually seating on a large couch, while his team goal was behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised he made to rise and return to the play when he noticed the referee, which was strikingly similar to Susan, move closer to him informing him that he had to stay there for the game to continue. Perplexed, Sergio sat where he was, until he saw one of the other players move in position as if he was the goalkeeper, as they aimed the ball toward him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo surprised to do anything he saw the players kicking the ball astonishingly fast, too shocked to do anything he simply stared as the ball morphed into a massive, melon sized, ball of cake which traveled right toward him. As if he had one it plenty of times before, he moved his head a little and opened his mouth astonishingly wide, until the massive ball of cake entered his open lips and he swallowed entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips in pleasure he saw that the score was now reporting <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOthers: 0 ; Sergio: 1\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he burped a bit, he saw that the next player was getting closer to the ball, and now, knowing what was going to happen, he himself prepared to be on the receiving end. For some time, the game kept going this way, with the players kicking the soccer ball and Sergio gulping down whatever the ball changed into, and yet Sergio didn\u2019t seem aware of how his body was faring. For each ball he gulped, his body seemed to grow fifty pounds heavier, starting to overcome the couch he was seating on as the score counter kept increasing in his favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOthers: 0 ; Sergio: 12\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another fifty pounds were added to his frame, forcing him to stay seated down, as he wasn\u2019t able to lift himself from the couch on his own even if he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOthers: 0 ; Sergio: 16\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body began to ooze out of his uniform, ripping it out in several places as the small and tight set of clothes couldn\u2019t contain his ever-growing form any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOthers: 0 ; Sergio: 20\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw the score, a massive burp escaped from his lips but, as he tried to lift his arms to cover his mouth, he realized he couldn\u2019t move them. As much as he tried, they were too heavy for him to lift them, forcing him to keep them at his sides, as his massive protruding gut also pushed them back from the front. As Sergio looked at himself, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure on what he was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself weighted down by something but, with the referee and the other players complimenting him on the wonderful game, he refused to acknowledge his real size, choosing to pretend that he was just tired. As he saw the other team leaving, he thought that the game was finished but, before he could even attempt to move away, the referee moved straight toward him. The woman, which Sergio was surprised in seeing that she really looked like a copy of his Mistress, walked right up to him and began undressing herself as she climbed upon him and on the couch and snuggled closer under his fattened up arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Mr. Aguero, another victory under our belt, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What? I\u2026I guess so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a humble player. Why, you\u2019re the greatest champion around. Nobody else could score as many victories as you\u2026now, will you keep winning for me? Will you do it, Pet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I will. I won\u2019t lose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aguero said that in his dream he tried to rise once more from the couch, managing it just for a few moments, before his weakened legs collapsed under his weight, unable to support his massive frame. As he rolled off the couch, he began to see how big he was, how heavy he felt and, most importantly how weak he was. As his dream turned into a nightmare, seeing all the people he had known for all his life taunting him as he was unable to move on his own, his subconscious began to actively remove the memories that were causing him harm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, making him forget what he really was, choosing instead to live the dream he was having. All his memories of him being a soccer player vanished, while being replaced by the ones provided from his dream. As he began to stir in his sleep, he was no more conscious of being Sergio Aguero the soccer player, believing instead of being Sergio Aguero, the couch-ball player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sergio woke up, finding himself still in his room, laying upon his bed he managed, slowly, to rise from his bed, seating on its verge as he tried to remember where he was and what he was doing in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I\u2026I was ill\u2026I think? Nah, that can\u2019t be it. I\u2019ve never felt better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I was moved here in preparation for my next game? I\u2019m a champion at it, after all\u2026 Yes, now I remember\u2026My Mistress was the referee at my last match, and she decided to help me train for my next game\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shall do her proud of having chosen to back me up!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Sergio felt his fattened gut slapping slightly against this thighs and, while horrified for a fleeting moment, he soon convinced himself that it was normal for him to be at that size\u2026 And yet, as he touched himself, feeling his jiggly body, he soon realized that if he was in training it was surely meant he was still too small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock he noticed that it was almost time for his first breakfast and, just as he thought of calling Susan, she appeared at the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Pet. Up already? You must be hungry, then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mistress! I need to eat more for the training to be a success\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan began surrounding him with the seven trolley\u2019s full of pancakes, waffles and bacon strips she had brought along as first pre-breakfast, she began to slowly inquire about this training he had mentioned. As far as she remembered, Podrick had never mentioned this kind of excuse for Sergio to be there. With a bit of prodding and a bit of cleverness, she managed to understand more or less what Sergio was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So, he believes to be training for this sport where he eats all the time, uh? <br>\r\nCan work with it\u2026gotta remember to inform Podrick though\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aguero cleaned each and every trolley worth of food, he felt himself collapse against the bed once more, his gut stuffed full to bursting and yet, with a sense of achievement, for he had managed to clean each and every plate that Susan had brought to him. Still licking his lips, he slowly began to feel sleepy, as his body began to work overtime to digest the massive amounts of calories it had received but, before he lost consciousness he managed to leave a request to his Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress\u2026 If I may\u2026could you\u2026*yawn*\u2026bring the next meal\u2026in one hour\u2026 I know I should wait longer but\u2026need to up my\u2026game\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could hear the reply, already he was fast asleep. Susan, meanwhile could only grin in pleasure, if he was so dead set in upping his game, then she would manage to let him overcome the big 500 milestone quicker than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I can\u2019t wait to have you so big that you shan\u2019t be able to move at all\u2026<br>\r\nThen, you\u2019ll rely only to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I\u2019ll force you to keep growing and growing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll see, Sergio\u2026 I will make you bigger than Cristiano, you can count on it.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One month had passed since the fateful dream that convinced Sergio of living into a new reality that saw him as the rising champion of the sport he had imagined, the couch-ball. In those thirty long days, Sergio Aguero had done nothing else but \u2018train\u2019 for what he believed was the incoming championship which he was determined to win. Susan, all too willingly, had done nothing to rouse him from this alternate reality he seemed to be living. It was simply too convenient for her to let him believe in that lie, as she warned also Podrick about that.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe training, by Aguero ideals, was going really swell, although his figure was swelling just as much. As per his request, Susan had shortened his resting time to an hour, giving him time to sleep longer only at nights, and even than only for four hours tops. This lack of rest, coupled with the massive chemically addicting meals that filled his days, caused Sergio to grow out at a ungodly speed. If before he was almost at the big 500 pounds, with this training brought on, he passed it just as fast, leaving him now at the mind-boggling size of almost 750 pounds. Currently asleep, in one of his few resting times, Sergio was being admired by his Mistress Susan, which stared at him with admiration and lust for what he had achieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was indeed massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs, fattened beyond belief, looked more like metal barrels so covered in adipose tissue they were, and were just as heavy, considering that Sergio couldn\u2019t move them anymore by his own will. His hips and ass too had received quite the abundant dose of fat, as if a mad doctor had just injected it right into his bum. It was now a large thing, soft like jelly, and just as jiggly, it was squished against the surface of the bed, leaving quite the indenture into the mattress, and yet it still was forced to spill at his side, overtaking the sides of his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, although his ass spilled at his sides, it was his humongous gut that took most of the space, as it had grown gargantuan, covering everything from below his upper torso down to his calves, leaving only his fattened feet to appear from below. His belly mound had grown so vast, in fact, that not only it covered most of his body height wise, but also by his width. As it in fact spilled over the bed, almost reaching the floor. And although it was so spread out, still it blocked his view forcing him to watch at the ceiling, unable to see what was directly on his front, when laying down on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio\u2019s moobs too had grown hugely, growing obscenely large, like sacks of meat which, forced by gravity, spilled at his sides too, wobbling crazily at his every breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms were similarly inflated with fat as were his legs, forced by their sheer weight to rest upon the mattress, side by side with his humongous gut, barely on top of it although, as his body kept growing day by day, even there they were at risk of being submerged. His face and neck weren\u2019t spared either. His neck vanished from view, covered as it was in four large chin-rolls, and yet every time he craned his head down, more appeared on the view, as if to promise their soon arrival on the permanent scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face, which had managed to look relatively thin for most of his time there, had finally exploded with fat, growing round and cherubic, soft and jiggly, with his cheeks cascading down, as fat accumulated everywhere it could, forcing his eyes to squint, pushed around as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan stared at his pet in his glorious fattened state but, what she dreamed upon was to be able to see him in a perpetual engorged state. Growing so big and massive that nothing would be able to contain him. Not the room he was currently in, nor the entire building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dream, an impossible dream and yet, nothing stopped her to try and reach that limit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved closer, she let herself go against his body, feeling her own self covered by all side by his magnificent, warm, body fat, just as if she was sleeping on the softest waterbed. And yet, she hadn\u2019t time to lose like this. If she wanted her dream to come true, she had to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting herself from him, she brought into the room the long train of trolley\u2019s she had taken from the kitchen, preparing herself in giving him his next meal. To tell the truth she wasn\u2019t sure anymore if this was going to be his fifth lunch or the first of many afternoon snacks, Sergio now was eating so often that was hard to distinguish between one meal and the next. Yet, it was his next meal, which would have been followed soon by another and another\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking herself up from her reverie, she moved at his side, slapping him a bit, rousing him from his sleep, forcing him to look at her with his bleary, squinted, eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWakey, wakey, Pet. It\u2019s time for your next meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*hrf* it is...time\u2026*hrk*\u2026already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Pet. You need to train for the championship...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio didn\u2019t lose time with words, instead replying with a shaky, half assed, nod as he began worming himself to a seated position, helped along the way by Susan, until he was seated in bed, his back against the wall. His heavy arms barely able to move, to bring food to his mouth. Susan was aware of how near immobile he was becoming and yet, the thought excited her even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left a bowl of heavily fried finger food in front of him, so that he could feed himself, as slowly as that was going to be, she also grabbed a massive spoon and began spoon feeding him loads taken directly from a long series of cakes she had at her side, forcing him to eat as fast as he could from both what he had in front and what she pushed into his maw. Aguero had had some troubles in getting used to this treatment, at first, but now that he was used to it he couldn\u2019t imagine a life without being fed this way. In his deluded mind it was the only way of eating correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could he consume such massive amounts of food stuff, if he had to rely only on himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor hours he kept swallowing mouthfuls and spoonful\u2019s of richly caloric food, feeling his massive gut filling up and out, as it grew rounder and heavier right under his eyes, as his body began to slow down due to his tiredness. This event, in particular, had been a reason of worry to him, the first few times it happened. Since he was afraid of finding himself without a mean to get more food within himself but, as Susan moved closer to him, feeding him faster and faster, as if to compensate his inability to stuff himself out, he started to feel prideful of how healthy he was going to become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had to thank his Mistress for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as massively engorged as he could get, he too had limits and yet, when he reached said limits, feeling so full that he might burst, as he felt, and saw, his humongous gut shooting out of him, covering the rest of him in its shadow. Still, Susan never stopped right away. She always pushed him to consume more than before, even as she brought him to hurting point. And yet, Sergio justified this methods, for he believed that she was helping him train, so she wanted to make sure that he was able to grow healthier and stronger and more resistant than the day, or the meal, before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBeing fed in such a way, Sergio Aguero was terribly near to lose any kind of mobility he may still had retained. But it mattered not to him, all he needed was to be in shape for his championship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, James stared from the camera feed from within his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was curious about the fake reality Sergio had started to believe in, how it had come to happen. It had been a by-product of Susan treatment? It had been a reaction from Sergio when he, supposedly, realized how big he had gotten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t going to know soon, if ever, but it hardly was of any importance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was important was only that Sergio kept growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulo\u2019s figure had managed to greatly impress the people that were going to transform him into a pre-packaged, ready to be consumed, meal for the people like him. And although utterly ecstatic they had been when he had brought him, they weren\u2019t going to use him right away, choosing instead to have him acquire a somewhat more rustic taste first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next one, James wanted to bring them such a specimen that they would remain mouth agape, unable to conceive a way to have him get better but, to do that he would have needed to bring them an even bigger prey. And that was going to be Sergio, if things kept going as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, Paulo\u2019s departure, had left him with an empty room with need to be filled. And he still had plenty of names since the CEO\u2019s list had only kept growing since the day, he first received it. But, in truth, as much as he would have loved to get someone new into his grasp, there was someone he wanted to meet first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a couple of days before he had been contacted by Georgina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had acted surprised and wanting an update, although, he wasn\u2019t really. Even though he had let her in charge of keeping the massively obese guy, he had never stopped checking after his first, and favorite, meal-pet. Still, how the girl had reacted to Cristiano\u2019s size, told directly from her lips, had been interesting to say the least\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Georgina sat watching the sun setting on the horizon, admiring the sky as it tinged itself of dozens of colors, feeling that soothing view easing her soul. Since the call she received from that man, Podrick, all those months ago, her heart had been in turmoil. The guy had called her revealing some very distressing facts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth behind the sudden vanishing of her boyfriend Cristiano Ronaldo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as the guy spoke, telling her of what his company had done to him, and what they had planned to do, Georgina truly wanted to do the best she could for her man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, when she saw him for the first time, she realized that what had been saved was only partially the man she had loved. When first she had been brought to the place where Cristiano had been hidden, to save him from the cruel machinations of his Company, at least that's what they had said to her, she couldn\u2019t believe where she was. For the car that had brought her from her home, had left her into some kind of huge farm, with a massive villa and an even bigger set of wooden looking constructions that only nominally could be called \u2018Barns\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, as the guy who had brought her there moved her toward these huge structures, she thought he wanted to induct her, to prepare her for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the huge double doors opened, and she saw what was inside, she barely repressed the urge to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor inside the massive building, she saw an amorphous blob, wobbling all over itself, as some kind of tube seemed to be pumping it with some sort of liquid. She stared at the mountainous blob, trying to understand what was going on, why those people had brought her there\u2026until she noticed that a screen had been turned toward her. On that she saw that atop that massive jiggly mountain, near the point where the tube was pumping gallons of the mysterious liquid, there were two eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes which she recognized immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-C-Cristiano?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment, a few of the guards there explained her the situation, about the treatment that his Company had done to him, turning him into that huge, shapeless mass of fat, and yet, through the use of some kind of VR, Georgina was able to talk with her boyfriend. She had been warned that They had used her, or someone like her, to trap Cristiano into that slothful gluttony. And so she tried at the best of her capacity to keep him in the dark about his real size. It hadn\u2019t been easy and, for many nights she felt guilty for betraying his trust but, what could she had done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she were to tell him the truth, the minimum stress could have killed him, or so the doctor there told her. So she kept the lie, trying to live with a boyfriend that wasn\u2019t anymore as she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still romantic and courteous to her, as the man she had met so long ago but, he wasn\u2019t a man anymore. So, Georgina tried her best to keep him company, to make him happy, to keep him relaxed, although she herself felt on the verge of madness. But, as time passed, as she noticed that all he seemed to be able to do was eat, she began to see him under a different light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything began three weeks since she had been reunited with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting near him, inside the barn, as he was still being pumped full of whatever chemicals they were giving him to keep him alive, despite his humongous size. And, as she stared entranced to his jiggly body, at how it wobbled and jiggled, at how taut his gut seemed to appear having been fed for days non-stop.  It was then that she began to feel amazed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t the same man she had know, true. But this Cristiano was easily as big as a couple of garbage trucks, and yet he kept eating and growing, filling up on whatever concoction given to him, as he steadily grew bigger and wider, larger and higher. She had to admit it to herself, she wasn\u2019t sure anybody else could have become that big and still be somewhat healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then, her admiration began to turn into lust. It took her some time to actually realize that she was falling in love for a mass of fat unable to stop eating and yet, it was happening. As she began to walk on his body, roaming and exploring all of his curves, feeling how soft the thick adipose tissue covering him was, she also started to become more and more affectionate toward him, until she realized that she had forgotten her old lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone, was the old fit and trim Cristiano from her heart. When this new Cristiano was getting, day after day, as he grew bigger and bigger, more and more attractive in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely a couple of days later that, after contacting him via the VR she managed to relieve him of some of his stress, after being aided by several of the people who took care of him to go spelunking down into the depths that were his rolls of fat.  And despite the hot and humid air she had found when she finally managed to reach his most intimate parts, she felt herself complete by knowing that all around her, every walls and every rolls surrounding her, it was only a fraction of her boyfriend body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, Georgina began to actively take a role in Cristiano feeding, dedicating a few hours each and every day, to feed him by hand. This slowed his gains of course but, it caused a massive spike of lust for the both of them. Georgina, finding the situation surreal and yet, she couldn\u2019t refrain herself. She had to see Cristiano growing bigger, so big that no building would be enough to contain him. And Cristiano, that although was still convinced of being in his perfect shape, had to admit with himself that being fed by Georgina made anything she gave him, delicious.  And yet, it didn\u2019t seem enough for neither of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weeks passed, Cristiano barely grew heavier, needing a massive number of calories only to maintain his weight. Yet, Georgina didn\u2019t want to call it quits. Forcing him to go over his own limits, she began to relieve his stress more and more often, rewarding him every time he managed to fill himself up to bursting faster than he had done before. With such a prize, Cristiano began soon used to the new quantities, and yet Georgina kept pushing him, relentlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, after months since her epiphany in regard to her \u2018new\u2019 lover, she watched the sky\u2019s beautiful colors, as she flopped back against his chins, sitting on one of them, using the others as support for her back. Sitting down in the cone that Cristiano had began sporting as his head sunk deeper and deeper within his body. And yet, although he could barely see anything, his eyes were riveted on Georgina\u2019s figure right beside him, not caring a bit about the fact that she seemed so much smaller than him, nor that he was still drinking avidly from the feeding tube she had forced him to keep at all times, even as he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy love, don\u2019t worry\u2026everything will be fine\u2026as soon as you are able to clear out also the next silos of food, I will go and give you some well needed relief\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll see, Baby\u2026 I\u2019ll get you back to a healthy weight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristiano couldn\u2019t do much beside opening and closing his eyes, sign that he had understood, as he started to focus only on the food coming from the tube. He was such a lucky man to have a woman as supportive as Georgina. Even though he was still so weak, she still did her best to cheer him up or to see that he was going to go through his next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>What could I have done without her? If she hadn\u2019t come here, to stay by my side, I don\u2019t think I could have lived\u2026<br>\r\nI love you Georgie\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if she had heard him speak, she turned toward him, giving him a quick kiss on what she could see of his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you Cristiano\u2026My little baby\u2026and I will bring you back to your former glory\u2026you\u2019ll see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Except, you shall be so big that nobody will be able to move you, or separate you from me again\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sergio woke up bleary eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, he tried to call for Susan but no words came out of his mouth. As he tried to speak, only a gurgle came out as he realized that there was a tube pushed deep within his lips. As he started to woke up properly and remembered where he was and what he was doing he lowly calmed down. He was still in his room, in the facility where the Mistress was having him trained to win the next championship of coach-ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been she, in fact, in requesting to have him fed with the tube each and every night, when he was asleep, so to maximize his training effort. So, Sergio didn\u2019t see anything wrong in the situation he was in, he had just to wait for Susan to come and take out the feeding tube, so that he could enjoy breakfast. In the meanwhile, although suppose to be fed only when asleep, he kept swallowing the delicious concoction pouring out from the feeding tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, the door to his room opened and, withing the light coming out from the hallway, a feminine silhouette appeared at the door frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Pet. Hope you\u2019re ready for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the figure moved toward him, Sergio could see how beautiful she was, how her curvaceous body moved and jiggled only in the good places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Mistress sure is a beautiful woman\u2026I am a lucky man\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Susan moved beside him, shutting down the feeding machine and extracting the tube from his throat, Sergio could finally breathe freely. He had gotten used by now to breathe with the tube jammed within his throat but, being able to breathe through his mouth was much easier. Yet, not even a minute without food and his gut began to grumbling hungrily, something which made Susan proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you are hungry, Pet? Good\u2026It\u2019s time to start on your meals\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that, Susan moved closer the dozen or so trolley\u2019s she had brought with her, getting them closer to the once soccer player as she prepared for the arduous task of feeding him by hand. Sergio, between the increased schedule and the nightly feeding, had grown tremendously. His flabby body had completely submerged the bed he had once been laying upon. At one point, during one of his meals, Susan was almost sure of having heard it break and crash onto the floor, but with Sergio so massive that she needed to climb atop of him she couldn\u2019t have verified it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin weeks since the fast paced \u2018Diet\u2019, Sergio had lost any kind of mobility, growing out to be just  a massive pile of flesh, one that Susan had often to wash it with a sponge and clean it with baby powder to avoid any issue. Yet, as big as he was, it wasn\u2019t yet enough for the manic feeder girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she climbed atop of him, she noticed his massive legs, which were getting o large she could barely circle them in width with both of her arms. His feet, ridiculously small in comparison, had been lifted from the ground weeks ago and never touched the floor again. But as he had been growing, so did his hugely apron like gut that, like a tidal wave, had moved over his legs covering everything up with its sheer size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan climbed, on all fours, she suddenly lost her balance when her hand lost contact with the belly surface she had been moving on, quickly she regained balance but realized immediately where she was. Her hand had just managed to grab onto a roll of fat, after having almost fallen into the large belly button that Sergio was sporting. As she returned moving forward, she was constantly reminded how big Sergio had grown. Still she kept moving, passing between the two jiggly hills that were now his moobs, flaccid and wobbly as they were. She had been, the first time, almost afraid that she could have been buried under those and left without breathable air. Finally she began the last climb up, as she grabbed onto his large collection of chin-rolls, managing finally to arrive near his head, sunken slightly within the accumulated fat that had been once his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Pet\u2026Sorry for taking so long\u2026open wide now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, without giving him time to answer back, she began stuffing fast food junk within his mouth, forcing him to chew and swallow without a moment of peace. Sergio didn0t mind the treatment at all, he\u2019d gotten used to it after some time and the hunger that forced his gut to grumble ad been growing steadily for quite some time. Slowly, he moved his jaw biting through massive burgers, dripping in grease and cheese, smearing his lips as he sloppily kept eating at the pace that Susan forced on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite, chomping down and swallowing each morsel, Sergio kept eating in bliss, still unaware of how his body steadily, although slowly, kept growing wider and wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Pet? If we keep this up, I believe that by the end of the year you\u2019ll be just about the minimum requirement for the Championship of this year...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inhumanly obese man heard the words but wasn\u2019t keen on accepting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Minimum requirement? As in Light weight? I can do better than that\u2026<br>\r\nI Will do better than that!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing exactly as she had hoped, Sergio began to quicken up his pace, trying to use any ounce of energy he had to eat faster, although he couldn\u2019t keep this pace for long. Susan, nonetheless was ecstatic. Teasing or threatening didn\u2019t seem to work anymore against her humongous pet, but using his pride, always did.<br>\r\nAs literally hundreds of pounds worth in junk food passed through his lips, Susan knew that Sergio was going to be too tired to keep on chewing his food, it had been so for the last few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger he got, the less energies he did have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, if before she would have stopped giving him the much needed rest he may have craved, that day she wanted him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPet, the training require sacrifices, you know that? You simply aren\u2019t eating enough. True, you could qualify for the minimum but, we don\u2019t want that, do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, as much as he could he tried to shake his head from side to side, causing only a slight movement of his head, as his fat jiggled all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Pet, from now, we will start with the tube feeding all day long. I\u2019ll make sure you go over the minimum requirements, passing their check with flying colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrust in me, Pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYhe\u2026hesshh\u2026Mhish\u2026thr\u2026heessh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio could only barely spoke nowadays, his throat, his vocal cords, so entangled with fat and so weighted down by his massive size that he could only spit out parts of single words, intertwined by huge gulps of air.<br>\r\nSusan couldn\u2019t be prouder of her massive pet, for trusting her so much and for accepting whatever she wished out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he could do anything if he wanted to refuse\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith the feeding tube in place, his growth started anew. Although slowly, she could see every few hours that more and more space in the room began to be filled with Sergio\u2019s mass. He truly was becoming a titanic mass of wobbly, squishy, fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Nothing\u2026</i>\u2019 she thought with a smile on her lips \u2019<i>Nothing could make me happier than seeing this\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, as she had been entranced in watching Sergio grow wider and higher inside the room, she was awakened from her reverie by hearing a strange creaking sound. At first, she was worried it may have come from her pet and, hurriedly, she moved at his side, trying to hear it again but, as she turned around hearing it again she realized it wasn\u2019t her over-fattened pet creating that sound\u2026but the same walls that were trying desperately to contain him within the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an even bigger smile erupted on her face, she hurriedly ran outside the room and, walking around the walls she soon found a crack in the wall. It was a small one for now, but she could see and feel the pressure applied there by Sergio\u2019s growing body against the thick concrete walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>He has to grow bigger\u2026He has to! <br>\r\nMy dream will come true! He shall become the biggest man on the world\u2026So big that no building will be able to contain him!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning inside she simply jumped against the growing walls of flesh that was Sergio\u2019s side belly, feeling its\u2019 squishy softness lessening as it was replaced by the hard and taut feeling of being over-filled with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep growing Sergio\u2026Keep growing my pet\u2026Do it for me! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreak the walls that surround you! Crush anything in your path! <br>\r\nBecome the absolute mountain of jiggly, unmoving, fat you\u2019re shaping yourself into! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t ever stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those words left her mouth she hurriedly covered her lips with one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she really said that? Did Sergio heard her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried about losing the trusty, ever hungry, pet she had changed him into, she moved her stare toward his funnel like sets of chins, wondering if he had truly heard her\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaxon had tried with all his might to avoid eating the pie he had been presented with, after seeing what had happened to his colleague Tom Boston. Yet, the Shaman was ruthless in forcing him and so, by keeping his nose closed, the shaman managed to shove a few pieces of it into his mouth, forcing him to swallow, or choke. Although horrified by the situation Jaxon could do nothing more than swallow down piece after piece of the Tom Pie. <br>\r\nHe felt awful.<br>\r\nFrom one side because he knew that he was eating his colleague, but also because, as much as he tried not to show it, he was loving the taste of the pie. Still, between a gap when his mouth was open, but no piece of pie was coming in, he managed to take a long breather and then closed his mouth shut. The shaman was perturbed. With a scowl he let go of the kid nose, letting him to breath spasmodically from it, his mouth firmly closed.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Boy, hear me well\u2026You\u2019re going to finish that pie. Either you like it or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the Shaman grinned toward him evilly. <br>\r\nJaxon, still fighting his internal battle, had to gulp down hardly when he saw the stare that that shaman guy was giving him. He wanted to ask them what they were going to do but, he didn\u2019t want to risk it by opening his mouth. Suddenly though, as he felt someone grabbing him from behind, he couldn\u2019t refrain himself from opening his mouth letting out a shrill of surprise and that was all the shaman had been waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick move, the shaman, moved closer to the kid and with force shoved a slice of the Tom pie into his mouth, keeping then his hand against the boy\u2019s mouth to prevent him to spit it out. Jaxon, so surprised that he couldn\u2019t do anything, found his taste buds suddenly overwhelmed by the delicious taste of the pie and before he could think of doing anything, he found himself swallowing the piece. Breathless, he tried to recover but the shaman before him didn\u2019t had any pity for his state. In a rapid succession the tribesman began shoving slice after slice of pie on Jaxon, barely giving him any rest, forcing him to succumb to the sinful taste of the baked treat. <br>\r\nJaxon\u2019s mouth soon was covered by fragments of the pie that, due to the forceful nature of the shaman, left him in a pitiful state. His eyes were glazed over, lost in a sea of shame and sinful pleasure, his entire form slumped on the chair was kept up only by the ropes tightly coiled around him. <br>\r\nYet he was jolted awake when the shaman moved closer to him, his face mere inches away from Jaxon as the tribesman began licking the pie\u2019s filling off the boy face with a grinning smile.<br>\r\n\u201cYou taste good, Boy. I wonder how we should prepare you\u2026but there is still more to come before we reach that point. Still, you cleaned out the pie\u2026must admit you did a good job but, it isn\u2019t over\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nAfter a few more licks at Jaxon face, the shaman moved back, revealing what was standing behind him. Jaxon was still trying to recover both from the forceful feeding and from the shaman advances. Still, although in a sorrowful state, he managed to glance behind the tribesman and his eyes stared wide open at what was in store for him. Behind the cannibal, in fact, there were already some servants carrying plates of food toward him. With a fear filled swallow, Jaxon tried to get away from what was coming toward him, but the shaman swiftly grabbed him by his hair and forced him to remain still.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, Boy. You\u2019re gonna eat\u2026and you\u2019re gonna like it. Our Tribe has made lots of sacrifices to prepare this banquet\u2026you will enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jaxon could put up any resistance, a serving guard moved forward carrying a tray with a pot of boar ribs, cooked in a red sauced stew, and a few forms of banana bread, until he kneeled beside the shaman keeping the pot high. The leader then grabbed some of the bread and, using it as a spoon moved it closer to the boy\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cEat it, Boy. You know you want it\u2026you know you need it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxon tried weakly to refuse, to close his mouth but, once more, the leader just closed his nose with one hand and shoved the morsel into the kid mouth with the other, smearing his face with stew and crumbs of bread. Jaxon could do nothing to defend himself, as he found his tongue beginning to burn due to how hot the stew was, and yet, the taste was overwhelming him again. Still, choosing between choking and swallowing he had to choose the latter. As soon as the morsel was traveling down his throat a new morsel was pushed against his lips, dirtying his face even more.<br>\r\n\u201cResistance is futile\u2026enjoy the meal, Boy. There is nothing you can do to stop me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoking a bit due to the forceful feeding, Jaxon soon found himself lost in a loop, a piece of that sweet bread sponged with boar stew filling his mouth, burning his tongue and inner cheeks, forcing him to swallow it, choking on it a bit, only to be replaced by another and another still. And yet, when he tried to fight back, the shaman would shamelessly grab his nose, cutting him out of breathing, as if enjoying the pitiful attempt of resistance. As some time passed, Jaxon found himself breathless, his face covered in a layer of boar stew, dripping slowly on his clothes, his mouth bloated by the last morsel he still had in his mouth, looking desperately toward the shaman. Begging him to give him time to breath.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fight back, Boy. Submit and everything will go smoother\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxon could see the truth behind the shaman words, he could see that the guy was enjoying all of his attempts of fighting back and realized that there would be only pain if he kept at it. With a stifled burp, as he swallowed the last morsel, red trails of stew still dripping on his chin, Jaxon breathed freely a couple of time before opening his mouth in a submissive acceptance of the treatment.<br>\r\nThe Tribesman grinned in seeing the boy capitulate, as he motioned to some of his guards to bring forward the next dish. As the guards moved forward, the leader closed the distance with Jaxon, grabbing his bloating belly, caressing it and swatting it with his hands, enjoying the bouncing out of it.<br>\r\n\u201cYou growing good, Boy. Keep eating, the feast isn\u2019t over yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaxon grimaced in pain as the guy smacked his packed stomach, and yet he didn\u2019t reply, he kept his submissive stance, recovering as much as he could until a new platter was brought forward, right under his nose. This time it was a small animal cooked in the oven with a greasy sauce covering it and a few sliced oranges like fruit atop of it.<br>\r\n\u201cThis, my boy, is a delicacy of my people. It\u2019s an armadillo cooked in its own shell, with a few sliced Cocona slices to add a little lemony taste to it.\u201d As the shaman said that he grabbed a few slices of the little slimy meat and brought it toward Jaxon open mouth, placing it inside gently. The kid could do nothing but enjoy the slight tangy taste, although the meat practically melted on his tongue. After tasting the morsel for a bit, he swallowed but, the tribesman found this process to be going way too slowly and so began to shove the following cuts of meat faster and faster. Jaxon couldn\u2019t fight back, he had learned that by fighting he would only endanger himself and so tried his best to keep the pace of his feeder although, when his mouth was full, the slimy sauce began to drip out from his lips, smearing his chin even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shaman passed the feeding duty to one of his guards, he concentrated on teasing the poor boy. He started by raising his shirt up, causing the boy to stop for a moment, before being forcefully reprimanded to keep going. As the bloating belly was in front of the shaman, this one began to lick it enjoying the salty, slightly sweaty, taste of it. Giving it a few more lick and a couple of teasing bites, the shaman turned his stare on the boy, enjoying his suffering stance as he kept messily chew the slimy meats forced within his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing good, Kid. You taste real good and with all this stuffing inside of you\u2026I know you\u2019ll taste way better, soon. No, no\u2026don\u2019t speak\u2026\u201d As the leader said that, he placed one of his hands on the boy\u2019s lips, preventing him to spill anything inside of it, releasing him only when the boy mouth was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE\u2026.Enough\u2026*urp*\u2026please\u2026.you\u2019ve\u2026gotta\u2026stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman raised his hand, stopping his servants from delivering the next slices to the boy, watching closely how the kid was doing. With a manic grin he realized that the boy was coming along pretty nicely. His belly had bloated up quite a bit already, pushing out from his torso still tightly roped to the chair where he was forced to, straining against the hem of his pants, the button almost ready to pop away.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done good. You going to be great, Boy. You taste right good\u2026just need some more seasoning\u2026I will make sure you ready soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026you\u2026mean?\u201d Jaxon, tired and confused, was valiantly trying to stay awake. All those delicious cuts of meat, the boar stew and the pie he had eaten was weighing quite heavily on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat do you think I mean, boy? Why do you think we are giving you all these delicious meals? Why do you think we made you eat the Tom Pie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026want\u2026me\u2026bigger\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. But why do we want that?... Cause you\u2019re going to join us at the Tribe\u2019s dinner. And you shall be on the menu, Boy. You\u2019re going to be so tasty when everything is done. Soon, Boy\u2026 Let out Tribe thrive through your sacrifice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026You\u2026You can\u2019t mean that\u2026I\u2019ve done what you told me to\u2026I\u2019ve\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cEnough! You may rest for a bit, now. Soon though, the oven shall be welcoming you. Not yet though\u2026<br>\r\nI\u2019ll try to teach you to be grateful to the treatment you\u2019ve received. Pigs like you can only have one fate\u2026And I bet you\u2019ll look so good with an apple stuffed into your mouth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been so focused on her career that she had a nearly mental breakdown and, with her husband away filming a movie in New Zealand, she had needed to just rest somewhere while doing absolutely nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, even though she had warned her collaborators of her break, people kept calling and disturbing her relentlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this could not go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Therefore, I was calling, Frank. I can\u2019t go on like this. You\u2019re my manager, what do you suggest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Angie. The answer is easy. Hire a personal assistant to take care of this load from you. If you want, I know someone who could fill this spot easily\u2026or, as I know you like to do charity for the third world countries, I\u2019ve heard of a new agency born in west Africa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongo, I believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard around that they\u2019re good and trying to get their name known worldwide. Anyway, give me five and I\u2019ll send you both the CV\u2019s of my contacts and the agency internet site so you can check and decide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina mulled it over for a couple of hours, she quickly scanned the CV of the person forwarded by her Manager, but she was fascinated by the idea of helping out to an African agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end she went and checked their site and remained very surprised in finding out how professional and prepared they seemed to be. As she scanned their site, she saw exactly how the process would start.<br>\r\nShe was to provide details on the job and the location, then the agency would forward a selection of their employees selected exactly to her specification, for her to choose which one she would prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding herself getting excited she quickly filled out the requester form, providing as much information as she could, finding herself quite surprised when a chat-box opened informing her than an operator was going to contact her right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Miss Jolie. I\u2019m Joao Cumbu, your referral for the purpose of hiring one of ours employees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, Angelina began typing away on her keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Mr. Cumbu. I actually wasn\u2019t expecting such an immediate response.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, it\u2019s our pledge to be of service to those who are in need, especially considering your case. With how much you\u2019ve done for our countries how could we not give you our best?<br>\r\nNo, Miss, it\u2019s an honor to serve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the discussion progressed, Angelina began to have a better understanding on how things were going to work out and, a few minutes later, she was already checking the CV\u2019s they had sent to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst one was a middle-aged man, named Felipe Mbutu. He seemed to be quite a big guy, almost seven feet tall with a quite impressive amount of muscles on his body. He was supposed to be able to speak three languages, including English and French, and apparently was a masterful Chef with a degree taken in an institute in France.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond one was also a male, quite young-ish. From his picture, Joao Kingstone, seemed quite the sly guy. While not as broad as the one before him he still seemed to be quite toned. Also, he was able to speak three languages, including English and Portuguese, and while he was able to cook, he wasn\u2019t a real chef. But he had under his special characteristics section marked himself as a fitness therapist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast one was a girl, Felicia Joao Macunda. She appeared like a thirty-something, bubbly, little thing, staring at the camera with a happy smile on her face.  As the other two she also was an expert in the latest software and had mastered the English language, but she also had remarkably good organizational and household\u2019s managerial skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina checked their CV\u2019s her eyes fell once more on the list of names provided to her by her Manager, wondering if she should try with this agency or if maybe could be better to ask Frank to find someone capable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the Headquarters of the Agency Angelina was in contact with, Joao Cumbu was giving the news to his staff members, with a smile plastered to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood News everyone! We may have a new Client that will bring fame and fortune to our Tribe and Company!<br>\r\nAs of now, the world-renowned actress Angelina Jolie is taking into consideration to hire some of our brightest to help her as personal assistant. Now, it was decided that three of you had to be chosen as candidates and, while it was difficult, the Elders reached a decision\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all the employees stood from their chairs, turned toward their Manager and Tribe Leader, a total silence fell into the room, until it was broken by Cumbu who announced the three chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe Mbutu! As a Shaman for our tribe you are the most competent in the culinary skills, so if she chooses to have you, it will be your duty to fatten her up to epic proportion so to let our Tribe able to feast on her bounties for months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoao Kingstone! As our Lead Hunter who better than you to feign innocence and get her to do whatever you wish? And don\u2019t worry about food. America is one of the most fattening places on earth, all considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast, but not the least, our beloved Felicia Macunda!<br>\r\nYou, have always acted as our bait to lure the foolish into our hands, letting them feel comfortable around you as you fed them to immobility and beyond. Do the Teeth Gnasher Tribe proud, child, and bring back to us enough Angelina to have an endless feast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina then decided to hire\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks later, after all documents had been processed, Felipe finally reached his destination, entering through the main gate of Angelina Mansion. He had already been briefed on his duties, both officially and unofficially, all that remained was to meet the employer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting between them went on cordially, from the start Angelina requested to keep things informal and throughout the day she began pouring on Felipe all the information needed for him to perform his duties. In all that time Felipe made up a show for Angelina, to show her his capabilities leaving her impressed regarding her new hired assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Felipe. You sure are something else. You\u2019ve done a terrific job today. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019ve come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to serve one such as you. You\u2019ve helped my people a lot in the past, it feels right to help you back. On this note, I was wondering if I could prepare you dinner? Just to show you how much I appreciate working here for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, feeling rather embarrassed, couldn\u2019t do much more than nod, and so as she remained sprawled on the couch, watching her television, Felipe was busying himself around the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s going to be on the menu, tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Miss. I\u2019m going to show you a taste of Africa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Oh yes. You\u2019ll see Angelina. Not for nothing I\u2019m the shaman of my tribe. Nobody knows as much as me about herbs and spices. I\u2019ll make you a meal that will place you right where I want you to be.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, we find Angelina asleep on her couch while the television keeps on babbling about. She\u2019s enjoying the peaceful rest and, somewhat ruefully, she wakes up hearing the voice of her assistant calling to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Miss, dinner\u2019s ready. Miss\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...What time is it? Oh, Felipe? It\u2019s already time for dinner? You should have woken me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss was sleeping so peacefully; I couldn\u2019t force myself to wake her up before everything was ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she rose from the couch and walked toward the dining room, but upon entering the room she stood on the doorway speechless. On the table there wasn\u2019t, literally, an inch of free space that wasn\u2019t occupied by some plate or dish prepared by her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026F-Felipe? Did you invite an army for dinner? That is way too much food only for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I actually didn\u2019t mean to prepare this much but, I wanted to thank you for the chance you\u2019re giving me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, appreciating the gesture, the actress sat at the table, inviting her assistant to join her, as she still looked dumbfounded at the quantity of food spread out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026From which dish we should start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, let me, Miss. Here, this is a typical stew from the ancestors of the south of Africa. It is prepared with various cuts of meat, potatoes, onions and some banana\u2019s peels\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe kept going in describing the recipe, he also poured a substantial amount in Angelina\u2019s plate, adding in the end a bit of spice he had with himself, making sure that the actress wasn\u2019t watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina tried the stew her expression changed. A smile a mile wide appeared on her face, as she began to consume eagerly the stew, feeling as it spread a pleasurable heat within her body. Even though it wasn\u2019t a small portion, the actress polished it off in a matter of minutes as she began to let her hungry star wander around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, you could try some of this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said moving a plate with a perfectly cooked steak and some roasted onions toward the actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one has been prepared through an old family recipe. After preparing the steak, before placing it on the stove to be cooked, you let it rest a few minutes within some palm trees bark, letting the aroma from the tree bark to flow into the meat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following hour Angelina found herself unable to stop eating. Everything tasted so good that she couldn\u2019t stop, even if she wanted to. Still, even though lots of food was still on the table, as soon as Felipe judged that the actress was nearly full, he intervened and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Is getting late\u2026Since tomorrow will be a busy day wouldn\u2019t be best if\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress stopped herself just as she was grabbing some more bread buns from the table and, gulping down her bite, she let out a small giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Felipe. Still, all my compliments. Everything was perfect. If it isn\u2019t too much trouble, would you mind\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman grinned wickedly as he nodded to the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, Miss. It will be my pleasure to prepare all of your meals if that is your wish...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026everything tasted divine\u2026If I weren\u2019t so full, I may still have something else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman smiled inwardly, thinking back to the spice he had used. It was a rare combination of herbs that in the tribe was often used to help their meals to willingly fatten themselves up. Not only was it odorless and tasteless, but it was highly addictive, and it also acted as a slight hunger enhancement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe chuckled within himself as he saw Angelina Jolie walk away from the dining room cradling her stuffed belly, and he couldn't stop himself from imagining how would she look like a few months in the future if he could manage to plan all of her meals and daily activities.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he kept updating his own appointment calendar, he already began to sort out those offer he was going to downplay and those he wanted to have Angelina take in consideration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was sorting them out, he noticed a missed appointment from the last month and decided to investigate upon it. Quickly he found out it was a meeting request coming from a consortium made of the major Fast Food Companies trying to hire Angelina as a spokesperson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Felipe saw an opportunity and began taking steps to correct the situation, as he called the number used as reference.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Felipe Mbutu, Miss Jolie Personal Assistant. As I was checking through her schedule, I noticed an invitation to a meeting bearing this number. Could I have some more information, for I believe there has been some miscommunication issue in this regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Uh-uh\u2026Oh, I see. Yes, there must have been some misunderstanding from my predecessor part. No, no, I\u2019m sure Miss Jolie will be quite interested in this proposition, especially if some of the points indicated in the circular here are placed under a major focus.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUh-uh\u2026Yes\u2026Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I mean. Correct, also, if I may be so bold, I would suppose there could be some more incentives included for Miss Jolie. No, nothing as petty as more money but, maybe, something that could also be\u2026let\u2019s call it \u2018free publicity\u2019 for your employers Companies as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yes, exactly. I see we understand each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no compensation is needed, nor wanted, on my part. I\u2019m just trying to perform my job in giving the most lucrative while most relaxing opportunities to my employer. Yes, I shall inform her the soonest. Have a nice day, will call you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe hung up a new plan was hatching in his mind, one that would help him speed up the growth of Miss Jolie under his care. In addition to that, as they stopped for lunch, he didn\u2019t have to pry too much in having Angelina decide to have lunch at McDonald. And that alone was a small, victory for his plans as he wanted to start promoting the job offer, he had discovered only that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered in the McDonald, they both sat at a booth, ordering up as per their own tastes. Felipe ordering a medium sized meal, while Angelina decided on a very small meal consisting mostly of a Caesar salad. As they slowly ate Felipe decided to broach the matter of the new job offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Angelina, as I was checking your appointments to fit in your weekly schedule I noticed a job proposal coming from a Consortium of Fast Food dealers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph\u2026Not so fond of those. Still, it can\u2019t hurt to hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, their offer surely has to be checked in detail but, as far as they anticipated they were asking for your presence to join in a few commercials for some of their affiliates. Apparently it won\u2019t be a long job but it should bring good profits\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot inter\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, they were talking about some fund raising to improve sensibility toward third country nations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh\u2026that is new. Did they say anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she asked for more info, she didn\u2019t realize Felipe had moved his fries toward her and was watching with glee as she begun eating them one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually they mentioned quite the offer but, before proceeding with any details I thought it was best to have your confirmation. Also, comparing this offer to other, while less popular, it surely seems less tiring and more adapt to a more conservative plan long term.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s true I wanted to have a break from all activities, but it also is true that I can\u2019t completely go sitting on laurels.<br>\r\nAlright, take contact with their representative and start the discussion with them, be sure that they\u2019ll have to proceed with that fund raising and be aware that I won\u2019t work for less than\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, more and more snacks passed from Felipe\u2019s hand to Angelina\u2019s stomach, without her recognizing how much she was eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, when they returned to the mansion, Angelina did notice that she appeared to be somewhat bloated. Fortunately, she dismissed the thought as she decided for a quick shower before going to the gym for her daily exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, although sorry of seeing her burn all those calories he had forced onto her during the day, didn\u2019t do anything to prevent her, knowing full well that in a few weeks her schedule was going to change completely. After-all, he now had to contact the Fast Food Consortium and had to use all of his negotiation skills to obtain as much as he could, while having Miss Jolie do the less work as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, Angelina emerged from her shower after a long workout session in her private gym, as she dressed in a pair of short shorts and a t-shirt she moved toward the dining room where she found Felipe applying the finishing touches to the table already covered with a few platters from which a delicious aroma emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe, I can\u2019t thank you enough. Not only you\u2019re taking care of my schedule but you also are cooking for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure, Miss. Now, sit and enjoy, I will gladly serve you dinner, as I will tell you what job offers I have received today for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat, Angelina soon fell prey once more to the delicate, and yet delicious, plates that he had prepared for her. As good as they were she found herself enthralled with them, taking no notice of how much she was actually eating. Also, she was only half hearing as he talked to her about the various job offering, letting him decide which he thought would be best for her. As dinner was reaching the end and only dessert remained, he decided to make his move toward the only offer he thought was best for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and so, Miss Angelina, there is the offer from the Consortium we received this morning. In the afternoon I went in detail on their offer and tried to get as much as possible without appearing grabby. In the end, we agreed on a certain set of conditions which are already into the draft of contract I will give you, all toward having you to be their spokesperson for twenty-four months, while having to do no less than three short commercials and a few photoshoots for them in the span of two years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve agreed on these terms considering your desire to keep yourself active, while having also time for your own relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, her mind clouded with food, nodded slowly as she happily dug in the pie slice Felipe had given her while talking. But even though she was engrossed in her dessert she had to admit to herself that he had done a really good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterall, it was her directive to have a less tiring role in the foreseeable future and so this job offering seemed good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about\u2026*gulp*\u2026the fund raising?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that. It took a while but I managed to have it confirmed and also, if you\u2019re ok with it, I managed to fit something else in it too. Basically, for every product you, or yours, will be purchasing from the affiliates of the Consortium, an amount calculated on a certain percentage will be included in the fund raising so to increase its actual value exponentially, while your own expenses will be covered by the Consortium itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026*munch*\u2026If I understood correctly, I buy from them with their money, and they will increase the fund raiser by a fixed amount? That is great. Although I don\u2019t know if I would have to buy so much from them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut even a small amount would be beneficial to the fund. Plus, just think of how much the fund itself could grow with your free contributions\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, having finished the slice, began to tiredly nodding to the proposal, giving her written confirmation to the contract by signing it as she began to rise from the table cradling her, once more, stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Felipe question if she wanted to review it herself she simply answered that with the excellent job he had done she was sure there was nothing to re-check. Saying her good night to him she began walking toward her bedroom, when she was stopped by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? I\u2019ve noticed that you may feel quite\u2026bloated. If you need I can prepare you an herbal tea that will solve that issue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Felipe. That would be a godsend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will come right away then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe prepared the tea, he had only to decide which effect he wanted to achieve with it. He could prepare a Tea that would slow down her metabolism, making her sluggish and more prone to laziness, or maybe he could mix a few spices and herbs and have her hunger grow steadily stronger as well as enabling her to eat more and more in one sitting. Or maybe he could prepare a drink that would make her body more receptive toward fat, making her gain weight way more easily. Or, to play it safe, he could simply make her a soothing tea to help her feeling better.<br>\r\nSo many choices\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Angelina went to sleep, with the herbal Tea in her belly, she quickly fell asleep feeling better already, unaware that her own body chemistry was going to change severely in the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days passed, a routine began to establish itself in Angelina\u2019s Mansion. <br>\r\nFrom morning to evening, she and Felipe would go through their daily appointments. With him checking and screening them from her eyes, making sure that the following weeks and months were as work free as possible, while Angelina began to rest more and more, enjoying the break in her life. However, as she rested all day long, taking a liking to Felipe\u2019s Tea, she didn\u2019t seem to notice that her meals and her snacking sessions kept increasing both in frequency and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days of this trend, as lunchtime approached, she stopped Felipe from making one of his meals, asking him a favor instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe, I\u2019m feeling quite puckish today, could you please order me something from one of the affiliate from the Consortium? This way I get also to increase the fund raising, won\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, Miss. So, what should I order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know\u2026How about a\u2026no; make it two medium sized Big Whooper meals. With fries and soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for dessert\u2026mmh\u2026could you prepare me some of those brownies you made a few days ago? They were really yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, Miss. Also, don\u2019t forget to have your tea before Lunch, so to increase the soothing effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream to forget it. Since I started drinking your Tea, it seems I haven\u2019t had any other stomach pain. Thanks Felipe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina returned to her break on her couch, Felipe quickly went into the kitchen heating up a few platter of his famed chocolate brownies, made from extra chocolate with the addition of being extremely addictive. As the brownies were heating up, he also ordered the requested food except, he didn\u2019t order medium sized as it was requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and please, could you supersize it all? Why, thank you very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe wasn\u2019t taking any chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that most of her appointments were over, by having most of them screened out through Angelina\u2019s food addled decisions, he could focus on having Angelina start relaxing more and more. Sure, he couldn\u2019t yet go all out on her since she still had to have a presentable figure to show for the McDonald commercials. But if he managed to train her to eat more, to stop exercising and to avoid detecting her own gains, he would be in a very good position to have her reach the first milestone of five hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still a long way away but he could do it. <br>\r\nHe was certain of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to take out the first two platter of twenty-four brownies from the oven, he heard the doorbell ringing. Knowing it had to be the delivery guy he swiftly went to door and collected the goods from the guy, quickly bringing them to Angelina which accepted the load without any fuss, focused as she was on the soap opera on screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe stood motionless, watching as she gave the first bite to the big hamburger, chewing it slowly, as a low moan of satisfaction escaped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod\u2026I so needed this\u2026I swear, I must be working out too much. I\u2019m always craving food\u2026gotta have to slow down a bit from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe heard that, he felt like he was going to heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, thing first, though. He had to bring her the brownies and had to organize as soon as possible the commercial shoot, so after that he could completely focus on fattening her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he returned to Angelina he almost gasped in delight in seeing her chewing fries by the handful, as her belly began to stick out from under the tight t-shirt she was wearing, and yet she kept shoveling those oily treats into her mouth, as she kept watching the tv show. As he saw this, Felipe, went and called his contact from the Consortium, hastily reserving a spot for Angelina the following day to take the commercial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, the two of them spent the entire morning and most of the afternoon at the designated location for Angelina\u2019s commercial of McDonald and their food. Due to the urgency of the request, they barely stopped for lunch but also this worked as an advantage for Felipe\u2019s plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as soon as they were back at the mansion, as Angelina was feeling starving, she didn\u2019t comment on having Felipe preparing her dinner while also ordering out some Chinese takeout. As he prepared a plentiful dinner, he listened attentively to the sound coming from the TV room where Angelina was now parked watching her favorite show, while scarfing down some Chinese food. As soon as he heard her stop, he quickly moved to her side, enjoying the view of the beached Angelina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was laying on her couch, more asleep than awake, as she unconsciously caressed her taut stomach, which seemed to be glowing under the lights coming from the TV. Felipe almost shrieked in joy as he realized that his Mistress was laying there with her shorts unbuttoned as her belly requested more room that she had available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Miss, everything ok?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, still half asleep murmured contently as she heard his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026just resting a bit\u2026feel so tired\u2026worked too much today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe knew that apart from a few lines said in the commercial and a few photos taken she hadn\u2019t done that much but, why he should have pointed it out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Miss but, see it this way. Now the next event you\u2019re requested to participate in will be in a month. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to recover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh\u2026good.<br>\r\nFelipe? When dinner will be ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably an hour or so. Do you need anything?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I should go for a workout but I feel so drained, so tired\u2026do you have anything that could \u2018pick me up\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled widely as he bowed slightly, she had just eaten a small sized Chinese dinner and yet she was asking for something more. It was a good opportunity to test the capacity of her stomach after she had used it for almost two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could prepare you a bit of a Health shake, to give you a small boost of energy, if you desire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Felipe, do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the man returned to Angelina, bringing with him a pitcher full of a dense pink shake, leaving it near his Mistress, with a straw emerging from it so she could simply drink it without having to move an inch. As he saw Angelina began drinking from it, smiling as she did, he couldn\u2019t refrain from thinking back at what was inside the \u2018Health Shake\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Heavy cream, sugar, powdered vanilla, six spoonsful of a bulk-up powder and a pinch of my herbal hunger mix. I wonder if she will be able to finish it and have dinner also\u2026</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina felt like she was in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drank the energy shake Felipe had prepared for her, she felt a soothing heat spreading throughout her body. Still laying on her couch she drank fervently the shake, enjoying the taste of it, without noticing that her belly began to poke more and more from under her t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay there, mesmerized by the TV show, suddenly waking up when she heard the sound from her straw as it scraped against the now empty pitcher bottom. Stifling a burp, she rose from the couch, feeling her pants a little snug against her body as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn\u2019t connect that feeling to all the food she had consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she could recollect from her, so tiring, day she hadn\u2019t eaten all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Probably it just shrank in the washing machine.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she didn\u2019t want to be seen in a tight-fitting pants, even though she was in the privacy of her own home. But, as she entered the hallway, she smelled the delicious aromas coming from the kitchen and was torn between the desire of going in there to have a bit of appetizer and the need to go change herself in more comfortable clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the best thing to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as she was in her room, she quickly stripped off her clothes, although she found some difficulty in taking off her t-shirt and for a moment, she stood in front of her mirror looking at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that her abs seemed less definite, while her body overall seemed slightly thicker than she used to remember but, in the end, she dismissed such thoughts. Her belly was just bloated, and she probably was too tired to be able to see such slight differences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot once, she thought back to all those junk food meals and snacks she had in the previous days, or about the long dinners Felipe had prepared for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything simply was dismissed from her mind as she just grabbed a pair of somewhat larger sweatpants and roomy sweatshirt, putting them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling now comfortable, she left her room and went to the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crossed the hallway, smelling the aromas coming from the dining room, she felt her belly grumble in anticipation and so she moved a little bit faster, arriving just in time to see Felipe placing a dessert plate on the table, motioning her to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, since you\u2019ve had such a hard day, I prepared a slightly more filling dinner. I hope you enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Felipe, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, If you don\u2019t mind\u2026Now that your weekly schedule is more malleable, I was thinking if you would like for me to plan your daily activities, so to match the rest you so much desire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, as she filled her plate with a couple of portions from the pan of lasagna he had prepared, simply nodded starting to wolf down the heavy and rich dish, moaning in pleasure at the amazing taste exploding in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph\u2026*gulp*\u2026oh yeah, Felipe. Please to do that. This way I will be able to rest completely at peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, Miss. Will start working on it right this evening and will try to bring it to you tomorrow morning. <br>\r\nHow is the lasagna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s perfect. Such a taste\u2026No wonder you\u2019re a masterful chef.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thanks Miss. But try also the veal, I prepared this sauce to go along with it that should have made the meat to almost melt in your mouth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meal progressed, Felipe was happy to verify that Angelina\u2019s consumptions had increased greatly. Even though she had already eaten a small dinner and a large pitcher of heavy cream shake, she also ate most of what he had prepared for her for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Angelina kept on eating, bite after bite, morsel after morsel, without noticing how her own belly was bloating up from all the food she was scarfing down.<br>\r\nSure, it was hidden within the sweatshirt but, still he could see the faint outline of it as it grew with every portion she consumed. Alas, although her hunger had been strengthened in the past weeks, she eventually reached the point of fullness as she had just scarfed down a third helping of dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof\u2026*urp*\u2026ohh\u2026that was\u2026so good, Felipe. I\u2019ve never been so content in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear it Miss. Could I offer you something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026No, I\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even some chocolate cookies to have as a small snack to go along with your after-dinner tea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t\u2026oh, alright. But just a small plate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled, as he handed her the 1-liter bottle of his herbal tea, along with a bowl chocked full of chocolate cookies, which he had prepared personally, adding way more butter to the batter than needed. And he smiled even more as he saw Angelina take the bowl without a fuss regarding the size of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had her all for himself, he was surely going to let her grow as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, from her side, went directly to bed; snuggling under the cover as she started the plasma screen TV she had mounted on the wall. As she did some zapping, she began chugging down the tea she had started to love, feeling it soothing her overburdened stomach. Yet, after a few minutes, she laid in bed she felt herself compelled in trying a cookie from the bowl Felipe had given to her. As she tasted the first one, she was immediately hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are so Good! Goodness, they\u2019re so soft and yet so tasty. Mmmm\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept eating the cookies, she began unconsciously to caress her bloated belly with her free hand, easing the tightness she was feeling there. And yet, she couldn\u2019t refrain from having more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the bowl was half-full she began to drowsily lay back in her bed, feeling completely sated and satisfied, as she was lulled to sleep by the television that was still on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, the television was still on and left on a specific channel that, without her knowledge, was going to influence her through the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe channel it was left on was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And although she dreamt of these massive meals, in her dreams she never gained an ounce. She just ate and ate with reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning rolled on, Angelina woke up feeling strangely ravenous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered about dreaming something spectacular, but she couldn\u2019t put the finger on what it had been so good. Yet, as her belly growled once more, she rose from her bed and began to take off her PJ\u2019s while wearing a spandex outfit that hugged her figure well, while also having a small pre-breakfast with the few handfuls of cookies that had been left in the bowl she had the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she freshened herself up, she left her room and found Felipe hard at work in the kitchen, while a place at the table was already prepared for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Miss, I hope you\u2019ve rested well tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I had a few good dreams tonight and am feeling refreshed and ready for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Also, I prepared a little bit of breakfast for you, to start the day in the right swing and your daily schedule, if you want to give it a check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina nodded silently as she began reading the schedule while, at the same time, she began eating the breakfast Felipe had prepared her. For starters she assaulted a large bowl chocked full of dense chocolate cream, having spoonful after spoonful to her lips, moaning silently as the taste enveloped her. As she cleaned the bowl, she didn\u2019t stop there, grabbing the nearer plate and revealing a large stack of cluffy pancakes smothered in butter and drowned in syrup. Once more, the taste surrounded her and, without even noticing, she cleared the plate in a record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept clearing plate after plate, she also checked the schedule Felipe had prepared her but didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. Sure, there were a lot of rest times and snack times in it, but as she was distracted by the onslaught of food in front of her, she dismissed the issue, focusing only on what she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally cleaned her third plate, mostly cookies and some pop-tarts, she burped lightly and looked toward Felipe with a strange glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhi, Felipe\u2026Could you do me a favor?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSure, Miss. What do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you prepare, for next time, some slightly bigger portions? I\u2019m feeling still quite hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Miss. So, can I offer you something more? I was just preparing some brownies for later but I can give you some, if you need it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina didn\u2019t reply she simply cleaned her mouth and eagerly awaited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew minutes later, she was happily eating away at her first dozen of brownies, as the second and third dozen was placed right beside her by an enthusiastic Felipe. As the day progressed, the actress didn\u2019t move from the kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there, eating away at whatever concoction Felipe urged onto her, uncaring of her own belly, which began to grow more and more round as food kept being shoveled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress was in heaven, she wasn\u2019t exactly hungry but, the food was so good she just couldn\u2019t stop shoveling it down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was worse was that as much as she wanted to stop, every time Felipe left a new platter beside her she just couldn\u2019t stop herself from having some of it\u2026and then some became all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlate after plate, she kept eating away all morning long, as breakfast food like pancakes and fried bacon, became snacks like small cakes and pastries, until it almost arrived lunch time and so Felipe began giving her burgers and fries. With an all morning and lunch feast, it is comprehensible to say that by 2 PM, Angelina was at her very own limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffed beyond her wildest dream she simply lay there on her chair, a mountain of empty plates surrounding her, and her own belly so big and round that, she could start using it as her own table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe watched her with pride in his eyes. She had performed so well, all it was needed was a bit of hunger enhancement in her food and she had eaten up to exhaustion. Yet, he couldn\u2019t afford to let her see how much she had really eaten. Therefore, while she slept and digested in her food coma, he quickly cleaned most of her dirty plates, leaving just a couple around her. This way, when she woke up, he could convince her to have been eating only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, nothing could prepare him to what he was going to hear as soon as she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe was preparing some more food, just in case she requested something else when Angelina suddenly woke up from her slumber. She tiredly stretched a little bit, feeling some tightness in her clothes but dismissing it as a more powerful desire forced its way through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe? Do you know how much did I exercise today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026quite a lot actually. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.Mmm\u2026I\u2019m just so hungry\u2026 I want...No, I need you to order me some takeout\u2026and could you give me something to tide me over until it arrives? I was thinking Mexican or even Chinese\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled as he joked, \u201cWhy not having both?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile disappeared when the actress smiled drunkenly as she answered \u201cWhy not, indeed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been an exhausting week for Felipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know what happened, his hunger enhancement herbs hadn\u2019t ever caused such an effect, so he was raking his brain for something that could explain the different behavior in Angelina. She had acted as if starving all week long, always eating up to her bursting point. He wanted so bad to feel proud of her but, in truth, he was worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had grown slowly, she would have had the time to grow accustomed to eating massive meals. But that sudden spike in hunger could very well cause her to realize how big she was getting and disrupt everything he had worked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time for breakfast rolled in, Felipe began preparing a large sized breakfast for his Mistress, keeping ready seconds in case she was still that hungry. Eventually he heard her footsteps coming from the hallway and greeted her gently as she appeared at the doorway, even though he had faltered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina surely had grown in her hunger fueled week of feastings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Felipe had arrived in the US Angelina was roughly around the 140/150 pounds of nicely distributed weight, but after their first week together and the last week of complete gluttony she seemed to have jumped right up to the 200 pounds range. As she walked toward the kitchen table Felipe could see the muffin top and soon-to-be-gut appearing from over the short shorts she was wearing, as also her sweater shirt failed to cover it from above. Her ass too seemed to have absorbed a lot of damage, growing plushier and wider, and it jiggled slightly at her every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Felipe\u2026I feel so tired lately\u2026am also quite hungry for some reason\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Miss, You\u2019re working out so harshly in the last few weeks, it\u2019s only natural to feel tired and hungry.<br>\r\nDon\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina sat, feeling strangely more comfortable on her chair, staring at the spread of food on the table she smiled at her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Felipe\u2026you\u2019re a godsend. Still, if you see me overwork myself remember to stop me\u2026Also that is part of your job. You\u2019ve gotta help me keep track of what I am doing. So, if you see me go away from the weekly schedule, let me know at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe could hardly contain himself, not only she seemed to have returned to normal, but she also told him to stop her if she was over-exerting herself. That was a huge advantage for his quest to have the actress fattening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, Miss. And, if I may, you should start right away with breakfast, otherwise you will be late for you tanning session late this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina licked her lips as she grabbed a large twinkie from the table, diving it into one of the large shakes in front of her, before chomping on it with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you start right away. That\u2019s *munch* good Felipe. Mh\u2026Delicious\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress then began mowing down all plates in front of her, clearing out pancakes smothered in butter and syrup, fried bacon strips and even a couple of quite large slices of devil\u2019s food cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Burp!* Oh, sorry\u2026t\u2019was so good\u2026everything\u2026tasted divine, Felipe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Miss, I\u2019m happy you enjoyed it. Now, it\u2019s time for you tanning session. I\u2019ll come help you out in two hours\u2026in the meantime, here, have a little shake to give you a boost of energies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress, even though had just cleaned out enough breakfast food for a family of three, gladly accepted the heavy weight gain shake, as she began drinking from it with gusto. As she made her way toward the tanning room, her ass and hips seemed to swell slightly larger, as well as her belly that was rounding out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the tanning room Angelina quickly undressed herself and began to lay on the tanning bed, when she noticed that right where the headrest was, there was a strange straw awaiting her. Quickly scanning the room she realized it had to be an innovation from Felipe and, as she sucked a couple of times from it she moaned in pleasure feeling the same shake she had just consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued she moved closer and noticed a note left on the wall, right above the point from where the \u2018straw\u2019 came out of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Miss Angelina, <br>\r\nI\u2019ve prepared a little something should you get tired as you tan yourself.<br>\r\nEnjoy.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress smiled as she, unknowingly, caressed her bloated belly. Still she soon laid on her tanning bed and, straw between her lips, began to enjoy the delicious shake as she lay there. She couldn\u2019t know that all that shake she was drinking down was going to add way more than a few pounds on her body. After half an hour, she already was filling out, as he body worked overspeed to store all the calories it was receiving as fat. Her whole form began to slowly bloat up and fill out, her ass growing larger and more jiggly as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the wall, Felipe worked hard and long to constantly refill the barrel of gain shake from which Angelina was drinking while tanning. It was hard work for him, but he knew it was necessary to let her grow accustomed to having more and more calories pumped in her system until it became the new normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he could focus on making her even lazier and hungrier, making so that her new normal was going to seem only a pittance of what she needed to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He had only to keep feeding her as much as he could\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Angelina Jolie began to lose track of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she followed the plan that her assistant prepared for her she soon found herself often spacing out in front of a television screen, either watching some soaps or playing a few games he had suggested her to try. More often than not, during these times, she also had quite a bit to eat. It was easy actually, as she simply sat there watching, listening or playing, she would just grab a handful of candies, or some chocolates left lying around and brought them into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste soon began to be the only thing she would remember of those sessions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer working out time seemed also to be reduced more and more as the weeks passed on. Felipe often chided her for stressing out too much on it, even though she had felt to be doing it only for few minutes. Still, he had hired him just for that and so, when he called her, she stopped what she was doing and resumed the weekly schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMealtimes instead had seemed to be occupying most of her time. <br>\r\nLonger breakfast, lunches and dinners became soon the usual, and when she got used to them a lot of snacking times seemed to pop up everywhere. Still Angelina could see that everything was having a beneficial effect on her, all things considered. She was surely more relaxed and laid back than ever, she barely cared about what was going on outside her apartment and her working schedule had been equally forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe had said to her once, \u2018Why worry about a job that is only stress inducing? You have more than enough to live comfortably until the end of times. It is so cruel to just lay back and rest?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized it wasn\u2019t and had to thanks only Felipe for that. Still, there were sometimes situations that seemed to awake her from her relaxing stance. That morning, as example, three weeks after her first tanning session with Felipe\u2019s shake, she had just woken up and rapidly consumed her pre-breakfast fit for five people all by herself. As she swallowed down the last morsel of fried bacon, she began to dress herself, which was becoming a chore lately, for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began by sitting on her bed and grabbing the sweatpants that she usually used. These were a bit tight the week before, but she hadn\u2019t really taken notice of it. Sure, she had felt them getting tighter but, since food was often presented to her right after that her concentration slipped and she focused on the tasty morsels presented to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that morning she placed first one foot and then the other inside the pants, then she began to lift them up but notice that, right after the knee, the pants did seem to meet some resistance. Thanks to her three weeks of unbridled gluttony, Angelina had gained quite a big amount already, including also the spices used by Felipe to boost even more her own capacity and hunger, it wasn\u2019t hard to see how easily she had gained weight. Still, Angelina, heaved harder and harder trying to fit a pair of pants three sizes too small on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBewildered, she did let go the pants and, slowly, managed to stand up on her own. For a moment she looked at herself through a mirror. She noticed that her face seemed less squared and more rounded up, as her arms also seemed fluffier ad with a hint of jiggle in them. Then she looked at her middle, where once she had a definite slim belly, now there was only a large gut protruding forward. Curiously she grabbed the last belly roll and lifted it, noticing that even her undies seemed to have started becoming tighter on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned around and saw her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile always appeared on her face when she saw it iggle at her every movement, as if she was admiring a nice plumped ass, and not the huge, fat filled, monstrosity she had. Turning a little bit more, she realized that something seemed to have been placed there and, with a quick manual check she realized it was the herbal tea container shehad thought of having lost from her morning breakfast. Not even for a moment she though f having an ass so large that it was a shelf by it own presence. She simply grabbed it and emptied it i her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had to dress\u2026or did she? Since nothing seemed to fit, except a large t-shirt she had started using as pajama, due to her maid doing the worst laundry ever, she simply decided to go down into the kitchen as she was. After all, Felipe didn\u2019t seem to mind.  As she moved she realized also that by walking normally her thighs began to rub against the other, with a low growl she simply spread her legs apart and began to waddle, without realizing she actually was waddling. As Angelia reached the kitchen she saw Felipe already at work, greeting her and starting with what had become their daily routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Felipe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to start a new day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Felipe motioned her to come over, noticing how she had become to waddle, pointing to a usual spot on the floor where a scale had been placed a few weeks ago. Angelina then would simply walk upon it and Felipe was to warn her for any fluctuation in her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood there, waiting in silence, she couldn\u2019t refrain herself from licking her lips from time to time. After almost a month of constantly snacking it was difficult for her to pass the time without eating anything. Seeing that, Felipe swiftly passed her a pan of freshly made brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Miss. You might start with this before proceeding with your first breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs The once lithe actress gulped down the sweet confectionaries, Felipe checked her weight, smiling widely in seeing her in her almost naked glory. He had no worries about her being able to see the scale, her globular belly was big enough to cover it completely from her point f view. As she kneeled he was happy to mark in his own notepad that she had gained another four pounds since the day before, bringing her to a rather hefty two hundred and eighty six pounds. As he stood up, taking the now empty pan from her hands, he was glad to announce her that she hadn\u2019t loss, nor gained anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026There is a minor fluctuation but we\u2019re talking of grams\u2026so no need to worry about that, Miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina could only smile I appreciation. It had been a condition she had placed before following his schedule and was glad it was working. This way she could see immediately if she was relaxing too much or not. Still, with that taken care she quickly took place at her usual spot, covering two chairs with her own ass, and swiftly tied a rather large napkin at her neck, preparing herself for her first breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Felipe, began to provide her with several huge portions of breakfast food, from muffins, to pancakes, from donuts to pies, from slice of cakes to tubs of ice cream. Angelina happily ate at her leisure, feeling the pleasurable weight of all that food in her growing belly. As several plates were being cleared, Felipe gave her the herbal tea she had grown used to drink every time she finished a meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still hadn\u2019t realized that a few minutes after having drank that her hunger returned. Still, as she cleared her twelfth plate of food, she finally laid back, caressing her stomach soothingly feeling it under her fingers quite soft and squishy. After no more than fifteen minutes, as she felt her hunger returning to her, Felipe told her it was time for her second breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile she began to dig in once more, uncaring toward the fact that her over-sized shirt had become to feel a little bit tight on her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the actress the morning passed away in a constant deluge of treats, but then, with three breakfast meals safely stowed in her bloated gut, she laid back in her chair, feeling finally full. Still, she slowly rose from there and began the slow waddle, made even more slow due to all the food she had consumed, until she reached her next stop for the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once there she sat down, feeling her bloated idle slap heavily against her thighs and began to watch the soaps to which she had grown addicted to. Felipe had sai that they were a good way to defuse stress but she had never imagined she could actually end loving them to that point. As she sat there, legs spread widely to give her belly room to breathe, she once more felt herself growing peckish. Not for a moment she thought that her third breakfast had ended less than twenty minutes before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply was getting hungry again. Luckily for her Felipe ha arranged the schedule by himself and knew when the Actress would start feeling hungry and when she was going to be full, so, just as Angelina was thinking of calling for a snack, here arrived Felipe carrying a couple of trolley with himself. At first he simply began to stuff Angelina\u2019s mouth with food, almost forcing her to swallow hot dogs and chicken nuggets, but then, as she appeared temporarily satisfied he simply began to surround her figure with more and more plates of junk food. Huge, greasy hamburgers, oversized hot dogs, Deep fried chicken in carton buckets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe moved back since he loved seeing this scene, it was something that everyday repeated. One of the few constants of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he saw Angelina\u2019s hand move along the goods surrounding her, stopping near one of the nearest plate and grabbing one of the huge triple hamburger he had left at her side. Then, the hand grabbed it and lifted it, bringing it to her mouth where she passed the next few minutes biting, chewing it and swallow it, until the hand was empty and moved back to search for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as he enjoyed watching he wanted to try something. True, she was capable of feeding herself, when in this state but, what would have happened if it was him providing her with food, letting her hands rest down, so she wouldn\u2019t move a single muscle in her body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he wanted to enjoy the view of the fattened Angelina from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering his courage, he approached her just as her hand was moving again toward a new bowl, stopping her from finishing the move. Then, as he felt her pitiful attempt to get free from his hold he whispered in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Miss, let me help you with that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina didn\u2019t reply but, her hand fell softly within his hold and she nodded slowly so Felipe moved swiftly beside the growing behemoth and brought to her lips, making sure to not obscure her vision, another of those large hamburgers. He kept it there, against her lips, letting her have half of it in her mouth, before biting on it and starting to chew it. He then kept it close there, waiting for her to swallow, and in the meantime, he used his free hand to feel her growing belly. As he heard her gulping down her mouthful, he quickly directed the rest of the burger toward her lips, as he stood there mesmerized by her mouth as she took the other half of the bread within her lips. Still, his free had didn\u2019t stop, it kept rubbing and grabbing, playing with her luscious, and growing, belly, as it hang over her undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This process repeated itself for the entire two hours of the show, and Felipe was relentless in providing more and more food to Angelina, even when she tried to show some restraint, as if feeling herself reaching again her fullness point, and yet with delicious food placed right under her nose and in front of her lips she couldn\u2019t resist but start once more eating. Still, as the show ended, Felipe quickly moved away, letting the actress to return in herself finding, as it had now become the norm, herself stuffed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMm\u2026Oh hey Felipe\u2026Guess I got distracted by the show\u2026everything is alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is, Miss Angelina. We still have half an hour before first lunch, if you want to refresh yourself or have a quick nap\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress, loudly yawning, brought her jiggly arms in the air, until she just placed herself back on the couch, feeling that a quick nap was going to be just the perfect choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah..I think a nap does sounds good. Please, wake me up when Lunch is ready\u2026I don\u2019t want to fall behind the schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe bowed and left her sleeping, as he confirmed that he was going to wake her up in time. As he returned to the kitchen, to verify how the food was coming along, he couldn\u2019t yet stop remembering the feeling of all that soft, squishy, fat under his fingers as he had played with her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he checked the various pan and called one more to the various food delivery he had contacted for lunch, he also took out a phone he hadn\u2019t touch since arriving in the US and began to make a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Felipe Mbutu on the line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the phone he heard the voice of his Tribe Chief asking him for an update.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s coming along nicely. Soon we will hit the big three. By year\u2019s end I count she could be ready to be transported home. There we\u2019ll just have to let her grow some more and then she would be ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing some minor comments and his praises, the Tribe chief hung up the call and Felipe returned to his pans. Soon, though, he heard the doorbell ring and sent one of the aids in the house to go and collect the food. And few minutes later a whole lot of junk food lay on the kitchen table, ready to be consumed. As he applied his finishing touches to the lunch of Angelina, mainly adding spices that were going to boost her consumption and the caloric absorption, he checked the time and went to collect Angelina, waking her up and helping her waddle to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there he stood his ground watching as the woman that had hired him almost a month before, began once more to eat an ungodly amount of food, clearing out pans of lasagna, rows of greasy hamburgers, buckets of fried chicken, all by herself, before stopping feeling her hugely bloated belly weighing her down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, Felipe\u2026Everything you make is so good. I swear, I could grow so Fat if it wasn\u2019t you who prepared these dishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, still seating on her two chairs, kept caressing her bloated middle as she spoke to her trusty aide who swiftly offered her the herbal tea, she was so fond of. Felipe, sensing an opportunity, proceeded in giving her directly the jug of tea, instead of offering her the cup filled with it. The actress didn\u2019t seem to mind as she simply grabbed the jug and emptied it in one, long, sitting. Few minutes later as she was still enjoying the sensation of her full stomach, she felt herself growing hungry once more. Used now to this effect, she simply reasoned that the diet on which Felipe had placed her was working normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026*urp*\u2026Felipe, it time for second lunch, already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is, Miss. Please, enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn\u2019t wait more than few moments before she was digging again through the mountain of junk food he had brought under her eyes. She felt her hunger as it seemed to be much more demanding than usual but, she didn\u2019t put too much thought into that, until she heard her bra snapping out from under her oversized shirt. Only then she stopped for a moment and turned an enquiring glance toward Felipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe\u2026Have you noticed, perhaps, about a shortage of my clothes lately? I mean they seems to be shrinking every week lately\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant had already thought about that and was prepared for such an eventuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t want to disturb you unnecessarily but, yes. It had caught my attention. The person in charge of your laundry has been already punished severely for her mistakes. I\u2019m confident it won\u2019t repeat again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress nodded, making her double chin jiggle for a moment, as she grabbed an entire apple pie from the table, biting through it with a ravenousness she didn\u2019t know to possess. As she munched on it she still turned toward her aide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill\u2026I was\u2026thinking\u2026that\u2026*munch*\u2026as long as\u2026 I don\u2019t go out\u2026I can still\u2026*gulp*\u2026 just stay in my pj\u2019s. I think it would be much more comfortable for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, Miss Angelina. I will be glad to inform the maid about this decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026\u201d From the on, for the following two hours, Angelina kept on stuffing food down her throat, if she had been more in herself she would have asked herself how cold she possibly keep on eating after a full morning of nothing but that. Unfortunately, the constant gorging had left her blind to almost anything, excluding food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe stood there smiling and, occasionally, helping her out when a baked treat she wanted was out of her reach. Her shirt, soon, began to rip at the seams as her belly kept growing more and more stuffed but, it was only in the early afternoon when she stopped eating and moved back to her couch to enjoy a post-meal nap. Felipe, once more followed her, enjoying the view of his, soon to be, titanic mistress, sleeping so deeply she didn\u2019t wake up when he jostled her body fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe quickly glanced at the clock, it was almost the 3 PM, and in two hours or less, she was going to have her first mid afternoon snack. He just had to keep adding the spices needed to boost her appetite and her body calorie absorption ratio and in a few months she could become an unstoppable eating machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as he stood there admiring her ample, jiggling forms, he didn\u2019t notice that the phone was ringing and by that distraction something could potentially disrupt his plan\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks passed and, as it was now becoming the common routine, Angelina gorged constantly throughout the day. As evening came, Felipe went to check the stock in the larder, to make sure that he had everything needed to prepare the scrumptious meals for Angelina, when he noticed that the door for the larder was slightly ajar. Silently, he moved closer to the door and peered inside. As he did so he saw Carmencita, one of the maids in the household, peering inside several boxes in the storeroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked at her, he saw that she was quite the young woman, barely 26, with a nice toned body, with all the curves in the right place. Sporting a pair if nice big breast, D\u2019s or DD\u2019s cup, from where he was standing, with a nice booty, JLO style. Her skin was the of a light-ish brown, with dark, long hair, styled in a long ponytail. All in all, a nice example of a Mexican beauty. As far as he recalled, from earlier interview with the mansion servants, she had appeared to him as a nice-looking girl, maybe not very bright, but not hateful or spiteful of her Mistress shows of hedonism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe was going to open the door loudly when he noticed that the girl, in fact, was opening the boxes of pre-packaged sweets and began to polish a few items from each, making sure that as soon as she had finished everything seemed untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So, we\u2019ve got a burglar in the house, eh? No worries\u2026I shall help you satisfy your need then.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRetreating quickly from there, he went back to the kitchen, to start a little punishment of his own. As he entered the kitchen though he found on the floor the opulent form of Angelina, still licking her lips and caressing her humongous belly, as she lay on the remains of what had been a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping her up he soon found out that she had wanted some sort of midnight snack and had wandered into the kitchen, since she didn\u2019t want to disturb him for something so trivial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, there is no need to encumber yourself. Whenever you need me, you may call me. Now, was everything up to your satisfaction?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, the cake was\u2026*urp!*\u2026delicious! I don\u2019t know how you do it, Felipe, but\u2026Your cheesecakes are just so good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Miss, thank you. Your enjoyment of my cooking is the biggest reward for me. Now, let me help you go  to bed. Just give me one moment so that I can have one of the maids to clean up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said so, Felipe grabbed a few pans of brownies from under a cupboard, where he had left them to rest to be ready the following morning, leaving a few of them on the table, along with a few more snacks, while placing some of the rest in a bowl; which he then gave to Angelina, as a post-snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he helped the growing behemoth at his side he called for Carmencita, while leaving her a note on a table, near the treats left on there. While helping the, still gorging, actress to her bed, he couldn\u2019t wait to see the following morning how said maid would have reacted to his note in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hardly wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen, meanwhile, hearing herself being called closed hastily the last package of glazed donuts in the storeroom, and quickly chewed down any evidence in her hands, as she moved toward the kitchen, making sure to enter the room with no evidence of her late night binge. As she entered the room she noticed the absence of her Mistress underling, Mister Mbutu. The guy was good looking and, had quite the gentle smile on him and yet, she found strange that since his arrival Miss Jolie had steadily ballooned in the lardass zeppelin she now was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he didn\u2019t seem to have done anything but his jobs regarding her, so maybe it was Miss Angelina who had left herself go. In any case, Carmencita, or Carmen as she preferred to be called, began to check the kitchen to see if there was any note left for her. As she did so she began to think back to the goodies she had snuck out of the storeroom in the last few days.<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t call it stealing, even in her minds, she justified it on herself as if she was taking some tips, some advances on her salary. Sure, her Mistress didn\u2019t know about it, and yet it didn\u2019t harm anyone. Plus, lately the food in the servant\u2019s pantry had always been either fast food junk or tasteless salads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted something with taste. Moreover, with her high metabolism, she wasn\u2019t going to gain an ounce so why not taking advantage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as she reached the counter, and saw the various treats left on it, she saw the note for her Mistress Assistant. Picking it up she quickly read it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarmencita, Miss Jolie had just had a quick midnight snack. Please to clean up the kitchen and bring anything left over to the Servants breakroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, Felipe Mbutu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed the note back on the table, she quickly looked at all the food still on the counter, a couple pans of Chocolate muffins, still quite hot, a vanilla short cake, a baker\u2019s dozen of donuts and a small pile of gooey chocolate brownies. Absentmindedly, she grabbed a muffin and began nibbling on it, unaware of the fact that everything on that counter had mixed in it the special herbs of Felipe, so to make it quite addictive and less filling than it should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid then, began to slowly clean up the counters and the floor, without realizing that every few minutes she was going back to the oven pan to grab a new treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Dios mio, these things are good\u2026Better than the ones in the larder\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than half an hour everything had been scrubbed clean, including the two pans of muffins, which had been transferred from the pans to the quite bloated stomach of the maid. Still, feeling quite peckish, she took a seat at the counter and grabbed one of the donuts from there, munching on it as she thought of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I can\u2019t bring everything to the breakroom\u2026It would take me several trips and I would like to get some sleep tonight\u2026Mmm\u2026Strange. I thought there were some ore muffins. Must have been less than I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, probably the Mistress had cleaned them up before I came.</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept thinking, she didn\u2019t seem to realize that, as she was sitting there, she was taking donut after donut, munching on them as she felt her hunger grow steadily more powerful with each bite. And yet, she didn\u2019t felt satisfied. Quickly polishing off the dozen donuts, she burped softly, caressing her bloated stomach and moved closer to her the short cake, taking quite a large slice for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Well, since there are only the brownies and this, I think I shall take, for sure, the brownies to the breakroom. I\u2019ll just have one or two slices of this cake and will see how much will remain for the breakroom.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing a fork she took a piece of the short cake and brought within her lips, the taste and the flavor of it assaulted her taste-buds, leaving her stupefied for a moment. Soon, though, she recovered and began taking bites faster and faster out of the cake, finding her plate soon void of everything but a few crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Woah\u2026Mmh\u2026Must have taken a smaller slice than I thought\u2026So good though\u2026</i>\u2019 as she thought that she unconsciously caressed her over bloated middle, which had begun to hurt against the waistband she was wearing to keep the small white apron on.  As she cut herself another slice, easily a quart of the small cake, she unfastened a little the waistband, letting her belly have some more room to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I\u2019ll just have this little more and will bring the rest for the others\u2026Just this last\u2026well\u2026Maybe another small piece after this\u2026So good\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost Two in the morning when she finally left the counter, she had cleaned the dishes she had used, and was leaving the kitchen while bringing with her the brownies. Of the cake there was no visible trace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved though the mansion, she quickly went into the servant\u2019s wing but, instead of stopping at the break room she went directly toward her private room. Unconsciously she had already begun inhaling the brownies, popping them one after the other in her mouth, enjoying the marvelous flavor of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally reached her room, she seemed to wake up from her reverie, noticing that she wasn\u2019t in the breakroom, and she hadn\u2019t taken the brownies with her. Burping a bit, she simply shrugged it off, she didn\u2019t seem to notice her overburdened belly, nor the brownie crumbs I her cleavage. She simply gave herself a quick wash and went directly to bed, feeling quite good with herself for having had just a few muffins and only a couple of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following Morning, Felipe went into the kitchen and quickly checked the state of the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pristine, as if nobody had used it before. Quickly checking through the security camera\u2019s feed was able to see the gorging spree of the maid on the previous night. As he watched, he realized that she didn\u2019t seem to be really noticing how much she had eaten and thanked once more the spice he had used in the batter for the baked sweets he prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, although he had still quite a few reserves, he had to re-stock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early in the morning and, while Angelina wouldn\u2019t wakeup before Ten in the morning, the household servants were supposed to be already up and about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncluding a certain maid of his direct knowledge.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he prepared a quick breakfast for the other servants in the mansion, he requested Carmencita to come into the kitchen swiftly. While nobody in the household said anything, this request was quite suspicious and, since some of the other servants knew of Carmen ways of taking tips for herself, they thought that she was going to get what she deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen was walking briskly through the corridors. She had woken up late and son had quickly put on her suit, even though it seemed tighter than before. Still, with no time to lose, she didn\u2019t put too much thought on it and went to the kitchen where Mr. Mbutu had apparently called for her specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Porque does he want to meet me there? Por favor, I hope is not about the tips I\u2019ve taken from the larder.<br>\r\nDios mio\u2026I cannot lose this job\u2026</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost out of breath she reached the kitchen and saw the guy sitting near the stove, as he cooked something there, as she neared him, she could hear the oil frying and smell the melting of butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Good Morning, Mr. Mbutu\u2026I-I heard you w-wanted to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe turned, he greeted the maid with a smile, noticing the slight tremble in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>She must be afraid of having been found out. Well, it\u2019s true that I have but I couldn\u2019t ever fire her\u2026Can\u2019t have her spreading news of the New Angelina, around.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Carmencita. Please have a seat. I just wanted to thank you for taking care of that small favor I\u2019ve asked you last night. When I arrived this morning, the Kitchen was crystal clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s obvious to me that you take great care in doing your work. I know that our Mistress has been a little too\u2026Relaxed, lately. And I know that she doesn\u2019t seem to care about you all, but I can tell you she always speaks greatly of all of you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe kept cooking, so the smell began to be intoxicating for Carmen, she felt herself drooling simply by staying so near to whatever the guy was preparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor this reason, I wanted to show you my gratitude. From today, I want to prepare something special for you and your colleagues.  So, from today, I would like you to enjoy some of my cuisine here in the kitchen. <br>\r\nWhat do you say? Here, you can start with this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe finished his spiel, he placed a large plate of fried eggs and bacon directly under Carmen nose.<br>\r\nAs she looked down, she could see the large omelet, covered in cheese, while on the side there were thick slices of fried tomatoes and a small mountain of crunchy, perfectly fried, pork bacon stripes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen was speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had expected many things but not to be receiving compliments and, most importantly, not to be invited to have her meals prepared directly from him. All the maids knew that he was a talented Chef and many of them hoped to taste his creation. And yet, here she was, being offered just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s easy, isn\u2019t it? Just say yes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe smiled at the maid he quickly placed a few more plates near her, some loaded with sweets, other with some ham and cheese toast\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your breakfast. Oh, one more thing. I\u2019ve been noticing that you\u2019ve gone quite a few times in the larder recently\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Carmen woke up suddenly from her reverie, forcing herself not to visible tremble as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026And I appreciate greatly your effort in helping me sorting out what do we have in stock. For that reason, I\u2019ve decided to change your scheduled work. Instead of passing your day cleaning in and out of the mansion, I want you to keep a strict record of what do we have and what we don\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if you notice we have something in shortage, feel free to apply an order for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing it will come from you, I\u2019ll pass it on with no fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmencita, once more stood there speechless.  He not only had offered her the prize of eating his food every day at every meals, but he also assigned her to have free unlimited access to the storeroom, and to be able to order for it without any additional check! Now, if Carmen hadn\u2019t been the ditzy girl she was, she would have been suspicious of this turn of events, unfortunately she didn\u2019t see it as a warning sign, she saw it as if the Guy wasn\u2019t himself very bright in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I thank you very much, Sir. I shall do you proud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you wil. Now enjoy your breakfast while I go and see to our Mistress needs. Then you can go and start your job at the storeroom. Remember, be thorough, if we are in shortage of something, do not be afraid to order it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe left the kitchen he could only grin widely. Between the hunger stimulants he had added to her food and her new assignment to the larder, he was sure Carmencita wasn\u2019t going to remain lithe for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the kitchen he saw Carmen as she began attacking the food with a ravenousness he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. Still, he couldn\u2019t stay there and watch all day long. He had another lady to attend and make grow as big as possible. Swiftly going to Angelina\u2019s bedroom, trailing beside him a trolley loaded with goodies, he knocked lightly and entered, marveling, as he did every single day, at the figure which lay on the king sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina Jolie had been once a lithe actress, a joyful person and a smart woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince his arrival though, two of those things had been lost thanks to his intervention. Sure, she had kept her joyful and bubbly personality but, her mind had been dulled a bit by the constant influx of food in her throat and her figure, well, that had stopped being lithe and skinny for quite some time already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the curtains in the room, he stood watching the woman of whom he was in charge, as she kept snoring on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had grown kinda chubby and round, with her cheeks beginning to soften more and more. Her neck was now presenting to the world a second chin, and a third one seemed to be starting slowly beneath the last one. Her shoulder had inflated, growing softer and squishier to the touch, along with her arms, which had now started to have some decent sized bingo wings. Her breast had grown yet of another couple of cup sizes, losing all their perkiness they had become large meat sack which were good only to store more and more fat. When laying down, on her back, those would slide to either side of her, forced to stay that way by the next obstacle right below them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer glorious, almost constantly, engorged middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, as she slept soundly, it was like a rather large mountain in the middle of some small-ish hills. In her current position it was divided in three belly rolls, with the last one hanging out, completely covering her undies and most of her thighs. Her hips and ass had grown too, jutting out behind her, he badonkadonk ass created a jiggly shelf on itself, often he had left some plates on her rear as he navigated her toward the next meal, and no plate had ever fallen from it. It was mesmerizing to watch, as it jiggled and quaked at her any movement, no matter how minimal. Her hips though had also grown wider, forcing her to move sideways through most of the doors in the mansion, except of course, of the double sized ones. And yet Felipe hoped to manage to reach the point where those as well were to become an issue, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he admired watching her, it was time for her first pre-breakfast. And so, slowly he began to wake her up in the easiest way possible. Simply, by sliding a plate with a dozen eggs omelet and almost a pound of fried bacon strip under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh\u2026It\u2019s you\u2026Felipe\u2026Good Morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Miss. I\u2019m sorry to wake you up but, it\u2019s time for your first pre breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, slowly pushing herself in a sitting position, noticing that it was becoming harder and harder as weeks passed, smelled heartily the delicious aroma\u2019s coming from the platter in front of her and all of her doubts simply vanished, as her belly grumbled in anticipation. Making quick work of the platter, she quickly cleaned out also the following five, and with that began the arduous task in her daily life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, with Felipe assistance, she managed to stand on her own, although she still needed his presence for support in order to perform the daily weight in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a very slow waddle, Felipe directed her toward the large scale he had brought online, used mostly to weigh livestock and farm animals, it was the safest bet to be used with the growing Angelina. The woman slowly managed to step onto the heavy-duty scale and, as she waited a response, she munched on a large short cake he had provided her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe kneeled, entering the shadow of the belly goddess behind him and carefully read the numbers provided by the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling he saw that Miss Jolie had grown more and more since the day before. It was amazing, really, by having her gorge constantly he was managing to let her gain pounds upon pounds, in an always increasing curve. With that day, for example, in a couple of weeks she had grown in average of nearly eight pounds per day, bringing her to a massive three hundred ninety-eight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pounds short of the big four hundred! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had to push her some more\u2026but could he lie shamelessly or was best to keep it low as he was already doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wicked smile on his face he replayed to her that her weight was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He truly could do with her whatever he wished and to prove it to himself he decided to lie shamelessly to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss\u2026I\u2019ve got a bad news. Your weight is..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, in the middle of cleaning out the last bowl of muffins her assistant had given her, tried to look down in shock, only to see her bountiful breasts, and under them her large gut, obscuring everything below them. Still, as they were doing the daily weigh-ins she knew in the back of her mind that her shape was of no consequence\u2026especially since her weight was so low.<br>\r\nStill, the trembling voice of Felipe put her in quite the alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Felipe? Tell me the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Miss, your weight is declining\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, hearing those words began to tranquilize herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you have me on this diet for a reason, right? It\u2019s normal to lose weight as we\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss! That is not the issue here. The problem is that you seem to be losing weight fast.<br>\r\nToo fast to be healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on the actress face vanished. With their weigh-ins she knew to be still in her normal shape but, if Felipe was saying the truth she was starting to lose too much, too fast. She didn\u2019t want to become one of those anorexic skeletons, no matter how rich they could become thanks to their minimal bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why would Felipe lie to her? Angelina thought long and hard on that, as she kept munching through the sweets she had in her arms and reached the conclusion that he couldn\u2019t be lying to her. It meant that she was actually losing too much weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Felipe\u2026*munch*\u2026then what should we\u2026*gulp*\u2026do? What can I do to prevent\u2026*urp!*\u2026it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what Felipe was waiting for. As soon as she had asked him that he knew he had her hook, line and sinker. Standing up he moved closer to her wide and overfed body, admiring her quickly, before returning to the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll modify the schedule again, Miss. We will tweak a bit the schedule, adding some more resting time and maybe increasing the quantities of your meals of a little bit. And we will also take out any exercises session you\u2019re currently following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll see, Miss, soon you will recover from this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can trust in me to have what\u2019s best for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, hearing the words from her assistant smiled at him happily, she was glad of having chosen him to help her out. With him at her side she felt like she could face the entire world. Still, she began soon huffing and panting, feeling tired and drained of all her energies, not realizing that only by standing there on the scale she had already consumed all of her energies. Waddling slowly, helped by her assistant, she moved toward her bed and slowly lowered herself on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was now laid down on the bed, her back against the wall so keeping a somewhat seating position, she felt Felipe pushing something in her hand. With a smile she saw that it was the remote for the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Miss, just rest and relax a bit. Watch some television as I\u2019ll have the maids bring you your three breakfasts. Don\u2019t worry Miss, all of this will pass. You\u2019ll see, with my help you\u2019ll never feel so tired again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his ominous words Angelina simply laid back and began watching her soaps, just as the maids began entering her room bringing her trays upon trays of breakfast food. Soon, surrounding her bloated, and ever-growing, body there were mounds and mounds of food. With a glance she quickly spied a few towers of pancakes drenched in syrupy goodness and butter, mounds of fried bacon strips with similarly sized mounds of sausages, piles of chocolate covered waffles and then countless cakes, pies and more sweets she could count. Without a fuss she began inhaling them, although with some difficulty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately she had noticed that her arms didn\u2019t seem to be working just as she wanted, it was as if they couldn\u2019t bend as they used to. Still, this little inconvenience didn\u2019t ring any bell in the ex-actress mind, since the maids were all around her, ready to act at a quick nod from her. And so they began, pushing morsels of food within her lips, pushing more and more food into her. And, as time passed, she found herself in a vicious cycle. The maids pushed fod on her faster and faster, since she ate it as fast as she could. And yet, she ate it as fast as she could, since the maids were pushing it into her just as quick paced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress, lost in her hedonism, couldn\u2019t see her figure bloating up, her breast swelling larger and heavier, pushing to her sides losing every ounce of perkiness they once had. Her gut rising up in the air, filling up with pounds upon pounds of food, her intestines working overtime to digest, and store as fat, all that was being ingested by the woman. Her hips and ass, slowly outgrowing her bed, as they had beginning to spill out of the sides, as they grew larger and jigglier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll morning was spent I this eating frenzy, with Angelina stuffed so full of things to eat and yet, still hungry for more. Always full, but never satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, as he watched from the sidelines, could only smile in happiness, here she was, growing larger and bigger than a whale, and yet, she still wasn\u2019t big enough for his tribe. She had to grow much, much bigger before he could even think of moving her to his country. Maybe, he thought as he kept watching as she moved from breakfast directly to lunch, he ought to push her on a liquid diet made of shakes and batter. Filling the empty spots with his herbal tea, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something so beautiful in watching her gorge on solid food, watching as she ate through her own tiredness, forced by her gluttony to power through her own exhaustion. Or maybe, he could do a bit of both, get the best of the two worlds as they say\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, he had also Carmen to take care of, in fact, as Angelina was currently busy he could go and check how the maid was working in her new position\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felipe knew that by going with a liquid diet, she would have grown bigger faster but, as a cook he also knew that preparations had to be followed to the book to have a scrumptious meal. True she could have grown huge in a few months but, the meal in itself would have been of a low grade, despite the main ingredient that Angelina was. No, he had to pamper her, to let her grow steadily, to fatten her up the old way in order to bring her as a meal fit for his Tribe. So, he went back to the kitchen where he began to modify her schedule, changing her meal times, the quantities to be brought to her and the times when she had to be left to rest and recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done that, he issued the new schedule to all the servants in the house, letting them know that a new schedule had to be implemented. The maids and the servants didn\u2019t oppose to this new regime. Some of them tried to inquire a bit about it but, were rapidly shushed up by either the other servants, or by Felipe himself.<br>\r\nIf their mistress ordered it to be done, the servants had only to obey. The only maid who was not included in the new schedule delivery was Carmen. For her, Felipe had a different plan. One the he was going to carry out personally, as soon as he finished to show to the once actress, what her future was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already lunch time when Felipe went to Angelina\u2019s room, finding the woman still laying on her bed, watching the soaps she had grown addicted too. Surrounding her there were countless empty plates, while many others were being brought unto her by the maids helping her. As he looked at the behemoth of a woman, sitting on her bed, Felipe couldn\u2019t help but smile. He still couldn\u2019t believe that the actress had fallen prey of her gluttony after only a couple of months. And yet, she was there right in front of his eyes, living proof that he had managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, with her cherubic face covered in sauce and grease, she was being served a large spoon full of the richest stew she had ever had, it was so tasty, and the aroma so intense, that she couldn't stop herself from cleaning out plate after plate of it. With her arms resting beside her growing boulder belly and with each sppon brought directly to her lips, alla she had to to was to open her mouth and feel the divine taste on her tongue, before swallowing down each spoonful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Miss Angelina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe-e-s\u2026*gulp*\u2026Felipe\u2026what is\u2026it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to enquire on how are you doing today? Is everything of your liking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph\u2026mmm\u2026.yesh\u2026everything is\u2026so good\u2026so tasty\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026seem to\u2026have enough\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not worry, Miss. I\u2019ve already informed everyone in the house about your new schedule. Meal times have been doubled and exercises removed. Soon, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to recover all of your lost weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, with her food addled mind turned fully on her gluttony, could only approve silently within herself. As she opened her mouth to accept the next spoonful of food, she could only approve of Felipe\u2019s quick response to her issue. He had been the best assistant she had ever had, she truly had been amazed at how quickly he adapted to taking care of her needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts though, were interrupted suddenly as the taste spreading within her mouth forced her to moan in ecstasy, feeling the sweet and sour taste in her mouth as a new dish was brought to her to be consumed. She barely knew since when she was eating but, addicted as she was she could care less about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe stood there silently, enjoying the view of the ever growing actress, as she kept stuffing herself to bursting point and then, forcing herself to continue just so she could enjoy the taste within her lips. The assistant, judging by the sheer quantity of emptied plates filling the room could easily deduce that she had to be around at her fourth lunch, knowing full well that the meals he had ordered fo her were named only by a matter of comfort. For, with the new schedule, she was going to be force fed at any time of her day, with only a few short breaks of no more than half an hour each between each meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw that she fell back into her eating trance her quickly began massaging her growing belly, feeling good touching it, enjoying the feeling of softness and the plush texture to it. After a bit of relaxation, feeling her growing body expanding under his touch, Felipe decided to leave he to her feeding, as he had another target in mind to occupy himself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, sitting at her new position near the larder, Carmencita was enjoying the advantages of her new job posting. She was currently sitting at the desk that Felipe had prepared for her, right beside the larder, with ease of access there, as she was just finishing up the last meal one of the other maids had brought to her not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was really good\u2026I don\u2019t Know where Mr. Mbutu has learned to cook but all of his meals are the best\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, even though she caressed her bloated belly, which had seemed to grow puffier since she started eating Felipe\u2019s meals, she still felt some hunger deep within her.  Pushing aside the rather large meal she had just finished, she slowly rose from her chain and began to move herself into the larder. Since taking that position she had grown accustomed to go in there, enjoy a few helpings of whatever she wished for and then, simply order more as if there had never been as much as it seemed to be. The maid thought to be sneaky about it but, anyone could easily tell she just was growing greedier and greedier as time passed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs she entered the larder, she quickly snatched the inventory list and scanned it in search of something that would catch her interest. Quickly she noticed some items that made her mouth watery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I just had lunch but\u2026I can surely have something more. Nothing too heavy, and yet\u2026</i>\u2019 she thought as her eyes went on through the inventory list. \u2018<i>A dozen donuts? Mmm, chocolate and cream filled? That\u2019s a yes. What else we have here\u2026Oh? A few \u00e9clair\u2019s sound quite nice as of now\u2026and then\u2026Oh, this I will take it for sure. I can never say no to a slice of good ol\u2019 sheetcake</i>.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she marked the items she wanted, she exited the room and used the phone on her desk to ask one of the maid to bring her the requested delicacies. As it was becoming usual, she simply said that she needed to perform a taste test and that those items had popped in randomly from her search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other servants, even though Carmencita had been on that position for less than two days, were growing envious of her and, pretty soon, started \u201cmaking mistakes\u201d when delivering the requested items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time, for example, a maid came out of the larder, carrying out the request placed by Carmen, leaving in front of her the requested items, except she seemingly appeared to have made an honest mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarmen, I\u2019ve got the items you requested. Two dozen\u2019s donuts, one chocolate and one cream filled\u2026 a dozen, white chocolate glazed \u00e9clair\u2019s and the sheetcake.\u201d<br>\r\nCarmen stood dumbfounded in seeing way more than she requested appear on her desk, at first she was going to reprimand the maid for bringing too much but, as she drank some of the herbal tea that Mr. Mbutu had prepared specifically for her, she felt her own hunger grow tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thanks, Marie. I shall\u2026erm\u2026proceed with the tasting then\u2026you\u2026you can go, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even waiting of the other maid to leave she simply dived into the goodies that she had received, biting and munching through them as she felt herself hungrier than ever. She had noticed that lately she had seemed to be this hungry every time she finished to consume a meal but, instead of worrying herself about it, she decided to dive into it. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u2018Some splurge, once in a while, never hurt anyone, right?</i>\u2019 she thought as her mind soon began to lose focus on her surroundings, placing food as her main focus.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Plus, my high metabolism will take care of anything\u2026need more\u2026much more food\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Carmen, another person was intently watching her. Felipe had just left Angelina, and was now enjoying the view of the lithe, for now, maid as she binged without any worry. Already he could see her uniform beginning to strain and rips at her middle as she stuffed her already full belly with even more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had really to compliment himself. By giving her the spiked food, laced with his hunger enhancer, and the same tea he had given to Angelina, the poor Carmen was going to grow a mindless glutton in no time at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough with Angelina he had to take it slow, at first, with the maid he could simply let himself go. In fact, as soon as she reached a certain point, he could easily switch her to a liquid diet and watch her balloon faster than the once actress. It was true that he had a duty as a cook but, he also knew that there was a vast difference in quality between the actress and the maid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply had to stand back and watch them grow\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Months had passed in a blur of eating and the flowing of time had seemingly vanished for the huge actress. <br>\r\nAngelina Jolie was lying in her bed, she had just finished eating what she supposed it had been the third, or maybe it was fourth, lunch. The maids at her side were now milling around, cleaning her and taking out the empty dishes, leaving the room and then, leaving her alone to rest and digest her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress looked around, noticing that she still was in her room and began wondering about the relaxation program that Felipe had put her on. It was true she had desired relax from her stressful life, but she didn\u2019t seem to remember the last time she had left that room for a walk or simply to go into the kitchen. Her stare began wandering over her own figure, as she was lying down on her bed, with her back on a pile of pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the hugely shaped dome that her gut had become, right under her glorious breast, which had grown immensely. At first, she had begun to worry about the size of those but, as she thought about it, she realized that thanks to the daily weigh-ins she couldn\u2019t have been putting on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the thought of going out of the room enticed her. It was true that the schedule of her assistant wanted her to be ready for her next snack but, she still wanted to leave the room and go for a walk, maybe to the library to read a little bit. Feeling strangely excited at the prospect, she tried to get out of her bed, but found herself strangely constricted. It took her a long time just to reach the far side of her bed and have herself in a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed how though it was to stand from there, especially since she had to gain enough momentum in order to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally was able to stand on her own, she hurriedly had to grab something to hold on since she realized pretty fast that her balance was completely out of control. IF only the actress could have truly seen her figure she would have freaked out.<br>\r\nStanding as she was, her body cascaded down toward the ground in a waterfall of fattened belly rolls. Her middle was reaching past her knees, which would have her forcing to walk with a strange gait, her legs slapping against her belly apron. Her overripe breast, losing all their perkiness, fell on her torso as bloated fleshy sacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt, also, had grown tremendously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had become a huge shelf, wobbly like jelly it trembled and jiggled at her every movement and even to her breathing. It drooped a little behind her but, still it kept its round shape. Overall, everything in her had fattened up, even her arms and ankles had grown with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge, fleshy, bingo wings cascaded down from her shoulder to her arms, her legs were now so round and large that she was constantly forced to move with a very slow waddle. Even her neck had changed since she started that fattening process. Long gone was the slender slim neck she once had, replaced by three, quite large, chins which wiggled and trembled every time she moved her head or opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all it was only thanks to the herbal knowledge of Felipe that the actress was able to stay so healthy while weighing more than 700 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her body in that situation, it was easy to understand why Angelina was having all those troubles in moving around and, yet, the actress couldn\u2019t see all those troubles or how those affected her mobility. Keeping her hold on the bedstand, she tried to look around to understand why she was having all those issues but, even by looking down, she couldn\u2019t see anything that would cause her to have troubles moving around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed by this event she tried to move one step forward, but she quickly realized that she wasn\u2019t able to even lift her leg by her own power. This was very disturbing for her mind, especially since with all the focus on eating, it had atrophied a bit, rendering her a mite slow in certain aspects of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more she tried to move her body, causing only to have herself jiggling in place. With her free hand she began massaging her apron like gut, feeling it grumbling slowly as she felt her hunger rising once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Why can\u2019t I move? Is that normal? <br>\r\nIt\u2019s true that Felipe told me that I\u2019m losing too much weight but, is it possible to have lost all my strength, too? <br>\r\nStill, I need to move but, how can I do that on my own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And I\u2019m also getting hungry. Mmm\u2026Wonder what Felipe has in store for my next snack.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her only the thought of having something to eat to let her forget about her current predicament, in a span of minutes she had completely forgotten about the issue of moving around. In fact, so focused she was on what she was going to eat next, that she never realized she had actually managed to move on her own for the few steps separating her from the bed, as she sat on its side awaiting for her maids to show up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there, huffing from the tiredness she felt from moving herself for those few steps, she still couldn\u2019t see the main issue in the situation. At first she had noticed that she had seemed to grow bigger but, as Felipe showed her through her daily weigh-ins, she hadn\u2019t gained much, so her mind couldn\u2019t accept the idea of being fat, or way more than obese, as it was in truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had simply grown accustomed to her size and found soon that it was easier to justify those little problems she was having with lies, than facing the truth. Furthermore, between her maids complimenting her and Felipe pushing her more, she simply laid back and pretended that nothing strange was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her gut began to grumble louder and louder, hungrily requesting food, and Angelina was finding herself in the uncomfortable position of having to admit that she had a problem, instead of ignoring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final effort, panting in her tiredness, she managed once more to stand up straight, even though the weight of her own body kept her down, forcing her to pant quite loudly at that effort. As she stood there, keeping herself upright by holding on the bedstand, she began to worry if truly she had a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Was it so hard to stand up, in the past?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo accustomed she was to being helped around even at the most trivial things, that now that she was alone she couldn\u2019t help herself but wonder if she truly was in need to relax even more or if it was time to get back and exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she really so healthy, except for losing her weight, as Felipe said or, maybe, she was seriously in danger?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right at that moment, the door of her room opened and one of the maids entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her mistress standing, she rushed at her side helping her up and assisting her leaving the room. With the assistance of the maid Angelina was finally able to move around, albeit slowly, and at that cruise speed she managed finally to reach the kitchen. True, initially she wanted to go to the library but, with all the exercise she had done in standing up and leaving the room she felt herself growing quite hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the kitchen, she saw something she hadn\u2019t expected to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the table there was one of the maids she had in service eating quite an abundant meal with Felipe stationed nearby preparing more and more food, directing the cooked food to both the maid and to some trays, prepared probably for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Felipe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant initially turned around in surprise but, in a moment, he managed to regain his composure, while the maid seemed to act as if caught doing something naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Miss didn\u2019t expect you to be out of your room. Still, would you like to join us at the table? I was just finishing preparing your first post lunch snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, her belly rumbling in hunger, didn\u2019t need to be asked twice and, as quickly as she could, sat in at the table, taking position on a couple of reinforced chairs prepared for such an occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, I would like to present you one of your maids, Miss Carmen here, since she\u2019s helping me out quite a lot in these last few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress turned toward the maid and greeted her with a smile, although she gave her quite a good look. She hazily remembered her, a waifish thing, always out of the scenes, and yet here she was now, with a healthy glow on her and, if she had to say the truth, looking quite healthier than before. Looking more closely at her, Angelina, saw that the maid seemed to have some issues with her clothes and idly wondered if there were still issues with the washing machines, but all thoughts vanished when Felipe placed in front of her a plate chocked full of hotdogs covered in both mayo and ketchup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen, seeing the Mistress so close felt as if she had been found stealing and yet, when she saw that her mistress was only concerned with her food, she started to relax a bit. The maid had been there at the table from quite some time already, eating away at Felipe\u2019s concoction, helping him in taste testing them and, yet, after drinking some of his tea to settle down her full stomach, she felt her hunger coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncaring of the tightness of her outfit, or the fact that the stitches in the front of it were strained to the limit, she almost pleaded with Mr. Mbutu only to smile in joy when a new plate full of delicacies was placed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe quickly breathed with relief, watching the two women gorging themselves on his food, laced as it was with his appetite stimulant spices. He\u2019d been really surprised in seeing the Actress coming to the kitchen, even though aided by one of the maids, but he soon managed to turn her thoughts over to his food instead of inquiring on the reason for feeding the maid in such a personal way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even though he was enjoying watching them gorge, he turned his back on them and started once more to cook, with both girls there he had to make sure that there would be enough to leave them stupefied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina felt herself in paradise, she still had some doubts about her mobility, but with delicious food in front of her those thoughts came second. Now she had to fill her belly.<br>\r\nInhaling the hot dogs, she quickly found a new plate in front of her, this time there were a couple chains of sausages, all covered in a weird BBQ like sauce. Quickly she began clearing them out, swallowing them as if she was sucking noodles out of a cup. With a glance she realized that after these there were available many other dishes, including huge slabs of steaks, mountains of fries and even platter upon platters of fried chicken. The once lithe actress started eating as fast as she could, needing to have all those delicacies within herself at the soonest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen, from her side, was feeling stuffed and yet, also hungry. With those feeling she couldn\u2019t resist from diving down on each new plate that Mr. Mbutu offered her, cleaning out heavy dishes of pasta and massive portions of lasagna, taking mouthfuls of meat pies and even heavily topped pizza pies. With this additional influx of food into her, the maid quickly outgrew her clothes, which ripped loudly, although none of the women present took notice of it, focused as they were on the food. Felipe took notice, and smiled within himself, staring happily at the caramel colored belly that ripped and sprouted out of the front of the maid outfit of Carmen. With a quick glance he knew that Angelina wasn\u2019t going to have this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince a long time already he had got her used to wear only tanga and bikini around the house, just to prevent this issue from happening. Still, the two of them had been at this snack for only two hours now and Felipe knew they both could handle much more and so focused himself to stuff them up to the gills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when they stopped eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen laid on the table, fast asleep already. She had crashed on the table, her face missing the plate she had been on, only by inches. What was really astonishing though, was her middle. Her belly was so bloated that it pushed against the table, distancing Carmen from it by a fair bit. Angelina, instead, was still going at it. Although, at the slow speed she was, it was barely recognizable.<br>\r\nThe actress was full, completely stuffed and yet, she kept pushing her maids to keep going. Even though she herself felt like there were morsels stuck in her throat, unable to reach her stomach, she still motioned her servants to give her more.<br>\r\nFelipe was enjoying the situation but, he couldn\u2019t afford to have an injured Angelina. For that reason, he swiftly intervened before the woman could actually hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? It\u2019s time for your nap. Here, let me help you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could act, Angelina began to rise on her own, or at least, she attempted to. The only result was to see the 700+ pounds behemoth leaving the chairs and fall down toward the floor, while the maid that had helped her reach the kitchen tried to stop her falling. Unfortunately, the lithe maid couldn\u2019t do nothing to prevent Angelina to fall, ending only to be completely squished down by the huge actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the effort of Felipe and other three maid to lift Angelina, which was already fast and deeply asleep, from the floor, releasing the poor maid which in turn had thought to be going to suffocate under her mistress. Realizing the impossible task of having the actress brought back into her room, Felipe decided to let her rest on one of the couches in the main room, while preparing himself to have his mistress room relocated from the first floor to the ground floor. Now that she had grown to such size it was unthinkable that she was going to climb the steps toward the first floor of the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as he watched her sleep away at the ungodly amount of food she had consumed he couldn\u2019t help but smile that soon, she was going to be ready to be moved to his tribe, for a feast that she wasn\u2019t going to forget. As he returned to the kitchen, to prepare the dishes for Angelina\u2019s next afternoon snack he realized that Carmen was slowly waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoyed your nap, Carmencita?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheating maid, having just woke up, didn\u2019t seem to realize where she was exactly, nor what she had done barely an hour ago. She tiredly caressed her still quite bloated stomach, not really realizing how big she was, since her focus was now forced onto something that Felipe had placed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, realizing that Carmen still had a lot to grow, decided to start anew the process of stuffing her up. She had done quite the amazing job by herself, with all those months under her belt of having her new job, and yet he wanted her to grow more and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Carmen, why don\u2019t you enjoy this little pick-me-up? Don\u2019t you forget your promised to help me taste testing some of my new recipes. . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid, drinking some of her residual tea, even though she was feeling quite bloated, couldn\u2019t refrain herself from lean down on the plate, enjoying the succulent aroma coming from it. As she prepared herself, grabbing fork and knife, she looked more closely at it, as Felipe explained her what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarmen, I\u2019m going to call it \u2018Buried treasure\u2019. It\u2019s basically a baked mincemeat pie, with a hidden heart of baked bread stuffed with a delicious roast of pork, prepared with a delicate touch of white wine and a special cream sauce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Mostly prepared with butter and whole milk to make it as fattening as possible but I\u2019m not going to tell you that.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid, quickly went to town on the dish, enjoying it immensely, finding it quite easy to go down even though it had to be quite the heavy plate. With a fueled hunger, the poor maid found herself again forced to keep going, eating faster and faster, as more and more plates began surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as evening was creeping on, Carmencita had to bring down her fork, leaving it there resting on the table. Again stuffed to bursting, she couldn\u2019t do much more than stay seated there, caressing her stuffed, bloated, belly, waiting for digestion to work down all she had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe was in heaven and yet, he didn\u2019t know that a possible storm was brewing and was coming right to him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank Smith had been Angelina\u2019s manager for years. <br>\r\nHe enjoyed working with her, she was a true gem. Not too picky on the contract and neither too greedy on the salaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best employer he could have dreamed of. And yet, to say the truth, he had been, for a short period, something of a stalker in relation to Angelina. He dreamt of her, he wanted her all for himself. It had become almost an obsession. Fortunately, he managed to repress his urges when with her and kept a lid on all the fantasies he kept having each night about her. In a few months, he had managed to stop stalking her around, and contented himself with having the chance to be near her. But he kept fantasizing about her, sating somewhat his lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, lately, he had noticed that she had left the scene for quite some time and the gap from her leaving was quickly filling up. Wondering on her reasons he decided to go to her mansion, since it wasn\u2019t the first time he had done so, and investigate with her personally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at her mansion, he noticed immediately that something was out of place. The gardens surrounding it were maintained as usual, but all her outdoor gym equipment seemed rather unused. Still, he moved on toward the door and knocked. When the door opened, he was surprised when a giant of a man opened. As he looked at the man, he realized that he had heard about Angelina hiring a personal assistant from central Africa and so he presented himself to the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Frank Smith. Contract Manager, and advisor, of Miss Angelina Jolie. May I enter? I would need to check a few things with Angelina in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Felipe went at the door, he thought he had to manage, once more, one of those pesky journalists who kept trying to intrude on Angelina\u2019s life. When instead he was faced with Frank, he realized that his plan, all of his scheming, was going to be ruined by the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about keeping him out but, if he really was who he said, he would just return with the police in tow.  So, he could only let him in and try to ease all the difficult situations that were going to arise as soon as the guy saw Angelina\u2019s new lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, come inside. I\u2019m Felipe Mbutu, personal assistant and secretary of Miss Jolie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank soon found himself sitting in a large ante chamber, waiting on a couch for Miss Angelina, while Mr. Mbutu sat opposite to him looking rather uncomfortably. For a moment he wanted to ask the guy if something was wrong but, as the wide set of double doors opened, Frank found himself speechless as Angelina entered the room assisted by two maids, each on her either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmith sat there, open mouthed and speechless, as he watched her Employer waddling in just as if he was dreaming about her. He had never told anyone but he had always been a Closet FA, a hidden fat admirer and, seeing the object of most of his wet dreams coming through, just as he had always envisioned it, left quite the impression on him. The fact that she was wearing only a small thong-bikini and was having issue with moving by herself only fueled his own lust toward the actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe noticed the impact the arrival of Angelina left on the Contract manager and grinned within himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Maybe his coming will not be such a bad thing, after all\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angelina sat on the couch, she breathed quite laboriously, as if she had just performed a marathon and yet, she was all smile at her friend visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank! So nice\u2026 to see you. <br>\r\nSorry if\u2026 I haven\u2019t\u2026 warned you\u2026 about my\u2026 leave of\u2026 absence but, I was\u2026 getting too\u2026 stressed out\u2026 so I\u2026 asked\u2026 my personal\u2026 assistant, Felipe, to\u2026 have me\u2026 under a regimen\u2026 that could\u2026 help me\u2026 relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that the actress had to often interrupt herself to catch her breath. Although she was healthy, it still took her toll to lug around a 700+ pounds body. To Frank it took a while to manage to speak again, and still he was uncertain as he addressed her, still thinking at what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>My God! She\u2019s Huge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe won\u2019t be able to find a single commercial like this\u2026I should report this to the authorities\u2026but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her health doesn\u2019t seem in danger, and she\u2019s acting as if she doesn\u2019t care about her size. Could it be that she does not realize how big she is? Yet, she still seems happy at how her life is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I cannot deny that I find her way more attractive like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I really call the cops? And who is this Felipe Mbutu? How did he managed to get her to such a size?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chat between them was slowing down, the double doors opened again and a whole fleet of maids, each with her own trolley full of food moved beside the huge actress, surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, it\u2019s time for your fifth late afternoon snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank could see that the actress was already focusing only on the incoming food, as she bounced excitedly on the spot, having her entire form jiggle and wobble madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYum yum\u2026Can\u2019t wait\u2026was getting hungry\u2026Gimme more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contract manager watched dumbfounded as the maids began feeding the actress, pushing all kinds of food down her throat as the woman herself soon lost herself to the bliss. He couldn\u2019t move his stare from her as he saw that gallons of ice cream were being pushed inside the huge actress, and more importantly, she seemed to be moaning in pleasure by the rough feeding she was subjected to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Felipe moved and sat beside Frank, starting a conversation that, potentially, could change their entire lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank could only nod silently, as his own body betrayed him by showing hard how pleasing the scene was for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, she could aspire to much, much more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026What do you mean? And who are you? What have you done with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled lightly, as he kept staring at Angelina, as she was in the process of scarfing down and entire devil\u2019s food cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName\u2019s Felipe Mbutu, personal assistant and secretary of Angelina Jolie. I\u2019ve done nothing to her\u2026I\u2019ve just provided her with food and a way to relax. The rest came on its own, in its own time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, instead, it could be you who might be able to do something to assist her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What could I\u2026do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough he understood the plan of Mr. Mbutu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his contacts he could provide a legal offering for Angelina, turning her from the movie star she was into the most famous SSBBW the world had ever seen. And yet, Frank was conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Felipe was a serious Feeder, one who had been able to turn an actress of the caliber of Angelina Jolie to a humongous whale, getting her hooked on eating while keeping her relatively out of any issues regarding her size. So, from one side Frank wanted to call the cops, have this Felipe guy under arrest and, maybe as the man was in jail, he could fill in the spot with Angelina? That would have been good but, he wasn\u2019t sure he could act as the guy did toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option was to accept the guy offer and try to look around for a job that Angie could perform while in her current state. It would be legal but, would he feel alright knowing that his Employer, and friend, could be used in such a way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frank mulled it over, Felipe decided to use his trump card on the guy, trying to rope him in as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Angelina is not my only target. There is also one of the maids that is coming along nicely. What\u2019s more, if you agree to help me, I could even apply my skill on whichever target of your choosing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll have only to have her move in here, then I would take care of everything...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Soon as Miss Jolie would have reached the milestone of the 1000 pounds, He would have nothing else to do but contact his Tribe chief and let him know to make contact with Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, under the pretense of hiring her for a long movie to be directed in Africa, Angelina could be transported there, and his tribe would have feasted for months on her bounties. Meanwhile, also thanks to Frank, he could find someone else to replace the actress\u2026and the cycle would continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but it was feasible and, most importantly, would appear as totally legal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was a long way yet for Angelina to go to reach the big thousand, who was to say that in the meantime a new avenue would show itself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pact accepted Frank could only stay there, enjoying the view as the actress kept going for hours with her feeding. The manager sat there open mouthed, watching as, inch by inch, her middle began to bloat up and out, filling up with food until it seemed that her humongous belly, stuffed to the maximum, almost seemed to be dwarfing the woman in its size. Without Frank notice, four hours had passed. He had been sitting there for four hours watching the actress filling herself up with food, stuffing herself to the point where she literally couldn\u2019t eat a single crumb more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, he couldn\u2019t resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay there, already asleep out of the exhausting experience of stuffing herself, Frank\u2019s hand moved of its own accord, until it reached the gravid belly, feeling it as tight as a drum. Felipe was quickly at his side, smiling as he placed one of his hands, on Frank shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we agreed then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll do my best\u2026you\u2026could you keep me posted on her\u2026erm\u2026progress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe nodded and then accompanied him out of the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the antechamber he stood silent for a few minutes, enjoying the sight of the fattened-up Angelina on the couch, filling it all by herself as she slept and digested, without any other care in the world but eating and reaching fullness. As he motioned to the maids to assist their mistress to her new room on the ground floor, he went toward the larder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had still someone else to take care before he could start preparing the next dishes to be served to his Mistress. As he arrived, he smiled in seeing Carmencita asleep at her post, several plates emptied at her side as she soundly slept away another fulfilling snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid was proving to be quite the nice fatty. Already he had ordered for her several custom sized outfits, each time keeping the same label as the original clothes she had. It was a shame he couldn\u2019t weight her but, at eye estimation, after all those months she had to be already in her 300 pounds of weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the influx of his own cuisine at main mealtimes and all the snacking she did throughout the day, she was getting quite big. Already it was getting harder and harder for her to rise from her desk, reason for him to bring her the meals directly there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings in the mansion seemed to return to normalcy. Angelina was kept now, almost constantly, stuffed full as mealtimes and snack times grew ever longer and more numerous than ever. Sometimes Felipe was letting her rest for no more that fifteen minutes between one meal and another, and yet the actress didn\u2019t complain. Until, after a quite long month when things seemed to finally have reached stability, Angelina asked for Felipe in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe\u2026I...was wondering\u2026is it\u2026normal\u2026that I\u2026can\u2019t seem\u2026to be\u2026able\u2026to move\u2026at all? I seem\u2026to be\u2026always\u2026out of\u2026energies.<br>\r\nEven\u2026talking...has become\u2026strenuous\u2026for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, moving closer toward the supersized woman forced in bed by her own size, brought her a straw to suck on, as lifting an entire keg of weight gain shake was hardly the easiest thing to do, even for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere miss, have some of this. It will boost your energy up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understand how hard it may seem to be. But it is perfectly normal. Your body is simply adapting to the new schedule we are implementing on you. You\u2019ll see, as soon as your body normalized all of these issues will seem a thing of the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, finish that drink so that the maids can continue with your meal. Remember, Miss, all of us are working hard for you\u2026it would be a shame to let all our efforts to waste\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress, now completely bedbound, unable to move a single finger of her fattened body, laid there drinking up the shake that her assistant had brought to her, until she was ready for her meal to continue. As the feedings had grown in intensity, her own mind had dulled even more, as she wasn\u2019t using it for nothing but to think of her next meal. True, she was having troubles in moving, even in lifting her hands but, if Felipe said it was ok\u2026it had to be ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor actress, spoiled and constantly fed as she had been, couldn\u2019t do anything by herself anymore. Whatever Felipe said, she knew it was the truth. And she had to force herself to do as he said. For a fleeting minute she thought of remembering a time when she was the Mistress of the mansion, when she did exercises and walks around the place but, constantly gorged as she was, those memories quickly vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her remembering that in a few short minutes, her next meal was going to be served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had to be hungry for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actress had truly grown under the influx of the huge feasts that had become her normal staples, her whole body, even though kept majorly healthy, couldn\u2019t resist the effect that having an almost 850 pounds body, was having on her. Her entire form had swelled up, accumulating so much fat that she was actually immobile, still able to move only her mouth and, for a bit, also her head. Everything else from below her neck was out of her control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t mind though. There were her maids helping her, some of them cleaned her, other massaged her and a great deal of them simply passed their time filling her with all kinds of fattening junk food and dishes prepared to her directly by Felipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy, was now dividing his time with Miss Jolie and, also, with Carmencita.  The poor aid had finally succumbed to her gluttonous side. She knew to be gaining weight and it didn\u2019t matter to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted more of everything and Felipe was ready to deliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll had changed the month before, just as Carmen had broke through the big 400 pounds. At the time she was eating away at one of the decadent meals hand prepared by Felipe. As she was gorging, stuffing her mouth with food, she saw how the other maid looked at her and, feeling their sense of superiority regarding her she realized that she had been fattened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mindless gorging stopped, and she gave herself a good look. She saw her huge fattened body, her breast so big and fat, without any perkiness, kept up only by the massive bra she had on. Then she felt her buttery belly, so juicy and soft to her touch. Finally, her hands moved toward her rear, feeling it plush and comfy to the touch. It was then that she realized how big she had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if a dam had burst open in her mind, washing away all of her sense of superiority, all her thoughts about being thin were swept away and what remained was something else. Something she began to cherish. The other maids often, behind her back, called her \u2018Cow\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmencita, realizing that eating was now one of the major things she cherished in her life, decided that if she was a cow, then she was going to be the biggest Cow her colleagues had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe knew that it was going to be soon the time of separation, already he had issued all needed papers in order to be considered as the sole keeper of Angelina\u2019s funds, if she was to move away from the mansion. This way, he was going to keep himself busy when the actress had to leave for her new, incoming, movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, with the main dish almost ready and the secondary willing to fatten herself up, he took the steps needed to have them both transferred to their new place. Naturally, even though his Tribe chief had taken contacts with Frank Smith and, between them, had organized the booking of Angelina (and a plus one) for a supposed new block buster movie directed there in central Africa, Felipe knew that the actress wasn\u2019t yet ready to be invited to the Main Festivities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cellphone began ringing. It was Frank, now it was Felipe\u2019s turn to act surprised toward the contract manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe? It\u2019s me, Frank. I\u2019ve managed to land a contract of three years for a new movie in central Africa, for Miss Jolie. It\u2019s going to be BIG, you get me? Do you think she\u2019ll be able to fly there within the next two months, as soon as passports and the other documents have been cleared?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready? Mr. Smith, you\u2019re amazing. I will inform her personally\u2026and will remain available if there any of your contacts that may need my\u2026services.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe\u2026about that\u2026I may have someone in mind already for you. Will send you all the details as soon as Miss Jolie is on the plane for her movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I can anticipate this to you, the name I was thinking of is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two months had come and gone I a jiffy. Miss Jolie was already moved to a special transport plane that was going to move her directly in the welcoming arms of Felipe\u2019s Tribe chief. It was going to be his duty then to fatten her up over the thousand pounds she already was, in order to have her as fat as possible under the pretense of having her starring a new blockbuster movie.<br>\r\nBut Felipe wasn\u2019t going to return soon to his home country. Now that he had an outpost in the land of possibilities, in the US, he was going to try and gain as much as he could from the opportunity. Using the Mansion of Miss Jolie as his base of operations and through contacts provided by Frank Smith, he was going to try and get more and more celebrities to succumb to his cooking and to his Tribe needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd already, a new guest was expected to arrive shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Felipe\u2019s mind, Frank had done an amazing job. Not only he had managed to have it \u2018leaked\u2019 on the web that Angelina was going for the next three years to an unidentified location in Central Africa for a new movie, but he also had processed the entire contract agreement legally, raising no suspicion at all to the authorities in relation to Angelina\u2019s situation. As much as they knew of, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, expecting a new guest, Felipe wanted to have everything under control, up to the minimum detail, before his next target entered the mansion. Frank had requested for her and Felipe was going to do his best, although he knew it was going to be harder than how it had been for Angelina. While the actress had wanted to relax and so hired him, in this scenario he was going to be the advisor to the target, with almost no possibility of forcing her to comply to his desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was a challenge and Felipe couldn\u2019t resist it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Frank smith office, Gwen Stefani sat on a plush chair trying to make a sense of what her manager was saying to her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean that I\u2019m overworked? I\u2019ve always work like this and now, suddenly, I\u2019m in danger for being too stressed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Stefani, please, let me explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on, then, Frank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you were aware of the \u2018sudden disappearance\u2019 of the actress Angelina Jolie in the last few months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I heard about that. For some time I kept contact with her through some mobile apps but,  then my tour started and I hadn\u2019t had time for anything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank, sitting comfortably on his chair, moved both elbows on the desk in front of him, keeping his hands linked together as he kept on pouring what he devised as the best action plan he had thought of to ensnare the singer in his and Mr. Mbutu trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Jolie seemingly vanished in the span of nine months from the scene, nobody heard of her, nobody knew what she was doing. Last news it was available was that she had closed an agreement for some Fast food corporation, issuing one of those fundraising she was so proud of. In those months of absence, the gap from her vanishing filled quickly and many upstarts have tried to replace her on the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just a few weeks ago, after what had been a training and inspiration regimen, she landed a multi-million contract for a new block buster movie. I, naturally, cannot tell you the details of her contract but, I can guarantee to you that it is worth a mind-boggling amount.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? What is your point? I\u2019m happy for her but, I don\u2019t see the connection with my current situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Stefani, it is my job to secure a good contract for those who wish to employ me, through my association. You and miss Jolie are some of our best customers and so, I wish only the best for the both of you. Now, I\u2019ve been informed that, behind the sudden increase in expertise for Miss Jolie there is one person responsible. This person is currently still in employment, officially, under her but, with her away for her movie, he is available to lend a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour career is going in an amazing way but, we can\u2019t deny that you\u2019ve managed to do better in the past. Now, I don\u2019t want to be threatening, it is your life and your choices but, your relationship with Mr. Blake Shelton hasn\u2019t earn much favor with your fans, resulting in a loss of revenues from your side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Gwen, began to grow angry.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I do with my life and the persons whom I meet is only under My responsibility, Frank. I will not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Miss Stefani, let me finish. I totally understand you and, as I was saying, I don\u2019t want to issue any threats or force you to change anything in your life. I was only pointing out that your revenues are diminishing, and what we would need would be a new album or, better yet, the main role in a new movie.<br>\r\nAnd since, with only a small training course Miss Jolie was able to land a huge contract as main actor, I was thinking\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the singer understood where her manager was going with that discussion.<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to follow the same regimen she followed, under the disguise of a long vacation? But, have you already any lead for a possible new movie that could bring me under the highlights?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes and no. <br>\r\nI\u2019ve heard on the line that in south Africa, one of the richest men of their country is trying to hire Hans Zimmerman to direct a movie with a cast of his countrymen. Which unfortunately doesn\u2019t help our plan but, by grapevine, I\u2019m currently investigating about a rumor regarding this new incoming movie. Apparently, the entire cast should be of people from that nation\u2026except for one single role. As far as I\u2019ve gotten, they were thinking of hiring Miss Angelina Jolie for that role but, as she will be busy with her current movie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think that if I manage to pass the regimen she did, I could propose myself for that role. Hmm\u2026It wouldn\u2019t be bad to be the leading character in a new colossal, but how will it be considered by US standards?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, under the directing of Mr. Zimmerman, I suppose it will be regarded just as any other colossal directed here in the States. The problem here, Miss Stefani, is time. <br>\r\nI will keep tracking and following the leads I have but I\u2019ve got to have an answer from you. Will you follow this regimen to enhance your acting abilities, or will you refuse this chance? If that is your decision, I will start anew searching for job possibilities for a singer and actress of your caliber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen Stefani was in doubt. She wanted so badly to enter the movie scene, to show everyone around she could do it. But this, this seemed too hard to get. And yet, Angelina managed on her own. She took the risk of leaving the scene for most of a year\u2026and managed to get out of it as a winner. Could she do the same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank. What will entail IF I accept to follow this \u2018regimen\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI managed to extract some info\u2019s from the responsible. As far as I understood, you\u2019ll have to follow a customized diet regimen based on your characteristics, along with a special training, of which he didn\u2019t describe in detail. For security reasons You\u2019ll have to stay for the duration in the mansion of Miss Jolie, as the place is secluded, reserved and protected from any gossip spreading journalists.<br>\r\nThis person will follow you day in and day out, for the entire period and will teach you just as he has done with Miss Jolie. Alas, unless you can get him to agree, there will be no contacts from your family and/or friends. That, as he told me, is the one rule he will not bend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, Frank. If that is the case\u2026Take contact with this guy. I\u2019ll do it. If Angie managed, I will do better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the singer left the office, requesting for the contacts and the instructions to be sent to her, along with the legal papers, Frank grinned deeply within himself.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes, Gwen, you shall do excellently. I\u2019m sure that Felipe will change you just as he has done with Angelina.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the span of a couple of days, all legal documents were signed between Frank association and Gwen Stefani, and the singer was finally able to go and train herself under the care of her new, soon to be, personal assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Felipe Mbutu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of them were finally one n front of the other, they sat in one of the antechambers in Jolie\u2019s mansion. Stefani, richly dressed as usual, stared with a hint of lust and some perplexity at the giant of a man that was sitting in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re the one behind Angie rise to the glory, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct, Miss Stefani. My name is Felipe Mbutu, pleased to meet you. If from your side is agreeable, I would like to keep things informally, for the duration of the regimen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMph\u2026yeah. Alright. So, what should I do? How exactly do you want to proceed? Are there presentations that I\u2019ve got to be following? Books to read?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled at the singer question as he, slowly moved his head side by side.<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.<br>\r\nWe will first start with a relaxation program, mainly diet and a few activities to be carried on, within the span of four to six weeks, depending on how good you perform at it. Afterwards, for no less than six months, in case you\u2019ve managed to perform to satisfaction,  we will start with intense training sessions to help you reach the objective of the entire course. In the last, ideally, eight weeks, you\u2019ll be tasked to perform with an audience of carefully selected participants to show what have you learned in the previous training sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis will be the regime you shall follow. Now, have today as a day off and, if you have any need, do not hesitate to let me know. I will gladly help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny friends of Miss Jolie, is also a friend of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe made to leave the room, letting the singer to rest a bit, she\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2026I wanted to ask you if you could give me a tour of the place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course. It will be my pleasure. Here, please to follow me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were moving through the house, Gwen could see that the mansion wasn\u2019t as big as her own in Beverly Hills, still it was altogether quite impressive. Her coach, Felipe, showed her around the bedrooms, the bathrooms, the library and then into the lush garden surrounding the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe especially loved the pool house with the included Gym and how everything seemed brand new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Felipe, are you sure Angelina would agree in having me living here? I mean, I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Miss Stefani. I already discussed the matter with Miss Jolie, there is no issue in having you around, especially if at the same time we both can help you to rise in the movie scene. Now, let me show you your room and then, at your leisure, we will meet again in the dining room so that as we have dinner, I will explain to you how the regimen will be placed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe singer was soon left with her luggage in a very wide and opulent room, everything was so richly detailed that Stefani couldn\u2019t stop herself from giggling time to time. Still, as she took in the size of the bed she almost choked on her laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u2026this thing is huge! It could contain easily six or seven of me in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she wasn\u2019t aware of was that in that same room Angelina had spent most of her time in the past, as Felipe worked his magic on her. Still, albeit not aware of that fact, she still enjoyed the soft mattress and, little by little, began to unpack her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, deep in the kitchen, Felipe was hard at work. He had at least nine months to work on Gwen Stefani, but he knew already that probably he had to extend that time. The singer was an accomplished woman, one who had renounced to a profitable band to try her career on her own, for a time. He had to break her if he wanted her to bend under his control. And that wasn0t going to be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he paused, thinking fondly of that first dinner he had with Angelina Jolie, how she almost melted in his arms as she fell for his delicious and addictive dishes. The actress had actually wanted to relax and find peace and all he had to do was to give her exactly that. The singer, instead, wanted to prove herself to the world once more. HE would have to work hard, he was sure of it, to break her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, before taking any actions he had to verify her adversary effective willpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to do that he was going to prepare a dinner that would have placed in shame a five-star restaurant chef. His objective for that evening was to test her and see where her limits were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe felt full of energy. He could hardly wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Gwen Stefani, after being informed by one of the maids that dinner was ready, decided to show up fashionably late, almost fifteen minutes past the call. She wanted to see too what kind of person this African guy was but, as she entered the dining room, she stood speechless. The room was organized as if a grand banquet was going to be hosted there, everything seemed so formal and classy that she herself, dressed in her jeans and a t-shirt, felt almost out of place. Still, Felipe was standing proud at the head of the table, motioning her to sit beside him as dinner was about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Felipe, it\u2019s every day that this room is decorated as if a grand gala is taking place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, generally Miss Jolie preferred a more informal approach but, since I wasn\u2019t aware of your own preferences I preferred to prepare as I saw better, hoping to have you pleased.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, keep it informal also for me, alright? Now, what\u2019s on the menu for tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, at that, moved from her side and brought forward a small pan, from which he began to pour some soup into a plate, serving it then to Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Miss, we have as an Amuse-bouche a Vichyssoise soup, served warm for your enjoyment. It is a soup composed of leek, potatoes and onion, with a hint of thyme and marjoram.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe kept talking about the soup, Gwen grabbed a spoon and tasted it, cautiously. But the taste invaded her taste buds so delicately that she found herself intrigued by the plate. As she kept taking spoonful after spoonful, seeing as the guy kept talking confidently about the origin of the dish she realized pretty quick that at the very least, he was truly a wonderful chef and not only one who blabbered about it but unable to perform. Still, in few minutes the plate was empty and before she could ask for some more, a maid appeared at her side and swiftly took the plate away, as another on gave her a new plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe then moved closer ad brought forward the next dish. This time he poured into the plate what seemed to be some sort of squishy looking slice of pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere Miss, as appetizer, we have a Quiche a la Benedict. It contains mainly asparagus prepared in a soft roll of baked bread, with small dices of Canadian bacon to give it a somewhat strong aftertaste\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at the new dish with trepidation, she had found the soup so good that she was wondering how good this cakey-thingy could be. Still, as she took a piece and brought it within her lips she found herself unable to release the fork from her mouth as a smile appeared on her face. Quickl enough she polished off also the quiche, feeling it going down her throat and into her stomach without an hint of heaviness. Within only fifteen minutes, the entire slice of quiche vanished and, same as before, the used plate was moved away and quickly replaced with a new one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood god\u2026Felipe\u2026you must be something else.<br>\r\nWait\u2026how many more plates you\u2019ve prepared?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, We have still to deliver to you, your full course meal. May I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could reply, a new delicious looking dish was place before her. This time it was what appeared as a simple Caesar salad, but as she tried it and Felipe described it , Gwen began to wonder how such a simple plate could be prepared to be as tasteful as that. As she rapidly cleaned the small bowl out, she marveled if the guy was really behind this dished by himself or if he had received any help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had prepared them by himself she was surely going to enjoy living there with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the salad, Felipe delivered onto the singer a delicate and, quite refreshing dish of fresh fish, cooked in a sweet white sauce, which he described but, as she was far too lost in pleasure, she couldn\u2019t listen. Then in what seemed a long series she found herself submerged by the two main courses, interrupted by a small portion of that soup she had loved so much at the beginning of the meal, and then he brought to her a mix of various kind of cheeses and other dairies products, to which she enjoyed with large amount of bread and wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Finally...</i>\u2019 she thought \u2018<i>It\u2019s over\u2026I couldn\u2019t eat another bite.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen Stefani was slumped on the chair, her bloated pot belly, pushing again the waist of her jeans as she tried to keep inside of her all the food that it had been given to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas everything of your satisfaction Miss Stefani?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStaisf...*urp*\u2026Satifaction? Yes\u2026but\u2026too much. I\u2019m not used to eat\u2026so much\u2026 so good though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Miss, we haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the singer grew pale in the face, as she slowly turned her head toward the man standing beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Not finished?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Miss. There is still fruits to have, followed by Dessert and after Dessert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen felt like she was going to explode, but before Felipe could bring more, she raised her hand, while gasping for breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe, tha\u2026Thank you very much but..I can\u2019t. I\u2019m full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even a slice of pie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sorry. Don\u2019t get me wrong, everything tasted delicious, but I can\u2019t eat a single bite more. If I was still hungry, I would gladly accept but, as I\u2019m feeling now? No can\u2019t do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, as Gwen Stefani had been helped to her bedroom to sleep off her food baby, Felipe was back into the kitchen, preparing the schedule to be discussed with her guest in the following morning. He had now an idea of her character, she had some willpower for she had actually resisted the temptation of having even a hint of his desserts, but still she admitted having a weakness with her hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only to force it to grow a bit more and then she too would fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of deciding how, after all Frank had been specific about her.

He wanted her to be focused on him, as in love with him. And addicted to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one was the simplest of the two. Felipe wouldn\u2019t have no troubles at all in change that aspect of her but, the challenge was to make her fall in love with the contract Manager. There was the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, if he could break her on her eating habits, he could also find a way to force her to believe to love Frank. After all, even though he was doing this to seal the deal with the manager, for his assistance with Angelina and all future endeavors, Stefani wasn\u2019t going to be sent to his Tribe (unless Frank didn\u2019t change his mind, of course) and so even if she returned to her senses sometime later, while in company of Frank, Felipe wouldn\u2019t have lost any moment of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was time for him to concentrate. He had nine months to change Gwen Stefani from being an A+ Singer to an A+ Eater. Cackling a bit within himself he started baking for the following morning. Breakfast was an important meal after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen woke up slowly the following morning, she still felt kind of sluggish and bloated as she rose from the king-sized bed. More asleep than awake she first went into the bathroom, to wake herself up with a quick shower but, as soon as she was under the water she realized that her once flat toned belly, was now retaining a bit of flab on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man! That dinner was good but, I can\u2019t get myself to enjoy that too much\u2026I need to lose this somehow.<br>\r\nI\u2019ll just ask Mbutu to help me accordingly</i>.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished cleaning up, she returned into her room only to find a maid in there waiting for her to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Miss Stefani. I\u2019m Helen, I\u2019ll be your personal maid as per Mr. Mbutu\u2019s orders. Please, have a seat and relax, let me handle your preparations for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen Stefani was too surprised to present any kind of opposition, and soon found herself seating on the bed as the maid dressed her up with a common looking pair of sweatpants and a sweat shirt. As soon as Gwen was dressed up, she accompanied her toward the kitchen, chatting a bit with the famous singer.<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Gwen was seating at the table in the kitchen, staring astonished as the huge guy, Felipe, kept preparing her breakfast, while telling her more of the Regimen she was going to be following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Miss Stefani\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Gwen, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you desire, Miss Gwen. As I was saying yesterday, the regimen you\u2019re going to follow is one made with the exact objective of making you capable of being the biggest star around. In Miss Jolie\u2019s case, it had the need to extend her acting capabilities\u2026and, as much as you Manager told me, you wish to reach her same level of ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is right, Felipe. I want to show everyone that I can be an actress as good as Angelina, if not better than her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, much will depend on your own attitude toward the regimen but, with this course, you\u2019ll have a large increase in your capabilities. No doubt about that. Now, for the hard part. Yesterday I gave you a quick example of the training course, today I\u2019ll try to give you the final version. The course will be separated into three distinct phases: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhase One: R&amp;R. What I like to define as Rest &amp; Relaxation. During the first three months you\u2019ll have to reach a total relaxation into your life. Not only on your body level but also inside your mind.<br>\r\nFor this reason, in this phase, you shall do no exercises nor having any stressful activity during your day. You\u2019ll just rest and recover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as the singer was about to interrupt, he motioned toward her with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, let me finish. Then you can ask me anything about the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as I was saying, we have Phase Two: Fitting in. Once the \u2018Total Relaxation\u2019 has been reached we will gradually implement specific exercises to both keep you trained while keeping you under the less stress possible, so to train your body to overcome any obstacle you may encounter in a period of, ideally, three months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhase Three: Powering-up. In this last phase, as your body and mind are trained to manage stressful situations, we will push through a long series of hard and strenuous exercises and activities so to give you the boost you need to be able to perform in front of a live audience. Also this period will take around three months to be completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can see, ideally, in the span of nine months, you\u2019ll be ready to arrive on the scene and becoming the biggest star around.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Felipe kept talking about the regimen that Gwen Stefan had to follow, the girl didn\u2019t take any notice of the plates that the guy was giving to her or about their contents. As she was focused on him and his explanation, she blindly kept eating anything he placed under her nose. In this way, and with the aid of the maid stationed at her side, every time she cleaned a plate, the empty one was swiftly taken away and replaced with a new one. With this simple trick, Gwen had polished unconsciously three plates already, which had been once filled with pancakes smothered in syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Felipe finished, the singer burped a little but didn\u2019t let that unfazed her toward asking her doubts at what was going to be her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026*urp*\u2026let me understand. During phase one I\u2019ll do nothing. In phase two, I\u2019ll do little\u2026and in phase three\u2026I\u2019ll do everything else? Why not having everything equally divided?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the regimen I put Miss Jolie under. And you have seen already the results she obtained.<br>\r\nPlease to understand this, Miss Gwen, I\u2019m not doing this to help you or to obtain anything out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a favor that I\u2019m doing for your Manager, Frank. Due to this, if you are not interested in following the training as I have envisioned, then there is nothing else to say between us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t want to sound rude but, I\u2019m tired of people ready to dismantle any achievement of mine, by going through what They think is best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe singer stood silent for a minute, slowly taking in the firm tone of voice of Felipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized with a start that it was the first time she heard him with a hint of anger in his voice, since she had arrived. She also realized that she had to be thanking her manager for giving her such an opportunity. At first, she thought that Frank had simply used \u2018her\u2019 money to hire this guy but, if what he said was true, it meant that Frank had managed to grant her this opportunity all by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Got to have to thank him properly when I see him\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those thoughts in mind she breathed deeply and calmed herself, before answering to the Felipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t want to sound as if I could do your job better than you. I was just curious on the time frame for each phase. In any case, I do want to gain the same level of ability that Angie managed to reach so, I\u2019ll follow your instruction\u2026Coach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe grinned inside. Most people who wanted something from someone else would simply surrender at the first sign of losing the possibility of reaching their wishes. Gwen Stefani was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he now had to continue with the act, in order to make everything believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, Miss Gwen, I apologize if I sounded rude to you. I haven\u2019t anything personal against you, instead, I must confess that you seem quite the good-natured person, so I\u2019m doubly ashamed of letting my anger to pass through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, let bygone be bygones, as some would say, and start anew from a fresh slate.<br>\r\nAfter years of testing and trials I found out that, due to the stress levels that can be reached during the regimen, the quarterly division was the better suited plan to efficiently organize the course. That being said, certain changes can be brought forward, although I will need time to ensure that the regime won\u2019t be affected by them. Anyway, in order to start properly, Miss Gwen, you need to have some breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was going to point out that she already was eating something but, as she looked down, she realized that the table was crystal clear, and no utensils were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>But\u2026But I thought\u2026Maybe I\u2019m still a bit sleepy\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could reply, Felipe brought to her a normal sized plate, containing some fried bacon strips and a couple of brownies, and a rather large cup of coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Miss. After breakfast, may I suggest that you could go and have a little sun bath at the pool? The weather is marvelous today. Just remember\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo exercises\u2026yeah, I got that, Felipe. <br>\r\nOh and, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled at her coach, as she began gingerly eating the bacon strips, while having a few sips of her coffee, marveling at the taste of it. Strong and, yet, sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man, this guy sure knows his way around a stove, that\u2019s for sure\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she cleaned her plate, she saw how her belly had bloated up but, simply thought that it was still a residual from the previous day dinner. She never seemed to realize that she had already eaten way more than her usual share. As the singer personal maid accompanied her toward the pool, Felipe showed a toothy grin. It wasn\u2019t time yet to bring in his herbal knowledge but, soon she would be ready for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just to wait the right moment to strike\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gwen had to admit that Felipe had been right. As she lay on the deck chair at the pool, dressed up in her bikini, she was thoroughly enjoying the weather as she sunbathed. Still, as she lay there, she soon grew bored and began to wonder if her Coach instructions had to be followed to the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Well, he said no exercise at all but, exercising makes me feel relaxed. How can I grow more relaxed and stress-free if I can\u2019t do what I enjoy?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift movement, quickly looking around, she saw that her personal maid was nowhere in sight. With a sigh of relief and, with the guilty pleasure of doing something naughty, she rapidly rose from her chair and began to do a quick series of relaxing exercises, to prepare her muscles for the incoming strain.<br>\r\nRight after that, she took off her shoes and began to have a small jog all around the garden, enjoying the feel of the soft grass under her feet or the pleasurable breeze passing on her running form. As she kept doing lap after lap, she began to feel more relaxed, although her small potbelly jiggled to and from at her every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching through the security surveillance feed, Felipe saw that the singer was already disobeying his orders and began to think about the best way to get back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even one day and, already, she goes against what was promised not even half an hour before. This one surely is strong willed. Yet, I can\u2019t let her do as she please. She needs to learn a lesson.<br>\r\nBut, what would be the best course of action?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning progressed, Gwen felt happier than ever. After a quick dip in the pool to refresh herself, she returned back to her chair, and acted sleepy when Felipe appeared out in the foyer, as her personal maid trailed behind him with a tray of goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026*Yawn*\u2026Felipe. Your idea was so good. Thanks for suggesting it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem, Ma\u2019am. I\u2019ve asked Helen here to bring you your mid-morning snack. Please to enjoy it. Thanks Helen, you may return to your duties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked askance at her Coach demeanor and was even more impressed by how subdued the young maid appeared to be. But before she could ask a question to either of them, they both left the tray at her side and swiftly returned inside the house. Still surprised by this she stood dumbfounded for a minute. Felipe hadn\u2019t seemed the guy to keep out such a cold and distanced stance. From the little time she had known him, he had seemed to be quite the warm guy, so this cold shoulder they both had given her left her wordless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she looked at the goodies they had brought her, she hid a frown from showing up. She was both relieved and sad as she saw the content of the tray. Just a couple of protein bar and a bottle of water. While those were the snacks, she knew were good for her, she still had expected from someone as good at the stoves as Felipe, something more personalized and\u2026yes, somewhat tastier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay at the pool side, she quickly polished off the bars, and yet she wasn\u2019t feeling satisfied. For a moment she thought about going inside the house and ask for more but, again, the cold demeanor shown by Felipe left her with the feeling that she wouldn\u2019t like to face him so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs midday approached, Gwen finally saw Helen coming out of the mansion, walking toward her. Barely she had been able to greet her that the maid informed her that Lunch was going to be called soon and, right after that she scampered away, leaving the singer quite surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>What\u2019s going on, here?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Gwen rose from her chair she swiftly followed the maid inside, arriving into the kitchen with expectancy of a deliciously cooked meal. For sure Felipe had prepared something tasty for her. In her mind, the singer, thought back to the dinner she had had the night before. True, the portions were a bit too big, but the taste. She still fondly remembered the taste of each delicious plate. With her expectation set that high she looked dumbfounded as she entered the kitchen and saw that a small bowl of tasteless salad was waiting her at the small table near the kitchen stoves. As she looked around, she couldn\u2019t see Felipe anywhere. Due to this she turned toward the maid which, stoically, was standing perfectly still near the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen? What\u2019s the meaning of this? Where\u2019s Felipe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Stefani, I have to inform you that Mr.Mbutu is deeply sorry but he\u2019s unable to join you at this time. You may start your lunch without him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stared at the maid with a dubious glance as she notices that even Helen, with which she had laughed and joked that same morning, seemed to have turned as hard and cold as a stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen, what is going on? Why all of you are so\u2026cold, toward me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Stefani, I\u2019m sorry to say that I don\u2019t know what you mean. If you have any complaint about me, you just need to let Mr. Mbutu about it, as soon as he\u2019ll be available.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the singer was getting angry. This was right down offensive in her eyes, she didn0t know what their problems were but she was soon going to find it out. Quickly she grabbed the bowl of salad and tossed it away, as she angrily stared down at the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, listen me closely. I\u2019m losing my patience. I demand to speak to Felipe. NOW! I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but, I will find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the singer continued to trash the kitchen, suddenly the double doors leading into the hallway opened and there Felipe appeared, sharply dressed as a butler, instead of his previous chef attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard you wanted to talk with me, Madam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Course I want to talk with you. And cut the crap with these \u2018madams\u2019 of yours. Told you already, Felipe, call me Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry, Madam. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Gwen was puzzled. Again the guy was giving her the cold shoulder, showing off as much emotion as a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why, do tell, you can\u2019t call me by name? If it isn\u2019t much to ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimply put, Madam. If by acting informally around you, you feel you can cheat on the same rules issued this very morning, then there is no reason for me to keep doing that. As per what we said this morning, I\u2019m sorry to see that your words have no grain of truth behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, instead of letting you cheat on the training I so hardly worked on, it\u2019s better to have you yourself decide how to train yourself. For this reason, I shall await your commands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What are you talking about? I\u2026I haven\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Madam. Do not embarrass yourself with foolish lies. I\u2019ve seen you performing exercises not even half an hour past our mutual agreement of you following my regimen. Still, it is up to you to decide and so, give me my orders, and I shall execute them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen, speechless, sat on a nearby chair. Realizing now that she had been seen. At the time she thought othing of it but, as she thought about it now, she knew she had broken her word barely a few minutes after talking with Felipe. As that realization arrived, she began to feel ashamed of herself. Red faced she turned back on Felipe, and saw that the guy, although tried to hid it, was deeply wounded by her demeanor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadam, do not concern yourself over this. I know that I can\u2019t be as smart and resourceful a you are. I\u2019m only a servant, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those words were expressed, Gwen felt even more shameful. She wanted to take those words and pushed them back to the guy, but how could she do that? It was the truth. She had really thought of being better than Felipe, even though she had promised him to follow his instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe\u2026Please. I\u2026I know I made a mistake. Please, let me\u2026I don\u2019t know. What can I do to show you I\u2019ll follow your training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe hid well the smile that wanted to come out on his face. Now, now was the perfect time to strike at Gwen Stefani and train her to be what He needed her to be. With a bit of shame on her part, his herbal knowledge and firm hand he was in the perfect position to start break her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftening his features, he turned toward the singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Gwen, I think you now realize how deeply you\u2019ve hurt me? Right this morning you seemed to have understood how dearly I care for this training of my creation, how prideful I am of it, seeing the results with Miss Jolie. And yet, right after you promised me to follow it, you simply went and broke that promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy should I trust you? How can I trust you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could\u2019ve understood if you\u2019d have gone back after a few weeks\u2026but not even half a day? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even one hour?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I know. And I\u2019m sorry. I will not let you down anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Gwen realized that she had been, no, she was still on the brink of losing everything she wished for, everything Frank had managed to get for her. She wanted to have her big spot on the Movies, to show everyone she could be a great actress\u2026and she almost blew it on a whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, Felipe, I\u2019ll follow your lead to the letter. I won\u2019t risk this chance you\u2019re giving me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe grinned once more. She was now vulnerable. He needed only to decide how to strike at her\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could see that she had still a bit of a pot belly from the large breakfast she\u2019s had unconsciously consumed. Still, he wished for her much more and to obtain that he decided that he couldn\u2019t give her a straight answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Gwen, I\u2019m willing to give you a second chance, but\u2026 If before I could have trusted you, I won\u2019t do so anymore, until I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve learned.

In that moment, she promised herself that she was going to do whatever needed, no matter what was required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe seemed accepting the response and, with a gesture of his hand, invited the singer to sit near the kitchen, as he started up preparing her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs we said this morning, Miss Gwen, during this first phase you\u2019ve got to learn how to relax by doing non stressful activities. <br>\r\nWhich mean, <u>no exercises</u>, no work, no social gatherings. For this period you\u2019ll pass your time watching TV, doing yoga, if so you wish, or playing videogames. Not much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny activity which requires you to move around and/or be subjected to stress will be ruled out. Now, to relax your mind I already stated the activities you\u2019ll have to perform. To relax your body is quite similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way to speed up the process is to store energy within yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStore energies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn these three months, I\u2019ll personally prepare all your meals and you\u2019ll eat them. Was I clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Crystalline.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled a bit at that. Although, his eyes told her a different story. From the glare he gave her she trembled a bit, knowing full well that if those eyes could talk they would have said \u201cWe shall see\u2026\u201d, but she wasn\u2019t going to be deterred by something so small. Even though the eating part scared a bit, she quickly realized she hadn\u2019t any choice. She had to follow the regimen, if she was going to gain a few pounds, she would just lose them soon as she was out of there with the same abilities Angie had matured under Felipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Gwen saw that her Coach had seemingly finished preparing something on the stove and still she stood shocked in seeing a large plate filled with some kind of Mac &amp; Cheese directly under her nose. For a moment she looked at in confused but, as she realized that it had to be some kind of test, she simply took her fork and shoveled a first bite in. Immediately she moaned in delight. She could taste several different types of cheese in the sauce, and yet all of them amalgamated perfectly with each other. As she began taking forkful off the plate, Felipe began to describe the plate to her, to which she found herself almost enthralled by both his voice droning on about taste and sauces and ingredients, and the actuale heavenly taste of the dish itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she cleared the plate, and had to force herself not to lick it clean. Yet, just as she cleaned the first course, Felipe brough forward a second course, this time there was a large steak of beef, grilled to perfection and yet, still a bit raw, on the side of the plate a small mountain of fries. As she cut herself a piece, she couldn\u2019t refrain from squirming in her seat a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the taste was incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, although there was a spice in there she didn\u2019t recognize, overall the plate was perfection. As she swallowed the morsel, she took some fries and the salty counterpart made her head spin, this were heavily fried fries, and yet the overwhelming taste of the oil was almost absent. Under the watchful eyes of Felipe, Gwen quickly cleared also this second plate. She was beginning to feel full and yet, she wasn\u2019t. Looking down she could see her belly growing puffier with each plate consumed, but everything was so good she couldn\u2019t stop. Next came a small dish with some caramelized apple slices. Even though she thought to be full, as soon as the aroma coming from the dish hit her nostrils she began to salivate, feeling deep within herself the need to have, at the very least, some of those delicacies. So she began, at first with small gingerly bites, to get at those slices of fruit-dessert, but as she took a bite out of those, she couldn\u2019t stop from loudly moaning a she chewed, feeling both the crunchy from the caramelized cover and the soft, sweet, heart of the apple. Slowly she savored them, licking her fingers happily as she cleaned the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping softly, Gwen realized that as though she was feeling her belly weighing her down quite a bit, due to the huge amount of food she had consumed, she still felt a bit hungry, especially as she saw Felipe move closer to her, placing a last plate under her eyes. Caressing her bloated middle, she looked enraptured to this last dish she had been served as she cleaned her lips with a napkin. <br>\r\nThis time, he carried to her a small, richly decorated, soft pastry, that it smelled vaguely of roses. Yet, even though she was getting to be quite full already, she smiled at him and simply munched the little tart with ease, feeling it as it went down her throat nice and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting lightly, not used to eat this much, Gwen turned her look again on her coach, but he still was watching her quite coldly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2018<i>True, can\u2019t expect him to change his mind in just one day\u2026Still, he\u2019s a great chef, no doubt about that.</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meal was over, Helen came at her side, helping her standing and bringing her back toward the pool, to lay a bit and have a nap in the wonderful weather that there was outside. The singer burped a bit as she moved with her new food baby, and yet, as soon as she was laying on her deck chair, she fell asleep. Her belly gurgling as it digested the large meal. When Gwen woke up the sun was still high in the sky, checking her phone she saw that she had slept almost three hours on the deck chair, and already she began to stand from there when she stopped herself suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down and saw that, although her bloated belly had deflated somewhat, it still retained a bit of pudge. But it didn\u2019t seem as bad as it was right after lunch. As she mulled it over, she heard footsteps coming toward her. Craning her neck she saw Helen coming her way, holding a quite large tray in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Gwen? You\u2019re awake, good. I\u2019ve got here your mid-afternoon snack. All part of the regimen you\u2019re following.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the singer still laying on the deck chair stared at the maid, this one placed the tray right on Gwen\u2019s thighs, just as the singer looked in shock at what had been brought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Holy crap\u2026</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of her lay the tray that Helen had brought to her, filled with a mix of various baked sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the tray, in fact, there seemed to be a couple of any baked sweet she has ever known, and even she hadn\u2019t ever seen before. There were donuts, at least three pair of them, a couple of eclairs, some bear claws and then she saw a few small round sweets made of apparently sponge cake layered with ricotta cheese and candied fruit. Curious about these strange sweets she grabbed one and gave it a bite feeling its soft texture almost melting in her mouth, with a touch of liqueur burning a bit in her throat. AS she moaned in pleasure, Helen moved forward, offering her some suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Stefani, if I may\u2026The one you\u2019re tasting now is an Italian recipe called \u2018Cassata\u2019. It is said that although it may seem to be quite a feat to consume, it truly isn\u2019t. I also suggest you to try these as they are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, with the suggestion coming from the maid, Gwen found herself practically shoveling those sweets in her mouth, enjoying the rich taste of them, as she lost herself in the deliciousness of the various pastries. Soon, too soon in her mind, she found her hand searching n the tray for more, only to find crumbs and some residual powdered sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>What? I\u2019ve really cleaned the full tray?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, she couldn\u2019t deny to herself that everything tasted delicious and that she didn\u2019t feel as bloated and weighted down as she expected herself to feel. It was with a somewhat deluded expression that she gave the, now empty, tray back to the maid and she returned to lay down on the deck chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe singer looked sheepishly at her, once more, bloated middle but it was only for a few fleeting moments, right before sleep caught to her once more and she let herself go in a calm nap, as her body began digesting the new income of calories. This process kept going for several days, with Felipe using the singer shame to force her to stand down and willingly accept anything he prepared for her. And as days passed, each meal started to slowly become heavier than the previous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Gwen rebelled less and less to this treatment, her willpower reducing as the weight of her shame was returned to her again and again. Soon enough she stopped entirely to try and fight back, instead accepting each meal brought to her as she tried to please Felipe with her eagerness in following his rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled at this turn of events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Gwen willpower reduced to dust, he had now free hand to shape her as he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could force on her the idea that she had to do even more to please him or, now that she was somewhat subjugated to him, he could try and persuade her to grow some like of emotions, some feelings for Frank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he had to start using the herbal tea on her, as he needed her to grow faster in order to break her down once and for all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Gwen Stefani kept following the schedule from her Coach, someone watched her inflating figure from the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, the personal maid assigned to Miss Stefani, had always worked diligently, being mostly invisible to the eyes of any guest of her employer, as any maid should have done. But, since the change in management, with the departure of Miss Jolie and the installment of that strange man, Mr. Mbutu, Helen was finding difficult to remain focused on her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen had, in fact, always hidden deep below in her personality, a secret from the eyes of all around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her time in high school she had always been a secretive obesiphile. She had always enjoyed seeing other people grow fat or to help them get fat while never being under the spotlight. When she was working for Miss Jolie, it hadn\u2019t been so bad. She had always managed to keep her desire only to a fantasy level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Felipe guidance instead, with the parade of fatties that was starting to pass through the mansion she was finding harder and harder to resist. Especially since she had seen from the shadows how Miss Jolie had ballooned, along with Carmencita. Still, at the time she had managed to resist. Now, though, with the famous singer Gwen Stefani following the same treatment she knew she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She had to have an active hand in the process started by Mr.Mbutu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new goal set in her mind, as she brought the first breakfast to the singer room, under Felipe\u2019s instruction, she added of her own decision a few selected items to the portions she had to bring. Entering the room, she saw that Miss Stefani had just woken up and was, now, sitting in her bed, curiously inspecting the small layer of pudge that had started to show on her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Helen, hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve here your breakfast, as per Mr. Mbutu request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she brought the tray toward the singer,pacing it on her quilt covered thighs, as Gwen looked in surprise to the \u2018hearty\u2019 meals awaiting her. Under her eyes, in fact, there were a four eggs omelette, four large sausages, a rather large mound of fried bacon strips, a few fried slices of tomatoes and two vanilla milkshakes. To this, Helen, had added also a couple muffins which she had baked the night before while adding into the batter some appetite stimulants. <br>\r\nAs Gwen began eating the massive meal, still trying to follow up the instructions of Felipe, she decided to ask a few questions to the maid that was milling around in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026Helen? May I\u2026*munch*\u2026ask you a question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Miss. If I can assist in any way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019ve put on weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, a bit embarrassed but, also, turned on, at first seemed to take time to answer, then she turned toward Gwen and, while smiling as sincerely as possible, she answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh. If I can be sincere, I don\u2019t see anything really. So, it may be that you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019ve gained weight due to the stress of living in a new environment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefani, as she cleared the eggs and the sausages, drinking them down with the first milkshake, cleaned her lis with a napkin, before turning her stare on the garden visible through the window in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHum\u2026Maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she took one of Helen\u2019s muffin and began, distractedly to nibbling it. Helen, instead, began to observe as much as she could without being detected. In a few minutes she noticed that Stefani started to eat more fiercely at the muffin, cleaning it out in a few bites, turning then on the second one, unaware that her hunger was only going t grow stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefani had eaten most of her meal, feeling content already but, as she nibbled on the muffin she began to feel her hunger returning. In few moments she found herself as if starving and, quickly, she began to devour also the second muffin and even whatever was still on her plate. With the tray cleaned out she let out a wistful sigh in seeing Helen carry it out, leaving her alone for the morning, with no more food available. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen, knowing full well how Felipe wanted her to follow his treatment, didn\u2019t raise any fuss, although she was still feeling a bit hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, as she carried the empty tray back to the kitchen was almost giggling in joy. The experiment had been a success, but, since she didn\u2019t want to intrude too much on Felipe\u2019s plans, she decided to keep on giving, once or twice per day, the stimulants to the singer, but without upping the portions dedicated to her too much. This way, it was going to be Stefani the one requesting to up the portion and she, Helen, could remain in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days passed, Felipe noticed that Gwen Stefani was managing to clean out anything he sent to her. As he had done with Angelina, he wanted to keep things slow at first but, the singer seemed to have other ideas in mind. As Felipe was cleaning the kitchen, preparing it for lunch time, he was suddenly interrupted by the presence of Gwen Stefani. Turning to look at her he saw immediately she was well on her way to acquiring some definite pudge on her middle but, what surprised him the most was the request she had come to ask to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe? Sorry, can I disturb you for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Gwen. Tell me, what can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m objecting to your treatment and your plans but\u2026lately I\u2019m finding the portions that I\u2019m receiving\u2026way too small. Would it be possible to increase them a little? I mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe was intrigued by the request. He already was preparing her meals with quantity enough for two people and, yet, Gwen seemed to be wanting even more of it. At first, he thought of a secondary effect of his Tea but, he hadn\u2019t started to give it to her yet. The only thing he could think of was that Gwen had started to reveal her gluttonous side and so, how could he ask her to curb it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026Ok. No worries, Miss Gwen. Will increase your portions a bit, maybe add a few more snacks throughout the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Gwen nodded contently, just as her little belly rumbled in appreciation. Felipe, smiling, invited her to take a set nearby as he kept preparing lunch, while giving her a plate with a few brownies he had asked Helen to prepare the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere Miss, I think you can have some of these, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs He watched Gwen attacking the plates of sweet he wondered if, considering the increased appetite of the singer, it was still a good idea to start giving her also his herbal tea. But, after pondering a while on it, he decided that it was probably just a temporary thing for the singer to feel this hungry and so decided to not to worry about it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Gwen, here, you might want to have some of this tea, it\u2019s made with some herbs from my country which have a soothingly effect on your stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first month in the mansion passed, two weeks since Helen had started to provide Gwen with the stimulants, the maid was truly enjoying the situation she was in. Between the appetite stimulants she managed to give to Miss Stefani and whatever Felipe did, the singer seemed to be facing a period of almost constant, never ending hunger. Which resulted in her asking, day after day, to up her portions more and more. This naturally was having quite the effect on her body, which was putting on pounds faster and faster, although the singer didn\u2019t really seem aware of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, for example, as Helen entered Gwen\u2019s room, she could see that the singer was still asleep in her bed, the remains of her latest night binge still surrounding her. The nightstand near the bed was still covered in plates which had contained a few small cakes and pastries just the night before. But were now empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the dirty plates, she brought forward Gwen\u2019s first pre-breakfast, carefully prepping the boat load of plates that Felipe had prepared for her first, of three, pre-breakfast meals. As weeks passed, Gwen found herself growing hungrier and hungrier, always wanting for more food to be given to her. Helen knew that partially it was because the singer was growing heavier, and so her natural hunger was growing too, but mainly it had to be the stimulants she was still giving to the singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she finished preparing the massive meal, which was fit for at least four people, she took her time to check out Gwen\u2019s body. She started from her face, noticing that still it looked quite thin, although her neck was starting to get thicker. Her torso, too, was swelling up quite nicely, her breasts had grown past the E cup, and had already started to lose some of their perkiness. Then there was her belly, it was a growing mound which seemed to be growing wider every passing day. Already it was hanging down on her crotch and yet, it seemed to be hanging lower and lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen could barely contain herself, seeing how big the singer was getting, and it was only her first month with them. She could only dream how big she could make her. She only had to decide if she wanted to continue as she was doing or maybe, if she had to increase the dosage\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gwen Stefani, after finishing her last lunch for the day, took her time to think on how her life was going in the Mansion, following Felipe\u2019s treatment. Lately, all she seemed to be doing was to sit down in the dining room, on a comfortable couch, and eat at whatever Felipe prepared for her. At first, she had been worrying about her size, for she thought she was getting worriedly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a check in with Felipe and after seeing her weight on a scale she understood that it was all in her head. True, she hadn\u2019t believed it herself at first but, after seeing with her own eyes the numbers on the scale, she realized that it really had to be all in her head. So, she simply stopped worrying and, after some time, she even stopped checking her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really too much of a hassle to rise and stand, walk up to the scale and then stand there\u2026it was all too much of an issue, so she simply let herself go, trusting completely Felipe and his treatments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there, massaging her overfilled belly, which pushed out in front of her of at least a couple of feet, she thought about her situation. Stifling a burp, barely, she realized that she truly was enjoying living there. It was just so carefree to pass her time doing basically nothing and she had realized that she also had to be growing healthier already, since her appetite was growing almost every other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for this there was only a person she had to thank, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her manager, Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought about him, with Helen at her side pushing within her lips a large \u00e9clair, since it was time for her post-lunch snack, she felt something hot growing within her. Gwen already knew what it was. It had been only a month and something since she had been in the mansion but, even in such a short time she missed the company of her fianc\u00e9e. But, alas, he didn\u2019t seem to be reachable, even when she called him through text messages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the more food Helen pushed within her lips, the more she found herself thinking about Frank and not of her boyfriend. This realization jolted her awake. As she gulped down the last pastry that the maid had pushed within her lips, she grabbed her phone and started to type. Only to stop after a few minutes finding the activity way too tiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen\u2026Could you\u2026please\u2026write a \u2026*urp*\u2026text\u2026for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the maid passed to her a massive tray still loaded full of donuts and other sweets, she took the phone and waited for Gwen\u2019s input. The singer began cramming food into her mouth, not feeling truly hungry but more as she had gotten used to chew and swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026type this\u2026Dear Frank\u2026wanted to\u2026 apologize\u2026for contacting\u2026you so\u2026late. Its nice\u2026in here\u2026and am glad\u2026you managed\u2026to reserve\u2026this spot\u2026for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will\u2026see with\u2026Felipe\u2026 if is possible\u2026to meet you\u2026one of these\u2026days. Gotta\u2026thank you\u2026for all you\u2019ve\u2026done for me. Will\u2026let you\u2026know.  xoxo Gwen\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the singer kept dictating the text, she also kept her mouth stuffed with food, pushing donut after donut within her lips. As soon as Helen had written the text and sent it, the roles reversed one more. Gwen returned to laid back on the couch, massaging her increasingly more stuffed gut, as the maid began anew to feed more and more sweets into the fattened singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, for one, was truly getting excited in seeing how the singer grew. As per last weigh-in, almost a week ago, Gwen had already surpassed the 250 pounds of beautiful fat. And since she had grown accepting the lifestyle, she didn\u2019t problem herself anymore with how much food, both Helen and Felipe, pushed onto her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready she was on such a massive calorie laden feast that it was astonishing how bigger she was getting and, most importantly, how accepting of it all she was. Helen couldn\u2019t wait to see how long it would take for Gwen to outgrow the couch she was currently sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe was amazed at the change in Gwen\u2019s demeanor in respect to her start. Since he managed to break her will, the singer had grown on a, almost, daily basis both in her appetite and in her mass. At first he had worried that she could realize how big she was getting but, thanks to appropriate countermeasures, the scale set to show a specific weight, and the help from Miss Gwen dedicated maid, Helen, the singer/actress had swelled up beautifully and out of any of his plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the truth he suspected that Helen had done something to her. Since her increased appetite didn\u2019t seemed to stop, but only increased as time passed. Still, he couldn\u2019t say it was a bad thing. As he checked the clock, noticing that she had to be almost finished with her first post-lunch snack, Felipe turned on the stove again as he had to prepare the second post lunch meal for Stefani. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he thought with glee, he decided to outdo himself and prepare for her a massive meal. After all, she needed to be at her fullest if he wanted to impress into her the idea that she loved Frank.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\nGwen Stefani, meanwhile, had just finished her snack and was currently resting on her couch, with her huge globular belly pushing harder and harder on the extra sized shorts she was wearing. As she breathed, to recover energies, she saw Helen approaching her with another tray of goodies. Instinctually she licked her lips, already tasting the sweets that her maid was bringing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Helen\u2026back again\u2026uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Miss Gwen. Just thought you could be still, somewhat, hungry. Didn\u2019t want to see you starving. Don\u2019t tell Felipe, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled as she opened her mouth, accepting the first large slice of cake that Helen gave to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had been going on for a while now, from the time when Felipe\u2019s portions seemed to be less filling than usual. Helen brought her once a few pastries to help sate her hunger and, soon, it became the norm. Between the scheduled mealtimes and the additional snacks brought from the maid, Gwen soon got addicted to eat constantly, feeling strangely depressed if she wasn\u2019t having something to eat all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the singer ate and ate some more. Everything was so good, so tasty. And she wasn\u2019t gaining a single pound from it. As the first cake was quickly polished, the maid brough out of the tray a second one, starting aew to feed slice after slice into the fattening whale of a woman sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feeding proceeded, the camisole that Gwen was wearing suddenly ripped in half, the buttons flying everywhere as her belly surged out even bigger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!  You guys\u2026sure know your\u2026way in a\u2026kitchen but\u2026laundry\u2026isn\u2019t your\u2026strength\u2026uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, Miss Gwen. Here, have some more cake, it will help ease your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stefani kept indulging, unaware of how her body was changing, her phone thrilled signaling that a new message had arrived. As Helen kept feeding her, Gwen rapidly scrolled through the messages and saw that Frank had answered back, thanking her and that he would have loved to meet with her. Startling, for she hadn\u2019t expected that, Gwen felt her heart flutter a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was due to Blaken absence, maybe since she had grown wiser living in the mansion, but she felt truly happy knowing that Frank wanted to meet with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2026Helen\u2026Can you\u2026ask Felipe\u2026If it would\u2026be ok\u2026for me\u2026to meet\u2026Frank\u2026here\u2026one of\u2026 these days?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felipe Mbutu was in the kitchen; he had just finished preparing the next snack soon to be brought to the constantly hungry singer. He knew that Helen, the personal maid assigned to Gwen Stefani was doing something to cause that but, as long as it didn\u2019t impact his plans, he could let her have her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was cleaning out the table, his phone buzzed letting him know that a ew mail had arrived. Curious he checked the preview and stopped suddenly. The sender was anonymous, untraceable, and the subject of the mail was \u2018Jolly\u2019. He stood perplexed for half a minute, before realizing what it really was. Hastily, he cleaned out the place and left for his private room, leaving the orders to follow the current schedule for the singer, as he had to absent himself for a few due to something urgent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached his room he quickly locked the door and closed all windows, then he opened up his computer and, before going online he also started an application that could hide all information\u2019s related to that machine and the IP address he was using. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce sure that everything was working, he opened his mail and saw that the message was a few words and a link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018 Enjoy the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-TheGnasher\u2019  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe knew immediately who the sender was. It was a message from his Tribe, but he wondered why did they contacted him after all this time. With nothing else to do he clicked on the link and immediately was connected through a series of servers and satellites until it appeared on his screen a video player. On top of the screen, in bold capital letters, there seemed to be the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>JOLLY \u2013 USE HEADPHONES</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, plugging in, started the video and smiled as he began to see what the video was about. As he kept watching he realized it was made just as if it was a spin off from one of the worldwide known shows like \u2018Big Brother\u2019. It recounted images recorded live from the scene and even a few shots of the characters describing what they had felt or how they were living the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t refrain himself to be curious about what was going to be shown to him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video started with a few camera\u2019s shoot of an airplane landing down in, Felipe recognized it immediately, was the small private airport of his Company/Tribe. Then a figure appeared in front of the camera, it was his Tribe Leader, Joao Cumbu. A forty something year old, with a bit of a bristle on his bearded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is on? Good. Hey man, we\u2019ve making this to show you that your efforts are not in vain! All of us appreciate what you\u2019re doing for us and we cannot start to thank you for the gift you\u2019ve managed to send to us. I\u2019ll try to show you the good use we will make of the gift. Hope you enjoy, Brother. We sure will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the guy smiled, revealing a set of razor-sharp teeth that would have made a shark, jealous.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe feed stopped for a moment and returned, showing now the cameraman walking on the landing field of the airport. A massive airplane had landed just before them and was now opening up on the rear to download its precious cargo. The video kept recording as a massively large pad was slowly being unloaded from the ramp while, sitting atop of it, there was a hugely massive, almost shapeless, blob of a girl with caramel-like skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pad was left out of the plane, several persons moved beside the huge woman, some were cheering, others were prodding her gently, and yet the girl was still completely absorbed by the tube tightly pushed within her lips, as she kept gulping down whatever concoction it was bringing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joao entered again the field of view of the camera, he approached the massive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome! Welcome to Africa, Miss Jolie! My name is Joao Cumbu, I\u2019m the producer of the movie you\u2019ve accepted to participate in the role of our main protagonist. I\u2019ll accompany you to our set, which include also your accommodations and will be at your service for anything you shall require.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive blob of a woman, none other than Angelina Jolie, pulled out the tube from her lips, burped loudly and turned slowly her head as much as she could toward the man, giving him a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTha\u2026*Belch*\u2026Thanks\u2026happy\u2026to\u2026be\u2026here. Need\u2026some\u2026rest\u2026though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, of course! We\u2019re just so happy to have you here, Miss. We will immediately begin transportation toward the Studios, for you and your guest, and we will let you rest from your exhausting trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joao kept talking, a huge figure began to slowly waddle out of the plane, soon helped by a couple of guys that were milling around. As the cameraman zoomed in, the figure revealed to be none other than Carmencita. The maid had left Angelina\u2019s mansion weighing roughly 450 lbs, but the woman that was now waddling down the ramp had to be easily 500, if not more. And yet, even as she was waddling, she kept pouring chips from an oversized bag she had under her arm. The video stopped suddenly but, as it returned online it showed the actress, comfortably seated on a sea of cushions in a veritable lavish room, while out of a window a rich jungle landscape could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Jolie?\u201d Joao Cumbu moved forward, offering a tray with a massive cake on it to a girl standing beside him. \u201c\u2026This girl is Felicia Macunda, she will be your personal attendant, along with her senior, Mr. Juan Kingstone, who\u2019s currently going at the studio to prepare the papers you will need to learn about your role in the movie. Felicia will take care of you and provide all you may wish for. Felicia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl curtsied gracefully before taking the tray and moving toward the massive ex-actress, bringing to her lips a massive slice of cake, thanks to a stair-like ramp which she used to be at level with the face of the ultra-obese actress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere Miss, have a small snack, just to tide you over until your first meals arrives.\u201d<br>\r\n   Angelina opened her mouth, accepting the slice of cake offered but, as she munched on it, a thought came to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankchs\u2026*munch*\u2026but\u2026I\u2019ve\u2026been\u2026*gulp*\u2026following\u2026a\u2026diet\u00e2 \u20ac\u00a6*munch*\u2026with\u2026my\u2026assist\u2026ant\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Felipe Mbutu, right? Yes, Miss we\u2019ve been informed already. That is why I\u2019ve been in contact with him, so to let you follow his schedule even during the Movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex-actress burped quite loudly, before accepting the next slice of cake, feeling happy knowing that Felipe\u2019s care was following her even though an ocean separated them. So she kept eating all that Felicia would bring to her, it never crossed her mind the strangeness of consuming cake after cake, when they had mentioned to give her only one. But it was ok, if Felipe had agreed to it, then she only had to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe kept watching the video, he could see all the efforts of his fellow shamans in the tribe, as they poured their herbal knowledge to good use, fattening even more the already massive ex-actress. With the helpful assistance of Felicia, such a good girl in captivating her preys, Angelina already seemed to be growing bigger and wider, and yet they didn\u2019t stop. The video kept recording the first hour of constant gorging of the actress, as more and more food was given to her to consume. Still, the video stopped for a few seconds and, when it returned online, the focus now was Carmencita in her own luxurious apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive maid was laying on a king-sized bed, waited hand and foot by a couple of young men, which fed her and complimented her for her beautiful figure. The maid ate it all up, both the food and the compliments, seemingly swelling every minute as the process kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of these butler then, moved closer to the maid, starting to massage her, as he explained to her what her role there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Carmen, I\u2019m Dominic Nkele, you may call me Dom. I\u2019ll be here to be your personal assistant. With my colleague Felicia taking care of your Master, I bet you wonder what you should do here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmencita hadt really thought about that, all she was thinking about was getting more food to get fatter and be the biggest Cow her colleagues at home had ever seen\u2026but now that he mentioned it she wondered, briefly, what he was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, the Producer decided that you could fill a secondary role into the movie, nothing too complex or exciting, to say the truth but, he was impressed by your stunning figure and found you perfect for the role of member of the protagonist crew. Miss Jolie shall be the main character of the movie, but you will have also to do a few scenes with her. Although, you may need to adapt yourself to do said scenes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you\u2026mean, Dom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you are, you\u2019re too thin. We need to put some meat on your bones\u2026that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThin?\u201d Carmencita laughed a bit at that, she knew to be a fat girl already, so she wondered on the why\u2019s the guy was trying to sweeten the news to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDom\u2026I know I\u2019m\u2026Fat. No need to\u2026lie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic, smiling to the obese maid, as he brought forward a tray piled high with slabs upon slabs of greasy steaks, replied with a total sureness in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFat? Miss Carmen\u2026for our standards, you\u2019re not even close to being thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guy say that, the maid felt herself growing excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>If he says the truth\u2026then coming here to them has been my luckiest decision. With their help I\u2019ll be the biggest and will show to those skinnies back home how a real woman is.</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe kept watching, he couldn\u2019t have been happier. The Tribe had really created such a show only for him, to let him see the progress that Miss Angie was doing during her time in Africa. He only wondered if he should keep watching or return to his duties and continue on the evening. \u2026Could he have the time to watch another episode ?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end, Felipe, had decided to watch another episode before returning to his duties. He knew that the maids and the butlers were already informed with the schedule and there were plenty of meals already prepared, needing only to be warmed up, so he could enjoy watching what his Tribe had prepared just for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he resumed watching he saw that the video started a few days later Angelina\u2019s arrival in Africa. As the screen went on, he saw that the ex-actress was still laying on her pile of pillows, as Felicia kept providing her, and feeding her, food from a nearby massive trolley, often brought back refilled once it was emptied of its contents. Angie was enjoying immensely this job, not only she was still following Felipe\u2019s regimen, but she also was actually working for the movie, although the story of the same was still a bit obscure in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSho\u2026*munch*\u2026Felicia. The story\u2026of the\u2026movie\u2026is\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere Miss, have some of this\u2026\u201d the curvy girl pushed within the lips of the human blob a new large hamburger, as she told her again what the script was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re impersonating \u2018Miss Lara Jolly, a rich archaeologist, sole heir of a massively wealthy empire, which travels usually around the world to discover ancient secrets and legends. In the movie, you have just embarked on a trip in Africa where you\u2019ve heard of a mysterious tribe that has been recently discovered, right I the middle of the deepest jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as your character want to discover them, bad people wants them dead since their village is standing on the biggest diamond mine of the entire world. So, Amanda Jolly will embark on the mission of saving these poor souls, with a few companions, and to defeat the bad people who want only to dig for the riches in the earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tribe will be so grateful that Miss Jolly will become their deity, cherished and loved until the end of times. The Movie will end on a cut scene with Miss Jolly, having spent some years in the village, as she has grown under their care as she accept to join them for the rest of her days, falling in love with the Tribe\u2019s chief.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felicia kept talking, she still kept feeding the massive American girl, which accepted and munched and swallowed all the food that was being given to her. Angelina, while enjoying the feeding, still vaguely remembered something similar to what Felicia was saying, she thought of remembering some kind of movie she did, some years before, about an archaeologist but, with her food addled mind she truly couldn\u2019t remember what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>If I can\u2019t remember it, it mustn\u2019t have been that big of a movie anyway\u2026mmm\u2026this boar\u2026so good\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ex-actress was being fed, the local girl eyes lit up when she finally saw two of her tribesmen finally carrying over the main dishes toward their guest, and future meal. A long queue of guys had in fact appeared and was carrying, upon their shoulders, massive trays with entire animals already cooked and prepared to be eaten. Felicia hurried them to come closer as she saw that spitted boar and pigs, as well as roasted cows were being slowly moved toward the blob like mountain of a girl in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Miss. Snacking time is over. Now, it\u2019s time for your main meals\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie couldn\u2019t actually see anything from her point of view, all she could see where her massively inflated breasts obscuring the world around her but, hearing that her main lunch was coming made her immensely stuffed gut grumble in hunger. No matter how stuffed she was feeling, she was so constantly hungry that if food was available, she had to have it. As usual she tried moving her arms and fingers but, was constantly reminded that she wasn\u2019t able anymore to move them, even by an inch. In a normal circumstance she would have wondered why that was, she remembered that Felipe said something about being so weak to won\u2019t be able to move herself but, with the delicious aroma\u2019s surrounding her all her worries were placed away, as she wanted nothing more than gobble more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026come\u2026to\u2026mama\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the platter was brought forward, so the guys and Felicia began pushing the massive roasted boar directly toward Angelina\u2019s mouth, keeping it from falling against her head and yet, pushing it toward her. The ex-actress didn\u2019t need any motivation though. As soon as the boar was near her mouth, she began to take chunks of meat out of the massive beast, chewing them as quick as she could, fearing that her meal might be taken away from her. With her vision completely obscured by the mountain of roasted animal she had been provided with, all she could think was to have as much as she could of it, within herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took her first bite, she moaned in happiness as a throaty gurgle resonated from her. She wasn\u2019t entirely aware of what hey were giving her but, it was so delicious she couldn\u2019t stop herself from having more and more of it. But, when she had managed to clean the entire beast up, feeling it settles quite heavily in her massive gut, she smiled in joyful surprise seeing as another similar meal was being pushed toward her. With a frenzied look in her eyes, Angelina didn\u2019t worry about anything else than filling herself up to the brim, eating as much as she could of any thing Felicia brought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, and more food was given to her, so the ex-actress body began to bloat, in height and in width, as her massive gut started to lose its resemblance to a soft, jiggly, blanket, becoming more and more stuffed with food, with her skin growing tighter and tighter as her stomach began to fill up. As the entire day passed in a near constant feeding session, Angelina\u2019s gut was starting to be over stuffed with food, her stomach skin tight as a drum, with barely no more room for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThere we go\u2026Miss\u2026A last snack to close the final meal of the day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felicia said that, pushing one of the last fried herons toward the greasy lips of the fattened up woman, she could see that Miss Jolie had enjoyed her meal immensely and yet, at the notion that no more food was coming, a few tears fell from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Are you in pain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026*Buuurp!*\u2026I\u2026just\u2026want\u2026some\u2026*beelch!*\u2026more. <br>\r\nTruly\u2026no... more\u2026for\u2026little\u2026\u2019ol\u2026me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia Macunda stared in shock at what the ultra-obese woman had just said. Just by looking at her Felicia could say that the woman was truly and completely over engorged with food. There wasn\u2019t simply no more room in her body to accept even the itty bitty little morsel. And yet, Miss Jolie wanted some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could Felicia say no to such a request?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Miss. We\u2019ll just have a little breather\u2026just the time to rest a bit. Then, an hour from now, I\u2019ll bring you something to tide you over before your midnight dessert snack. Would you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, completely glutted, drunk on food, simply exhaled a last, affirmative, burp, before finally falling asleep for a quick, restorative nap. Feeling happy of having finally managed to stuff herself so completely and knowing that more food was soon to be coming her way. With these happy thoughts, any worryingly thought about her size or her lack of movement capabilities simply vanished, as they always did lately, letting her sleep and dream of her next meals and of how healthy she was going to be thanks to Felicia and Felipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felicia sat, watching the servants carry out the huge, now empty, and dirty platters off the room where their gluttonous future meal was finally resting, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from being amazed at how big, and addicted to food, Felipe Mbutu, their shaman leader, had managed to get this woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd big she was indeed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer face was massively covered in fat, forcing the woman to squint, as her many chins rolled down from her neck, mixing themselves with her upper torso belly rolls, starting to form a funnel like shape around her head. Her breast, then, had grown immense. Pooling out in front and off her side, these were massive sacks of jelly like flesh, forced by the gravity to be laying on the ground. Then came her massive globular bell, a huge apron like gut that covered all of her front, up to her feet, actually cutting off from view her body portion below from her torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia, on an occasion when Angelina had fallen asleep, had tried to do some \u2018spelunking\u2019, having some guys lifting up her gut and exploring what was beneath it. It had been a rather short and humid trip, but Felicia had been ecstatic in seeing that also her thighs and legs were completely engulfed in fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was her ass, a magnificent, wobbly, mounds of jiggly fat, rising high up to the middle of her back, so soft and squishy to the touch that Felicia had already risked being swallowed by the soft ass cheecks. And yet, slapping it briefly she remained delighted in seeing it wobble for a full two minutes before coming to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Angelina Jolie was an immobile mass of lard, a huge monument to gluttony and greed, with which the Teeth Gnasher Tribe was going to be feasting for months to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was what Felicia had dreamed about before seeing the massive ex-actress. But now that she was in front of her, she wasn\u2019t so sure about that. In truth, Felicia, and she knew that many in the tribe thought the same, was growing rather attached to the blob like girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she was the literal embodiment of gluttony and, most importantly, as a person she had always helped Africa as much as she could. Felicia, and many others, were starting to feel ashamed about thinking of consuming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was also the maid given to them\u2026if only she could direct her Chief focus toward the maid, they could keep Miss Jolie as the monument to hunger and gluttony she was becoming\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gwen, after having pouted for a bit, had finally accepted her coach decision and then began to intently follow her coach instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, along with Helen, couldn\u2019t have been happier with the outcome. Gwen Stefani was now so single minded about her training that she barely stopped eating and getting fatter from it. Still, even though she was so one minded about the training, there was also the high risk of finally noticing what was happening to herself. Luckily, and this Felipe was grateful for, thanks to Helen additional assistance, Gwen was kept rather happy and stuffed that she barely had the energies to fight back or complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen herself was actually almost counting the days left, wishing more and more in her heart to meet Frank. And yet, with that objective in mind, she barely noticed how each day passed. Under an almost constant deluge of treats, the singer was seemingly blowing out daily. Between the hunger inducing treats from Helen and Felipe\u2019s delicious massive feast, Stefani barely had time to breath and yet, all her thoughts were focused on meeting Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning rolled on, Gwen woke up slowly, as she lately had started to do. Looking around in the dark room, she lazily scratched her topmost belly roll, although unaware of it, as she started the long and arduous process of sitting in her bed, with her back against the pillowed wall behind her. Pushing slowly, and cursing a bit, she managed in less than ten minutes and yet she felt breathless and tired only from that simple action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as Felipe\u2019s words rang in her head, she reminded herself that it seemed so hard only because she was aiming for a total relaxation, so also her muscles were going to be less ready to sudden action. As she looked at the digital clock on her bed stand, she saw that it was almost time for her first pre breakfast and, sure enough, a moment later entered Helen carrying with her a couple trolley\u2019s worth of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Gwen, I\u2019ve got your pre breakfast right here\u2026you ready for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning\u2026Helen. Yeah\u2026 feeling rather\u2026famished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, between the hunger inducing drugs she took unknowingly and the constant gorging to which she had been subjected, it was a rare occasion indeed that Gwen Stefan wasn\u2019t hungry for more. And yet, the singer still couldn\u2019t see how her own body had changed. In truth she could see it billowing out on every side, surrounding her completely but, between the encouragement words from Felipe, the compliments received by her friend Helen and her own white lies, she wasn\u2019t going to assume being fat anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she sat on her bed with her lips smacking hungrily, as her hands kneaded pleasantly her fattened frame, she greedily accepted the first oversized tray that the maid was giving her. On it, as Gwen smiled seeing the spread, there were three chocolate milkshakes, a large plate filled with fried bacon strips, a bowl chocked full of cheeseburgers and a, quite large, mound of a new kind of chocolate bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed one to inspect it closer, Helen piped up toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are actually new. Felipe told me he was going to skip a bit ahead and get you used to have them, as they should be related to the second phase of your regimen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen explained, Gwen had already peeled one of those bars from its casing and had given in to the most reliable test she had learned to trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a mouthful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately she moaned in pleasure. As she munched on her mouthful she felt a heavenly taste spread in her mouth, it was so delicious that she couldn\u2019t refrain herself from quickly stuffing the rest of the bar into her mouth, while preparing the next one to be consumed. Moreover, as she kept wolfing them down, she felt her lethargy fading, feeling for the first time in a long while, bursting with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, this extra energy she felt within herself was spent on devouring her meal, but still, in her eating addicted mind, it was a wonderful knowledge to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So, with these bars I can do whatever I want\u2026I feel like I could go with the training all day without stopping.<br>\r\nThat\u2019s so\u2026cool!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this newfound source of energy, she then, doubled down on her meal, quickly polishing tray after tray, almost making Helen feeling tired as she brought and took each tray from the growing singer. And yet, as Helen took the last tray from Stefani, she noticed that her charge, and friend, was still looking expectant for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGwen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I... I\u2019ve already finished? Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid, looking at the pouting fattened singer, smiled a bit and gestured to her friend to wait a moment, as she exited the room and went directly to Felipe to relay the news. Felipe Looked surprised as he heard that Gwen Stefani, while consuming all those bulk up bars had managed to clear the massive pre-breakfast in a record time, still it was good news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Helen. From now on, bring her immediately her next meal and we will see how it goes. If she cleans it as fast as she did before\u2026Well, in that case I\u2019ll rewrite the schedule to match her results, as it will fall to you the job of preparing her meals today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid, excited by the prospect took the next meal, that was supposed to be brought to Gwen only an hour later, and she delivered it almost immediately. Once again, with a new influx of those bulk up bars, Gwen cleared also the next meal in a record time, forcing her to improvise. As days turned into weeks, Gwen Stefani finally reached the grand day she had been expecting. <br>\r\nThe day when she could finally meet Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of those weeks, though, due to how longer it took her to tire herself out by eating, she had grown even more massive than before. As she was now barely able to stand on her own for a few seconds, she was constantly helped around by Helen. Still, as Frank was coming to meet her, she began to feel rather anxious, just a if she was in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGwen? Everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not fine\u2026I\u2026feel on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s wrong with me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the maid moved closer, taking seat near the massively flabby girl, she soothingly caressed her back, as she inquired a bit about the situation, although knowing the \u2019behind the scenes\u2019 already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026So, Frank is finally coming and you\u2019re anxious about it, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But I don\u2019t know why\u2026he\u2019s a \u2026friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I may, Gwen\u2026with all the time spent chatting and messaging with him I would say that we\u2019re over the friendship part\u2026 Look, you may haven\u2019t realized it yet but, every time you speak of him\u2026you actually have a brilliant smile on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace it, girl\u2026You\u2019ve developed a crush on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you\u2026really think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. And, judging by the amounts of messages between you\u2026either he\u2019s gay\u2026or he\u2019s into you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook\u2026Let\u2019s go meeting him and we will see how it goes from there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Frank entered the mansion he chatted a bit with Felipe, sharing pleasantries and discussing about the future, of any actors and actresses that could be brought there to him to let him work his \u2018magic\u2019 on them.  But when, finally, it was time for him to meet Gwen Stefani, Felipe just smiled and let him go to her on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frank entered the room where Gwen was waiting for him, he remained o the opened door for a full minute, barely able to think anything to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of him he had the actual figure of the singer he had last seen several months before. Last time he had seen her, she had been a lithe figure, weighing no more than 140lbs, and although with some soft curves on her, she still had an almost stern aura about her. The person now in front of him was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in a couch wide enough to hold three people, while occupying it almost all by herself, with no less than three chins obscuring her neck from view and with her overall body fattened by hundreds of soft, squishy, pounds, Gwen Stefani was an SSBBW that he was actually afraid of meeting. He had had countless dreams about her, about her size when he could finally meet her, but he had never dreamed of being rewarded with such a treasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, in his eyes, the beautiful thing ever. Even more marvelous and attractive than Angelina Jolie had been when he had met her after Felipe\u2019s intervention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith slow, fearful steps he moved closer to her, shaking slightly from both excitement and anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hi Gwen\u2026How... How\u2019s\u2026going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe and Helen sat in the kitchen, the first sipping some coffee, while the latter didn\u2019t seem able to sit still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen, would you calm down, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you feel so calm!? What if he rejects her? Or maybe that is your plan? Do you want to have her Comfort-eating to her death?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, calm down. Second, here goes the pot calling the kettle black. I know you\u2019re giving her hunger induced drugs. So, don\u2019t come here acting righteous. You\u2019re not.Third, He won\u2019t reject her\u2026Trust me on this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWell, Helen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gwen Stefani could barely rest that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same day on which she had met Frank and her hearth was still beating faster and faster. At first they had both been quite timid but, as the conversation went on and on, she had managed to keep the discussion alive and joyful. In truth she had been worried a bit when he had accepted to wait for her as she went through her five lunch meals but, she realized later on, that she had felt almost compelled and excited to be seen following her training under his eyes. And by the way he had watched her, she knew he was proud of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meeting came to an end, as Frank had still to get back to the office, she surprised herself by blurting out the question she had dreaded to even think on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWould you like to come back and see more of me?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n And his answer, his definite yes, with that romantic undertone\u2026She had seen how longingly he had looked at her and, after hearing that answer she lost any control, moving closer to him and kissing him full on the lips! <br>\r\nBut what left her even more speechless was that he returned the kiss with just as much fervor as she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>He loves me! He loves me! Oh, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling so happy but, Lord, I am!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe showed to Helen the camera feed recording of the meeting, the maid smiled widely for her friend. True, she wanted still to fatten her up but, as time went on she couldn\u2019t be but happy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why you were sure this was going to be alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you Helen. I\u2019ve noticed how Frank stared at Gwen the first time he brought her here. I knew there was something more than just attraction between those two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen huffed a little as she lit up a cigarette, taking a quick puff from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now what? I know you\u2019re getting her to be bigger than a house\u2026and you know I\u2019m also responsible for that. What\u2019s your endgame, Mr. Mbutu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Felipe let a smile shows o his face as he hid his true intentions deep within himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can guess it. What happened to Miss Jolie wasn\u2019t an accident, I\u2019m sure you know it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen took another go at her cigarette, while thinking, until she turned her stare locked on the African guy, she stared at him in silence for a few, before exhale the smoke she had inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone hired you to sabotage them, isn\u2019t that right? But, sincerely? I don\u2019t want to know\u2026probably better this way. So, now, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe grinned to the maid. \u201cI knew you were a smart girl. The plan, in itself, doesn\u2019t change too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019ll keep her eating as much as we can, for as long as we can. She needs to be way fatter. Ill just add a few therapy sessions with her, to let her grow more\u2026accustomed to her size. She\u2019s bound to notice any day now and no matter how addicted she is she\u2019s gonna be worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting, Stefani was brought one more under a whirlwind of meals and snacks, filling every moment of rest with those energy bars she was loving so much. Yet, as she was now aware of being under the second phase of her training, she had started growing more conscious about her size. And even with Helen support, telling her she was still in great shape, the singer was noticing that everything around her seemed way smaller than herself. It was at that moment that Felipe brought forward his \u2018Therapy sessions\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was midafternoon, Gwen had just cleaned out a \u2018mid-day pre-afternoon snack\u2019 snack, when her coach called her in a simple, spartan room. There wasn\u2019t much in it, just a couch for her to sit, and a table with chair for Felipe Mbutu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the room, and sat comfortably, Felipe took a minute to observe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had grown majestically since she had entered the mansion. Barely six months had already passed and yet the woman sitting in front of him was almost at 600 lbs already. He idly wondered how big she would get when all was over but, that was going to be Frank problem. Still, to see the one lithe singer, having now a definite triple chin obscuring her neck, a fattened middle divided in three belly rolls when seated, and an apron like gut that covered up to her knees when standing. Without considering her massive jelly like ass, wobbling to and fro at her every movement, as well as her huge breast, now so big and filled with fat that they could be kept up only by the strongest bra\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo see all of this was a huge reward for the Tribe shaman. Still, he was here to help her grow accustomed to her size and not just to admire her marvelous jiggling form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGwen\u2026\u201d he started \u201cI\u2019ve called you in here because it\u2019s time to start your therapy sessions, which are a fundamental of the second phase of your training. From this day onward, you\u2019ll come here every day and we will have a two hours therapy session. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Felipe. Thank you for sticking up with me for so long. I won\u2019t disappoint you never again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, let me tell you how it\u2019s going to go. I\u2019ll give you a VR headset on which there is already loaded a tape. This tape will show you how to boost your confidence in yourself and how to perfect your acting skills. Every day, you will use the VR and after that we will have a little chat together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>That\u2019s partially true\u2026However, the tape will also give you subliminal messages about how you should act whenever you feel fat or afraid of gaining weight. In particular, you\u2019ll grow less conscious about your exterior, growing more and more confident that you cannot gain any weight.<br>\r\nIf only I had thought of this with Miss Jolie\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe then brought forward the VR and gave it to the singer which, after having it on, she relaxed against the couch and listened to the tape inserted there. Visually it seemed to her to be just a recollection of motivational discussions and acting rehearsal but, mixed within those scenes, there were also brief flashes, too fast to be seen with eyes, but that were still pouring messages into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough it was as if someone was continually whispering to her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You can\u2019t be fat. Fat isn\u2019t something you are related to. Things shrink all the time around you, that is normal. Diet food is bad for you. You can\u2019t eat diet food. Tight clothes have just shrunk, that is something that happens every time. You will trust Felipe completely. You will trust Helen as a best friend. You can\u2019t be fat. Fat isn\u2019t something you are related to\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tape rolled, Felipe then moved from his chair toward the singer and, as she was deep in a trance, focused only on the tape she was watching and what she was hearing, he began hand feeding her with those energy bars she had grown addicted to. One by one he fed them to her, letting her full stomach grow more and more full, until it expanded a bit more than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as he saw that she was waking up he returned to his chair and waited.<br>\r\nAs the two hours passed, Felipe chatted a bit with the Singer, often reinforcing that the therapy sessions were soon going to give the expected results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the therapies kept going, Gwen seemed to stop her concerns about her figure and what was surrounding her, which brought, thanks also to Helen who kept her fully stocked of both food and compliments, to the Singer increasing more and more the food she consumed on a daily basis. Within the span of two months, Gwen was barely stopping between a meal and the next, soon growing accustomed to have constantly somethings to munch on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, portions kept only increasing, with her mealtimes lengthening, resulting in an almost constant deluge of treats toward the singer which began soon to outgrow anything around her. Yet, thanks to the therapy she didn\u2019t mind, being absolutely confident that she couldn\u2019t be fat and that it was perfectly normal to having outgrown a three-seater couch which she had used just the day before without an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two feeders, Gwen Stefani was growing to an astounding size. So much so she even decided to stop wearing clothes, preferring to use simple massive bikini\u2019s that were easier to manage and wear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the things were going, Helen rapidly stopped giving to the singer the appetite enhancers but, that didn\u2019t actually change very much. Gwen had grown so accustomed to eating that even if she wasn't feeling all that hunger pushing her forth, she still devoured everything in sight. Felipe knew it was almost time to deliver her to Frank, but he wondered if he could change the pact a little with the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen Stefani was almost as obsessed with food as she was with Frank but, Felipe was wondering if he could do something else instead. What if he could convince Frank to bring him something new, while giving him a shot at the growing process, attracting Frank deeper and deeper within the process?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this case, even if the guy was to one day try to revolt, he would be just in deep as himself. But there were two issues with this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Gwen Stefani would have to be moved somewhere else. Sure, she could be sent to his Tribe but under which pretext? There couldn\u2019t be that many movies directed in Africa at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, What to do with Helen? She had grown too friendly with the singer and could try to make problems if the Singer was simply shipped away\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these thoughts, Felipe had to take a decision on how to proceed\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end Felipe decide to leave things as they were. Frank was going to collect his Prize as soon as Stefani was ready, and then he would give him someone new to fatten up. In the meantime, Felipe still had to broach the subject with Helen. The maid had grown rather attached to Stefani and he didn\u2019t want to cause any unnecessary ruckus in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this reason, he thought about fattening her up too. This way she could focus herself on something else than Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his studio, Felipe roamed around the house aimlessly, until he found himself walking near Gwen\u2019s room. Now that Helen was taking care of the singer, he had almost no contact with the girl anymore, apart from their therapy sessions and yet, he planned to recover for that loss of contact. Knocking softly on the door, he entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he entered, he could see that Gwen Stefani was completely confident about her body, although having grown massive, she still smiled as if nothing had really changed about herself. He moved closer, getting a better view and almost let a smile to pass through his expression. Gwen Stefani was nothing more like the woman she had been when she had arrived at the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time he remembered her lying down in the courtyard sunbathing in the smallest bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, instead she was seated in her room, upon her king-sized double mattress bed, and still she was barely contained within it. All of her body had exploded with fat, from her head to her toes. Her face held now two chunky chipmunk cheeks, which forced her to squint with her eyes, unable to properly see to her surroundings. Her neck had completely vanished under the avalanche of chins, currently counting three and one that was growing thicker by the day, that had sprouted after each massive meal she consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breast, two humongous jelly like sacks of fat, pooling at her sides, had lost any of their perkiness and were slowly brought down by the force of gravity and weight. He didn\u2019t dare to touch them, but he couldn\u2019t imagine himself able to lift both of them at the same time. Her belly then, a massive apron like gut, which flowed from her torso down to her legs, almost reaching her calves. It was a huge mass of soft pink flesh which she was barely able to lift by herself, when empty, while immobilizing her in place when it was full of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her had fattened up quite enormously, from her may back rolls, to her humongous ass and hips, which actually pushed her up higher and higher, every time new inches were added there by her metabolism.All in all, Gwen could barely move on her own, needing help just to stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, thanks to the therapy sessions, she was still blind to all of this, fervently believing that she was just tired, or that it was completely normal for everything to seem smaller than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer still, Felipe noticed that, since she wasn\u2019t anymore capable of lifting her own arms, someone had made a series of pulley and lifts that by her minimal effort of closing her hands, would bring to her mouth a bowl constantly full of the energy bars he had gotten her addicted to. Gwen\u2019s focus was on her shows and yet, despite that, every few minutes she made so that a handful of those bars would fall in her mouth, where she would then noisily chew on them, before swallowing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Gwen?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh?...Oh\u2026*urp*\u2026Hi\u2026Felipe. How\u2019s\u2026*gulp*\u2026.going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine thanks. And you? How do you feel? Hope the regimen isn\u2019t too harsh on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen Stefani, swallowing a new handful of extra caloric bars, burped quite loudly before turning slightly her head toward her Coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot\u2026at\u2026all\u2026 I\u2019m following\u2026the\u2026schedule\u2026as you\u2026said. It\u2019s good\u2026so good\u2026 Wonder why\u2026I\u2019ve\u2026always\u2026worried\u2026about\u2026eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, Gwen, is why the regimen is so harsh. You need to unlock the real potential in you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was speaking the door behind him opened and Helen came through, trailing behind her a long column of trolleys, from which a cacophony of tantalizing aromas was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Gwen\u2026 Ready for your Third breakfast? Oh, Hey Felipe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen. Oh, this reminds me. Helen? Since I\u2019m going to be working in the kitchen for a few, why don\u2019t you keep company to Gwen, I\u2019m sure she will enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid looked surprised but, couldn\u2019t refuse and so, as Felipe left the room, she stood there, chatting a bit with the enormously obese singer. But, as Gwen ate her meals, she noticed that Helen wasn\u2019t having any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Helen\u2026You\u2019re\u2026not\u2026hungry? Have some\u2026come on\u2026It\u2019s good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid smiled a bit unnerved by this turn of events, although she had stopped using her appetite enhancer I most of the meals given to Gwen, sometimes she still gave it to her, as in this case. So she wasn\u2019t exactly happy about having some of the spiked food for herself. Still, as the singer kept eating, she rationalized that even if she was to eat somewhat more than usual she couldn\u2019t refuse her friend offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down near Gwen\u2019s bed, Helen then took a small-ish plate from one of the trolley\u2019s, revealing it to be a bowl of perfectly fried chicken nuggets. As soon as the first one entered the mouth of the maid, she felt like a jolt of pain had erupted in her belly. Trying to fill the empty void she now felt to have in her stomach, Helen began to assault at her food with a voracity that Gwen had ever seen before. Yet, the singer was happy at this turn of events. She now had an eating buddy to keep her company as she followed her training regimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Helen kept eating, picking up plates that were supposed to be consumed by Gwen, she never noticed how the Singer would often let a few of her bars in the maid lap, until one of said bar rolled out of there and onto Helen\u2019s tray. Seeing the new treat, although knowing full well how fattening and addictive those were, the maid couldn\u2019t refrain herself from polish them off rapidly, feeling herself bursting out with energies. Readily used to try and satisfy her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hours passed, Gwen finally reached her point of fullness, while, beside her, Helen laid down, seated on her chair with her bloated to bursting stomach in plain view. Her poor Maid outfit hadn\u2019t managed to survive the onslaught of fatty foods. Still, as she slowly tried to recover as much dignity as she could, she was surprised in hearing Gwen inviting her to join her at dinner.<br>\r\nAnd even more surprised in hearing herself accepting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days became weeks, it soon began to be a fix appointment for both Gwen and Helen to share their meals together. Felipe would simply bring some more trays for Helen and then leave the two girls to stuffing themselves up, returning only when both had eaten their fill. Helen was worried at first but, as the energy bars worked their magic on her, she soon began to not really take notice on how much she was eating. After all, staying side by side with a behemoth like Gwen Stefani, even if she cleaned out two lunches by herself, Helen still felt she had pretty much contained herself when at her side Gwen managed to polish five of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weeks turned into months and Gwen Stefani growth seemed to reach her plateu, Helen already was a couple hundred pounds heavier than she had initially been. What had surprised her at first was that Felipe insisted on having also her during the therapy sessions. The maid had been worried at first but, as the sessions went on she believed to be there only to push Gwen to relax more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe smiled as he looked at the two girls in front of him, both with their own VR headset on. Gwen had barely any need for it, nowadays, but who really was in need was Helen. The maid had fallen line, hook and sinker for Felipe\u2019s trap. After that first weeks of shared meals with her Friend, Helen had started to let herself go, enjoying more and more the company of the ex-singer, as she indulged with her at her every turn. What had once been a youthful girl, lean with muscles, was slowly becoming a young indulging fatty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe hadn\u2019t initially planned to have Helen grow too big but, since she was already over the three hundred pounds, why don\u2019t let her reach\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As months passed, Felipe began to press less and less on the regimen, focusing instead in brainwashing both the singer and the maid. Gwen Stefani had finally accepted her new role in life. Thanks to the \u2018therapy sessions\u2019 she saw herself ow as what she was needed to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t there to follow a regimen to have her gain new abilities to become even more famous, she was there to become a perfect eating machine devoted to the only love of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this realization planted solidly into her brain, she became much more docile and subservient, something that Felipe appreciated much and was sure that Frank was also going to enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as Gwen\u2019s weight was finally approaching the half a ton mark, Felipe knew it was soon going to be time to release her and let Frank take care of her. For sure the Contract manager was going to enjoy his new partner and, while he was going to be busy with her, Mbutu would have occupied his time with Helen, making sure that she too would grow at a healthy weight, as he was going to wait for a new celebrity to be changed into a \u2018Bigger\u2019 star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking those thoughts, Felipe finished preparing the lunch he had in preparation for Helen. The growing out maid, after months of endless gorging along with her friend had pretty much grown used to having these massive meals brought to her, even when her friend wasn\u2019t there to keep her company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the latest weeks, for example, Felipe had started to keep them separated as much as he could so to better prepare the maid to manage on her own when Gwen\u2019s time of departure was going to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was the case, Felipe, began to move the several trolleys of food out of the kitchen and toward the guest room where Helen had taken residence. The room was spacious and lavish, although not at the same level of the one occupied by the almost thousand pounder singer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the room, he stood one moment admiring his handiwork. Helen sat on two chairs in front of her computer. He hadn\u2019t taken long in having her grow addicted to gaming and surfing the net as those were now the only activities, she was doing day after day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to this her growth had been astonishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massively obese maid sat there, wearing only a tight bikini, letting all of her fat rolls to hang out in the open, as she constantly clicked here and there on the screen. She sat with her thighs open widely, letting her fattened up gut to flop downward toward the floor, as she sucked from an extra large milkshake safely secured in her buttery cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen? Time for your first lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh? Oh\u2026*Gulp*\u2026right. Bring it on! I\u2019ve got a game to finish here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe neared her and began delivering the twelve-course meal to the girl, he marveled once more at how she had fallen prey of her own hedonism. True, she had also fallen under the influence of both her appetite enhancers and the addicting taste of the health bars, but still, she never seemed to worry about her increasing girth size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he placed the last plate on her desk, he noticed immediately that Helen was already cleaning out pate after plate. Literally downing plate after plate, without taking the time to taste each but simply dumping their contents into her large stomach. Since she was so busy, Felipe began to replace the empty plates with new one, trying to see if Helen would notice but, as the girl gorged, she didn\u2019t seem to notice that she was eating two or three times more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after the third refill, when he presented her a massive three-layered tower cake, Helen seemed to falter. She stared at the massive confectionery, precariously balanced on her bloated belly, as if trying to figure out what that thing was and what she had to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, leaning closer to the obese maid, tried to prompt her to continue without appearing too explicit about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, Helen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I just don\u2019t know\u2026Felipe. Haven\u2019t I\u2026had already\u2026.one of these\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh? No\u2026Don\u2019t think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid, as she massaged her stuffed gut with both hands, as much as could due to the mere size of it, burped a bit in response before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026that I feel like\u2026I\u2019ve had\u2026more than\u2026enough\u2026already. Feeling quite\u2026filled up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe knew this could happen, but he already had a contingency plan prepared. Swiftly he brought closer to the girl face a massive jug full of a mushy brown sludge, which aroma began to tantalize the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe you just need something to cleanse the palette? Try with this milkshake, I know for sure that is probably just gas in need of a release. Afterall, Gwen has eaten six or seven times as that and she still it\u2019s going\u2026so you can\u2019t be full already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he mentioned her friend, Helen seemed to get a boost of confidence. If Gwen was so much ahead of her she surely could manage some more, couldn\u2019t she? Taking the jug with both hands she began to chug its content down in her throat, feeling as the heavy milkshake sloshed down in her belly, she began to feel her hunger rising once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had grown accustomed to this situation, she didn\u2019t seem to recall that she had used the same expedient with Gwen at the beginning, when she gave her the appetite enhancers. Instead, after burping out loudly, she simply looked hungrily at the cake still laying in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm..You know\u2026what, Felipe? <br>\r\nYou were right\u2026feel like\u2026I\u2019ve never\u2026eaten in\u2026the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood that you mention that\u2026since it\u2019s almost time for your second lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen licked her lips as she began to stuff her mouth with the massive cake, as she motioned Felipe to brig it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Munch*\u2026.bhrings\u2026it\u2026on\u2026.*gulp*\u2026I need my\u2026fuel\u2026to be\u2026competitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later, well into the afternoon, Helen finally had fallen asleep, loudly snoring due to how stuffed she was, she had fallen asleep just after finishing her third lunch. Felipe looked with pride at the engorged maid. Her body swollen with fat, her gut bloated beyond belief with enough food to fill a small army. She had been scheduled to eat only four meals that day and yet, thanks to hunger stimulants and the appetite enhancers, he had managed to let her stuff with three times as much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all he had to do was to keep doing it. If he could maintain Helen at the same rate that Gwen was having, she would surely reach the five hundred lbs marker he had thought for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the engorged maid to rest for the hours or so before her first afternoon snack, he went to see how Gwen was doing. Upon entering her room, he marveled once more at how good the singer had been at fattening herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay on her twin bed, almost a thousand pounds of blubbery beauty, unable to move her body except for her fingers, and even those were getting so sausage likes that it was growing harder and harder for her to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, thanks to the brainwashing sessions she was the happiest as she grew bigger and bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, moving closer to the bed, leaned on the massive bed bound girl and enjoyed as he looked at the girl face, bloated with fat, with so many chins that completely obscured her neck from view. Gwen was awake, chugging from one of the barrels of shake Felipe had started leaving beside her, to drink from when she felt hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massively fattened up woman was aware of being bigger than most girls her age and et, she couldn\u2019t be happier. The man she was in love with, loved her back with all of his heart and yet, all he wanted from her was to grow a bit fleshier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Felipe\u2026good\u2026to\u2026see\u2026you. Have\u2026more\u2026food\u2026for\u2026me? Need\u2026to\u2026grow\u2026more\u2026for\u2026Frank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, Miss Gwen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, I wanted to propose you something. I know how tiring it is to chew all the time, so I have a proposition for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe said that he sat on a nearby chair, still basking in the gloriousness of all the flabby fat that was laying in front of him. Gwen Stefani had almost lost any resemblance with a human being since her body had swelled so much with fat. Seen in her entirety she would have resembled a humongous pink, jiggly, mattress like thing, with a swollen-up protuberance on top from which her hair came out, falling stylishly on what had once been her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo vast she had become that her breast were swollen sacks of fleshy jello which wobbled at her every micromovement, pooling down at her sides, working as cushions for her fattened-up arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut, though, was the biggest thing around. It covered the rest of her body like a bedsheet, hiding from view even the tip of her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, as he drank from the beauty of this fattened Venus, could only imagine how big already Miss Angelina was already and how bigger Gwen could have grown under his Tribe care. But it was pointless to think about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was already promised to Frank and he couldn\u2019t betray his word to the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he woke up from those thoughts, he relayed his plan to Gwen, showing her how he proposed her to keep on growing\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Felipe relayed his plan, the once singer attentively listened to his plan. At first, she wasn\u2019t sure about the effectiveness of what Felipe was proposing. After all, she was already eating pretty much all the time but, as she thought of the happiness that Frank would get by having her growing steadily bigger, she quickly agreed to the guy\u2019s plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day, Gwen Stefani was then placed under a continuous flow of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally, she hadn\u2019t a minute throughout her day while she wasn\u2019t chewing or guzzling down something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaids began to be a fixture around her, often replacing each other as they did everything for her, seeing as the ex-singer was busy guzzling downs something edible every moment, she was awake. Stefani, already as big as the king-sized bed she was on, began to outgrow it as her forms expanded under the deluge of tasty treats coming from Felipe\u2019s kitchen. Even as she fell asleep, so used to eating she had become, her maids made sure to have her eating and chewing throughout mountains of junk foods and desserts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she didn\u2019t seem to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe control that Felipe had over her was such that the singer could not see any issue in growing to such a size, seeing her growth, instead, as a reason of pride for she was doing all this to please the only man that seemed to love her with a passion she had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the singer grew bigger and wider, it soon started to become an issue even the simple act of feeding her, although several maids were stationed around her at all times, she was simply growing too big to be catered by them. Felipe, knowing that time had finally arrived to release the cow from the cage, simply called Frank and let him know the good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank? It\u2019s me, Felipe. Yeah, just wanted to let you know that you can come and collect your prize. Be mindful though that I still need some additional contacts from you so that the Training can resume for someone else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank seemed overjoyed at the news and quickly moved the following day, hiring a 20 foot trailer to move the over fattened singer back to his private villa. As the workers prepared the truck and Felipe began laying down the plans to move the massively obese girl from her room to the truck, Frank went to seat beside the hugely fattened up artist, enjoying every second of her beautiful fleshy forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Gwen\u2026you\u2019re so beautiful\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl wanted to reply but, still under the constant barrage of food could only sputter partially chewed food as the maids didn\u2019t stop the treatment, pushing into her maw slice after slice of massive sheet cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, although she could barely breathe an move herself, she managed to close her hand on the shaking one of Frank, letting him know that she was as much into him as he seemed to be into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gwen Stefani was moved out of the mansion, Felipe turned his attention to the ever growing maid, increasing her meal sizes and upping the dosages of the appetite enhancers forcing the maid to feel constantly hungry, growing completely addicted to the simple act of eating. Helen, although at first had been worried of gaining weight, thanks to the relaxing sessions with Felipe and the near constant hunger she felt in her belly, she soon focused only on eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, as he waited for Frank to provide him another target, could only force more and more Helen to grow just as big, if not bigger, that his previous employer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Africa, Angelina Jolie was feeling like she was living a dream. The entire staff of the production, for the movie she was supposed to be doing, was constantly at her side, supporting and fulfilling any request she may have asked. In truth, she was mostly asking for food but, seeing everyone so excited about serving her, providing her and enabling her, left her feel completely satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once actress, under the nurturing care of the African studio had kept growing, increasing her size and mass at an outstanding pace. Yet, she didn\u2019t see it that way, all she seemed to be worried about was to keep on following Felipe\u2019s diet, without acknowledging that through the omnipresence of Felicia, she had already surpassed the original amount two to three times over. And yet not one scene of the movie had been recorded yet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Angelina had reached Africa she already was barely mobile under her own power but, as meals and snacks filled her days there, she began to rapidly grow even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her knowledge it was almost a year since Felipe had entered her life, changing it completely, and yet she couldn\u2019t imagine that she was soon going to be brought in to the biggest event of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd probably her last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia Macunda had tried again and again to convince the Tribe\u2019s chief to spare Miss Angelina, trying to convince him that she could actually become the reincarnation of their Goddess but, the chief, couldn\u2019t delay anymore what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoao, I\u2019m telling you, let her be. Let me find some tourist to fatten up, we can have the feast with them\u2026you know I can do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelicia\u2026Felicia, how many times I\u2019ve got to tell you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Miss Jolie represent a bounty that our tribe has never seen before. You should be proud of what you\u2019ve accomplished with her. It\u2019s true that she has grown way over our expectation, but that is just proof that we\u2019ve got to distribute her bounty to all the Tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived here few months ago, she could barely move on her own and ate like there was no tomorrow and yet, she was barely gaining few pounds per day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to your efforts, instead, she has just yesterday outgrown her room! <br>\r\nHer entire room, Felicia! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Jolie has grown so massive that if we wait any longer, we will have to relocate the village. In addition to that, all of our Tribe is waiting only for the Goddess Bounty Dinner to bless their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot take them this bounty only because you wish to have for you to play with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish for another target? There is her maid\u2026true, Dom is doing a terrific job with her and yet she has barely reached the 600 lbs under his tutelage. <br>\r\nYou could go assisting him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chief stood silent for a moment, seeing the pained expression on one of his best hunter and charmer and quickly placed a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will admit with you that she\u2019s something else. She arrived her weighing almost a thousand pounds and with your assistance she almost doubled her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know how things go, as soon as they reach a certain weight they simply die and their bounties go to waste. We can\u2019t afford to lose Angelina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as Angelina was currently busy with another of her seemingly unending meals, Felicia came into her room and began the arduous task of climbing the massive blob like body of the ex-actress, until she lay distended on her belly  in the valley created by Jolie\u2019s massive breasts, almost face to face with the humongous woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Miss Jolie, wanted to let you know that tomorrow will be a big day, for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhrmpf\u2026*gulp*\u2026why\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow we will take one of the main scenes of the movie.

Still if this Felipe had placed her on a diet, she could surely let herself go for one night, couldn\u2019t she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Shure\u2026*munch*\u2026will\u2026do\u2026*Burp!*\u2026all\u2026need\u2026ed\u2026to\u2026*Gulp*\u00e2 \u20ac\u00a6follow\u2026the\u2026movie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia then, smiled as from below of her a few of her assistants began passing her massive trays choked full of the greasiest meats and sweetened desserts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go, Miss, a few more snacks before your next grand meal starts\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Don\u2019t worry, Miss\u2026Will make you so big that Joao will not be able to move you from this very spot.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felicia was laying down, between the two mammoth sized boobs that Angelina was sporting. The actress was barely over the 2.000 lbs when Felicia had begun bringing more food for her to consume. Still, as gluttonous as she had become under Felipe\u2019s tutelage, she didn\u2019t care anymore about the pesky details like an adult girl laying between her boobs feeding her cartloads of food. All she needed, all she wanted was more to eat. Felicia, was aware of Angelina\u2019s desires and quickly had organized her servants to bring up to her platters upon platters of food, having them reach her so that she could be the one to push them into the massive blob like woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go, Miss. Let\u2019s start with your snack...you need to have energies for tomorrow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felicia said that, she grabbed the platter with an entire roasted boar and tipped it toward the woman mouth, watching in glee as Angie began to chew and swallow huge chunks from it in rapid succession. As the once actress ate, though, her body seemed to tremble slightly as it began to grow larger inch by inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia, still laying atop of the mountainous woman, could feel how the enhanced food began to manifest its effects into the massive American. As she ley there, she could feel the woman body getting fatter and fatter as the food she was eating, the same that she had treated with special herbs to increase its calories content, began to enlarge her. Yet, as more an more food was pushed against the woman mouth, Felicia didn\u2019t seem content and kept ordering more for her patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Don\u2019t you worry, Miss. I\u2019ll make sure that Joao won\u2019t be able to cook you.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina was in ecstasy. She wasn\u2019t entirely aware of how all that delicious food was being given to her, since she could no longer see in front of herself, forced instead to stare at a portion of the ceiling, but it didn\u2019t matter. As soon as she felt something touching her lips, she would simply open her mouth wide and get a chunk out of it, moaning in pleasure as the taste overloaded her taste buds. Yet, as much as she liked it, after a while she began feeling tired by the simple act of chewing and so she began to slow down in her consumption.  Felicia, noticing that the massive woman was slowing down, moved forward and began to enquire on what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Is everything okay? There is still plenty to go and\u2026and you\u2019re slowing down a  lot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo\u2026tired\u2026\u201d Angie, tired as she was, spoke slowly and tiredly especially since she was breathing hard just from the simple act of talking. Still, she didn\u2019t find anything to worry about. She was just tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChewing\u2026is\u2026hard. <br>\r\nGetting\u2026too\u2026tired\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs Felicia heard, she reasoned that it was the truth. Considering how humongous the American was, the simple act of chewing had to be truly exhausting for her overtaxed body. Still, she was nowhere near the end of the massive nightly feeding she had thought of giving to her, to make sure that Angie was going to be so full and fat that her Chief wouldn\u2019t be able to cook her. As she thought for a solution, one of her servants told her something that made her see the solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelicia? What\u2019s the hold-up? The cakes and sweets are starting to melt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young African feeder heard those words she opened her eyes  wide open, realizing that if Angie didn\u2019t have to chew she could eat even faster than before! Motivated by this plan she quickly commanded her minions to start meliting all the cakes and sweets they had, as well as turning everything else they had prepared into a mush as liquid as possible, and then moved closer to the actress head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss? Are you hungry? Would you like to continue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe\u2026*belch!*\u2026eees\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I\u2019ll bring you your food here in a minute then\u2026no need to chew\u2026You will just have to swallow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie, although she was starting to feel full, wasn\u2019t yet stuffed to the brim, a feeling she was still dreaming of reaching once more. So she was more than happy when Felicia had found the perfect solution for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Good girl, that Felicia\u2026have to remember to bring her with me in the US when finished here. She\u2019s smart and quick on her thinking. She will take good care of me, especially paired with Felipe\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough all night, up to the beginning of the morning, Felicia poured large buckets of liquefied sweets and meats into Angelina\u2019s bottomless stomach, greatly enjoying how bigger the woman grew after each bucketful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humongous American blob shaped woman also enjoyed immensely the feeding, swallowing down each portion she received with ease, as she felt herself growing closer and closer to the feeling of being stuffed to bursting point. What she wasn\u2019t aware, was that for each load she gulped down, her body grew more and more massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feeding session creeped to its ending, her body had grown so fat and massive that already was threatening to burst out of the room she had been placed in. The room, which had been built around her specifically to contain her massive girth, had been made entirely of light wood and palms, so to avoid any accident if Angelina was to grow too big as she did before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia, creeping up with the last bucket of what was basically an hyper weight gain shake, couldn\u2019t anymore stand on her knees, forced to crawl on Angelina\u2019s massive chins, just to pour that last part of her meal. As she finally managed, and tipped the bucket against Angie\u2019s lips, the once actress felt her mouth fill up with the same liquid she had grown accustomed to during that long night and, although she felt way too full, forced herself to swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body began to rumble angrily. Felicia, afraid of having gone overboard, quickly realize she didn\u2019t have any meaning of move herself to safety, forcing herself to hunker down and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, Angie\u2019s body began to rattle and quiver, as a groaning sound began to appear along with the rumbling, within the massive mountain of flesh that her body had become. Even Angie, at first started to get worried about the sound that surrounded her, until she felt herself expand once more, growing quickly bigger than before, feeling her own hands and feet being dragged down and under the mass of flesh that expanded around her skeletal structure. As the expansion ended, Angelina felt a strange sensation on her flesh. As she opened her eyes, she didn\u2019t saw the ceiling anymore, finding herself watching at the sky instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia could barely contain herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving managed to have her feedee outgrow her room, again, was a spectacular results n her eyes. As she quickly scrambled off the massive woman body, she moved back quite a lot to observe how massive Angelina Jolie had become. And massive it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of her stood a literal mountain of woman flesh. As she moved around the actress, she saw how big each part of her had become. Her arms had grown massively, becoming huge rolls of fat which had grown so large that not even the point of her fingers was visible anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar situation was for her legs, her feet vanished from view within a tunnel of sorts made entirely of fattened flesh. But even more impressive were her front and her rear. Felicia honestly couldn\u2019t say where Angelina\u2019s belly started. It was so large that it covered everything up t to her legs, engulfing them into a soft, adipose filled, hug. It divided itself in a series of belly rolls, each wider than the previous, with the last one with a width of at the very least six feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar situation was her back, massive jiggly belly rolls cascade behind of her resting on her car crushing ass. Her ass cheeks having grown so big that looked like a full adult could walk into that crack and simply vanish from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, if she had to say a number, she would have gone for the 3.000 lbs, if not more. But she knew that it was pure hypothesis, since there wouldn\u2019t be no scale big enough for Angie, nor the woman could move from her spot if there was one. Yet, Felicia was satisfied. With Angelina so big, Joao for sure wasn\u2019t going to be able to use her, unless he declared her as the goddess reincarnation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she saw Joao move closer to her, already she steeled herself for the reprimand that was sure to come but, instead, she saw that the tribe chief looked way happier than he should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelicia! Wonderful work there on our guest! I don\u2019t know how you did it but you managed to have her outgrow her room, again! That is wonderful news!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course! It would have been a waste of time if we had to dismantle it. This way instead we can simply cook her right on the spot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What do you mean? On\u2026On the Spot!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t\u201cSure! I had already prepared an underground, metal layered, pool filled with water to be used as cauldron to cook her! Now we only have to remove the supports under her, and she will fall right into it, ready to be cooked!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t\u201cSure! I had already prepared a hidden platform all around her room. That\u2019s where we will perform the sacrifice. We only have to prepare the pyre and cover all of her in tin foil. She will be great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t\u201cBut of course! As big as she is how do yo think we can move her? Although, gotta admit she\u2019s surpassed my own expectations. Maybe what you said about her being the goddess reincarnation isn\u2019t far from the truth\u2026Have to see this with the Elders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tMeanwhile in the States, Frank provides a new target to Felipe\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felipe Mbutu was living in a perfect setting. Nothing was out of the ordinary and everything seemed to go smoothly. Day after day he kept taking care of Helen, the now massive maid who had grown used nowadays to the constant stream of food going her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMbutu hadn\u2019t even the need, anymore, to hide his plan on fattening her up, she was so single minded regarding her gluttony that she was blind and deaf to any warning bell she may had seen or felt. Still, it seemed to the African feeder that the maid was made of a different paste than the celebrities before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Angelina and Stefani had managed to grow humongously huge, Helen seemed to be unable to go over the 800+ lbs. It was a shame in the feeder\u2019s eyes, for he could imagine how beautiful, and bountiful, Helen could have become if she was able to go over her plateau but, alas, there didn\u2019t seem a way for her to grow more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe currently stood in her room, admiring as Helen gulped down mouthful after mouthful of the weight gain shake Felipe had concocted for her, when he had thought that by pacing her on a liquid diet she would have managed to grow bigger. And yet, as much as she drank and swallowed, she didn\u2019t seem to gain an ounce more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he had tried to check every angle of the situation, monitoring how many calories she absorbed during the feeding and how many she actually used but, he wasn\u2019t able to understand how it was possible for her not to gain anymore. It was then that he realized she must have reached her physiological limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, since there was nothing to do, he kept her eating as much as possible, still hoping she could overcome her limits, one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left Helen\u2019s room, he was soon approached by one of the maids at his service, as she gave him the phone, letting him know that someone was on the line for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Felipe Mbutu here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Felipe! It\u2019s me, Frank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Hey Frank. How\u2019s going with your girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s adorable. I can\u2019t thank you enough for what you did\u2026She\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever dreamed\u2026and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I\u2019m calling you to know if you\u2019re available for some more work with that training of yours. And don\u2019t you worry, this line is secure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I am. Is there any new application coming in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not completely.  I\u2019ve been contacted by a few colleagues who have heard on the grapevine that some of my clients have disappeared from the scene for quite a while, creating a vacuum of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to this some of their clients have managed to grow in their own market fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what they\u2019ve asked to me is if it is possible to have some more celebrities to leave the scene for a while, so that their clients can join the Big league. They already gave me a few names, along with the justifications for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I was able to enquire without committing myself, some of these requests are coming from people who have some bias against the celebrities and who managed to ensnare said targets within false promises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other instead, are their own contract managers who have heard about the Contract of Angelina and hope for a similar result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you say? Are you interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe didn\u2019t need to even think about, he quickly gave his confirmation and agreed with Frank that he would wait for the files to arrive before taking a decision on the next target. The following day, Mbutu was busy sitting at his desk, in his personal studio, studying the profiles that Frank had sent to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was a request coming from a certain Adler R., he seemed to be one of the few who were interested in taking out the opposition to let his clients have a shot at the Big league. As Felipe scrolled through the folder, he saw a few names listed as Adler\u2019s client, but he took no interest in those. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instead focused on the target identity. Apparently, Mr. Adler, wanted to have Miss Jovovich, Milla to be taken out of the scenes or a while. As Felipe thought about the girl, he reasoned that such an actress could be a difficult one to take on. She was as big as Miss Jolie, for one, but most importantly, he wasn\u2019t going to be requested by her\u2026 Still, as he kept reading, he saw that Adler had managed to have Miss Jovovich personal doctor, one of the few she trusted more than everyone else, to falsify her checkup results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her appear as if she was at risk of contracting a dangerous issue at her vocal cords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that only Felipe\u2019s training could hope of alleviate, if not prevent completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next file was from a certain Miss Smith J., she also seemed to be interested in having one of her clients opponents to be taken out of the scene for some time. In her case, though, the target wasn\u2019t an actor but a singer. The girl know as Shakira, to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe began imagining how the singer would have looked if she was way bigger than she currently as and, had to admit that the idea fascinated him, still, he kept checking the file and the request  to be sure that no strange issue could arise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept checking the file he realized one big issue could be Shakira\u2019s partner and their children. But, in truth, he could simply take them all and have them growing, up and out, under the same roof. As he thought about it, he got quite interested in trying that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept on reading he noticed that this Miss Smith was someone you didn\u2019t want as your enemy, as she had been able to extort out of one of the trusty aides of Shakira to convince the singer that she was going to lose all her fans if she didn\u2019t step up her game somehow, convincing her that the incoming boom in music fandom was going to be toward curvy girls. Shakira was then going to be informed that Felipe was one of the best around, as nutritionist goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext file was from Mr. Schultzer A., who had invested a lot of money in the growth of his current client, an actor and musician which, already, was largely acclaimed by youngsters of both sexes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe celebrity name was Zac Efron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe folder Felipe was checking was one of those that Frank had told him had arrived because the Contract Manager truly thought about the \u2018success\u2019 of Miss Jolie after the regimen. Mbutu wasn\u2019t really sure about this one, since these kinds of guys were usually problematic and with an iron will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, since it was a man that they were talking about, he thought that the presence of a particularly good-looking maid could help greatly in having him grow out of his current size. The main issue, on this particular target, he realized, was that the manager was interested in his client, so there would be slim chances of him being able to be shipped to the Tribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as Felipe passed to the next folder, if the situation would arise, he was sure that some solution could be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the next file, he saw that also this one was coming from someone interested in their own Client, although it was a situation quite different from the previous one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Contract Manager, a Miss Greer S., had taken contact with Frank in order to have her own client taken out from the scene. As far as it was reported within the folder, the client had done some kind of harassment on her and now she was out for revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy name, Felipe saw, was Justin Bieber and although he wasn\u2019t an expert, it still rang some bells in his mind. Still, for the same Manager t want her own client out, the guy had to be a true rogue and, if that was the case, he could become a prime candidate to be shipped out to the Tribe under whatever pretext. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe justification, as he kept on reading, was that Mr. Bieber could have the big shot in the Movies he so much wanted, if only he followed the course that Felipe was to provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of these choices, and seeing as many more folders were still on the table waiting to be examined, Felipe began thinking on what he was to do. If it was better to take one of those he had already reviewed or if maybe some other files could pick his interest\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, before taking care of the guy, the shaman needed to verify a few things and to do that he sent a quick text toward Frank, confirming his choice but, requesting a meeting with the client before starting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Frank\u2019s assistance a meeting was soon organized within one of the few shadiest bars in downtown L.A., so that both Felipe and the Client could meet without attracting unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the night of the meeting arrived, Felipe went to the location, finding it just as bad as he had expected. Maybe due to his herculean size, or maybe the light of his savage eyes or, even, the pearly white glint of his slightly sharpened teeth, still nobody tried anything funky with him, letting him in as if he was a usual customer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside he went to a small, shadowed corner, as he waited for the Client to arrive. Much to his surprise, the Client was right behind him, looking like a small, glassed, secretary. Yet, as she sat at the table, he could see a fiery burning rage within those little beady eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s cut the chase, shall we? So, He\u2019s going to take care of His Majesty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, already having been briefed by Frank, knew well enough the codes that were going to be used during the meeting. \u201cHis Majesty\u201d was referred to Mr. Bieber, she was going to refer to herself as \u201cHer\u201d and Felipe himself was going to be \u201cHim\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. It will all depends on how this meeting goes. He\u2019s a bit short of trust toward others.  Still, he needs a few information\u2019s from Her, before taking any decisions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, will His Majesty absence be covered?

Second, more like a curiosity but still, why the request?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis absence will impact the scene for sure but, will be justified. His Majesty is known for vanishing for long periods of time due to his need to clean himself within specific clinics. Extended duration of his absence will also not be a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the second question, let us talk about a supposed event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppose she was invited to a late-night party. Then, during this hypothetical event, let us suppose that His Majesty tried to flirt, badly, with Her. She would have refused, of course. Mixing work and private life will never be a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupposedly unsatisfied with his failure, His Majesty would have tried next to get Her drunk. Which would have failed again, as she had to be able to see the pattern in these events, if they had ever happened. In the end His Majesty, would have tried again to get at Her, trying to slip a drug of sorts into her drink, and when she would have confronted him, he could have tried to force himself onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have remained at his side due to her work ethics, but that wouldn\u2019t mean that she couldn\u2019t exact some revenge, if so she wished. But, naturally, these are only suppositions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, having heard everything sat deep in thought for a few minutes, evaluating the pros and the cons of taking under his care the figure of Mr. Bieber. Considering how he managed to get his own Contract Manager to want him out, he decided that Mr. Bieber was in dire need of a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, inform Her that He will accept the contract. It will be His pleasure in helping His Majesty to\u2026 Relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe would like to know how He\u2019s going to proceed, in order to prepare any papers if needed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlas, He doesn\u2019t talk about his methods. Professional secret, She must know. If She\u2019s so intrigued, She could always come too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the effects directly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two parties agreed, they kept discussing on how to convince the target to join Him and, as the night began to turn into early day, both Felipe and the Client bid themselves goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has been a pleasure doing business with Him. She will send you confirmation within the week for the arrival date of His Majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s welcome. And the offer is always open. Should She wish to feel the need of a vacation, She\u2019ll be welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, as Felipe prepared the house and the servants, especially by moving Helen to a few friends who would be interested in keeping her well fed and to keep growing healthy, he received confirmation that the target was bound to arrive on the following day under the pretense of following a regimen that would have turned him into the Biggest Superstar around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came, Felipe was the first to greet the target in, as the young man looked around in surprise seeing where he was going to stay for the duration of this \u2018training\u2019, as his Manager had called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Mr. Bieber. Welcome to Miss. Jolie Mansion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Hey man. Wow, I thought of having seen this place somewhere\u2026so, why are we crashing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Miss Jolie was so ecstatic of the result obtained by the training that you\u2019re going to follow that she offered me to use this mansion as a training center of sorts, for all those young stars that wish to grow bigger in their respective sectors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, please, let our maids bring your baggage\u2019s to your room, as I will give you a tour of the place and some explanation on the training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Felipe was slowly moving through the mansion beside Justin Bieber, letting him see the place as he explained him how the training was going to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost simply, you will undergo a training which will push you over your limits. Rending you capable of feats that you would have never believed been possible. These feats will grant you limitless possibilities, especially in your actual field of work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, for example, Miss Angelina Jolie. She\u2019s followed the training and, almost right after that, she found herself requested for a multi-million\u2019s dollar contract into a massive new colossal. Or, closer to your own business, Miss Gwen Stefani, which after following the training has started working on a new album which, as far as rumors go, will be something never heard before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that by following this training of yours, I will make it Big into the industry? Hell yeah. What we are we waiting for, man\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlas, before starting there are a few rules that have to be followed in order to reach the end of the training. There are several, and you will find them into a booklet right next to your bed but, in the meantime, I will mention to you the most significative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, no contact with the outside world. For the rest of the world you\u2019re going to follow a long vacation, meanwhile you shall need all of your focus on the training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, due to the particularly complex nature of the training, you shall follow a specific diet prepared to your exact needs. Some variation may be applied from time to time but, you\u2019re requested to follow it to the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, while you shall be focused only on the training, rest is an important factor. So, one day a week you\u2019ll be free to do whatever you wish, as long as it complies with the two rules stated before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026actually, yeah. When\u2019s lunch? Haven\u2019t got breakfast this morning and I\u2019m starving\u2026Don\u2019t worry man, will follow the rules. I need to be the biggest around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Felipe accompanied the young singer to the dining room and swiftly went into the kitchen to take charge with the cook\u2019s that were already hard at work, checking their preparation and to see what would be most fitting for Justin first lunch in the mansion\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tLunch focused more on the taste. Got to get him hooked first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tLight meal, keeping him hungry to snack more often<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tLarge meal to get him nice and full. Give him a taste of what\u2019s coming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tLunch prepared more like a buffet. See how long he lasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tSomething else\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Justin sat at the dining table, he immediately was shocked as he saw a plethora of waiters and maids bringing forward platters upon platters of delicious looking food. Ranging under his shocked, wide open, eyes there were several different types of pasta, with red or white sauce, Chinese food in all forms and shapes, massive slabs of meats in various cuts and cooked with different techniques, from grilled, to roasted or even in sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral different kinds of fish platters, each extremely tasty looking, and then fried food of any possible variation served, alongside, with plentiful platters of side dishes, from salads to finger food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much of it that, for a long moment, Justin was almost afraid of having been sent into the hands of a madman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026F-Felipe? I\u2026I don\u2019t have to\u2026Eat all of this, right? Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course not, Sir. Since I need some personal information from you, in order to prepare your own diet, I\u2019ve decided to prepare for today\u2019s meals a sort of buffet, so that you may partake in whatever you may prefer. This way, basing on your preferences, the diet that will be issued will try to be at the utmost toward your own tastes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling way better, now that things were clear, Justin rose from his chair and began scooping some first courses into his plate, just like he would have done at an all you can eat buffet. On the way back, before sitting down, he stopped a moment beside Felipe, thanking him for the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again for everything, Man. And call me Justin, alright? Sir makes me feel\u2026old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you prefer, Justin. Take whatever you want, today is a cheat day. From tomorrow, we will start the diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Justin began taking huge forkfuls out of the plates he had taken, finding the pasta and the noodles made to perfection. He had actually to stop himself from moaning, as good as the plates were. Still, he kept shoveling anything he could within his mouth, considering that since he was going to start the diet on the following day, he could overdo it on that day. As he cleaned out the two plates of pasta, he rose again and took a few cuts of meats from different platters, wishing to try anything that took his fancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he returned to his table, he began to take a bit from every plate he had brought with him, tasting as much as he could but without ever finishing again his plates. As soon as he had his fills of the meats he rose again and moved toward the fish\u2019s section. Acting as before he took a couple of plates and returned to his seat where he started to stuff his mouth as if he had no control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt himself fill up, Justin moved one of his hands slowly, unbuttoning his pants, so that he could continue. Having tasted a bit of everything, as he tried to cover his unbuttoned pants, he stood and went for the dessert section. As the other trips, he grabbed a bit of everything but, as much as he had wanted to taste only, he soon find out that those sweets were to die for, finding himself unable from stopping and clearing them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around the table was tasting divine and he truly couldn\u2019t stop himself from going for a fourth trip. This time, though, he brought back quite the large plate of BBQ ribs. As much as he liked everything in the buffet, for his last plate he wanted nothing else than a few of the delicious ribs he had tasted before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his belly  was feeling full, weighing him down as if full of lead, as soon as he sat in his chair with the plateful of ribs drenched in barbecue sauce, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from attacking them with hungry determination. Uncaring for the grease on his hands or around his lips, Justin kept taking the ribs from his plate with both hands, chewing and then swallowing each load as he savored the taste of the meat and of the sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him almost two hours, between coming and going to the buffet spread, before he threw in the towel, feeling like a beached whale as he collapsed against the chair. Cleaning his lips from the grease of his latest plate of ribs, he found himself burping out in satisfaction and felt a sudden tiredness fall cross his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Urp!* Whew\u2026sorry. Ugh. So good, man. You guys really know how to cook\u2026everything was so tasty I couldn\u2019t stop myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you enjoyed, Justin. Why don\u2019t you go have a bit of a rest? Miss Cerys, the head-maid, will be pleased to escort you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe saw the bloated singer leave the table, almost being dragged by one of the maids, he grinned. As far as he saw, Justin hadn\u2019t much of a will power to fight off his hunger, if he confronted it. True, it could have been just the novelty from the day but, there was potential for improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Justin was walking alongside the maid, he couldn\u2019t refrain from noticing that she was a really cute girl, not too curvy, but neither flat. Just the right size. As he walked, got dragged, he faked a slip and grabbed on her breast, feeling it for softness. The girl didn\u2019t once break her smile, even as she felt herself being touched, instead she brought her hand up to Justin\u2019s and caressed it from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, if you wanted to feel them, you just had to ask. All of us have been already informed of your presence here and, although we are not to disturb you during the week, on your free day we can come and keep you company, if so you wish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2019? Oh, I mean\u2026yeah\u2026er\u2026sorry\u2026I mean\u2026 Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was escorted to his room, he saluted the girl and entered, feeling himself like the richest man in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Wow! Can\u2019t believe she was into it\u2026that has to be what Felipe said about the free day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I can have one of them each time? Man, this is awesome! <br>\r\nHave to remember to send my thanks to that frigid witch of my manager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems she made me a huge favor by sending me here.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling rather tired he then moved onto the bed, planning to have a quick restorative nap, when instead he fell into a deep, digestive, sleep. As he was sleeping, the maid that had escorted him entered the room and stood a few minutes by his side, staring at him maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So, you think that you can do whatever you want, eh? You pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deserve what\u2019s going to come to you, better than anyone. Mr. Mbutu can play silent as much as he like but I\u2019ve noticed that whoever enter this house gets huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess it\u2019s your turn, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will only find it fun to play along\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one of the original maids that, long before, Angelina had personally hired, and that since then had been working within the mansion. She sometimes missed Miss. Jolie, for the actress had always been nice, gentle and caring but, had to admit that with Mr. Mbutu around there was so much fun to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the guy to sleep, she returned to her duties, finding herself face to face with the African guy himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir\u201d she said, bowing her head as the old assistant of Miss. Jolie was entering the room just as the maid was leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCerys? I was just coming to make sure that everything was in order. I know that our current guest may have had some\u2026incidents around girls, so I wanted to make sure that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Sir. But there is no need. Mr. Bieber was just as gentlemanly as any other person in his position. I thank you though, for the concern.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved away, returning to her duties, Felipe turned around a bit watching her leave. He wasn\u2019t sure but he had thought that she was looking at him rather excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was aware of the fact that she had been in the mansion the longest, compared to any other maids but, if she had found him out why hadn\u2019t she said anything about it to anyone?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe had enjoyed having Helen around, she had been a great involuntarily ally, and test subject, in the fattening of Gwen Stefani, but as all good things had to end, she too had to be moved away to avoid issues. And as much as he would have loved to see the head maid to grow, he couldn\u2019t afford it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her directing the other maids and all the small jobs within the house, the mansion maintenance was going to be hell.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t often the he would let himself go that much at mealtimes but, as he recalled on how everything tasted, already he began drooling a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking himself, though, he rose from the bed and, without glancing at the mirror he had in the room, he changed into some sweats since it was time for his Gym training. Just before getting out, though, he noticed the small booklet on his bedpost and gave it a quick read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he leafed through the few pages, he saw that most rules were just really common sense, although one in particular caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<b><i>Unless authorized, no physical activity shall be performed during the first phases of the training.</i></b>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about it, he left his room and wandered through the mansion in search of the private gym, blindly sure that one had to be somewhere. As he walked, he suddenly saw Felipe coming out of the steamy kitchen and decided to approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Felipe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Hey Justin. Had a nice rest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyeah\u2026 the bed is super comfy. Had a question\u2026actually, two questions for you, though.<br>\r\nWhere is the gym? And I\u2019ve seen in the pamphlet that is forbidden to do physical activity. Is it true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the private gym is downstairs, in the basement. And it is not technically forbidden to exercise. You see, for most people, this training has to be a relaxing course, so usually exercising, running and similar activities, which put your mind and body under stress are not advisable. In your case, though, the training will be much harsher\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Harsher?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, yes. It is not personal but, Justin, you wish to become the biggest star around. To reach such a level, we will have to work on your character, on your body and on your mind, strengthening all three of those to their limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar to an ingot of stainless steel, we will need to hammer you down, metaphorically speaking, until you\u2019ll change from the squared ingot bar, you\u2019re now\u2026to the magnificent sword you will become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this reason, as your training will take a lot out of you, not only your diet will give you plenty of energies but you shall have to use those energies down in the gym to train yourself. Of course, once we will have shaped your body, the hardest part will come with your mind, but we will manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll see, in one-year time you\u2019ll be ready to take the role of the Biggest Singing Star around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow me, I\u2019ll show you the gym. One thing, though. Never exercise on your own. <br>\r\nDue to the dangers related to it, there is a trainer always available in the gym. If she\u2019s not around, don\u2019t go on your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstood, Justin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Felipe. I got you. Don\u2019t worry, man\u2026I don\u2019t want to risk losing an arm or else just to be alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling motivated, Justin followed Felipe, his Coach so to say, and after a brief trip with an internal lift, they were in a massive room, chocked full of gym equipment\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026this place is massive, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, that\u2019s what Miss Jolie had wanted. Anyway, let me preset you the in-house Trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVic? Vic, are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Justin was still looking around, he didn\u2019t notice immediately the figure approaching but, as soon as he saw her his eyes went wide in shock. Coming toward him and Felipe was a massive hulking woman, not burly as some could think a body builder to be, but still she was massive. With the body of an amazon, she walked slowly and calmly toward them, still sweating a bit, with a towel around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a two pieces sweater shorts and shirt, Justin saw immediately the defined abs on her middle, which seemed only to compliment the large rack she sported. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin Bieber, she\u2019s Victoria Savage, Vic or Vicky for short, our in-house Gym Trainer. Despite the name, she\u2019s quite friendly don\u2019t worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky, this is our latest guest, Mr. Justin Bieber. He\u2019s here for the Training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria Savage was a 6,4 feet tall, amazon, with a fiery long red mane of hairs, with an imposing figure, without looking unproportioned. By herself she had often scared shitless those who had tried to work out around her. Still, as her Jade eyes turned toward Justin, he felt only admiration, and a hint of attraction, for the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hi\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Mr. Bieber\u2026So I\u2019ll see you often in here, uh? It will be nice to have a workout buddy. Felipe is ok but, he\u2019s away way too much for my tastes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe stayed at the joke and helped to relax the mood. As he did so he couldn\u2019t stop thinking back when he had hired Vicky just a few days before. As the agreement was reached over the fate of Justin, he had been informed that the target had a preference for gym activities and so, he went and scoured the market for the right figure to have in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he searched, he found Vic, professional trainer, body builder and fat admirer. <br>\r\nIt did not take him long to convince the amazon to come and work for him, although he had to let her know a bit about the plan regarding Justin. Still, as much as the woman knew, Bieber was there just to be fattened up enormously and then sent back where he came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had made sure that was all she was going to know about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, here they were, Felipe planning to fatten Justin up with massive meals, while Vicky was going to make sure he exercised the least possible, while also preclude him any way of doing exercise ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the present, he saw that both Justin and Vic had already started to exercise, the first doing some stretches in front of a mirror, while the latter doing some curling, showing off her curves and muscles to the young singer. Leaving them to on their own, he saluted them and returned to the kitchen to supervise the preparation for the dinner of that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, form his side, was feeling rather edgy. Not only he felt ashamed of his current figure, in comparison to the amazon beside him, but also, he could barely take his eyes from her, so hot she made him feel. As he kept stretching in front of the mirror, he suddenly caught her checking him out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Man! <u>She\u2019s</u> checking me out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe is only the name? Nah, that can\u2019t be\u2026otherwise she would have started as soon as the name dropped. So, she has to find me interesting\u2026isn\u2019t she?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Justin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas wondering\u2026you\u2019ve done gym before, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026not as much as you, though...You're huge\u2026Erm! I meant\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Stupid! Why saying something like that\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began tormenting himself over his choice of words, not wanting to offend her or anything, he almost missed her answer back. And her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. It is not so often that someone sees the hard work I do to keep myself fit.<br>\r\nAlthough, you\u2019re not that bad yourself either. I can see that you like to exercise\u2026who knows, maybe in the coming months you\u2019ll managed to put on some pounds and get the body you wish for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she flashed him a smile that left him shocked and confused. So much so that he had to stop his stretching\u2019s, just to avoid hurting himself as he went down on a knee, fake checking his shoestrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man\u2026She\u2019s something else alright\u2026never before have I ever felt like this with a girl. <br>\r\nWho cares about the maids, when this beauty is around?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the afternoon both Justin and Victoria kept doing some exercise in the gym, although most of the heavy training was done practically only by her. Under the guise of letting him feel the place, before committing to serious training, she almost forced him to do only a few light exercises while she went full out to show off to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky wasn\u2019t really into him, but she knew he had potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was way too skinny, but that was something that Felipe Mbutu was going to take care of pretty soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if he managed to gain quite a bit of weight, she could see herself lusting at him, as he grew bigger and bigger for her. Vic had always been fascinated by fat people. She had grown up in a family of fitness nuts, forcing her to love the idea of having a fit, muscly body. But, whenever she dreamt, she always saw herself catering and teasing to massive lumps of fat, both women and men alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, thanks to Felipe\u2019s offer, she might have a straight shot at her dream without having to worry about being put into jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them finished their exercises, she went to a near mini fridge and took out of it a couple of bottles, tossing one to Justin, who caught just barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, Justin. After a good workout nothing better than a cold energy drink. Heads up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drank from her bottle, seeing that Justin was doing the same, she barely managed to hide her smile, for she knew that while her bottle was a normal energy drink. The one she had passed to Justin was way richer in sugar and had a mildly addictive effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting him go to have a shower, she could barely wait as months had to pass away and he would become her ideal of a Real Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig, fat and lazy\u2026she could only wait and see\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just staying there and watch as she flexed and curled, as her muscles moved under her skin, as her breasts bounced every time she pulled or pushed, he felt himself growing hot and excited. Yet, as much as there was a feeling within them, he could see in her eyes that she wasn\u2019t that much into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed the shower and stepped off, he briefly wondered if with the training he would have managed to impress her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he changed himself in a new pair of pants and shirt, he suddenly felt mildly hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Must have worked out more than I thought\u2026I wonder if I could have a quick snack before dinner\u2026just something to tide me over\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his room in search of something, he found himself by the pool, where he decided to sit down for a bit feeling his legs strained after the gym session he had just had. As he sat by himself, with his belly rumbling lightly, he notices that the maid he had \u2018erroneously\u2019 touched after lunch seemed to be going toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Afternoon Mr. Bieber. I saw you sitting here on your own and wanted to ask you if there was anything you may need\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to say the truth\u2026yeah. I\u2019m feeling a bit hungry\u2026isn\u2019t there something I could nibble on. Something light, just to tide me over before dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry, Sir. I\u2019ll gladly bring you something light to quench your hunger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing lightly Cerys turned back and went to the kitchen to take something for the young singer to munch on. As she filled a platter with some cookies, a few doughnuts and a handful of pastries, she realized that while the platter she was preparing was rich in choices, wasn\u2019t as light as the guest had asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had guessed what Mbutu plans were for the guy, although she couldn\u2019t fathom the reason behind them. In truth, she had been shocked when she had realized that Felipe was fattening the incoming guest up and, had wondered for quite a bit if he had done the same to Miss Jolie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought about her old boss, she thought back to how she had seen her balloons up, while she did nothing to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn\u2019t been her business, this she repeated herself like a mantra but, she couldn\u2019t deny the growing fascination for Felipe\u2019s methods in fattening people up. He seemed totally at ease, as if he wasn\u2019t doing anything at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, as she had witnessed the transformation of Miss Stefani, her fascination turned into admiration for the African guy. And now, now she wanted nothing more than ease along his work with their latest guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could she give to Mr. Bieber something light, while also trying to support Mr. Mbutu\u2019s plans? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around the kitchen, she noticed a platter left on the counter, under a glass dome. As she saw the dessert kept within, she remembered haring Felipe talking within himself the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>This...this has to be my best creation yet\u2026 this little cake, seemingly so light and innocent\u2026it really is bursting with so many calories to put a wedding cake to shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan\u2019t wait to see the effects it will have on whoever eats it\u2026will it be Justin? Or someone else, maybe?</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up from her reverie, a devious smile appeared on Cerys\u2019s lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she grabbed the glass dome and began cutting the small cake into slices, while also taking all the slices on the platter she was going to bring to the guest. If this cake was as light as it looked, Justin was going to commend her and then nothing could go wrong, neither to her job, neither on Felipe\u2019s plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly carrying the dessert back, she found the singer still seated near the pool, although as soon as she reached him she noticed that he forced himself to stay still, as if he had the urge to take the platter from her hands, as she slowly passed him a small plate with a slice of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>You\u2019re that hungry, uh? Well, let\u2019s see how you fare after this\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justin thanked her he immediately gave a big bite to the slice of cake, enjoying the texture within it and the taste, as it began to spread within his mouth. In few bites, the slice of cake had vanished from sight and yet, he was still hungry for more. As he turned to ask for some more, he was pleasantly surprised that a new slice appeared into his vision, as the maid had given him another one without even asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding with gratefulness, he started anew on the cake, wolfing it down just as quickly. As he swallowed down the last mouthful from the third slice, though, he stopped himself and stood from the bench on which he was, as he thanked the girl and moved on, deciding to go back into his room to unpack a bit of his baggage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, if he had to stay one year in there, he had to have everything organized, at least within his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked toward his room, though, he began to feel his hunger vanishing, replaced by a certain heaviness coming from within, just as if he had a repeat of the massive lunch, he had that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Sheesh\u2026Gotta start get used to eating well.<br>\r\nCan\u2019t be I\u2019m already this full after such small slices of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah, it must be just the fancy food in here\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he returned to his room, that feeling of fullness made itself more and more present until, as he stood near his bed, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and decided to lay down to nap a bit. As he closed his eyes, he thought to himself that he was going to sleep just for a bit, only to soothe his overworked stomach but, instead he rather quickly fell once more into a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, looking out at the window he saw that the sun had already settled. Surprised, he stared at his watch and realized he had slept away all the afternoon. Groggily standing up, he noticed that his stomach was now feeling way better than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, he felt a bit hungry, although he wasn't sure how it was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, have to curb down my appetite\u2026otherwise this diet will be hell for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood from the bed, he turned around and watched himself into the mirror. Already he could see the hint of a bit of softness on his middle, nothing to be scared over but, if he didn\u2019t do anything it could only worsen his situation. Still, as he stared at his reflection, he smiled at himself. He had never said that to anybody but, he loved to stare at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from the beauty in the private gym, no one else had ever caught his eyes, than himself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2018<i>And to think that when this training will be over, I\u2019ll be the best I can ever be! I\u2019ll be the biggest star around\u2026None shall reach my stature\u2026even around the world! Ha!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had those thoughts, he heard someone knocking at his door. Collecting himself, he answered back finding out that it was just one of the maids which had come to inform him that dinner was ready to be served in the dining room. Quickly, as he began to feel his stomach grumble a bit as if it could have understood the maid words, he re-dressed and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the dining room he was surprised in seeing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Justin entered the dining room he stood silently in shock realizing that, seated neat his own place, was Vicky, her Amazon Gym buddy. Slack jawed he didn\u2019t resist when Cerys helped him toward the table, aiding him to sit, retaking control only when the first platters of food were placed under his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down he saw a salad bowl being placed right under his eyes, filled to the brim with pasta made with a sauce of cheese, egg and bacon pieces. Questioningly he moved his stare toward Felipe who was standing at the end of the room, near the double doors of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Justin could finish his question, he felt the socked foot of Vicky \u201ccaressing\u201d his own leg, as she invited him to enjoy dinner. Looking at her plate he could say that she too had received a larger portion than normal, although it still seemed small in comparison with his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, between his own hunger, and the encouragement from Vicky, he started to take forkfuls out of the bowl, feeling how good the pasta was on his taste buds. After the first, slow, bites, he began eating in earnest, focusing only on his plate without noticing that Vicky\u2019s portion was quickly replaced with a more normal sized plate. After a while, though, as He had had more than half a bowl, Justin began to slow down, feeling his shirt a bit constricting on his filling up belly. As Vicky saw this, and after sharing a conspiratorial glance with Felipe, she proposed a toast, having so Cerys fill up Justin glass with some kind of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo a perfect Training course to make out of Justin the Biggest Superstar Around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her sincerely cheery voice, Justin couldn\u2019t much but oblige, raising his glass and drinking the sweetened tea in it. As he drank it he shared a dubious glance toward Felipe, which imagining the question replied with his calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough the training start tomorrow, drinking alcohol before this kind of regime is not a good idea. I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019ll have to get used to tea, Justin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries\u2026*urp*\u2026Man. It\u2019s kinda too sweet\u2026but it\u2019s good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he then returned to his plate, he began once more to scoop up forkful slowly but, after a few minutes his pace quickened again, as he felt his hunger rising anew. Although finding it strange, he didn\u2019t seem to mind it too much, since the pasta he was having was so good. As he quickly polished the bowl, he emptied again his glass, which had been filled once more by Cerys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeeting the stare of Vicky made him blush and so, he didn\u2019t see the bowl taken away, replaced by a platter filled with lasagna covered in beef sauce. As he looked at the, once more, big portion he had been given, he had wanted to raise some questions but, he felt down right starving, although his belly pushed against the confines of his shirt. As Vicky encouraged him to go on, saying that he was going to need the carbs to train, and Cerys freed his belly from the shirt, by lifting it up, Justin started again to dig in, enjoying the taste so much that he couldn\u2019t refrain a moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite, with Cerys at his side, helping him to clean his lips with a napkin, he cleared almost three fourths of the pan before stopping again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026*Burp* It\u2019s all so good\u2026feels full but\u2026so hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just not used to eat a bit more than your normal. This meal is pretty common for people who wants to train their bodies as you wish to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is?\u201d He asked toward the amazon seated at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sure is. A Real man who\u2019s training, eat like this at all meals\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2026guess I\u2019ve got to step up my game then\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmptying his glass once more, he quickly went to work on the remaining food, having bite after bite, swallowing each morsel and feeling it travel and land heavily in his filling up stomach. His belly pushing out in front of him as it filled with the delicious food, he was having, began to move closer and closer to the table. Cerys saw that and distracting for a moment Justin by giving him a new refill of his tea, she managed to smooth it out so that it would grow under the table, instead of against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finally cleared the pan of lasagna, he loudly burped before excusing himself rapidly. Although nobody around the table seemed to be disturbed by it. Still, after a few minutes rest, during which Justin chit-chatted with Vicky, the pan was removed, and a new plate brought to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he saw a small mountains of fried chicken pieces, while on the side, there were a small tower of onion rings and a few pieces of chicken nuggets. Forcing a second burp out of himself, Justin began tearing the chicken flesh with his own hands, munching with joy on the greasy fried skin on each piece, feeling its greasy, and yet not heavy, taste on his tongue. Beside him, Vicky stole quick glances at him, as she ate her grilled chicken breast, accompanying them with excited smiles. Thus pushing him to eat faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelipe, from the sidelines, watched interested as Vic managed to push and prod Justin to keep eating, although his belly was rounding out quite a bit, showing that he was getting pretty full. Knowing this, and wanting to avoid having him feel sick, Felipe quickly went into the kitchen and began to take out from the fridge the cheesecake they had prepared to close the dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>There will be time to push him for more than three courses\u2026but for now, we\u2019ve gotta make do with what we have\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing from the adjacent room that Justin had finished, hearing his most massive belch of the evening, Felipe gave him again a few minutes rest, before bringing to him the cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe singer, feeling still a bit hungry, and also full, moved a tired glance toward the treat that Felipe had brought on the dining table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-More? I\u2026I don\u2019t know if I can\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just to close the dinner, Justin. Come on, just one slice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe said that, he cut a larger than most slice and left it in a plate in front of the singer, which was currently busy massaging his full belly with one hand, while he moved under it the hem of his sweat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was feeling full but, between the smiles from Vicky and his own residual hunger, he took his spoon and brought one morsel to his lips. As he chewed on the cake, he closed hi eyes in bliss. Although he was feeling pretty full, although everything had tasted delicious, that cake was heaven on his taste buds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft, and yet sweet, taste of it seemed to cleanse his mind from any other concern. Morsel after morsel, in half an hour he finally managed to clean his plate lick-clean, yet forcing him to crash with his back against the chair, feeling himself get sleepy after such a meal. So he laid there, his tired eyes met for one last time with those of Vicky, noticing how satisfied she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a good job tonight, Justin, for a starlet. Will see you tomorrow afternoon at the Gym. Have a good night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that, she rose from the table, sending him a wink and leaving the room, as he was then helped by Cerys to stand up. As he was up, sleepy as he was feeling he barely felt the tautness in his stomach, letting himself be carried away to his room. Before he could leave the dining room, though, Felipe stopped him for  a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin, tomorrow we start your regime. I\u2019ll send Cerys up to wake you at around 10 AM. Enjoy your night\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justin was escorted to his room, undressed and redressed in his PJ\u2019s, he felt sleep overtake him quickly, although a thought passed through his mind before he closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man\u2026hope the regime is always this good\u2026Want to be the bigger thing of next year as soon as I can\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, as he was now standing from it, he slowly walked to the bathroom where he quickly showered himself and prepared for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started to wear his sweats, he noticed that they weren\u2019t as tight as he thought they should have been. Wondering for  a moment about that, he suddenly forgot about the issue as he heard Cerys knocking on his door, informing him that breakfast was ready. Feeling strangely hungry at first morning, he left the room and went to the dining room, finding there Felipe drinking some coffee and having a bit of a croissant still on his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Justin. Ready for your first day of training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure am, Man. Can\u2019t wait to be started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! Let\u2019s have your breakfast and we can start. Now, breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day\u2026be sure to have your fill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justin sat o his chair, he saw that the maids begun by bringing him three plates and a couple of tall milkshakes to wash the food down. On the first plate he had a stack of six, two inches thick pancakes covered in maple syrup and liquid butter, then there was the larger plate with a four egg omelet and a dozen or so strips of fried bacon and finally a slice of Sacher-Torte cake. As he licked his lips, he first grabbed one of the milkshakes and took a long gulp from its straw, tasting the chocolaty deliciousness from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he began his meal, taking a morsel from one plate and then another from a different one, feeling the amazing tastes spreading on his tongue, making him enjoy greatly the meal. A bite here and a bite there, it took him almost one hour to everything, leaving him slightly panting as he felt his now full belly weighing him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Job, Justin. Now, give me a few minutes and then we can meet in the adjacent room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, slowly moving with his full belly, Justin ambled through the hallway until he reached the adjacent studio, whereas he sat heavily on a reinforced couch, trying hard to remain awake as Felipe began to explain to him how things were going to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, Justin. So, from today we will follow this schedule tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach morning, right after your breakfast, I\u2019ll teach you the theory, the gestures and the mindset we have to mold into your persona in order to have you reach the level of greatness you can achieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we will have a break for lunch time, followed by a short rest to \u2018recharge your batteries\u2019 and then in the afternoon I will show you a few practical examples through movies and prepared clips. At around 6 PM you will join Vicky in the gym, where she\u2019ll give you some assignment to prepare your body for the advanced exercise you will need to follow in the following months. After a quick break for shower, we will meet again at Dinner and, for a quick recap of the day\u2019s lesson after it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a fast, end of the day snack, you will go to bed and the cycle will continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, ready to start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, feeling downright sleepy after the breakfast he just had, could barely follow what Felipe had said, still, trying his best he replied with a sleepy confirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, as Felipe began talking and explaining in boringly detail, Justin didn\u2019t even realize that he had, slowly, fallen asleep. Felipe, smiling through his teeth, kept on with his explanation, though reducing his words to barely a whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>You\u2019re getting into the spirit of things aren\u2019t you, Justin? <br>\r\nKeep working like this and you\u2019ll be the BIGGEST star around\u2026just as we want you to be</i>.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost two hours later, Felipe raised his voice, waking up the singer from his nap, making sure to avoid noticing that the guy had fallen asleep. As he gave Justin a quick summary of what had been said that morning, he ushered him out, directing him toward the dining hall for lunch. As the singer walked through the hallway, he tried to remember what Felipe had explained to him but, he didn\u2019t seem to recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man, that was boring as hell. <br>\r\nNo wonder I can\u2019t recall anything\u2026well, it\u2019s only the first day. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get used to these lessons\u2026</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the dining room, he quickly sat at his place, not feeling truly hungry but, neither sated. As he waited for lunch to arrive though, he graciously accepted a cup of tea from Cerys. As strange as that sounded to himself as well, h was getting rather used in having that particular brew of tea. He made a mental note to himself to ask Felipe to share which brew it was so that he could have some when he returned to his old life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he did that, he saw that Felipe was coming toward him bringing him his lunch for the day. As he looked at the plate he already started to drool a little. His coach had, in fact, prepared for him a plate with a couple of home made hamburgers and a \u2018healthy\u2019 amount of fries on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burgers were quite loaded, as far as he could see, since there were two patties of meat inside, separated by three layers of cheddar cheese, tomatoes, pickles and some strips of bacon. Without waiting anymore, as he felt his hunger raising just by looking at them, he quickly grabbed the first one, biting into it with gusto. Still, he turned a curious gaze toward Felipe, asking him the reason for such a meal, without actually saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the burgers, Justin? Simple. Since you\u2019ll need the energy for this afternoon gym session, I\u2019m having you carbo-loading. Ejoy your meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that answer cleared any doubt, Justin completely focused on the burgers and the fries, biting through them savagely and shoveling handfuls of fries within his maw. After devouring the first burger, and half of the fries, he felt quite parched and quickly emptied his glass of tea, seeing Cerys refilling it once more. After thanking her with a smile, he then proceeded to attack the second one with just as much hunger as before. Soon enough the plate was empty, licked clean of any crumbs and yet, he felt both filled and hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he saw Felipe walking toward him, and before he could stop himself, Justin blurted out \u201cCould I have some more, Felipe? I\u2019m feeling really hungry\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe African guy simply smiled although he quickly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaturally, should you need a little more we will bring it to you but, consider that there is also a bit of dessert today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026*urf*\u2026Man. Bring it on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Felipe quickly asked into the kitchen and, just as swiftly, another plate with the same quantities as before was ushered to the hungry Justin. The guy, although he knew he should be feeling full, he could only feel a strong hunger bubbling within himself and so rapidly began to clean out also the second plate, mowing down the burger a little slower than before but leaving, nonetheless, the plate licked clean once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, his already puffed out belly, pushed out even more, as he was still digesting his breakfast from before. Still, this didn\u2019t seem to faze him as the dessert was brought to him, revealing quite the large slice of apple pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justing breathed in the delicious aroma from the pie, although his stomach bubbled and grumbled noisily, he still moved the plate closer to him, taking large forkful out the slice of pie he had received, enjoying its taste greatly.  With also the dessert cleared out of the way, the singer felt once again stuffed to his fullest, yet, since lunch could be considered finished, he rose from the table and went into the living room for a quick nap, just as prescribed from the regime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Cerys helped him sitting down on the couch he felt himself being overtaken anew by sleepiness, which was assisted as the head maid kneeled beside Justin, insisting in giving him a belly rub to, help him out with his stress. Right during the massage, Justin collapsed once more in a deep digestive sleep. Once sure that he had fallen asleep, Cerys stopped and began bringing the sacks that Justin was going to be surrounded by as the afternoon lesson would proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour and something, Felipe woke the guy up and began showing him a few gestures and situations he could end with, trying to appear as boring as possible, managing so to have Justin focus on the movie that Felipe was using as an example. As the singer kept watching the shows, he never realized that his hands were moving, slowly at first but taking the pace quite quickly, at the snacks that Cerys had surrounded him with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing from small chocolate bars, to cream puffs and to similar sugary pastries, Justin kept munching on throughout the afternoon, alternating the food he was eating with the herbal tea they kept bringing him. It was only when Felipe called the class over that Just felt himself overly full, although as he watched around himself all he could see was a single, meager plate with a few cookies missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had been in what was going to be called his \u2018Eating trance\u2019 Cerys and another maid made sure that the empty plates were swiftly taken away, to make sure the he wouldn\u2019t realize how much he had really been eating. Although, as he rose from the couch unsteadily due to his full belly, Justin did have some thoughts about his eating, the only thing that stopped him from asking out loud was the fact that he had no physical proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man\u2026I feel so full and bloated\u2026But I can\u2019t seem to remember having anything apart a few cookies after lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, since it\u2019s the first day, I\u2019m just not used to eating all those carbs\u2026 Yeah, that must be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I feel so freaking full\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felipe accompanied him toward the gym, he  started to have a bit of  a chat with his guest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something unexpected?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Felipe, in truth\u2026I still got to get used to all these carbs\u2026I think they may be bloating me a little. For the rest, though, everything seems ok\u2026 a bit boring but, ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I know how you feel, but before practice, theory must be learned. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure in a few weeks you\u2019ll get used to it. Now, it\u2019s time for your hour in the gym. After that, get a shower and at twenty hundred we\u2019ll see each other in the dining room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Felipe turned around leaving the bloated, in truth stuffed, Justin to meet Victoria in the gym.<br>\r\nHe then moved slowly to the internal elevator while, tiredly thought of having to show himself in that way to that beautiful amazon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a fleeting moment, he thought about skipping gym but, he had an objective and he wanted to get it.  As soon as she saw him walking slowly into the gym, his belly all puffed out and taut as a drum, she tried her best to hide the grin she had on her face. Still, the guy was there, supposedly, to train but, seeing as how filled up with food he was, she knew perfectly well he couldn\u2019t do very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back, Justin. Ready for some exercise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sure\u2026*Huff*\u2026j-just a\u2026just a minute\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time, Justin. Nobody\u2019s hurrying after us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, since today is your true first day, I think I\u2019ll mostly give you a tour of the place, explaining you what we are going to do in the next few weeks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Victoria showed him around, explaining to him in detail what each machine did and what he was going to do in the following days, Justin tried to keep the pace as much as he could but, after a bit he felt himself growing too tired to continue and had to sit on a bench to have a breather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat down, Vicky sat beside him and began chatting, distracting him from his stuffed belly, giving him the time to rest and digest a bit. In such a way, as they talked about their lives, the hour that was supposed to be gym quickly passed, leaving the two of them late of half an hour already from the schedule that Felipe had told the singer that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, feeling much better now that his stomach had had time to settle down, quickly realized that they were late but, being fascinated by Vicky, didn\u2019t hurry out but simply followed her as they slowly moved to the dining room. As they arrived, Felipe didn\u2019t comment or said anything, knowing full well that if Vicky had needed the extra time, the it was time well spent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as Justin sat at his place, although having done almost nothing but eating, he couldn\u2019t stop from drooling in pleasure as a rich fish tartare was presented to him as a starting platter.  Without waiting for any invitation, just as if he had passed the entire afternoon exercising, Justin started to rapidly clean the platter before him, although he found himself burping quite a lot since he was after all still digesting the afternoon filled with snack that he\u2019s had in front of the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t stop him though from literally cleaning the fish tartare and the following platter, which was a rich ratatouille. Using bread to get even the most minuscule speck of sauce, the singer felt rather better now that his stomach was once again all filled up but, a few minutes after having drink from his glass, he found himself growing hungry once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time his dubious expression stood longer on his face, especially since his next platter was late in being delivered.  As he waited, he thought about the strangeness of the situation, trying to figure out why had he suddenly felt hungry once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, before he could reach a solution in his mind, Felipe was happy to leave in front of him the next dish which was a large tray with an assortment of pastries and slices of cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin Bieber, feeling his sweet tooth called in, smiled widely as he began eating each treat at a faster pace than before, barely tasting them as he quickly munched on them, until the serving tray was void of anything edible, leaving the singer to realize how full he felt. For a moment he toyed with the idea of asking for a refill but, remembering that after a brief review of the day with Felipe he had scheduled a closing the day snack, he decided against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about an hour, Felipe did a quick recount of the activities performed that day, neither punishing nor praising Justin for his attention (or lack of) but, soon enough, he closed the review while all were still seated around the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Justin, as a first day, this hasn\u2019t gone bad\u2026not as good as I had hoped but, it\u2019s a start. For this week, and maybe the next too, we will focus on the theory and on the most basic gestures and mindsets. As soon as you manage to master them, we will proceed with the next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as anybody knows, since going to rest on an empty stomach is bad for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll have one last snack to close the day and we will see again tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, who during the review hadn\u2019t done anything else but drinking his tea and waiting, was more than ready for what the kitchen guys had prepared for him. Soon enough, as Vicky and Felipe left the room, Cerys began bringing a few snack to the already filled up singer. Felipe had known that Justin had done nothing but overeating that day but, it was only by stuffing him over his current limit that they were going to super size him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerys quickly left in front of the induced starving musician a platter with half a dozen cupcakes covered in frosting, half a dozen jelly filled donuts and one last plate with an entire quart of chocolate cake. Poor Justin, feeling himself so hungry to be almost starving, began almost to swallow the cupcakes whole, as he tried desperately to sate his belly. Alas, it was only when he reached the cake that he crawled down to a stop, leaving most of half the cake on his plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling completely full he hadn\u2019t any energy left to continue and so, feeling his arms growing heavier he sat at the table trying to will himself to stand. Cerys, though, wasn\u2019t going to let him leave the table without finishing his after dinner snack and so moved closer as she began to take forkful of cake toward Justin lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Sir, a few more bites and you can go lie down\u2026it is shameful to leave food on the table\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween her words and his own sweet tooth, as much as he was feeling stuffed, Justin finally managed to accept the last few forkful of cake, although it took him quite a long time to finish them. As soon as everything had been cleared, it was the head maid who helped him rising from the chair and accompanying to his own room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was in is room, back on the bed, although his overfilled belly grumbled angrily in protest, Justin quickly fell into a deep sleep, during which his body absorbed and digested each calorie he had consumed that night. Cerys stood at his side for a few more minutes, slowly massaging his taut gut, until she felt it quiet down as the digestion process started, leaving the guy to sleep away the massive amount of food that had been stuffed within him in that day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still the two of them did love each other and wanted to find a more permanent solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile checking on the internet they suddenly saw an AD for a counsellor, which seemed to have a huge amount of fans and followers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick search and confirmation of the info on the guy, they took an appointment and went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, the two of them entered his studio and seated on the couch as they waited for the guy to start their session. The Doctor\u2019s name tag Recited \u2018Dr. Sweet\u2019 and he seemed quite the average Joe. The only thing that stood out on him was a strange glint in his eyes, a glint that some people seemed to find unnerving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart for that, all reviews about him were extremely positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered and sat on a small couch right opposite to the married couple he smled as he greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Mister Pitt, Miss Jolie. I\u2019m Philodendron Sweet, but you may simply call me Phil. Now, I would like to keep this as informal as possible, if that is okay with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple silently nodded with each other, at which the doctor smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Already from this I can see you\u2019ve been a loving couple from many years. But it does seem you\u2019re having some issues lately. Don\u2019t worry though. We\u2019ll find a solution, together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started to delve deeper and deeper into the issues that the couple was facing, the doctor began to formulate a plan on how to solve the situation with his new clients and to solve a minor matter that had been persecuting him lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Philodendron had always been a different child. He had grown in a family that considered the rest of mankind as nothing more than an additional source of food. Growing up he was taught that to enjoy the taste of the human flesh was a good thing, something that most should have given out freely. But apparently he hadn\u2019t ever found anybody who wanted to share their personal bounty and so he had to reinvent himself to satisfy this need he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for this that he decided one day to study the behavior of the human mind and, after mastering various degrees, he opened up his studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping people pair up\u2026and then chewing\u2019em down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two celebrities in front of him were going to be the icing on his figurative cake. He had just to let them grow together, both in happiness and in size, and then he could finally see if fame made the flesh taste better\u2026just like a normal steak and one prepared by a gourmand were two different worlds apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of discussion, being able to discern that the two of them were simply having a normal issue with their own respective careers, he decided the best course of action for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad, Angelina. I\u2019ll be sincere. The two of you look perfect together but you\u2019re letting your own greed getting in the way of your relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI personally say that there is an easy solution to try to solve this and prevent any further fights between you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should try to take a breath of rest from your own careers, for a while at least, and following a specific schedule that I will prepare based on the information you\u2019ve given me, you shall try to rest, relax and enjoy life together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo have a better effect, I would suggest following you on a more personal level. By living with you and helping you on this journey. You will see that in no time you two will return to the best time of your relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it be acceptable for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise we could find some other solutions. I could follow you one by one, but it would require a longer period. Or maybe, I can give you two some different objectives, thus forcing you to decide which you prefer best, if the objective or your true love.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, six meals per day doesn\u2019t sound\u2026too much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a common misconception. It doesn\u2019t matter what you eat but how often you eat. See, to reach an easier peace of the mind, you\u2019ve got to be able to concentrate on what\u2019s really important. By eating often, you give your body a constant intake of energies that will grant you additional resources to reach the bliss. Otherwise your body would have to spend precious energies to always be on the lookout to satisfy its hunger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor almost half an hour the married celebrities kept on discussing with the doctor but, in the end, they had to accept all his proposals. They were a bit worried about this turn in their lifestyle but, in the end, as they started following the schedule they both began to grow more and more complacent as time passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that week the two of them didn\u2019t do much more that wake up late, watch television together, sleep together and, of course, eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they followed Dr. Phil\u2019s diet of six meals a day, with a constant stream of snacks out of the mealtimes, it was no wonder that both their bodies began requesting more than what they were currently having. Still, in that week, both Brad and Angie, noticed that there were no fights, no arguments but a simple calm and acceptance of what was going on around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil followed the two celebrities all week, watching them from afar, pushing them from time to time in the correct direction\u2026toward gluttony. And the results were promising so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the two had gained that much in that simple week but, it was normal. Phil knew that the week he had instructed them to follow was necessary to instigate their bodies to start slowing down their metabolism and to get them used to eating more. And that they had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new week began Phil made sure to be always reachable and, while doing so, to always have time to provide a few more detailed suggestion or instruction to his client. That morning, for example, as he was brewing some coffee in the kitchen he saw Brad coming down from their master bedroom and sit at the table beside him, while ordering around their servant to prepare him a hearty breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsuelo? Please, could you make me a few eggs with fried bacon? Four or five eggs should be enough\u2026 Oh, Hi Phil. How\u2019s going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning Brad. Well, shouldn\u2019t be I to make that question to you? It\u2019s fine, although, I wish I could see some better results from the two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad began eating from the big plate he had received, he looked quizzically toward the doctor seated beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Brad\u2026Usually in the first week the couples grow closer through a common objective. You two instead are still on the \u2018Finding your own peace\u2019 moment. However, that\u2019s okay, we will try to make your next week\u2019s more relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoreover, since we\u2019re talking of this\u2026I\u2019ve been thinking of increasing your daily regime a little bit. As a couple you guys are way too singlehandedly active. That isn\u2019t good. For this reason I\u2019m going to implement some required nap time that the two of you will have to follow together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Phil, how could we do that? If I haven\u2019t need for any sleep how would I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy. Let Dr. Sweet work on it. You\u2019ll soon see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, as Brad and Agelina sat on the couch together, watching some tv shows, trying to follow the schedule from their doctor, their servants brought them their snacks for the mid-morning, but both watched stunned as their usual small bowls of snack was replaced with a large Devil Food\u2019s cake for Brad and a large apple pie for Angelina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two looked at the massive treat, Philodendron appeared behind them with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, guys, you need to relax. To do so, you will eat some snacks until the both of you feel sleepy. This way, you will snuggles beside each other and move forward toward the peace and calm you so desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI already instructed your servants about this, so don\u2019t worry about a thing. Just eat, sleep and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything will be taken care of.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Oh yes. Soon the two of you will get used to gorge all the time\u2026I can\u2019t wait to see it happens\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was near the end of the second week since Brad and Angelina had started to follow the advice from Dr. Sweet, and the two of them had never been as happy before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clock ringed both woke up with a yawn, Brad was the first to rise to a sitting position, while scratching the beginning of a potbelly he was developing, while Angelina kept low on the bed but wide awake. Not a minute had passed since the clock ringing that their room door opened letting in two of their servants. These brought with them two tray, one for each actor, with their first pre-breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both celebrities sat in their bed, they quickly accepted their trays and happily started digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad began taking bite after bite at his large portion of fried eggs and bacon, washing it all down with the thick vanilla milkshake, his portion had been steadily growing since the previous week, reaching now a size that could have fed two normal people. Yet, Brad felt he could trust the good doctor advice and so didn\u2019t see anything wrong in its size. <br>\r\nAngelina instead licked her lips as she surveyed her own pre-breakfast, it had been constantly changing in the last week but, apparently it had finally settled on a constant barrage of sweets. In front of her, in fact, there was a large bowl filled with chocolate brownies, a couple of large muffins and a big plate with a particularly large slice of devil\u2019s food cake, with a side of three dollops of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth celebrities did a quick work of both trays and, as soon as they were cleaned, the two maid quickly took the tray\u2019s away, leaving the two celebrities to rise from the bed, to prepare themselves for the continuation of the day. With a belly full of sweets, Angelina was the first one to rise and, as she did every morning, she began her day by taking a quick shower and then wear her usual attire for the day. A pair of  short shorts in spandex, with matching sports bra. As it had become usual, she quickly inspected herself, noticing that she had become a bit softer than before but, with her new relaxed attitude she simply dismissed the thought and went on with her day.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrad was in a similar position, after dressing up in a pair of sweater pants and shirt, he gave himself a good look in the mirror. He flexed a bit his slightly flabbier body and, as per instruction received he knew that by being bigger he was going to be stronger. As he finished, he too, left the room and followed his wife down toward the kitchen where their true breakfast was awaiting them, along with the good doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them were seated at the kitchen table Doctor Phil smiled and greeted them, while sipping a bit of coffee, as they began to consume the first proper meal of the day. Brad, seated at one end of the table, happily munched on a dozen hot dogs, as he kept staring at both his wife and to his next plate, chocked full of fried bacon and sausages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him, always within reach, there were a couple of tall glasses full with an energy drink, spiked with some spoonful of bulk up powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite to him sat Angelina, she too was rapidly consuming quite a large breakfast while feeling decidedly content in refilling her belly with the food she was starting to get addicted to. In front of her there were several plates, the nearest ones were full of fluffy pancakes drowned in syrup and butter, then there were a few more with chocolate covered waffles and finally a large platter with half of a massive chocolate cake covered in frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina smiled toward Phil as she began to dug in the delicious food. She had shown some resistance at the beginning but, as the doctor pointed out, she had to live more relaxed to return to her old love life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she was beginning to enjoy following that diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both cleaned out their respective plates, both actors lay on their chairs panting slightly. As it was becoming a normal occurrence, both felt tired after eating their breakfast and always needed some minutes to just recover from it. Their bodies though began rapidly to digest and process all the food they had consumed, something that Phil loved to be able to see right in front of his eyes.<br>\r\nStill, after a few minutes rest, the two quite bloated celebrities slowly waddled toward the couch where they would spend most of their day. Sitting there, side by side, they began to watch some shows on the TV, as their maids began bringing them some snack every few minutes. Distracted by the shows Brad kept chowing down on all snacks that he received from the maids, chewing noisily on hot dogs and burgers and sloppily drinking soda after soda. Angelina, seated right beside him, wasn\u2019t in a better position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe too was so focused on the TV that she barely registered on how much she was eating, filling her mouth with more and more chocolaty snacks and treats. The maids, from their side, weren\u2019t aware of what was going on but, as they had been ordered to follow the Doctor\u2019s indication they simply did as he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so for most of the morning the married couple kept on guzzling down food and drinks as they kept watching the television until, usually, Brad began to feel sleepy. It was at that moment that Phil, always checking on the two, proceeded to increase the quantities delivered to Angelina which, with more food on her hands, simply began to consume it faster and faster until she simply crumbled, falling asleep right beside her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the two stuffed love birds napping for almost an hour, Phil began to organize for their next main meal of the day. Lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the hour had passed, the maid went and began to wake up the two bloated celebrities, urging them to rise from the couch and, almost, pushing them to the dining room were their first lunch awaited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Brad and Angelina, even though were still feeling somewhat full, couldn\u2019t deny that they were growing addicted to the constant gorging and so, without too much of a fight, both began to eat once more. If they hadn\u2019t been so focused on stuffing themselves to the fullest both could have noticed that their dietary regimen, apart from the sheer quantities, were very strange. Brad seemed to be following an all carbs and protein diet, with all of his meals consisting mostly in meats and baked breads. While Angelina was more on a carbs and sugar diet, being given for the most parts sweets and sugary treat and beverages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth celebrities tough, didn\u2019t seem to mind how much they were eating, especially since they were so focused on eating that they didn\u2019t seem to realize how much of it they were pushing down in their gullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment, as the two were enthralled by their full six course meals that Doctor Phil began, as he did every day, to lay an additional insurance to have the two actors steadily growing bigger and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad\u2026\u201d Phil began, whispering softly in the man ear, as he was still focused on eating away at the large one pounder burger in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad\u2026Keep going Brad. Keep eating. <br>\r\nRemember\u2026the more you eat, the more you grow\u2026the bigger you are, the stronger you\u2019ll become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd look at her, Brad\u2026isn\u2019t she beautiful? How could a skinny little thing like you stay with her\u2026unless you grow bigger and stronger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe strong, Brad\u2026be the biggest for her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words, the tone, everything in Phil voice was calculated to impact on Brad subconsciousness, to force him to see the world as Philodendron wanted him to see it. Brad, focused as he was, couldn\u2019t do much but listen to that voice and turn his world around it. Convincing himself that what the voice said was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter working his magic on Brad, Phil moved on Angelina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngie\u2026you\u2019re such a good girl. Aren\u2019t you, Angie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut good girls will eat what they have on their plate. Eat Angie, eat and enjoy. <br>\r\nRemember, food is good. Exercise is bad.<br>\r\nLook at Brad, he\u2019s awesome, isn\u2019t he? But he\u2019s like that because he eats his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEat up, Angie. Remember, eating makes you grow more beautiful\u2026the more you eat the more amazing you become\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as lunch finished, Brad and Angelina collapsed right where they were. Huffing and puffing, both celebrities felt good, due to Phil\u2019s hypnotical suggestions, but as it was becoming a common occurrence, they both couldn\u2019t move an inch. Brad leaned back on his chair, slowly and carefully caressing his overburdened belly. Forced to open up the zip of his sweater shirt he laid there breathing slowly as the literal weight of all the food consumed kept him from moving. Angelina, seated opposite from him, didn\u2019t fare much better. Sure, she was wearing clothes more comfortable, without feeling them grow tight on her belly, but with the compulsion instilled in her by Phil, even though she was feeling full she kept on eating, trying with all of her resolve to lick clean her plates. Eventually though, she stopped and collapsed in a similar pose to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, as they were still full and overstuffed, they rose from their chairs and, helped along by their maids, they moved to their master bedroom, where they passed some time together. At first, they spent that time cuddling together\u2026but as the days passed and their forms began to grow bigger and fuller, the two of them began to spend that time by sleeping and digesting together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as this was the end of the second week, Philodendron wanted more from them... But what could he do with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossibilities were endless\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As weeks passed Phil decided to keep things quiet and let the couple to slowly fill out. And it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Brad and Angelina kept following the dietary advices from Dr. Phil and, without any worries they steadily kept growing as their meals and snacks grew larger as well. It was barely one month passed since Phil entered in their lives and both were already showing some distinctive changes in their figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad noticed how larger his paunch was getting, along with his arms and legs, and yet thanks to the hypnotical guidance from Phil he knew that he was building mass that would have grown into muscles, eventually. Still, he couldn\u2019t refrain, in the privacy of his bathroom, to play a bit with his paunch. Lifting it up and watching it as it jiggled when he let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main room, Angelina was also watching herself at the mirror. <br>\r\nShe was admiring her forms as they grew, in her conditioned eyes, more and more voluptuous, more feminine. She quickly passed her hands from her breasts, feeling as they had grew heavier and bigger, to her potbelly. She knew that once she had abs there, but she also could see how more beautiful she was now, it was way better the way she was growing. Naturally, she couldn\u2019t see how the rest of her body had been growing. Her butt was growing exponentially, along with her thighs, and it was a common occurrence for her to knock things down when she was walking. Her face also had grown rounder, starting to grow more cherubic, her chin softening up as a second chin began to slightly appear under the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as their bedroom door opened, both turned there their attention, eagerly awaiting their next meal. At the doorway one of their maids peeked through the door informing them that their first breakfast was ready. At this news, both Brad and Angelina quickly put on some clothes and walked slowly toward the kitchen, where they were greeted by a table choked full of delicacies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled as he saw that in front of him there was a large plate chocked full of fried eggs with a small mountain of fried pork bacon as a side dish. Using his fork Brad didn\u2019t waste anytime in take large mouthful of the eggs, and having some bacon strips every now and then, completely oblivious to the small rivulets of grease that were flowing down on his chin. Opposite to him Angelina was also going strong, as she had begun cleaning out a plate full of powdered donuts, while also having spoonsful of ice cream from the gallon tub that her maid had left near her. A couple of hours later, as both had cleared out several plates of food, both actors leaned back on their chairs, burping and belching as they tried to make some more room. <br>\r\nRight on time, Phil sat at the table with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Brad, Angelina, how do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Burp!* G-Good\u2026but full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs Brad said\u2026*belch*\u2026It\u2019s so good\u2026though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to hear that. Maybe you didn\u2019t notice it\u2026but in the last month you didn\u2019t argue not even one time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that the married couple perked up, as they both caressed their own growing form with fondness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>And you don\u2019t even realize that by eating all the time you couldn\u2019t argue even if you wanted\u2026</i>\u2019 Though Phil with a smile before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, there is no time to rest. We still have a lot of work to do. For starters we must make sure that both of you are as relaxed as you can be. Then we can focus on some exercises to have the two of you enjoying some activities together.<br>\r\nAnd, final, if everything goes as it should, you will be able to enjoy a trip together that you will remember till your last days\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>A special trip indeed\u2026right into my belly.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, the two actors began to be fed almost every time they could, and from that point onward they kept on being overstuffed constantly. Whenever they were, be the couch or the bathroom, one of their maids was constantly at their side pushing more and more food into their mouths. In less than two weeks Brad began to slightly outgrow his clothes, as he could see his belly began to peek out from under the sweatshirt he was using.  Especially if he was laying down, he could see how dome shaped it was beginning to appear. Yet, he knew in his mind that it was a good thing, that it was meaning he was going to grow big and muscular. Alas, he didn\u2019t notice that, along with his gut, his entire figure was rounding out, although most of the weight was centering on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina instead had been noticing that her clothes seemed to be shrinking, and yet she choose to fault their washer or the people using it, instead of realizing it was due to her consumption rate that she was ballooning up. And she was growing faster and rounder than her husband due to a constant onslaught of sweets and candies, cakes and pies. With a maid constantly at her side feeding her full time she truly seemed to be exploding out of her clothes. Still, both actors had their limits but Phil, and the maids as per orders received, didn\u2019t stop at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaroline\u2026I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m Full! Can\u2019t\u2026keep\u2026going\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was laying on the couch, unable to move due to how full his belly was. His gut was filled out, a huge round balloon that forced him to lay there with his legs spreaded out. Yet, the maid at his side, Caroline, moved closer to him, with one hand massaging the taut stomach, while moving a hot dog toward his, still closed, mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Sir, you know the schedule by now, thirty hot dogs by three PM\u2026we\u2019re going to be late if you don\u2019t open up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad moved slowly his head reaffirming his idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo full\u2026Let me nap\u2026a bit\u2026first\u2026at least\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Sir.\u201d The maid conceded with a smile, as she simply began to massage the taut rounded gut with her free hand as she used the other to place a straw in between the actor lips. Brad, as he fell asleep, kept slowly sucking from the straw, unknowingly going to consume an entire five liters pitcher of weight gain shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, by the pool, Angelina was in a similar situation.<br>\r\nShe was laying on a pool chair, her rounded out body engulfing the chair itself under its mass, her ass cheeks barely contained by it. At her side, with a trolley chocked full of sweets, there was her personal maid Sarah, personally assigned to her by Dr. Phil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Miss, one more slice and we can call it finished with this cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Urp!* Urgh\u2026too much\u2026can\u2019t have anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense\u2026I can feel plenty of room in here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, she grabbed more firmly the slice of cake in her hand and began to forcefully push it between Angelina\u2019s lips. The actress grunted in pain but in the end couldn\u2019t do much but open her mouth and accept the treat, chewing on it slowly until she painfully swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026no\u2026more\u2026\u201d She whimpered, but the maid seemed to be deaf to her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please, Miss. Don\u2019t be such a child\u2026here come some more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Sarah, grabbed another slice of cake from her trolley, this time devil\u2019s food, and pushed it once more against Angelina\u2019s mouth, who couldn\u2019t do nothing else but accepting it once more. This process repeated itself several times, each time the actress stomach grew larger and wider as more food was packed inside it. After some time, Angelina began to stop feeling pain and began to feel some kind of pleasure from being so much under pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A couple of pies later, Sarah felt the tautness in Angelina\u2019s gut and motioned to stop but, felt the hand of the actress on her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Belch!*\u2026Mf\u2026M-More\u2026*Urp!*Give\u2026me\u2026more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid looked at the beached whale in front of her. She didn\u2019t know why both she and her husband had decided to follow such a fattening diet, but it wasn\u2019t her place to discuss it. Returning to the present, she looked down at her mistress and, seeing that she truly wanted more she simply grabbed another piece from a sheet cake and brought it to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Miss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina happily accepted the treat, moaning in pleasure from both the pain and the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilodendron was watching the scene from the camera feed. This was an unexpected result, and yet he wasn\u2019t going to refuse it. He didn\u2019t expect it from Angelina to grow attached to the feeling of being overfull, but he for sure was going to take advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following weeks the gain for both the actors kept increasing steadily, as they slowly got used to the new portions and, as such, they had to be stuffed even more to reach the objective of stretching their stomaches. Angelina especially was growing at an astounding rate, quickly surpassing 250 pounds in less than three months, while Brad was still getting used to be slightly less than that. This increase though had quite the impact on both, as all their daily activities began to be harder to do, even the simplest one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was having trouble dressing himself up, as he could hardly lift his arms over his head and had to request assistance to do that. His wife instead, had way more trouble moving around as she was now constantly waddling around, her fattened body burdening her at her every step. She had to admit she kind of enjoyed how her entire body jiggled at her every movement, her burgeoning breast flesh sacks quivering like jelly, her gut slapping against her thighs. All of this she saw it as a sign that she was still growing more beautiful and so she redoubled her effort to grow even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was finding hard to reach the point of being overfull, but she tried at her best all the same.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is now almost five months since Brad and Angelina decided to follow the treatment suggested by their new marriage counselor, both of them have greatly changed in this time frame. Brad had reached the 300 pounds milestone, having to finally waddle around as his belly have grown so big that it started to overtake his crotch. His choice of clothes for the everyday also changed. Not being able to wear sweat, no matter how big, he\u2019s turned to wear a muumuu\u2019s that let his belly hang free and, without feeling constricted, he\u2019s been able to increase his consumption even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina instead, was growing at breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had crested the 330 pounds and was now hurrying toward the 350. Wearing almost constantly bikini\u2019s she felt wonderfully, even though she had noticed how harder it was to move around the mansion. She had truly ballooned under Phil\u2019s guidance, as her body began to round out more and more. Her breast kept on growing larger, although they weren\u2019t perky anymore, being pushed up only by the bikini top she was wearing. Her belly had grown massively, dividing itself in two large rolls when seated.<br>\r\nHer ass also didn\u2019t stop growing wider, forcing her to move sideways when passing through doorways and, as of late, even through the hallways. The maids kept being around them 24/7, assisting them and feeding them all the time. Yet, Phil knew that something had to give, and he had to move first to avoid all this to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad, Angelina? I\u2019m seeing good progress here but, I still don\u2019t see a good connection between you. For this reason, I want the two of you to spend more time together. From now on, the two of you will be staying in the same room all the time.<br>\r\nDue to some issues, I\u2019ve had to upgrade your bedroom but I\u2019m sure the two of you will love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth actors had been so focused in their food lust that they had barely registered the renovation on going in their own house, but as they were helped to their master bedroom, they could see that it had been completely renovated. Gone was the king-sized bed, replaced by two large mobile beds, each big enough to hold up to their growing sizes for months to come. These beds were the apex of modern technology, having included some screens to comfortably watch TV, an electric motor to lift a portion of the bed, letting the user to actually sit without even moving and, most importantly, including a chute system that would take care of any \u2018trash\u2019 in a complete silent and odorless way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two once actors were placed on these beds, both enjoyed the feeling of comfort and their gains quickly increased as they now had no need to move at all. Between the maids feeding them and the possibility to simply \u2018go\u2019 whenever they needed, they simply stopped moving at all, constantly watching how their forms grew bigger and bigger. It was at this point that Brad, after months, began to closely watch at Angelina in a different way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterall, even with his conditioned mind, he soon realized that his wife had grown massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, something inside of him seemed to be telling him that he had to love it but, after a while, as he kept staring at her gorging and growing form, he felt himself grow tired of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Look at her\u2026How have I not noticed it before? <br>\r\nShe\u2019s growing to be such a pig. She\u2019s so grossly huge!<br>\r\nI wonder if she could stand on her own\u2026But I don\u2019t think she can\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrad, being constantly beside Angelina had finally noticed how big she was getting but, he failed to notice that he was in the same situation. Still, As Phil noticed this situation to rise, he decided to take action to keep the two growing as big as they could. Quickly he checked within his records and found, within the maids, the girl he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, as the two actors had just finished their third breakfast, one of the maids moved closer to Brad as the actor was looking disgusted at Angelina starting on her fourth breakfast. The maid, Christie, placed her hand on Brad\u2019s thigh beginning to caress it gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actor, even though was eating again, turned toward the girl with an intrigued stare, just as she moved closer and began whispering in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a shame that a wonderful man such as you have to be with a slob like her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cR-Really*urp*?...I-I\u2026I mean\u2026you\u2019re..right\u2026I\u2026deserve\u2026.*gulp*\u2026so\u2026much\u2026better\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could give it to you, Sir\u2026You\u2019re so handsome\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christie kept whispering, so her hand began to massage more seductively his lower belly, just above his nether regions. Brad began to eat faster, as he felt more aroused than he had felt in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a handsome man\u2026If only you could eat more\u2026You could be the hottest hunk\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christie began whispering more and more encouragements, so Brad kept on trying to eat faster and faster, falling line hook and sinker to the sweet words of the young and attractive maid, trying all he could to get to grow bigger for her. All thoughts of his wife beside him washed away by a desire for a younger woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad began to focus on the maid, Angelina seemed to remain in the dark about her husband desire. She simply ate more and more, trying harder to become what she thought was the epitome of beauty. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Angelina, following the advices of Dr. Phil had been focusing solely on growing more beautiful and voluptuous for her husband Brad. As she did so she realized how good it felt to feel painfully overstuffed, and yet the main reason for her to grow this voluptuous was still solely for her husband sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as of lately, she seemed to notice that Brad appeared as if he was getting away from her, as if he wasn\u2019t interested anymore in her. Since they had a communication problem, as Dr. Phil said, she never faced him about the issue, but simply poured her thoughts to the good doctor that was following them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Phil didn\u2019t seem worried at all, and only with that, Angelina felt herself less worried. If the doctor wasn\u2019t worried, things weren\u2019t as bad as she thought, didn\u2019t they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the good doctor instructed Angelina on how to proceed to get back the attention from her husband, in the specific he told her that she had to grow more beautiful for him, she had to renounce to her youthful figure only to assume a curvier one to entice Brad into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man, not a boy, Angelina. As a man he will be more receptive to a woman with real curves, and not to your current slim figure. You don\u2019t have to be a stick thin model anymore Angie, if you want to get Brad to notice you, you\u2019ll have to grow some curves\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Phil said that, Angelina was still on her bed, which had been moved from the room she shared with Brad, to a more private room where Philodendron could interact alone with the actress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Angelina couldn\u2019t realize was that the figure to which Phil was referring to, she had already lost it weeks ago. In that exact moment, for example, as Angelina listened intently to her doctor advice, she was still being fed by her personal maid. And she really had the body to prove it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was now racing through pounds, shooting past the 350 and almost reaching the big 400 pounds. The bed on which she lay, it seemed to be getting smaller as days passed, as Angelina\u2019s whole body grew larger and wider. Her ass had seemed to grow the most, no thong or panties could hope to keep it in, and as more calories were pushed inside her the more it kept growing. Similar situation was for the rest of her body, her billowy gut kept rising and was starting to obscure her most private areas. Her breast also grew larger and meatier, sure they lost their perkiness, but they increased in sheer size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face also grew chunkier as time passed, another chin appeared under the first two, and overall her entire visage seemed rounder and rounder as time passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, the actress couldn\u2019t see the truth for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her eyes she was simply growing slightly curvier, and apparently not enough for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026doc\u2026So\u2026gotta\u2026grow\u2026more\u2026womanly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Angie. For this reason, I\u2019ll ask Sarah to double the portion of your meals and to triple the quantities of your snacks. You\u2019ll see\u2026 a few weeks this way and you\u2019ll be your husband dream come true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the actress barely had time to sleep, devoting instead all the time she could to eat more than she ever had, with the constant influx of food from both her own desire and the forcefulness of her maid, her growth began to show results right from the start. Angelina\u2019s weight began to skyrocket, if before she was gaining a good five pound per day, under the new regimen she began to put on eight to twelve a day. <br>\r\nAnd yet she tried as best as she could to go over her limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer figure literally ballooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than two weeks, her fattened body began to overtake the bed on which she was staying, as her fat thighs and ass-cheeks began to overflow it. And still she soldiered on, focusing solely on the food, she began to lose sight of her surroundings. It started to happen, again and again, that she focused so much on eating that she simply forgot of everything and everyone surrounding her. In her quest to reach the ideal figure for her husband, Angelina quickly transformed herself in an unstoppable eating machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Philodendron noticed just how quickly the actress was ballooning, in short less than a month, although Brad had grown pretty massive too, reaching the 350 pounds thanks to the whispers coming from what he thought was going to be his lover, Angelina reached the 450 pounds, growing a vast hundred pounds heavier than her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilodendron couldn\u2019t refrain himself, as he often began inspecting the growing couple, to touch more and more personally the growing form of the once lithe actress, caressing her every roll of fat, or simply by feeling her gut rising and falling as she breathed slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Soon\u2026Soon you\u2019ll be ready Angelina. Sooner than expected you\u2019ll be able to go on the last trip of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to wait for the both of you to reach the quarter ton of weight but, as fast as you\u2019re growing you may be a little too big to handle\u2026or maybe I could wait and see when you\u2019re going to plateau?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As time went on, Brad focused more and more his attentions on the lovely maid who came to stand beside him almost every waking moment. Due to her, he kept growing fatter and fatter at breakneck speed. He was still dwarfed by his wife but, as he kept eating to try to find satisfaction from Christie\u2019s compliments, he really began outgrowing himself. And yet, as he kept staring lustfully to Christie, he had to notice how small she seemed compared to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days passed, he noticed the vast difference in size between his wife Angelina (who was growing as big as a zeppelin in his eyes), himself (as he thought of himself as normal sized) and Christie, who seemed to be growing smaller and smaller. In those days, Brad began thinking about this matter. It was no easy task since, with the constant feeding and huge onslaught of food, he rarely had to think about anything except eating more but, powering it through, he realized what had to be the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was normal sized, and his wife was way too big, it had to be that Christie was changing from fit to malnourished. Since he was beginning to love her presence around him, Brad decided that something had to be done. Naturally, he had to bring in the good doctor Phil but, he wanted to keep his affair secret (although he didn\u2019t know it was all a scam prepared by the same Doctor).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this reason, as soon as the Phil came into their room, Brad stopped eating and signaled the doctor he wanted to talk. Phil had already a hunch on what was going to happen, he had seen the results of the cameras feed and had been informed by Christie about the latest behavior of Brad. Still he requested a couple of maids to move Brad\u2019s wheeled bed to a different room so they could have a chat in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were alone, Phil sat nearby Brad, as he once more marveled at the sheer size the once actor had reached in those few months. The ex-actor had grown massive, although most of his weigh ended in the huge boulder belly he sported, the rest of him still had puffed up. As if a case study, Phil noticed how large Brad\u2019s hand had become, the fingers do puffy he barely could move them or flex them anymore. The rest of him, with so little physical activity had grown more and more jelly like, making him appear similar to an overfilled waterbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Brad, you wanted to tell me something? I know It can\u2019t be a progress update, since I gave you both a full report just the other day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026It is\u2026about\u2026Christie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristie? Uh? Oh, the maid following you? What about her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026so\u2026thin. Could be\u2026she\u2019s\u2026not\u2026eating\u2026enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026Now that you point it out, it may seem so. But I\u2019m following the two of you, her lifestyle is not my business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish\u2026for\u2026her\u2026to\u2026stay\u2026healthy. She\u2019s\u2026loyal\u2026employee\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil could see the strain in Brad, the toll that doing something simple as talking was taking out of him. It was yet another milestone in Phil\u2019s book regarding the growth of his two patients/future meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, Brad wasn\u2019t wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor when both he and his wife were gone, changed into massive food reserve for Philodendron, he would have to find something else to keep him be. Instead, if he could fatten up the servitude and, why not?, even some friends of the couple, he could stock on his favorite food for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Brad, this does you honor. To be worried as you are about your employees, shows how good natured you are. Angelina\u2019s lucky to have you. Anyway, I\u2019ll have a chat with her and try to convince her to follow a diet for a healthier lifestyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026Doc\u2026appreciate\u2026it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, Brad. After all is my job to keep the two of you happy and together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the other maids moved Brad back in the main bedroom, right alongside his wife, Phil called to him Christie, having her seat in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Christie? How\u2019s going with Brad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing all I can to have him keep on eating as much as possible. As long you keep your part of the agreement, I will follow your instructions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that Phil smiled wickedly. He had hired her to woo Brad only because he had found a leverage to keep her lashed to him. And that leverage was none other than Christie\u2019s own family. The poor girl knew that her family, specifically her mother, was having financial issues and so Phil had volunteered to keep her secure at the cost of her help. It wasn\u2019t the nicest of things to do to trick your own employer but, she didn\u2019t have any other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re doing all you can, Christie, but there is something you could actually do to speed up things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it? What more could I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple. From tomorrow, you shall be placed on a similar bed and keep him company from there. As if you were following their same diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? Are you crazy? I won\u2019t be fattened up like them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil smiled sinisterly as he looked at the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, I won\u2019t have you fatten up. Second, you don\u2019t really have a choice, do you? Or you\u2019re ready to maintain your mother as well as your brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Especially\u2026</i>\u2019 The doctor thought with a wicked grin \u2018<i>Since I had her moved on a twelve thousands calories per day diet, since she was moved in my facility.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026I guess not. B-But you\u2019re not going to make me grow as them, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you already, Christina. We\u2019re only going to pretend. <br>\r\nYou\u2019ll be fed a tasteless sludge which doesn\u2019t contain that many calories. So you\u2019ll just stay there beside Brad, faking yourself to be following an healthier diet and he will return to his usual addiction.<br>\r\nTrust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, Brad noticed with glee that a new bed was placed beside his own, and on this one was laying his latest crush, Christie. As he saw her lay there, drinking away from a hose placed on her mouth he could easily deduce that the good Doctor had managed to convince her to follow the healthy diet he was following. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling for his success, Brad, began eating faster and faster at whatever his maids were feeding him. Soon, Christie would become perfect sized again and he could finally make love to her without any fear of hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, as soon as the sludge entered Christie\u2019s mouth, she realized something for the briefest moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a single fraction of an instant, she realized that whatever was being forced in her mouth through the hose, was tasting divine. And that was worrisome, for the Doctor had said that it should have been tasteless instead. But, as more and more of that sludge was pushed between her lips, Christie soon lost interest in anything else, focusing only on the delicious stuff she was slurping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilodendron looked pleased as he surveyed the master bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there was Angelina Jolie, pushing near the 600 pounds, growing so largely pear shaped that her lower half had begun overtaking the bed. Then, next to her, there was Brad. He was now almost always trying to catch a look from Christie, as he was now reaching the 500 pounds and forcing himself to grow more for her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, beside him, Christie herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil had promised her it was all going to be fake\u2026But he had simply lied to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to grow just as big, if not bigger, now that she was being getting addicted to the weight gain chemical he had also used on the couple. And so, the good Doctor now had three soon-to-be-meals to feed and prepare for the final moments. Angelina was obviously going to be the first one to go\u2026but before that he needed the two of them alive since\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet, he only needed their confirmation so that he could start using their money to create his paradise. Entering the room, he was glad to see that everything was still under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina had slowed on her growth, with almost 650 pounds on her frame it was becoming obvious that solid food wasn\u2019t enough for her growth anymore. Even though she was fed every waking moment, be it willingly or forcing her, she still wasn\u2019t growing as fast as before. No matter that four maids were following her throughout the day, pushing more and more sweets, from wedding cakes to donuts, into her mouth, she still didn\u2019t seem to grow any larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, she was a sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge form had to be moved on a new wheeled bed, since the old one couldn\u2019t keep her on any longer, and yet, due to her pear-shaped form, also the most recent one was having trouble to contain her. As usual, even though her breast had grown massive and her gut had grown gigantically, her butt was her biggest feature. So big and large that she was forced to lay on her stomach, it appeared as a veritable mountain of jelly like flesh, as it jiggled and wobbled at her every breath. Still, since he hadn\u2019t decided yet if she was ready to become a meal, Phil hadn\u2019t changed her feeding schedule and so she seemed to have reached her plateau. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad instead was still growing on. <br>\r\nSure, he was smaller than his wife, still at a mere 520 pounds, but thanks to Christie flirts, he was speeding up a bit, adding more and more rolls on his already fattened up frame. As his wife he also had assumed a specific shape. Contrary to her he seemed to have been focusing his weigh in his gut, which had grown grotesquely huge, covering all his lower body up to his feet. It rarely was empty, as his feeding was also constant, and so it kept rising higher and higher toward the ceiling as a domed semi-sphere. The rest of his body didn\u2019t fare too much differently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had still some mobility in his barrel like arms, but he was finding it harder and harder to move them as each day passed on. At his side, two maids were keeping him always stuffed to the brim, letting him rest a bit and then forcing him to eat more as soon as some more space freed in his growing gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie was growing too, at a slower pace than her two room companions, but still growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the most recent but also, the one most affected by Dr. Phil\u2019s diet as she was, in truth, an experiment. True, Brad had requested her to be \u2018healthier\u2019 but the good doctor saw it also as an opportunity to test the effectiveness of an all liquid diet. The sludge she was constantly feeding off was nothing more than a glorified weight gain shake overloaded with chemicals to result addicting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she truly couldn\u2019t stop herself from having it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her thoughts about her figure, her worries, even her precious family had been washed away by the heavenly tasty shake she was being fed with. She ballooned from a scars 140 scrawny little thing to the 200 plus chubby gal she was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Phil could see how addicted she was to the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the days where he would reduce her feeding, to slow her down, instead of gulping down shake she had started to try to suck it from the hose. Trying her hardest to have as much as she could, and even more beyond that. But, Phil knew that she couldn\u2019t grow too big or Brad would probably lose interest, so he kept alternating her full on days, with days were he was giving her a smaller quantity so he could have her on a good track for the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, Brad, Angelina. Just came for the usual checkup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina grunted a few times as her maids forced in between her lips slice after slice of cake, she tried to raise her arm to greet the doctor but found herself unable to. This lately had left her quite bewildered but, with so much food surrounding her, her focus didn\u2019t last long on trivial matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad instead slowly managed to raise his arm closing his ham-sized fist in a thumbs up sign, but also him soon found himself tired from that single exercise and gave it up as he opened his mouth to accept more hot dogs and burgers. Christie, instead, overdosed with the weight gain stimulant was blind to anything but food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Brad, Angelina. The diet is proving successful and the treatment will continue, but both of you have done huge progress and I\u2019m confident that at year\u2019s end, your marriage can be considered saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there are many that can\u2019t afford, or don\u2019t know ho to ask for help. For them I was thinking to offer some assistance but, I can\u2019t do it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you say to help me in this endeavor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina, as the feeding stopped at Phil\u2019s command, burped quite loudly and, after gasping for a while she replied in a deep voice, through ragged for she was starting to have problems to do even the simplest of things at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Y\u2026Ye-he-rsh...\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrad instead seemed to think long and hard on it, keeping a scrunched-up face as he downed burger after burger, chewing them hard in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Burp!*\u2026urff\u2026Alright\u2026seems\u2026ok\u2026also\u2026for\u2026me. <br>\r\nYou did\u2026a good\u2026job\u2026with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! I\u2019ll start right away with the preparations. But this doesn\u2019t mean I will stop with the two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phil said so, he motioned for the maids to start anew with the feeding and, although Angelina seemed to want to add something else, she quickly found herself unable to talk as her constant feeding started anew. Philodendron had received their agreements and, most important, had it recorded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he could start to build his paradise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanks to the funds stored in his two new human banks (Brad and Angelina\u2019s bank accounts) he had started the renovations on the mansion so that he could better host many new guests. But, as it always happens, something seemed to put a stop to his grandiose dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently checking the camera feeds, after moving Brand and Angelina, along with Christie, in a more secluded section of the mansion he noticed that the bank accounts of the two actors had been suspended. At first, he thought that there had been a mistake. Between the two of them there had to be enough money to purchase a small nation but, as he checked more in detail he saw a suspension notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Miss Jolie,<br>\r\nAs our client we are terribly sorry to inform you that we\u2019ve had to place your accounts under suspension. As per our security checks it is possible that your bank accounts, and funds, may have been hacked and used for an enterprise for which you weren\u2019t informed. Due to this we\u2019re sending one of our agents to personally contact you since, it has been impossible from our side to contact you by any other means.<br>\r\nHoping that this issue is only a simple misunderstanding,<br>\r\nSincerely yours,<br>\r\n\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil stopped reading, as he began to think on what the easiest solution to this issue could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor obvious reason he couldn\u2019t let this lawyer to see the two over-grown actors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would simply get him arrested and tried to save the two from the path of gluttony upon which he had placed them. But there wasn\u2019t also the time to let the lawyer grow slowly how it had been for Angelina &amp; Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a long day of planning, Phil had a half idea on how to deal with this lawyer person. He had only to hope that the person coming wasn\u2019t going to be one of those paranoids who saw troubles and dangers everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, as Phil hastily finished his preparation against the lawyer representative, the doorbell of the mansion sounded and one of the maids informed him that a lawyer was requesting to enter and be shown the owners of the mansion. Phil let out a sigh, clearing his voice from any trembling and went to meet the person. As he entered the salon in which the lawyer was waiting Phil noticed that it was a young man, barely thirty, and was nervously fidgeting around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling the good doctor moved forward, greeting him with gentleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. You must be the Representative from Fitzgerald and Co., isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy turned and politely, albeit nervously, smiled to the doctor shaking his hand and then sitting opposite to him as he began the speech he had prepared for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. Yes. I\u2019m Jacob Vanderbird and I\u2019ve been sent by the firm to verify the situation here for two of our best clients, Miss Jolie and Mister Pitt. There have been plenty of expenses in the last week alone and our firm had decided to investigate. <br>\r\nEspecially since most of these expenses have been done in the name of a Philodendron Sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be me. I see your worries but I can assure you that there is nothing illegal going on.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI\u2019ve been employed by Miss Jolie to help her and her husband to keep a solid relationship with each other, something tha was crumbling down before my intervention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expenses have all been agreed first with them, as it is proved by the receipts that my accountant has in ours archive. I will gladly send copy of those to your firm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that solve most of our worries but, we still would like to meet our clients.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, that is a request to that I can\u2019t satisfy as easily. You see both Miss Jolie and Mr. Pitt are currently undergoing long meditation session and cannot be disturbed for any reasons. Through these sessions the feelings they have for each other will be made stronger and so it is essential for them to keep all external influences away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your point. But, we will not unfreeze their capitals until they have been met us. So, you could say, we\u2019re in an impasse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHm. Mister Vanderbird, I think this matter shall be discussed further. Would you join me for a cup of tea? I understand your position, but I wouldn\u2019t work for them if I let anyone through, disturbing them each and every time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly. And I\u2019m sure you will make an exception for me as soon as we discuss it further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following two hours Phil and Jacob discussed about the situation, but, as time passed, Jacob began to feel somewhat strange. He didn\u2019t feel ill, but it was as if he was getting more relaxed. Way too relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u2026I\u2026I feel warm, all of a sudden\u2026Uh? You\u2026You were saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your point and I would gladly agree but my employers do not wish to be disturbed. Now, If you were <b>easy</b> enough and <b>calm</b> enough we could talk about it in a <b>gentle</b> manner and reach finally a conclusion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil spoke clearly and willingly slow on certain words, knowing full well that the tea he had given to the lawyer was beginning to have its effects. It was a brew he had found to be used in the Amazonian jungles, one that those with his dietary preferences used to let someone willingly agree with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it was needed were certain sounds and a certain emphasis on some words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I</b>\u2019m sure we can all <b>agree</b> that if my employer wanted to be disturbed, then <b>Miss Jolie</b> would personally tell you that she <b>is</b> willing to meet you. As she\u2019s <b>healthy</b> of mind and body enough to let you know that.<br>\r\nAlas, there is <b>no</b> way that she will talk with you as she\u2019s still in her meditation chamber. I\u2019m afraid that you shall <b>need to</b> inform your superior about this situation. As we stand there\u2019s really no point in letting this argument to <b>continue</b>.<br>\r\n<b>What do you answer me, Jacob?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I thought\u2026But\u2026She said\u2026I mean, she is healthy so\u2026I don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil smiled wickedly as if he could see the memories of the guy change thanks to the hypnotic effect of the tea he had drank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much to it, just a few word here and there. Or, as in this case, he had just calmed him down at first with his \u2018<b>easy; calm; gentle</b>\u2019 and then he had simply began laying the trap emphasizing certain word until they formed a directive for Jacob to follow : \u2018<b>I agree, Miss Jolie is healthy, no need to continue.</b>\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now primed and ready to receive orders and memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Tell me, Jacob. Do you agree?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. She\u2019s as healthy as I could find her. She\u2019s just so busy. We won\u2019t berate her further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Good. Also, Jacob, do you have any family?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019ve got a girlfriend. Our parents are in another state\u2026we rarely see each other nowadays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Good. Listen to me, wait a few weeks and the leave that job. <br>\r\nBring your girlfriend here. You both will live like royalty. You both deserve it.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I will. Yeah. We deserve to live a little. A vacation would do us good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Yes it will, Jacob. Now, return to your bosses. Remember, everything is\u2026?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is clear. Both Miss Jolie and Mr. Pitt are alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2026uh? What just happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob Vanderbird felt as if he had just woken up from the quickest nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was feeling some dizziness but, it was already passing so everything had to be ok. Still, he had closed an important job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how long that doctor had tried to prevent him, he still had managed to meet his clients and got their confirmation that everything was in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he felt a little bit embarrassed when they scolded him for the disturbance but, he still felt that he had done his job perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil\u2019s voice shook him from his reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright there, Mr. Vanderbird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Oh yeah. Just a bit dizzy. Thanks a lot Mr. Sweet. Now that I\u2019ve been able to talk with them and assure myself that everything is in order there is no need for further disturbances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, sorry if I ask but, do you still work as a counselor for couples or are you working exclusively for them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think I could spare some time for some advices\u2026 I\u2019ll talk with Miss Jolie and, in case she agrees, will let my secretary to call you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lawyer went away Phil grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time he used that brew of tea but, it was the first time he had done it to purposely trick someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he needed to do, now, was to call some friends over so that when Jacob would be back with his girlfriend there would be someone able to follow them in their life style change\u2019\u2026 Or could it be better to keep things under the radar for a bit longer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices, choices\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost a month had passed leaving Dr. Phil enough time to finish the renovations needed to the mansion, to change it into the headquarters of what he saw as his very own secret society. His two personal piggy-banks, Miss Jolie and Mister Pitt, had almost reached their maximum potential. Both had seemingly reached their plateau and were barely able to gain a single pound more every few days. Still, Philodendron knew he couldn\u2019t just take them out of the picture. He still needed their money and with them alive it was going to be easier for him to work from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even though he had moved both to an underground cell-like room, he went often to see them, to check on them. They both were glorious in their hugeness.<br>\r\nAngelina, seemed to have transformed herself in a jiggly mountain, her ass jutted out behind her, almost reaching her shoulder level in height, as it trembled with her every movement, or breath, just like a jelly dessert. Her breasts had grown humongous, falling each on her side, so big and blubbery that one person alone would have problems trying to lift it on his own. Then, there was her belly. A globular cascade of fatty belly rolls, it covered her entire front, leaving only the point of her feet visible. Phil loved to see her manic expression as she was now fed non-stop, twenty-four hours each day, using a feeding tube. The constant gorging and the pleasure she gained from feeling stuffed had reduced the once actress to a beast with simplistic desires. She was a slave to her hedonism and her gluttony. There wasn\u2019t, anymore, any other reason for her to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad instead had to be moved to rest on his belly. Since all his gains seemed to go majorly there, Phil had seen the risk of him getting crushed by his own weight, so when he was relocated, they also changed his posture. Brad Pitt too, had reduced himself, mentally, to some sort of animal.  He also followed his basic instinct, which could be described as \u201cthe need to feed\u201d and \u201cthe need to see others grow\u201d.<br>\r\nSince he had started to have emotions for the young maid who had only meant to trick him, Phil was happy enough to provide him with enough women to be watched as they inflated with food. Young Christie, unfortunately, had to be removed from the mansion. Brad, even in his own animal mentality, seemed to disregard those creatures that appeared to be larger than him and, since Christie had ended up way bigger than him, he quickly discarded her, focusing his needs on a different gal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilodendron moved closer to the huge pile of flab that Brad had become, forced to lay down on his stomach had rendered his arms and legs useless piles of flab. The actor was now so big he couldn\u2019t move, even if he could manage to reach the ground. His middle was just so big that he literally was lifted from the floor, having his limbs flaying in the air by a couple of feet, if not more.<br>\r\nChristie, in the end, had to be moved away. She was currently staying in the same structure that was hosting her mother and Phil had deemed the two of them to be  ready for their next transition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming a staple for his people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, his people were going to collect the first bounties he had spent so much time to prepare. And it would be awesome but, he had no time to celebrate. More pressing was the situation of Mr. Vanderbilt.<br>\r\nThe lawyer, now ex-lawyer, had finally released himself from the contract and was going to come to the mansion to follow a healthy vacation there. Phil had a great opportunity right here in front of him. Through Vanderbilt list of contacts, he could easily have access to any major influence in the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could barely contain himself as he thought of his next victim to be added into his collection. Would it be a singer? Or another actor? How fun could it be to turn an athlete in a morbidly obese blob? And why not target politicians? They could exponentially increase his web of contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, focusing on the present, he had to prepare everything for his new guest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, after having been informed by Jacob that both he and his girl were coming, Phil began to prepare the trap for them. Just like a spider he perfected his web, hiring additional security to keep out any unwanted visitor, removing any personnel from the mansion which he couldn\u2019t trust and replacing them with trusted people from his own structure. With the house stocked full of both food and feeders, he was just waiting for the new victims to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jacob Vanderbilt arrived at the mansion, he was surprised at first. The place was bristling with security guards, and yet, they were courteous and gentle in letting him pass, as they had been informed of his arrival. As he walked through the garden, followed by his girlfriend, she still seemed suspicious of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob, are you sure about this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Sara, we already talked about this. Dr. Sweet has a clean slate on his file, excellent references and wonderful reviews. We need a vacation and what place could be better than L.A.? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink about it, a whole three months\u2019 vacation, being pampered and followed through by a dietician, living in one of the most fabulous mansions in Beverly Hills. What more could we want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara Manning was a simple girl, she had grown in a small little town in Minnesota but, thanks to a lucky roll, she had managed to find her future there in Los Angeles, where she then met Jacob. Their relationship had started slowly, as they started out as friends, until both seemed to grow attached, and attracted, by each other. She was a stout country girl, a busty, a bit more on the husky side, cowgirl with freckles on the bridge of her nose and curly red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her \u2018humble\u2019 origins she wasn\u2019t used to the places where Jacob usually hanged out, being a bit too snobby for her tastes, and yet, for him, she did all she could to try and fit in. Similar situation was with the current place. She felt out of the picture there, as if she didn\u2019t belong there, but she still supported her man and tried to play it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could want to stay alone with my guy, even if only for two weeks\u2026but, I suppose you\u2019re right. <br>\r\nCome on, then, let\u2019s get inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they passed the entrance, they found Dr. Sweet waiting for them, welcoming them with open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Vanderbilt! So good to see you again. And this lovely lady has to be your fianc\u00e9e, I presume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara blushed a bit, as Jacob simply laughed while hugging her from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe sure is, Dr. Sweet. Sara Manning, this is Dr. Phil Sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure to meet you, Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil smiled as he shown to their new guest the layout of the house, while replying to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, was my father\u2026just call me Phil. Now, follow me, I\u2019ll show you both where you\u2019re going to stay, and we will talk about your vacation here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phil showed them the layout of the place, they also met most of the key figures of the household, although Jacob was surprised in seeing o many new faces around the place. As he tried to inquire about it, the doctor simply answered that it had been a shame, but he had to replace all the previous staff. There had been some issues with how the old staff perceived their living there and so, Phil had been forced to hire personnel he could trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to both Jacob and Sara, as they greeted each key figure, they had been evaluated by them as all the workforce in the mansion was either a feeder or a cannibal, as Phil was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, both Jacob and Sara looked marveled at the massive mansion in which they were going to live, there was almost everything one could wish for. There was a private gym and pool, a secured garden, a vast library and even a small, private theater. Both were ecstatic but the biggest surprise for them arrived just during dinner. As they were enjoying a truly delicious dinner, with each plate brought to them masterfully prepared, Philodendron began to lay down his plan for the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob, I was thinking. Since you both will be spending a so needed vacation here, why don\u2019t you follow one of my courses in the duration of this break?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUff...Gotta give my compliments to your chef, Dr. Phil. Dinner was amazing. <br>\r\nBut, what do you mean with, one of your courses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jacob and Sara had eaten way more than their usual fare, both were feeling stuffed to the gills and yet, everything had been so good that they weren\u2019t feeling any remorse on overindulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Jacob. When we met, I\u2019ve told you that a vacation was good and all to refresh the spirit of a couple but, in truth, since my job here for Miss Jolie and Mister Pitt is almost finished, and they agreed to devolve this mansion to be like a shelter for those who have problems in dealing with issues with living together, I thought I could offer to both of you my services, completely free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see clearly see that, you guys, don\u2019t have any trouble living together but, I\u2019m sure that following one of my courses could only strengthen your relationship together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Sara took the evening to discuss the proposal within themselves but, even though they hadn\u2019t had a strong fight with each other in a long time, in the end they both accepted the offer, just to see what was so special about this regimen that the good doctor was offering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey couldn\u2019t know that by taking that decision, their whole lives would change forever\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the first couple of weeks, both of them tried to keep themselves busy, walking around, doing yoga together, exercising in the private gym and following the \u2018relaxation method\u2019 proposed by Dr. Sweet. But, as time passed, they started to get a bit lazier in their routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more changes to their schedules were coming, and it all started one evening when Jacob was sitting on the porch, enjoying the fresh evening air. As he sat there, Dr. Phil emerged from within the house and sat with him, offering an after dinner cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust to help you relax the most while sleeping tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacob began drinking the tea, though, he began to feel rather buoyant, and yet as Phil kept talking to him, he seemed to grow rather attached to some particular phrases from the guy. Drinking more and more of that wonderful brew of tea, Jacob began to relax even more, growing more detached from the discussion, and yet, strange thoughts began to stick to his minds, as if he had thought of them on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man, Phil really is a good guy. I can really trust him as if he was a brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love this place\u2026maybe should extend the vacation here\u2026it could do a lot of good for me and Sara, to stay here a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it\u2019s true that me and Sara have a few problems lately. <br>\r\nI\u2026I can\u2019t manage to arouse myself around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still love her but\u2026there is something missing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, Phil can help us on this... </i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay after day, Phil kept his evening conversation with Jacob happening, while giving to the guy that special kind of tea that Jacob was starting to love. The poor guy couldn\u2019t know that he was in the middle of a trap, carefully laid down by the doctor. The tea he was using was the very same, in fact, that Philodendron had already used on him when they first met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs days passed, Sara noticed that Jacob seemed a bit different and, one evening, after an especially large dinner, she called him to join her in bed, wanting to verify a thing or two with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob? Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh? Oh, yeah\u2026yeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m used to seeing you much firmer on certain things\u2026is there something that worries you? You do know you can tell me anything, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob, his mind swirling with those new thoughts in his mind, turned his stare onto his girlfriend, noticing, as if it was the first time how skinny she was. It was as if a curtain was lifted from his eyes. He knew now, what the issue was but, how could he broach the subject to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah\u2026there is something, actually\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what is it? Is it something that Phil said?... It\u2019s about us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026no, no\u2026don\u2019t worry dear. It is nothing\u2026really. Just a bit worried for the new job\u2026you know how I am. I always worry about the littlest things\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Sara noticed that, even though she was caressing him and massaging him as she often did when she wanted some cuddles with him, he didn\u2019t seem to react. Choosing instead to go directly to sleep, leaving her confused. As she tried to understand what had happened, she decided to go ask to Dr. Phil the following morning, asking for advices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning came, Sara noticed right away that Jacob had already left the room. She felt sad that he hadn't woke her up or greeted her, and her decision to speak with the doctor was stronger than ever. So, after a good sized breakfast she wandered around the mansion, until she found him sitting in a studio, working on some papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Good morning\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t want to disturb so, maybe I\u2019ll come later\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm? Oh, no. Please, come inside. I was just checking some notes on the shelter, but I can get back to it later. Is there something troubling you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, entering the room and seating in front of the desk, felt herself completely opening up as she felt strangely safe in talking of her doubts and fears to the good doctor, after all he was a professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually yes. I\u2019ve been noticing that lately Jacob seems\u2026rather distant. Or at least, he does it with me. I\u2026I can\u2019t seem to talk with him anymore. It\u2019s as if he has become a different person. I\u2026I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026I want to be sincere with you, Sara.<br>\r\nJacob has come to me yesterday, saying thing much similar to yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2026He did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. And, I wanted to speak with you, first, before calling both of you together. You see, as we talked he told me a bit of your relationship together and I\u2019ve noticed, as he talked that he was growing rather excited on a certain part and then, that excitement, that passion seemed to vanish as he recollected another period together with you.<br>\r\nI have a theory in mind, but to be sure I need to have some details from you, if you\u2019re willing to share.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Of course. Ask away, Doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil, seating more comfortably on the chair, began to check a few notes on his table until he began asking Sara about her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob told me that you both met one morning in a bar, when he mistakenly walked into you, splashing you a bit with his coffee, is it correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I was just so clumsy since I had arrived in LA, since barely a week. He was gentle, though, and gave me his phone number so that he could repay for the laundry expenses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom then, slowly at first, you began seeing each other every morning, until it became an \u2018expected routine\u2019 to meet there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. He was so cultured, so gentle\u2026I already was starting to develop a bit of a crush on him, although I didn\u2019t have any hope for making it real, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, a few meeting after work, a few nights passed together at the movie theater and you both started to become friends. From there, slowly, your relationship grew until he asked you to become his girlfriend, during a weekend at your homeplace. Is that correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I was so afraid. I was embarrassed to show him my hometown, I thought he could think I was nothing but a hillbilly. Yet he smiled when he arrived and kept smiling for the entire weekend\u2026and yes, he asked me to make our relationship grow official. I was so happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut despite growing attached, lately he doesn\u2019t seem to be the same, especially since he could spend more time with you but, actually, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong\u2026did I do something? I didn\u2019t do anything out of the ordinary\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here, is the thing. You actually did, something. Let me explain. <br>\r\nWhen you two met at your hometown, you were the same girl you\u2019re today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026Think so? Maybe I was a bit uncouth\u2026a bit more like a country girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSara. There is no need to feel ashamed. He told me about your diets and your training. You changed yourself to become what you thought was his ideal of beauty, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Course I did. I saw how his friends looked at him, when they compared the chubby girl with the young lawyer. I\u2026I didn\u2019t want to shame him in front of his friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet\u2026\u201d Here Phil leaned forward on his desk, moving closer to the blushing girl in front of him. \u201c\u2026He never asked you to do that, did he?<br>\r\nYou see, Sara, one of the things he loved in you was how\u2026rich you were at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only for your mind but also on your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, stood agape, shocked by this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you mean he preferred me\u2026Chubby?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is something that not all mates are capable to share, especially to their partners. Jacob, is conflicted. He doesn\u2019t want you to do something against your wishes and yet, he is not capable of finding you as attractive as you once were. Now, this is something I always say to all my patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guys must talk freely to each other. If you keep secrets, it will only harm your relations in the long term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as you admitted, you dieted and trained only for him, but what do you wish for yourself, Sara? What are your thoughts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I admit that I rather like myself as I am today\u2026but, can\u2019t say that I love dieting and exercising. I often thought of going back to my old figure but I thought that Jacob\u2026would love me more if I wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point she burst out in tears, feeling as if she had been the cause of the degradation of her life with Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now. None of that. There is nothing that can\u2019t be solved with a bit of focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll schedule your meals for this week so to have you gain around five pounds. This way, you can easily check Jacob\u2019s reaction to your new body and will not be such an amount that you couldn\u2019t lose by workout if you find yourself hating how the new you will feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, next week, we can meet again and see how things are going, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara left the room, still a bit shocked by the news but, with new hope thanks to the doctor\u2019s plan, Phil grinned maliciously. He had only to plan on how he wanted Jacob to react to Sara\u2019s progress\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the week started, Sara wasn\u2019t actually sure that the plan proposed to her by Dr. Phil was going to provide any results. Still, seeing as Jacob seemed to grow a bit more distant each day, she knew that she had to do something. Quickly she began to follow the instruction provided by the good doctor, eating quite the large meals, doing some light exercises and trying to pass as much time as she could with Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, she had to admit, she found some difficulties in following the meal plan she had received. The portions weren\u2019t all that big but, seeing as she was unused to them, it took quite the toll on her at first, forcing her to start a nap routine after every main meal during the day. Still, although no changes were exactly visible at first, she tried to spend as much time she could with her boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the beginning of the week, although they were relaxing together, she noticed here and there that he wasn\u2019t really interested in checking her out, especially when she tried to entice him once with a skimpy bikini she had on. <br>\r\n Same situation would arise when they were together in bed, alone in their own room. Sara could see that Jacob was less active than usual, so she redoubled her efforts to match the plan prepared by Dr. Phil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week progressed, though, and as the first couple of pounds already were creating a thin layer of softness on her once perfectly toned belly, she saw that Jacob seemed to show some sparks of interests in her. Noticing this made her aware that the assumption of Dr. Phil had been right on the mark, and yet, she was trying to figure out if she was truly willing to change herself for her lover passion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had to be honest with herself, it was somewhat liberating not to follow her old diet anymore, furthermore, the meal plan that the doctor had prepared for her seemed to be rich in things that she had always adored to eat. So, it seemed to be a win-win situation for Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shadows, Phil was enjoying how na\u00efve Jacob\u2019s girlfriend could be. But, in truth, she couldn\u2019t know that Jacob was acting out as per his instructions, so it was fairly natural for her to react like that. Still, in his eyes, Sara had yet to grow in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>But that will come in time. I will order Jacob to open up the more she grows out, this way little shy sara will turn in just what I need.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil, schemer he was, not only was watching how Sara began the plunge into the abyss of gluttony, but also began relaying more detailed instruction to Jacob, since the guy was more or less uer his thumb now that he had become addicted to the herbal tea that Phil used to control him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instance, for example, both Phil and Jacob were seated in his personal studio, the doctor sat behind his desk while Jacob, busy drinking the tea he loved so much, listened carefully to what his Master, as his subdued subconscious identified Phil, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Jacob, do you understand how you have to act around Sara?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Must act interested if she gains. The more she gains, the more interested I\u2019ll become. Must compliment her figure as well as soon as she reaches 200 lbs. From then, will compliment her figure while hiding any further gain she has.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, Jacob. Very good. Now, remember, you mustn\u2019t fall behind your own schedule. As she reached 200 pounds, you shall start gaining too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Master. I shall do it and I shall find pleasure in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob, pausing here and there as he drank the tea, spoke with an emotionless tone of voice, since it was his subconscious that was doing the talking and not the conscious himself. Still, Philodendron, grinned at the brainwashed guy, providing him a few more detailed instructions before releasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As the week came to an end, Sara noticed that he had actually managed to go over the weight limit she had agreed with the good doctor, gaining almost six pounds. Still, as surprised and shocked as she was, she couldn\u2019t deny that Jacob had been interested in her, even checking her out, although she wasn\u2019t completely sure about that, so the experiment in her eyes had been a glaring success.<br>\r\nThat Sunday, as her fianc\u00e9 was resting ear the poolside, she sneaked away and went to meet the doctor, to discuss how they were going to proceed from there. As she entered into his studio, she found him busy on the phone, but he motioned her to seat and wait for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? Yeah\u2026No problem at all, Miss. I\u2019ll make sure that Miss Jolie will be informed. Thanks, bye\u2026. Sara! Sorry for the wait, was working a bit for Miss Jolie. So, tell me, how did it go with Jacob?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Doc. He\u2019s been much more responsive than before. I\u2026I really must thank you for your suggestion, it worked perfectly but,\u2026I\u2026I think I would like to keep going. I would love to have my Jacob back with me, the guy that loved me and that showed it to me every day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is good to hear and don\u2019t worry. As I said to you last week, this was only an experiment based on what you\u2019d told me before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that we know the issue, we can simply place a long-term solution to fix it. We only have to decide how far we want to bring this solution for. I mean, when the two of you met and decided to make your relationship official, how much would you say you weighted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Sara blushed a bit, but managed to answer truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at the time I was around the 200 pounds\u2026but after seeing how his friends and colleagues I did manage to bring myself to 140 lbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. And now, more or less, you should be around that 140\u2026probably something ore considering the week past. Good, good. All you\u2019ve got to tell me, Sara, is if you want to bring the experiment further or, if you prefer to try by yourself. I understand it may seem shameful to lose the fit body you managed to model yourself but, there would be nothing wrong in letting yourself go a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost important, though, you must feel confident in your choice. Otherwise, it won\u2019t end well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara thought about it for a bit. He was ecstatic about the results gotten in the past week. She hadn\u2019t felt so carefree about her diet in a long time and, with the addition of doing it for her boyfriend, she felt even better. Though, was she sure she would like to return to her past self? She had to admit that before meeting Jacob she had never had any issue with her own size but, now that she had gotten used to be sixty pounds less then before, could she, in all honesty, return to her past weight without any guilt?<br>\r\nAs she pondered, she thought of Jacob accepting her in his arms and smiled a bit, knowing now that she had her answer for the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Phil? Y-yeah\u2026I\u2026I think I would like to keep on going with the experiment. At least until I return to my old weight. I think Jacob would love it and\u2026if he loves it, I will too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! Very well, Sara, I will immediately take in consideration your desire and prepare a revised meal plan to which you will have to follow. You\u2019ll see, in a few months, you\u2019ll be back with Jacob as if nothing had changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, just as Sara was into the kitchen, having a sip of coffee, one of the maids of the mansion left for her a little booklet, prepared the day before by Philodendron, indicating her new and revised meal plan, which was going to start straight from that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drank her coffee, seating herself down at the table, she looked through the pamphlet and felt herself growing strangely excited as she saw the delicacies, she was going to be eating for the next few months. Without her notice, a maid moved closer to her and quickly left a few plates near her, letting her now, suddenly that her breakfast was ready. Jumping a bit in surprise, Sara thanked the maid and looked at what she had brought to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to be a classic english breakfast, as it was a four egg omelet, with a side of sausages, fried tomatoes, mushrooms and fries. On a side plate, she also saw a small-ish slice of vanilla cake, a little less than half of a quart, and one tall glass of milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026didn\u2019t expect so much on my first day\u2026still, I\u2019m doing it for Jacob\u2026and yet, I will probably enjoy it for myself too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to dig in, she saw that Jacob had just entered the kitchen and came to join her at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Sara. Woke up with an appetite, today, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was starting to feel embarrassed for his comment, Jacob continued, while giving her a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s good seeing you eating healthily for once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving said that, she noticed that he sat there, with her, drinking a cup of coffee and having a small croissant for himself, as they chat a bit, she didn\u2019t seem to notice how quickly she was going at her food, gulping it eagerly down, until both plates and the tall glass were empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she swallowed the last morsel she felt full to burst and yet, she could see Jacob eyes riveted on her figure. Smiling a bit, she moved making so that her stuffed stomach was a bit more visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so good, thanks for the company, hon\u2026But I think I\u2019ll have to go a nap a bit of this off\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As days passed, Sara kept eating what the maids or the butlers I the house kept bringing her, at first she made sure to be following the pamphlet that the good doctor had given her but, as time passed, she began to let it be and just eat what they brought to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her pleasure, at her every main meal she was constantly surprised with a new delicacy, so much so that sometimes she even asked for a second plate. Still, as much as she was enjoying the meals, she was still searching for attention from her fianc\u00e9 and, as time passed and a soft layer of fat began to appear on her figure, she noticed that Jacob began to be more and more interested into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with these results, in just a few weeks, she let herself go even more during her meals, enjoying anything they brought to her at the fullest. Still, one day, almost a month since she started to follow the diet, as she was resting at the poolside, working on her tan, she was surprised when a butler moved toward her, while carrying under his arm an empty tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Afternoon, Miss,  I\u2019m Karl. May I bring you anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2026Well, I don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019m following a diet from Doctor Phil\u2026I don\u2019t know if I should\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Miss, I\u2019m sure that a little splurge once in a while won\u2019t hurt any diet you\u2019re on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara thought about that, she had to admit that lately she had started to feel rather hungry in the afternoon, so many hours away from dinner time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why not\u2026what would you suggest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, I know that the chef has just prepared a batch of brownies that looked scrumptious enough and, if I may, I would also bring you a small shake to wash it all down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure, Miss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought of food, Sara\u2019s belly began to gurgle a bit, providing further convincing to the girl the she indeed was in need of a small snack. A few minutes later, as she heard the door facig the pool opening, she saw the butler move her way, carrying the tray now filled with half a dozen brownies and a tall glass of shake. The guy, the left everything near Sara, on a small table, and quickly returned to his duties making sure that the girl knew she could call him for anything if she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, eyeing the treats, began to lick her lips in anticipation. Still laying down near the pool she moved her had and took the first of the brownies, bringing it closer to her mouth. As she bit into it she couldn\u2019t refrain from moaning a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>This thing is Divine! My God!</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she managed to scarf it all down in another two bites, before starting to quickly take each of them, feeling their deliciousness into her mouth, as she cleaned them all from the plate. In a few minutes, she realized he had eaten the all and it was then that she stared hungrily at the shake. As Fast as before, she began slurping down the shake, smiling in pleasure at the wonderful taste of it, and yet, a short time later, she found herself staring into an empty glass. Pouting a bit, she placed it back on the tray, as she caressed a bit her belly, feeling herself sated for the moment and yet, still a bit hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the woman had cleaned the tray, Karl moved closer to take away the tray and, sensing she could clearly have some more, decided to inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas everything good, Miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it was delicious\u2026thanks again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to serve. Would you care for something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026N...A-actually,  yes. Could you do me a favor and bring something a bit more\u2026substantial? The brownies were good and all but, I\u2019m starting to feel like I need something more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Miss. Will be a pleasure. Anything in particular you would wish for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing too sweet, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karl returned into the kitchen he smiled within himself. Slipping an appetite stimulant in her shake had been a brilliant idea, if he could say so himself, but now he was in need for something more, and yet, nothing too sweet.  Carefully looking through the kitchen he saw that one of the chef\u2019s had just taken out of the grill a few hot dogs, and deciding that those were just what she needed, Karl proceeded to take them. As he brought back to Sara the tray with three, rather large, hot dogs drenched in ketchup and mayo, he knew for sure that if he played his cards right, the girl was going to be his in a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go Miss, hope you enjoy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Trust me\u2026I will\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that day, as time passed, Sara found herself enjoying these snacks more and more often, until they became almost part of her regular diet. And as those snacks grew in quantities and in size, also her main meals seemed to be growing larger and longer. Yet, Sara, as she was enjoying too much this new kind of lifestyle, didn\u2019t seem to really notice, also since Jacob was growing more and more fond of her as time passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of this, Sara\u2019s figure was changing rather heavily. As a couple of weeks passed, under the deluge of large snacks and massive meals, not only her appetite grew to new heights,  making so that she required more and more to feel herself satisfied, but also her body began to grow softer and softer as  more calories were ingested and never consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn barely two months, she managed to jump from her toned 145 pounds to a bit more heavy 195 pounds, and yet, as she had now grown accustomed to the portions and to the constant snacking she didn\u2019t seem able to discern that she was already that much closer to her objective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the second month of the new diet just passed, Sara found herself used to a very different lifestyle than before, not that she noticed the difference. She would wake up, finding herself in the loving embrace of Jacob, who would give her a quick morning kiss before letting her go to her breakfast, where she would usually be busy destroying it for the next two hours. Once breakfast had been cleared up, she would enjoy a lovingly napping sessions near the pool, up until almost midday, when the butler Karl would bring her some appetizers which, at first had been a few treats and sweets, but lately were becoming more and more often full sized cheese and bacon burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the appetizer session was over, after consuming in average, from three to five burgers per session, she would then quickly being given a few shakes with the appetite stimulant, so to have her primed and ready for lunch time, where she would keep herself busy until the first hours of the afternoon. It was then, with her belly stuffed dull of food, that Sara would go in her room to a well-deserved nap, together with Jacob who would keep her company as she slept in their bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her two hours resting session, it was yet again snack-time for her, which was quickly brought to her while in bed, loading her up with short cakes and sweets. During this time, she would ask Jacob to assist her since, often enough, she would start feeling tired, although she wasn\u2019t really aware of the reasons behind it. Still, Jacob was eagerly helpful, making sure to have Sara nice and full just an hour before dinner time.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring dinner, she found herself trapped by both her rising gluttony and the pleasure she was starting to associate with the feeling of being stuffed full, letting her go full hog on whatever was prepared for her, usually forcing her to remain seated at the table for hours. When she first started the diet, she had thought that a three-course meal was quite the large meal but, as her stomach got used to bigger and bigger portions, she got used to meals of no less than seven courses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, she would often spend some time with Jacob, cuddling together, up until midnight, when he would bring her a midnight snack made mainly of desserts. With Sara laying in bed, and Jacob busy fondling her quite large belly and feeding her, she would eat up to her bursting point and fall asleep within his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trend kept going for a bit more than two weeks, past the second month of diet plan, before Sara thought about going to meet the good doctor to thank him for his assistance. That fateful morning, as she stood up from the kitchen table, after having eaten enough breakfast food for four persons, she slowly began to waddle toward the studio of the good doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn those two months and a half, as her weight rose higher and higher, along with her body as it got thicker and fatter, both maids and butler did all they could to adjust and repair any clothes that would rip and tear after being subjected to the stress of containing her growing forms. As she waddled through the hallways, she was completely blind to the way her body jiggled to and from at her every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive thighs and puffy arms would jiggle slightly at her every step, as similarly acted her ass cheeks, which would jiggle from side to side as a wobbling jelly-like dessert. But her most impressive features were on her front. Her boobs had grown so laden with fat that were hardly perky anymore, as they started to sag due to all the extra weight in them down. Her gut too, was now nothing more than a billowing out mass of jiggly fat and cellulite, pushing out in front of her of at the very least one foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long, stout neck too had changed heavily, as fat accumulated on her body, so her neck rapidly vanished, replaced by two thick extra chins, as a third one seemed to be starting to appear. Yet, Sara slowly moved onward, until she finally reached the doctor studio and entered, a bit covered in sweat as if she had just returned from a small run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat in the studio, Phil was ecstatic about her progress, and couldn\u2019t wait to see if he was able to keep her going as she was on her own or, if he could find a way to step her game up even more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sara sat in the studio of the good doctor, she found herself breathing a little hard as well as being slightly covered in a little sweat. Taking a napkin from a pocket, she cleaned herself up a bit as she waited for the Doctor to finishing whatever he was doing on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Man, gotta remember not to come here running\u2026must be the heat, I feel myself sweating still\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phil finished what he was doing, he turned toward the woman who had grown a lot in the past two months and something. As he greeted her and chat a bit with her, he stared carefully at her, taking mental notes of how she had grown, and where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Sara, I heard from the staff that Jacob seems pretty much enthusiast of your new you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He\u2019s getting closer and closer, but I still have a lng way to go, haven\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Phil understood immediately where the issue was and did his best to mask his surprise in hearing that question, as he coughed a bit in his hand, taking a bit of time. As soon as he thought to be ready, he addressed again the young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, about that. Have you weighted yourself yet?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 No, actually no. Haven\u2019t thought about that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then. Here, let me help you stand so that we can quickly take a reference of where we stand. If I\u2019m not mistaken you were at 145 when we started with the experiment, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Doc. Although I hope I\u2019ve put on a few since then\u2026I wanted to discuss with you also on this point\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a minute, Sara. Here, stand on top of it\u2026just right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was helped by Phil to stand, she slowly waddled toward the scale on the floor, as she was directed by the doctor until she felt herself standing on it but, as she looked down, she couldn\u2019t really see the scale under her, as it was covered by her still full belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t really see it\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Must remember next time, not to weight myself after breakfast\u2026it bloats me so much I can\u2019t even see the scale\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilodendron kneeled beside the growing girl, making sure she couldn\u2019t see the malicious grin on his face as he thought about her unable to see the scale under herself, and then proceeded to take some fake measures, as he began touching both her legs and her middle, just to enjoy her softness. As he pretended to measure her he quickly glanced at the scale and almost whistled in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Wow\u2026197 pounds! She\u2019s really going at it\u2026can\u2019t tell her this though\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty normal, Sara. Wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. You just had breakfast, right? It must simply be the bloating. Here\u2026let\u2019s see\u2026 Uhm. Well, I must confess, Sara, I was expecting a bit more\u2026you\u2019re still at 165.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I expected that, if I can be sincere\u2026that\u2019s what I wanted to talk about, Doc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Sara?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026as of late I\u2019ve noticed that the portions I receive at meal-times are always so small\u2026no wonder I haven\u2019t put on enough weight. Would it be possible to have some more \u2018normal sized\u2019 portions from now on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil, still kneeled, was on the verge of burst out laughing as he managed to resist it. He had met people who were na\u00efve and blind for their surrounding but, hearing that phrase from someone who was so blatantly fat to not being able to see their own feet was too rich. Still, he managed to resist, as he calmed himself down, while racking his brain down for a good answer to give back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that there must have been some incomprehension with the staff. I assure you that the diet was prepared to consider a slight increase in the portions as months passed away. Still, I\u2019ll check directly with our chefs to make sure that the\u2026right sized portions will be brought to you, Sara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he helped her sit down again, he silently offered her a few candies he had on his desk, noticing with glee how quickly she took him up on the offer, as she began gulping them down quite rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Sara, I believe we shall just continue with the diet, as I make sure that the kitchen staff will update your meals as per the diet plan, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Doc. Really, thank you very much. Without your support I would still be having problems with Jacob, while now that we\u2019re getting closer I think we shall do much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Sara, quickly saluted the good doctor and began once more her slow waddle toward the kitchen. Seriously thinking that she had run all the way to the doc\u2019s office, she thought she deserved a little splurge. She was, after all, feeling growing hungry already. As she finally managed to reach the kitchen she was surprised in seeing Jacob there waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney! Here, would you join me for a quick snack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026I\u2019m feeling quite hungry to say the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat at the table, with the butlers and maid bringing them both a little feast of fast foods, Sara could barely wait before starting to eat, as she grabbed one of the hot dogs she had in front of her and began to voraciously eat it. As she did so, she noticed that Jacob too was eating a similar treat and yet, he seemed worried by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob\u2026.*gulp*\u2026everything ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm? Oh..yes, well\u2026 in truth\u2026no, it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, still unconsciously eating the food in front of her, thought back to that evening of so many days ago when Jacob had acted the exact same way. She had known that there was something he was worried about and she had wanted so much to know what it had been but, that time she didn\u2019t press the issue. This time was going to be much different. As she almost pushed the other half of the hot dogs she had been eating into her maw, while taking a quite larger burger next, she swallowed and cleared her voice as she addressed her boyfriend directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob\u2026*munch*\u2026if you\u2019ve got something...*crunch*\u2026.you want to tell me, don\u2019t be afraid of being direct. I love you\u2026*gulp*\u2026with all of myself, whatever it is I\u2019m sure we can\u2026*munch*\u2026find a solution together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Sara, the thing is\u2026I feel so wrong\u2026as if I\u2019ve been betraying your trust\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026*Gulp!*\u2026for?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve to admit that I was losing interest in you\u2026When we met, and later made it official, I found you irresistibly attractive. Then, I don\u2019t know why, you started to diet and exercise all the time\u2026our \u2018together time\u2019 began to dwindle to nothing and\u2026as much as I loved you I\u2026I didn\u2019t you find anymore\u2026exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, since a couple of months I\u2019ve seen you put on some weight and was so happy about it but, as time passed, I felt wrong since I didn\u2019t tell you anything\u2026as if I was doing something wrong\u2026I\u2026I should ave warned you but you seemed so happy and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacob began to talk, Sara listened carefully, although she never once stopped eating. She kept munching down burger after burger, alternating it with a few slices of pie but didn\u2019t say a word until she saw her boyfriend literally tearing himself apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob\u2026listen\u2026Listen to me. Do you want to know why I\u2019ve started putting on some weight? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did it because I was stressed about you hiding from me and, because I felt the need for freedom, since we are on vacation here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I can\u2019t tell him that Phil told me about his fantasies\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, there is nothing for you to be feeling guilty about. I\u2019m gaining a bit on purpose, because I felt I needed to do it\u2026if it pleases you, I can only be happy for the bonus\u2026\u201d <br>\r\nAs she said that, she returned to her meal, while smiling at her fianc\u00e9 who also, had started again to go at his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, while she looked at him, she noticed that he seemed a bit smaller than her. Trying to not be noticed, she compared her own arm with that of Jacob and, indeed, she saw that he seemed a bit skinnier than her. As she mulled it over, she gave another bite to her burger, munching on it with gusto, until she gathered her courage to ask a dreaded question to Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob? May I ask you\u2026*munch*\u2026something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, babe\u2026shoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh\u2026have you noticed that\u2026you seems to be rather\u2026uhmm\u2026smaller than me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the ex-lawyer chuckled a bit as he patted a few times his non-existent belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe. That was the other thing I wanted to ask you\u2026I feel like I should put on some weight, to become a bit more buff, if you get my drift\u2026 Would it be a problem for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, as she gulped down the last bite of her fourth double bacon &amp; cheese burger, could only smile at him languidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, Babe\u2026I always wondered how would you have been with a bit more fluff in you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point, during every meal, both Jacob and Sara  kept eating  together,  starting to find a source of joy, and soon arousal, in seeing the other one eat their own meals. Sara, fueled up by the need of gaining more and more weight, seeing as she thought to have managed only twenty pounds in two months, began to eat more and more, asking for bigger portions almost every other day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob, instead, as he was forced by the brain washing from Doctor Sweet, began also to eat more than he what used to, although he couldn\u2019t manage to compare his meals with those of his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara\u2019s third month of diet comes to an end\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sara was enjoying the freedom coming with the diet the good doctor had made for her. She could eat almost anything she wanted ans it was only going to help her reach the 200 pounds limit she had imposed for herself. Also, he had been pleasantly surprised in noticing that her meals had finally started to seem to her as normal sized once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so getting tired of the rabbit portions of food she had got at first, now instead she was more than happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, to be sincere, she sometimes (almost every day) had asked for seconds and third refills but, it was normal right? She had to grow a bit bigger than her lousy ten pound per month of before. So everything was just peachy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she had noticed, as she started to spend more and more meals with Jacob he had started to return to his old passionate ways, making her feel like a teenager again. It was so good to have her loving boyfriend back to her. But, most importantly, since the time that he had seemed to be smaller than her, it seemed to her that Jacob had taken to his hearth her appreciation for a fluffier him and so he too was getting a bit bigger than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust that morning, as she had woken up slowly at around 10 AM, she saw him dressing up in front of the mirror and had to admit that seeing the small-ish gut that was forming on his middle made her all giggly. In her eyes it was the cutest thing ever. He then turned and noticing she was awake had come to her side to give a quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, I\u2019m going down for breakfast\u2026you\u2019re coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Baby. Gimme five and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacob left the room, she slowly rose from the bed, passing all those issues in standing up to simply the fact she had jut woken up. As she dressed, wearing quite the large camisole and similarly large spandex pants, she left the room and slowly waddled toward the kitchen. As she opened the door she almost guffawed in seeing Jacob already sitting down and dunking a donut into his cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby! That\u2019s not fair\u2026you started already without me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d He replied \u201cYou\u2019ve got an advantage of two month on me, gotta keep it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat at the table, without taking notice in the rather large and sturdy chair that the staff had left for her, she began caressing her tummy in hungry anticipation as one of the butlers brought to her a large plate with a four eggs omelet and enough bacon strips to create a small mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Miss. In a few I\u2019ll bring you the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in anticipation to the words of the butler, as a double chin made aware it presence under her face as she nodded, Sara began taking forkfuls out of the eggs, while consuming the bacon strips at such speed that even Jacob looked at her with surprise, before returning to his own breakfast. Sara didn\u2019t notice anything of her surroundings, all she cared now was the food under her nose and her lover sitting across of her. Just as she cleaned the eggs, the same butler as before collected the empty pates, while leaving in front of her a couple more plates with some kind of buttered toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese, Miss, are a few different types of French toast which the cook was trying out today, just for you. The first one are the most common, being bread soaked in a mixture of eggs and milked, fried and served with strawberries and whipped cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side, here, we have French toast with some butter on top, and a bit of powdered sugar. Lastly, same plate but with the addition of maple syrup and nut\u2019s freely sprinkled on top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope you enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara licked her lips as she began to chew the quite thick slices of French toast, while looking over to her boyfriend to see how he was faring. Jacob had cleared his four donuts and cup of coffee and, as he cleaned his lips a butler brought to him a large plate of chocolate covered waffles, along with a cup of the tea he so much loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked hungrily at those waffles and, as she was receiving her next plate, a six stack of pancakes, she also asked to have some of those waffles too. The butler could only nod in approval as he took the order and also, left another plate beside the one currently attacked by Jacob. Leaving near the guy a plate covered in small, yet spongy, pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Sir. Enjoy your breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two kept eating, so their bellies began filling up with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob, being the smallest of the two had to stop earlier, although he had pushed himself quit a bit over his own limits. But, as he breathed out the fatigue, he could only look with admiration at how hard Sara was pushing herself, clearing plate after plate, totally destroying the pancakes and then turning on the waffles she had requested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began inhaling them, he could see that she too was reaching her limit and, in fact, with only half waffle on the plate, she burped quite loudly as she let go of the fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo full\u2026so\u2026*urp*\u2026 good. Can\u2019t eat another bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gave herself a belly rub, as much as she could due to how bloated and filled her belly was, Jacob scooped up the remaining biteful of waffle and moved it closer to Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, babe\u2026I\u2019m sure you can have one last bite\u2026it is wasteful to leave food uneaten\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know, Jacob\u2026feel so full\u2026so\u2026*urp!*\u2026so heavy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was relentless, though, an moved the bite sized treat closer and closer to her, as he felt himself excited like never before. Sara, seeing as Jacob seemed so happy, gave it in and opened her outh accepting the treat, lapping up at his fingers still close to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh\u2026delicious\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt every meal, both Sara and Jacob, began soon to overstuff themselves, eating enough for three of rour people by themselves, and yet, the both of them couldn\u2019t be happier. Jacob, although brainwashed to be thinking so, couldn\u2019t stop thinking that the bigger Sara was getting, the more beautiful she looked. Sara, instead, could only look at her lover with pleasure, finding his fluff rather enticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on a sort of schedule started to be followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf before, the couple, would do some activity together, since Sara had started to follow the doctor little diet, they started to pass most of their time sitting together at a table, eating away as their growing stomachs got rounder and fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times something would seem to disturb their routine, as one time, for example, as Sara sat on a chair that was meat for Jacob, she rightly crushed it under her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, thanks to Jacob, and the butlers stationed around, food was rightly brought out to her making her forget about the incident. And so, the routine started anew, with food becoming the main activity that the two of them would follow throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it naturally is, a schedule oriented around only food started to produce results in both of their waistlines. Since both Jacob and Sara basically glutted themselves from morning till night, their bodies began to grow along, storing all the excess of calories as adipose. Sara, which already had been on the verge of the 200 pounds, after two more weeks of this endless gorging, was now teetering near the 225 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as her body accumulated fat within itself, so her hips began to flare out massively, growing wider, even ripping out some of the old pants she still had with her from the time she had arrived in the mansion. This didn\u2019t mean that only her ass seemed to be growing. Her breast too, took a lot of nutrients into them, as they started to inflate almost on a daily basis, covering whatever was in their shadow from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob, instead, seemed to be growing rather round all over, although his weight seemed to be concentrating in both his belly and in his, recently sprouted, newfound moobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t particularly fascinated by his growing out, but since he had been ordered to like it, he did his best. Still, brainwashed or not, when the two of them reached the end of the day, waddling side by side toward the bed they shared, each of them couldn\u2019t deny that sleeping beside each other was much more satisfying than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, though\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
