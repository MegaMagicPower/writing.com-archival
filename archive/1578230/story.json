Steven heard all about Benjamin reading all the Harry Potter books back-to-back and the 24 season set Benjamin bought. But hearing a long tirade wasn't what was keeping him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was still unnoticed by Jill, the head cheerleader. Sure he didn't have much of a chance with her, but he loved her. Then he failed a test. Then he got tons of homework. Now he's going home, and is sure his parents aren't there and he'll have to watch Rachel. For a 12 year old, she can be quite a handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked home, to vent his frustration, he found a dumpster and punched it. That wasn't smart. It hurt. A lot. But something in the dumpster caught Steven's eye. A weird necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grabbed the necklace and wondered: Should he put it on? Or wait until he's home? Or just leave it there?</span></div></div>",

His head went blank and then he started to feel \"normal\" again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven thought to himself that he should try to see if the feeling was real. He walked around the general area and saw a couple making out in an alley. To his surprise, it was Jill and her supposed boyfriend-of-the-week (Jill probably chose him because he was buff. REALLY buff.). She didn't notice him. Neither did the disposable boyfriend.

Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill quickly became a stalker...though Steven didn't mind. Jill was always there for him, even in bed. They did everything together. Thanks to his muscles and Jill, the whole school loved him. He was the most popular guy in the school, plain and simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatley, Jill started to become a \"little\" overprotective. Anyone who dared to even say one even slightly mean thing about Steven, found themselves dead. No one knew who was doing it, but Steven knew. So, no one said anything bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon, whenever someone even looked at Steven with either attraction or awe...she took that wrong too. And killed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could figure out Jill was doing this, she was practically a pro at killing and body disposal. Why? Steven didn't know, but didn't want to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven went home early from school one day, and looked through a bunch of magazines and comics. This helped him calm down a bit. He still couldn't believe he bought bodybuilder magazines because of his new physique. As for comics, reading about Batman fighting Poison Ivy was a nice relief from reality. Poison Ivy had some crazy abilities, like being able to control plants or being able to control any man with pheromones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he wished for Jill to go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost himself in these magazines until Jill came out of nowhere and jumped on him. Looking at her, what was he thinking about?</span></div></div>",

In essence, she became exactly as muscular and huge as Steven. The only real differences being that her breasts swelled past her normal D-size to practically H-cups and that her hair flowed down to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven began to panic, and decided to turn Jill back. Unfortunatley, Jill was going through spasms of glee from the muscle growth (making Steven wonder why he didn't experience this), and her now huge arm hit the necklace. She grabbed onto it and ripped it off before Steven could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's growth stopped and she held the necklace as she enjoyed her new body. Jill thought to herself that she had lost her previous form, but always liked muscle. And now she had a lot of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's previous thoughts gave way to the thoughts most bodybuilders have, due to the necklace. She wanted more muscle. She never wanted to stop growing. And she somehow knew the necklace could give her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven tried to stop her from using the necklace, but Jill punched him again and put it on.

Too wrapped up in her body, she didn't notice Steven attempt to grab the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling up her muscles, Steven grabbed the necklace. His thoughts were focused on turning Jill back to normal. He put it on, and she retaliated, but it was too late for her.

Steven reached forward to grab the necklace, but Jill had already grown much stronger than him and pushed him back toward a bookcase.  He fell into it, knocking off a pile of comic books.  He held onto the bookcase to keep himself from falling down.  The comic books fell to the ground in front of Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Jill had already added enough muscle to put any boy in school to shame.  Her legs were thick with muscle.  Grapefruit sized calves jutted outward and her massive thighs hung over her small knees in perfect teardrops.  Her narrow stomach was tensed into a cut 8-pack and her gravity defying tits pushed outward from a shelf of striated pectorals.  Her muscle filled arms hung to the side, pressed outward by her wide back.  She hadn\u2019t grown much taller, having reached 6 foot tall, matching the height of Steven.  When the comics fell in front of her, she paused her growth and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you like these things huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven righted himself and stood there cautiously.  He swallowed nervously as he started to sport some serious wood.  It wasn\u2019t every day a beautiful, fully naked muscle girl was in his room.  OK, this had never happened before, but he certainly had dreamed about it.  And before Steven could answer, she read his mind, surprised that she had that ability.  Shaking her head, she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to answer.  I can tell you do.  And you know what?  Having the power of this necklace is intoxicating.  I don\u2019t really want to be 15 feet high.  But I do enjoy the thought of being powerful.  Ruling the school is one thing.  Ruling the planet, well that\u2019s another.  But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.  What would you like to see Steven?  Do you want to see me make your comic book world come to life and have me take on the strongest heroes and villains?  Would you like to see me become Supergirl or the Invisible Girl?  Or Supergirl or the Invisible Girl with massive muscles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s blood rushed out of his face.  Holy cow!  Someone he could tell the necklace had given her the ability to lock in his thoughts.  And that she would grant his wildest dreams!  He stared down at the comic books on the ground and back up to Jill, who flexed up her bicep into a 20 inch mountain of sexuality.  She winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice Steven.  At least for a start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like his dreams, reality began to shift and Jill began to glow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He glanced at the drawing of Supergirl, and he just stared at her for the longest time. God, she was so sexy! A hot, gorgeous girl with blond hair and a blue skirt, with a beautiful, long, red cape draped over her shoulders that would blow in the wind\u2026 Not to mention the fact that this girl had super strength and could FLY! He just loved the Supergirl character\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat choice, Steve\u2026\u201d Jill said, while she was still standing naked before him. \u201cI will be your Supergirl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace started to glow once again, and a bright, blue glow engulfed Jill\u2019s body. Then, out of the blue, a bright, blue skirt and top materialized on Jill\u2019s body, completely out of nowhere! On her chest was the big, bright \u201cS\u201d emblem, with the red and yellow border. A long, red cape was draped over her shoulders and was hanging all the way till past her calves. A bright-red pair of boots appeared to cover her feet and ankles, almost up to her knees, and a thick, bright-yellow leather belt appeared around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Jill grew even more muscular, as her arms thickened, growing into huge pythons of steel. She sported tremendous biceps and huge triceps, and she had large breasts as well. Even her legs grew thicker, as her muscles increased in size. Finally, her flat stomach grew several rows of abdominals, finishing off her new look as a super-heroine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s give this new body a test-drive!\u201d she cheered, as Jill raised her arms above her head and leaped into the air, flying a wide circle above Steven\u2019s head. She had super powers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d Steven gasped, as he slowly got back on his feet. He couldn\u2019t believe it! He saw Jill transform into Supergirl before his very eyes! She has all Supergirl\u2019s powers, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill landed right in front of him, and craned her head towards the sky. Then, two red beams of light came from her pupils, striking the clouds above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! I also have heat vision!\u201d Jill said to her friend, as she continued to discover her powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uhhh\u2026 Can I have my necklace back, Supergirl?\u201d Steve asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jill/Supergirl gently removed the necklace, and handed it back to Steve. She didn\u2019t need it anymore. She got what she wanted, and her powers and her costume were hers to keep, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve then placed the necklace around his own neck.

The only difference was that she really was Supergirl, thanks to the cursed necklace! She was wearing the blue dress and skirt along with the iconic long, red cape draped over her shoulders and finally those long, red boots which covered her legs all the way up to her knees. She looked absolutely stunning. The most wonderful thing about the costume was also the fact that not only did she look like Supergirl, but she had the super heroine\u2019s powers as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look absolutely\u2026 Super!\u201d Steve grinned, as he ran his hand over her hair. \u201cI just love the way you look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m glad you like it, Steve\u2026 It\u2019s just that\u2026 I\u2019m feeling a bit lonely right now\u2026\u201d she purred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLonely?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026 I would like to have a man with me, who can fly next to me, you know?\u201d she said with a grin on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the only one around here who is super\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOohhhh I get it!\u201d Steve grinned back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve then stood up from the couch and stood right in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I would like to be your Superman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace glowed around his neck, and it emitted a bright, blue light, which surrounded Steve\u2019s body from head to toe. Then, just a minute later, Steve\u2019s muscles began to inflate again, as he began to discover his super powers, thanks to the necklace which had granted his request. Steve then craned his neck and closed his eyes as his body was flooded with the wonderful super powers as the necklace converted his DNA to that of the famous Kryptonian visitor who had become such a popular character in the comic books and in the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the magic progressed through his body, his clothes began to morph into the famous red-and-blue tights, which clothed his body as well. His t-shirt and shorts then morphed into the blue tights and long sleeves which made up the upper-body part of the famous Superman costume, which covered Steve\u2019s now huge, bulging chest. His arms became big and round and powerful, as his biceps grew even bigger while his pectorals inflated even more so than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoulders widened considerably and his back became a large slab of muscle, as super strength flowed through his muscular body. Then, the magic traveled south and affected his legs and his torso, making his abdominals pop up like tiles on the kitchen floor and his legs inflated and became as thick as sewer pipes. His calves finally ballooned out like soccer balls, making him look incredibly muscular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig, long, red boots now covered his feet up to his knees and a long, wide, red cape now formed, draped over his wide shoulders. Everything on his chest and on the back of his cape had the large \u201cS\u201d insignia on it, which was the famous trademark for the superhero. Finally, his shorts morphed into the red briefs and the yellow belt, which covered his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, how do I look?\u201d The Man of Steel said to the maiden of steel, who was still sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely smashing!\u201d she said, as she got up and walked towards the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the two caped people took off, flying through the air like two birds, with the two long, red capes billowing behind them in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flew around, chasing each other and enjoying the total and complete freedom they now possessed as they got to fly through the air like two kids, playing tag with each other and seeing who could fly the fastest. After a few minutes, Jill decided to fly back to the house where she landed in the back yard with Steve following right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve then looked at her and wondered what to do next\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had found him to be sweet and polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish that Sean was our son and that he was living with us right now\u2026\u201d Steve whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta go inside!\u201d Sean said to the other kids, as he picked up his board and walked into the house, where Steve and Jill were waiting for him while they were still in their superhero outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the boy walked in the door, he ran up to Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish Sean was Superboy and that he had super powers, just like me and Jill!\u201d Steve said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, while Jill was hugging the boy, the necklace around Steve\u2019s neck began to glow and a ray of blue light struck the boy\u2019s body, engulfing him in blue light as Jill was still hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just like magic, the boy suddenly gained all the same super powers that Jill and Steve had. His muscles grew as well, while his chest, his arms, and his legs inflated with amazing muscle. His t-shirt and shorts morphed right away and changed into the blue tights, red boots, red briefs and the long, red cape which transformed Sean into Superboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi mom\u2026 Can we go and get some ice cream or something?\u201d Sean asked Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him!\u201d Steve said. \u201cCome on, bud\u2026 Let\u2019s go flying, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! Thanks dad!\u201d Sean cheered, as the short, muscular caped boy leaped into the air, and remained hovering a foot above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ha ha! No flying in the house!\u201d Jill said with a stern tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry mom!\u201d Sean said, as he quickly landed with his red boots touching down on the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Superboy. Let\u2019s go outside and get some ice cream!\u201d Steve said to the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Steve and Sean walked outside and took off, flying side-by-side to the ice cream shop, as Jill looked on with a wide grin on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And like she had gained a bit of muscle too, but somehow still had a knockout frame. And was definitley stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd where she woke up...it was like she was in a hospital bed. Except this hospital had a window showing outer space. Getting up, right away, Jill said, \"...Where am I?\" in a darker yet seductive and feminine voice. And the necklace was in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman then appeared out of nowhere, nearly giving Jill a heart attack. Batman then said, \"You're in the Justice League Watchtower. That fight we had with Amazo must have taken a lot out of you.\" Jill thought \"Amazo? Who the hell is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she somehow remembered an android who had hundreds of superpowers. Named \"Amazo\". Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman then said, \"Get some rest, you were wounded quite a bit in that fight. You look completley healed, but your behaviour is peculiar to say the least. Not recgonizing the Watchtower isn't like you.\" Jill replied confused, \"Uh, yeah. I'll get some rest. Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman then disappeared as Jill looked for a bathroom. She figured a mirror would be there. And if she looked into it...she could see what happened to her body. Since it felt different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding one, Jill looked in the mirror and gasped. Jill was now Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long flowing black hair and a tight outfit. It still showed some of her breasts. And they were big. Possibly bigger than her former ones. With no pants, almost all of her legs were shown. A nice touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had Wonder Woman's indestructible bracelets, her golden lasso that could force those in it to tell the truth and a pretty cool looking (at least to her) golden tiara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did she Wonder Woman's powers? Levitating off the floor, she quickly discovered she could fly. And by punching a hole in a wall with ease, she obviously had superhuman strength. Jill didn't remember Wonder Woman's other powers (though she knew she had more), but this could be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Jill found a rocket-like thing (a \"Javelin\" or something) and went down to Earth. It was...different. There were fictional cities like Gotham or Metropolis now real. And if her, Amazo and Batman were real...there must've been others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jill was flying, she passed through Gotham and saw the Joker AND Carnage teaming up. And killing people. Joker was a psycho clown, with laughing gas that killed and way too many weapons as she recalled. And you shouldn't underestimate him. Ever. His insanity knows no bounds. As for Carnage...he was like a red Venom. That kills everyone. This liquid freak that can turn solid and kill people with bladed arms and such. Creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...she could fight them and save some innocents. Plus, she could test out her powers. But, Wonder Woman didn't have any pockets on her costume. So, she had to hold the necklace...but what if she dropped it? Or maybe she should try to fix everything...a world of superheroes and supervillains could be dangerous. She could think of a better world. Or at least a safer one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

People were no longer murderous, psychotic, and generally just f---ed-up clowns. Now, they were.....still clowns?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, every man, woman, and child were still clowns. From birth to death, they were clowns. Like with regular clowns, they had chalky white skin, big squeaky red noses, oversized shoes (people tripped rather often), gaudy colored clothing, and many balloons and various other small magic tricks filled their large pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was a bright side to all this. Wars and crimes were no longer done, because as soon as any sort of trouble started, the people on both sides would laugh too much at how ridiculous the other side looked. And so nothing bad really happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the only problem that still existed in the world, was that very rarely, a person would be born with coulrophobia. And when everyone looked like clowns (even you) twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred sixty-five days a year, you really didn't wanna see anyone. Needless to say, those people didn't get out much.  But they were treated well by the government due to their unique condition when everyone looked the same as your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite all this happiness, Jill couldn't change everyone back into regular humans. Perhaps the Joker has made another wish on the necklace, maybe her crazy clown side had influenced her last wish, Jill didn't know, but clowns everyone was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill realized then, maybe she should change everyone in a different manner. Maybe work her way back or humans, or something else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe the necklace was drained or something? It was one thing to change the world the way the Joker had, but to do it several times in the course of a such short time might have been too much, even for this mighty artifact.

The end result would be them killing themselves in pleasure, so that was good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jill the Jester made her way through the boat, more random things happened to the other innocent teenagers. Food starting eating people. The boat flipped upside down, but gravity kept them on the boat. Sharks with smiles jumped up (or down, depending on how you look at it) and swallowed people whole while they laughed. Beautiful girls became mermaids. Boys became \"mermen\", with the heads of fish and lower parts being male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went crazy and everyone loved it. For the finishing touch, everyone left living on the boat became a laughing maniac, a clown and one of the Jill the Jester's servants...all at once. Except Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill witnessed some of this and hid the whole time. But Jill the Jester wanted Jill to loosen up and have fun. So she decided to do something special for Jill's birthday and prove to Jill she wasn't bad. She was going to show Jill what her home was like. And then her and Jill could go for a girl's night out, in which she'd drive Jill to insanity to be worthy of ruling over her world (to be made insane before her rule, during said night out).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill was scared as Jill the Jester came out of nowhere and decided to:</span></div></div>",

He flexed his giant muscles again and looked at his framed picture beside his bed of him and his girlfriend, Jill. Rachel came running to his room and hugged him. His parents were making pancakes for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second. Steven thought to himself, \"What's happening? Last time I was buff, bad things followed. And this picture of Jill and me...how the hell did I get that? Last time she liked me, things didn't go so well either. Maybe I should use the necklace again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could, his parents brought him breakfast in bed. A ton of pancakes. With syrup. And they smelled so good. Steven chowed down and decided to wait a little while longer before using the necklace. Just in case, he took it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the only new weird thing that really bothered him was the fact that his parents and Rachel were smiling. Big smiles. Insanely big smiles. And they never stopped smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon changing into clothes (he was surprised he even had clothes that fit him), he put the necklace in his pocket. All of a sudden, he heard a ring on his nearby cell phone. Picking it up, it was Jill. Jill gushed on about how much she loved him and asked if their date at the movies was still on. Steven said that it was, but first made sure what theatre it was at. Still, why was their date in half an hour? He just woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe theatre was near his house so he could walk there. Along the way, everyone was happy. REALLY happy. It was kind of creepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the theatre, Jill jumped out of nowhere on him (bad memories came up). But she was also really happy. It was like someone put a permanent smile on her face. Steven then asked her why everyone was so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill responded almost puzzled (but still smiling), \"Because everyone is always happy. If you're not, they come get you and make you happy. You're not smiling though...are you alright? ...I could get them for you.\" Steven, slightly scared, said \"No...that's alright, I'm happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looked at Steven and said, \"But you're not smiling. You're not happy enough. Our date can happen later, you need help.\" Jill then yelled out, \"Someone's not happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was puzzled at why she would yell this out. Then a tranquilizer dart hit him, seemingly coming out of nowhere. And he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven woke up, to find himself locked in a cell and chained up in some sort of cross between a torture chamber and a high tech lab. Steven, still waking up, barely managed to say, \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman in a lab coat (who was smiling ear-to-ear) came and said, \"We took you because you weren't happy. Would you like to be tortured until you're happy or injected until you're happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven thought both choices were probably not good. But where was the necklace? Steven asked, \"Where's my necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman replied, \"We took it from you and are analyzing it in the next room. But first, we need to make you happy.\" The woman pulled an axe and a syringe out of nowhere, still smiling. The woman said, \"Answer my question, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Steven realized he had no choice...but if he chose one, she'd have to open the cell. Maybe then he could escape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does Steven choose?</span></div></div>",

Shall we begin?\" Steven felt that \"pain\" and \"happy\" contradict each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman brought the axe close to Steven's face again. But if he wiggled around, he might be able to have the restraints cut by the nearby blade. Then again, he didn't have much of a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shook for dear life. And, luckily, for Steven...the axe cut the chains. Almost miracously, he managed to shake off the chains. The woman then came running at him with the axe as he ran. And didn't look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDitching the madwoman by hiding behind torture equipment, he heard some people talking nearby. He followed the noise down a hallway, filled with paintings of bloody smiley faces. Creepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise came from inside a small room. The door was slightly ajar. He tried to take a peek in, but couldn't see who the people were. There was a male voice and a female voice though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has he settled down?\"<br>\r\n\"No, madame, he hasn't. Though he is in re-education as we speak.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, call me when he's back to normal. I do know him.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, madame.\"<br>\r\n\"Smile bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"Is this satisfactory?\"<br>\r\n\"For now.\"<br>\r\n\"Why do we always have to smile?\"<br>\r\n\"Are we questioning the will of God?\"<br>\r\n\"...No.\"<br>\r\n\"Good. Because God was reincarnated in our chosen. We owe it to God to respect the body that God lays in. And that body desires happiness.\"<br>\r\n\"And control.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should tell her. I am her Angel of Bliss. And I'm sure she'd want you strapped down too. She only pretends to be normal, you know that right?\"<br>\r\n\"...Of course.\"<br>\r\n\"Good.

And the necklace isn't the best thing to use. Then again, Jill seemed to be prone to...changes. That and she...well, he couldn't finger it but he got the impression she had done a lot of bad things. Like every choice someone makes ends with her screwing them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two left into the night, Jill and Steven boarded her motorcycle and rode enough into the night. Steven kept the necklace in a pocket. Did not want it to screw him over. Again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVampires attacked and Jill used a machine gun with one hand to mow them down. Jill then stopped in an abandoned hospital, and starting itching the back of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill got off and so did Steven. Steven said, \"Why are we stopping? We have to get out of here.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jill almost instantly fell asleep. No nodding off, just the feeling of a hit in the head...or her whole body. And she was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, she woke up. She still had the necklace, which she put away into a pocket, as she got dressed. But she wondered...did she really become an amazing fighter? She did notice a lot of fighting trophies and black belts lining her room, with a \"World Warrior\" trophy beside her cheerleading pom poms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen of her house, she watched as her brother (a nobody in the school) bowed before her. Her parents also bowed before her. They had made her favourite breakfast, packed her bag, everything. They practically were slaves. Then she realized...they were slaves! HER slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cowered with fear. Jill looked at them with delight. They just begged not to be hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the house, and looking at the necklace in her pocket, she wondered \"How good of a fighter am I?\" Jill did a few backflips, somersaults and splits to warm up. Then she did a 360-degree kick, flipped in the air TEN times, each time getting higher, until she landed with a downward punch that left a small crater in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. She felt more \"wows\" as she found she knew the ins and outs of pressure points and nerve endings on an innocent bystander. Who ran for his life afterwards. Then she found that Karate, Hapkido and about a dozen other fighting forms were child's play to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to school, boxing and running with the speed of a cheetah the whole way, she realized something. This is fun. This is how she should be. Not just some cheerleader everyone loves. A badass fighter that everyone loves AND fears (and maybe does cheerleading on the side).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill made it to school, and watched everyone being both fearful and in awe of her beauty. She beat the crap out of some jocks (for fun) and got away with it just by looking at the bystanders. Yeah...this is the life, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to actually go to a class just for fun. See how people treated her in the classroom. Sure enough, life was great there too. She never thought she'd actually enjoy math class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen people started whispering about an upcoming World Warrior tournament. And how Jill won it the last time. Would she win this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard about a \"transfer student\". Who could be as good as Jill. That was bullshit, and she knew it, but she continued listening. Apparently, they had trained under some \"Ryu-san\" and had become a worldwide celebrity fighter. Before this person was an amazing fighter. Now they were World Warrior material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill balled her fists up, even hearing someone could be as good as her. She needed the necklace.

Plus, the hair was cute somehow as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, the boys were lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill wasn't lucky, feeling unnerved that someone could usurp her position as best fighter in the school. Jill then right away thought of bringing out the necklace. But it was too risky. Someone could see it, take it, who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura introduced herself to the class, explaining all about her training (asked about many times), and even flipped a guy with one hand. Just one hand. Not even using her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill really didn't like this. But Sakura felt kind towards Jill. Besides, she WAS a World Warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after class, Sakura appeared out of nowhere to Jill. Jill, surprised, was told that Sakura was just practicing her stealth abilities. At least that's what Sakura said. Damn showoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura seemed to be an avid fan of Jill. At least she wasn't all bad. Though Jill really didn't remember winning any fighting tournaments. And that was all Sakura talked about. Until she mentioned the World Warrior tournament. It was going to start on the weekend...and today was Friday. That meant on Saturday it could start!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura confirmed this. She also said it was happening (or at least starting) in China. And it would be televised to the world! Sakura couldn't wait...as soon as school was over, she was going to fly down to China. She would fight for the weekend, then come back to school. Then each weekend after that, there would be more of the tournament. In a different place each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill thought this would be a great opportunity to show up Sakura. Plus, she could test just how great a fighter she was. And it would be easy to get there with the necklace (which she could use for cheating, if all else fails). Or she could just beat up Sakura in a brawl outside or inside the school to show her superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, what should she do?</span></div></div>",

Just for fun, I mean.\" Sakura thought about this and said, \"Sure! It should be fun. You'd kick my butt though.\" That was just what Jill wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two decided to meet afterschool, right in front of the school. Jill, using her popularity (and if necessary, everyone's fear of her), made sure every student was there. Jill was ready to beat Sakura to a bloody pulp, even if Sakura was treating this like a game. Still, Jill wondered why Sakura was dressed like a stereotypical schoolgirl. Sakura replied that it was her \"street fighting outfit\". Jill rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura asked Jill if she was ready. Jill felt for the necklace in her pocket (just in case she lost, she could go back and make herself win...though using the necklace was risky, and she knew it). It was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill responded she was ready, gritting her teeth. The fight was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura came running at Jill, and the two grappled, each attempting to throw the other. Jill was still surprised at how easy fighting now came to her, yet aggravated Sakura could be her equal. NO! No one is Jill's equal! At least that is how Jill felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill elbowed Sakura in the neck, and threw her into a wall. Jill then rushed to the wall to continue the assault as the crowd cheered, \"Jill! Jill! Jill!\" Jill looked back at her adoring fans...and Sakura kicked Jill in the back, sending her away from Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura followed up right away with a spinning kick which defied gravity. As Jill was overcoming her back's pain, her face got Sakura's shoe in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill then backflipped away and came back with a running punch to Sakura's gut, knocking the wind out of her. Jill wanted to win, no matter what. But as they traded blow-for-blow...it seemed like a stalemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jill fought dirty. She grabbed Sakura's hair, and while Sakura was busy with her hair, punched her in the face. Then threw her to the floor and kicked her while she was down. Sakura got back up, though, still willing to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was almost done for, but instead screamed \"Hadouken\" and unleashed a pink fireball of sorts out of her hands, the size of the school. It seemed to cause no property damage (so at least the necklace would be safe), but it was a safe bet it would hurt people...like Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was almost no way Jill could dodge it. If it hit Jill, she'd be done for. She was already out of breath, and wasn't sure if she was fast enough to dodge. Sakura could barely stand and would soon fall to her feet, in defeat...unless her Hadouken hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hadouken used was a little-know variant called the \"Nekkestsu Hadouken\"...it could break almost all the bones in someone's body at close range.

Sakura extended her hand to help Jill up and said, \"Wow, I can't believe I actually beat you. It was probably a fluke, but it was really fun fighting you. We should do this again sometime!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill got up herself, and left humiliated and upset at this turn of events.

She could give herself enough of a pain threshold to withstand cheap moves like the one that did her in. She could make herself stronger, faster, better. Of course, this would come with unintended side effects because of the necklace (at least she theorized that) but it would be fun no matter what to kick Sakura's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2- She could also wish to be able to drain her enemies' strength, speed, etc. somehow. This would definitley give her an edge, but what would this do? The necklace would do something....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one should she wish for?</span></div></div>",

Only stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she got her wish. First, she got more than enough strength to beat Sakura. She shot up to 6'4 in height, her bones extending flawlessly and painlessly. Then she began to orgasm, as a beautiful feeling rushed through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of power. Her biceps and triceps grew bigger and bigger. They were clearly defined, with bulging veins protruding from her twin biceps and horseshoe-shaped triceps. Her arms became so huge she could barely put them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest and back grew huge as well, veins also running through them. She gained a rock hard six-pack as her legs became the size of her arms. Then muscle erupted all over her body, seemingly growing out of thin air until she couldn't even breathe without making them 2 inches bigger. Her body was converted to almost all muscle, the rest being what was needed, like a brain or a heart (now much bigger to provide for her new body). Even her breasts became so huge, she could barely see her amazing abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breasts were also rock hard, so hard the nipples could be used to stab someone. They were about five times larger than DD's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her butt was massively muscled. Everything seemed to be muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last touch that could be seen (for now) was her hair extending to her knees. And somehow the necklace was still on her. And of course, there were now no clothes to be seen. At all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all her physical abilities, despite dwarfing the Hulk, were enhanced. She could leap tall buildings, run faster than a locomotive, take inhuman amounts of pain...everything. And she loved it. Plus, she realized she was slowly building in muscle and power every second. And if she needed to, she could will more muscle and power. ...This was going to be fun, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople (including Sakura) watched with fear and awe as Jill became this mammoth woman. However, Jill's body was now also giving off superhuman pheromones and scents (due to another wish: be even more loved than before). Every boy wanted her. NOW. Hell, even the girls (Sakura included) were starting to entertain very naughty thoughts about themselves and Jill's amazing muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill took a step, shattering the ground and roared from her new 2-ton body of muscle. The roar brought only Sakura back to her senses, who used her incredible willpower to resist Jill. Jill said, \"So, little girl, you wanna have a rematch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura replied:</span></div></div>",

Her beauty was intoxicating.  How could she possibly defeat her?  Realizing that if she would ever have a chance at the tournament, she had to try.  Running at Jill, Sakura jumped up, spinning her feet out and delivering a full powered kick into Jill\u2019s massive tits.  Jill smiled, not even bothering to move.  Sakura hit Jill\u2019s left breast with her full force, and the loud crack was heard across the high school as Sakura\u2019s legs snapped against Jill\u2019s steel hard breasts, not even making the slightest dent!  Sakura fell to the ground in heap at Jill\u2019s feet moaning in pain.  Jill laughed and reached down, grabbing Sakura by her shirt and pulling her up until Sakura\u2019s feet dangled high above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try pipsqueak, but you\u2019re looking at the most powerful being on the planet.  Nobody can challenge my strength, muscles or fighting ability.  Especially a tiny girl like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill tossed Sakura up and over the school where she landed hard on the ground, knocked unconscious.  Jill smiled and turned off her super pheromones.  Having everyone lust after her was fine, but she preferred the fear.  And within moments the school yard registered fully what they just seen.  The toughest girl in school, hell the toughest fighter in the world was now even more powerful.  Jill flexed up her bicep and it exploded upward to the size of a volleyball, blasting up to her wrist and crackling with untold strength!  Everyone around her cowered in fear and admiration.  As Jill released her flex a loud boom was heard behind her and Jill turned to see a dimensional hole form and a group of people walking out.  Within moments the group of spandex heroes had exited and the hole boomed shut.  Superman looked at Jill and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited to the tournament this year.  You must be the previous champion.  I would have to say that there is a group standing in front of you who can not only challenge your strength, but your fighting ability as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill turned and clenched her jaw.  She recognized the heroes in front of her.  Superman, Thor, Captain Marvel, the Hulk, the Thing and the Silver Surfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?  Well I care to differ.

He jumped into the air and landed next to her with an earth shaking boom.  Jill stumbled backward as the rest of the school kids scattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHulk strongest one there is!  No puny girl can stand in his way!  Hulk crush!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hulk brought his fists up over his head and leaned back, looking to smash Jill into the ground.  Jill stared up and bent her knees.  This would be interesting.  She was big and powerful, but the Hulk was a force of nature.  Holding confidence in her wish that she would continue to become stronger and never weaker Jill reached up with her arms and watched as the Hulk brought his fist down hard.  And with a earth shaking concussion, his fists slammed into Jill\u2019s waiting hands.  And drove her 6 inches into the ground with a huge cloud of dust!  But as the dust settled, the other heroes looked on with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis teen-age super girl was holding the Hulk back!  Driven to one knee, Jill\u2019s arm shook with effort as they slowly bent toward her head.  The Hulk roared and began pressing down harder, his huge muscles tensing from the effort.  But even as the Hulk grew stronger, so did Jill.  She began moaning loudly as each leap of super strength pounded into her muscles, causing her to orgasm with immense pleasure.  Her large muscles began to throb, growing more powerful by the second, rising in strength to the task at hand.  Every muscle fiber on her body was bursting with super energy, pulsing to the surface across her perfect female form.  Her calves expanded out beyond the size of volleyballs.  Her thighs grew thicker than garbage cans as steel girder sized muscles expanded and split!  Her narrow stomach pushed forward nuclear bomb proof steel abs across her midsection.  Her pectorals tore across her chest as titanium cables of raw power and her breasts pulsed forward, rippling and throbbing full of muscle.  Her bullet nipples glowed red hot.  Her arms took on enough muscle to fill a side of beef!  One foot thick triceps continued to expand as her arms trembled against the Hulk\u2019s power.  Her biceps expanded up to the size of basketballs.  Her eyes glowed bright blue.  Her beauty was reaching toward that of a goddess and her long, brilliantly blonde hair whipped around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she became stronger.  And stronger.  And STRONGER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her gigantic arms stopped trembling.  And a smile crept across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Hulk.  Is this the best you can do?  Show me your geometrically increasing strength!  Show me those monster muscles!  Drive me into the ground if you can!  After all, I\u2019m just a teen-age girl!  And you\u2019re the Incredible Hulk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hulk roared.  \u201cBah!  Stupid girl make fun of Hulk!  The Hulk is the strongest one there is!  And the madder the Hulk gets, the stronger the Hulk gets!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he pushed even harder!  But Jill only smiled wider as her entire body began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!  You call that strength?  I\u2019ll show you some real girl strength!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmic power began to pore into Jill\u2019s muscles, DOUBLING her strength every second!  Within moments, Jill pulled her leg up and was standing back up!  Then she began to extend her arms back out, pushing the Hulk back!  Now laughing, Jill twisted her wrists forward and bending the Hulk\u2019s wrists back.  She tightened her grip with her small fingers around his fists, slowly crushing his bones!  The Hulk roared again, this time with pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Hulk?  Can\u2019t you take it when the tables are turned?  You dared to challenge me in a test of strength?  I\u2019m beyond super powered!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill then tensed her gigantic muscles and her strength doubled AGAIN, blasting into her muscles like a nuclear explosion!  She pressed harder, crushing the Hulk\u2019s fists and sending him to his knees before her!  Jill looked into the pain racked eyes of the formerly unstoppable monster as she continued to grow stronger and stronger!  Her entire body was flexed to ridiculous proportions.  Her skin was paper thin as every muscle on her body expanded out bigger until she was matching those of the Incredible Hulk.  Muscles so big they ate up all space available on her frame.  But they weren\u2019t nearly big enough or strong enough for her!  Wave after wave of increasing strength swept her body and in order to accommodate the muscles she demanded her height increased.  At 7 feet tall her muscles grew bigger than the Hulk!  At 8 feet tall, they dwarfed his!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what real strength is all about, you pathetic loser!  I\u2019m the strongest one on this plant and I don\u2019t care who shows up to challenge me!  I\u2019ll kick all of your asses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing all of her godlike strength down, Jill drove the Hulk into the ground, smashing his body into the earth and onto his back with his legs twisted awkwardly below him.  Jill stood over him and bent down, flexing her humongous muscles into the biggest, strongest most muscular pose ever dreamed and roaring with victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles expanded in every direction, filling up her now 9 foot tall body to the limit!  Biceps 120 inches around surged forward, pectorals and boobs bigger than beech balls exploded forth as six inch thick striations raced across her mighty chest!  Her shoulders and traps lept up to her ears!  Her back was 8 feet wide and two feet thick!  Her legs were as big around as 100 foot tall oak trees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJill is the biggest one there is!  Jill is the strongest one there is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hulk shook his head and pulled himself up, blinded by rage.  Ignoring the fact that he now had to look up to see the powerful and beautiful girl before him.  He pulled his fist back, ignoring the pain in his broken, but quickly healing, hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah!  Hulk heard it all before!  Now Hulk SMASH!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With uncaring ease she had just struck the Hulk with force enough to launch him into another state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, not even worth my time anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing took a step backward - this dame had just thrashed the Hulk without even trying and he was no Hulk. But, then, Hulk was no Superman, Captain Marvel, Thor or Silver Surfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing wasn't the smartest man alive - but he worked with him - and he knew something about these 4. Thor was a demigod, and with mortals he was always pulling his punches. Reed estimated that the thunder god could tussle with any living hero if he ever tapped into his full godly power. The Surfer was infused by the Power Cosmic, if he needed it he had the power of Galactus to tap into, though that would of course draw Galactus to see what his old herald was up to, probably strip him of the Power Cosmic then devour Earth. But even without going that far he could drop the big guys like a bad habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Marvel and Superman he didn't know as well, what with them being from a different universe and all, but from what he'd heard - strong here was nothing compared to strong where they came from. Hulk was famous for being able to lift a few hundred tons, maybe as much as a thousand or two if you really pissed him off. These two could supposedly alter the orbit of the moon if the job called for it.</span></div></div>",

Seemingly knowing she was awake, several maids, a cook, and a butler quickly hustled into the room, smiles beaming out of their faces, intcredibly pleased to serve her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill blinked her eyes a few times to get the sleep out of her eyes, and sat up. Immediately the group of 8 rushed to her bed. She noticed the butler and cook had hard-ons, but apparently being loved by everyone would kinda make guys a bit more horny around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Jill, what is your desire?\" the butler eagerly asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...want to go downstairs and eat something.\" Jill replied, to which the cook shot out of the room. The butler then called in 4 very muscular and VERY good looking men, carrying a very comfortable looking chair. They gently set the chair down, turned towards Jill, and pulled back her sheet and covers.Two of them then picked up Jill in her sitting position, and set her on the miniature throne. All four then picked the chair back up, and uniformly carried her out of her room. They continued through hallways and rooms, ending up in a massive dining room with long carved mahogany chairs and tables. However, she was the only eater for now. Soon a maid came through, followed by the cook from earlier with a plate of her favorite foods, breakfast or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four carriers took a step back, but seemed to be like guards though. That would be understandable. She might be loved the world over, but there would have to be many who might want her for themselves. As she ate her breakfast, she thought about her situation. Was she just only loved, but the world still ran on it's own, or did all those people who loved her, put her in charge of everything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, she was beautiful by normal and regular standards, she hadn't earned her old cheerleading spot for no reason of course. But if people were going to love her, why not give them a truly gorgeous female physique? Why not become flawless in her beauty? On top of that...she looked at her carriers, who \"perked up\" at her gaze, she'd love to get a taste of their bodies. She was sure they'd be very very happy to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading her thoughts, the necklace...</span></div></div>",

The one she woke up in, that's how she'll remember where it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill dressed up in an elegant fashion, looking like a princess from a fairytale. No, better than one. No, better than all of them combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill had her buff carriers carry her around her massive palace. It only took about 20 hours, it was that big. And they weren't even half done. Not even a quarter done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her palace was way too big to explore all of now, she made her carriers take her to the streets. On the streets, everyone who saw her immediatley threw themselves to their feet, and worshipped her. They all loved her so much, they begged for her to do whatever she pleased with them. Jill was feeling generous, so she allowed a few good looking men to make out with her. She even allowed some good looking women to make out with her, for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jill made her way back to the palace. Jill realized a sad thought about her kingdom.

How would she do that...then she had an idea. She could go to the beginning of time and make herself GOD. Even though she had been forced to go to church as a child and sometimes enjoyed it (not enough for her to decide upon a religion, especially with recent events), she had to admit, the idea was tempting. ...Still, there was \"The Butterfly Effect\" she learned about in school.

However, the spark was coming towards HER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also getting bigger. But this is space, and Jill had the higher gravity than the spark. So it was traveling towards her. As it got closer, it seemed to grow to about her own size, and then stop. As the spark touched her, Jill glowed with a soft light for a moments, and it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure what to do. Had she just absorbed everything that was, and everything that would be in this universe? Jill just wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite that, she soon heard voices. Arguing voices coming from somewhere away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, we missed ANOTHER universe! How many is this now? Like what, over 9000 now? No wonder people don't believe in us anymore!\" said a very old looking gentleman wearing a toga. He was already frowning as he spoke, but since none of his compainions got his internet reference, he frowned even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...excuse me. Can I help you?\" said Jill, \"walking\" (a relative term, since there wasn't anything to walk on) towards the arguing group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frowning man turned towards her, \"Let me guess. You're the one who absorbed this universe, so you could do whatever you wanted, right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...well...yes actually. You see...\" Jill began, but was interupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look! She has another NECKLACE! How original! God I hate those necklaces!\" said the frowning man; though as soon as he said \"God\" all the others in the group responded with a \"Yes?\" This only made him more mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm...ok. Could I possibly get your names?\" Jill asked, trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you know us from your \"mythology.\" But since you probably don't, I'm Zeus. This is... Ares, Artemis, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena, Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hermes, Hephaestus, Poseidon, Aether, Gaia, Hemera, Nyx, Chaos, Oranos, Eros, Hebe, Hecate, Helios, Herakles, Hestia, Iris, Selene, Pan, and Nike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...the Greek Pantheon!\" Jill exclaimed, seeing all these deities in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you do recognize us then. So can we have this universe or not?\" Zeus went on.<br>\r\n\"Honey, leave the lady alone. We'll find another universe eventually.\" said Hera, placing a hand on her husband's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"I...I know. I would just want my father to be proud of me as a God.\" said Zeus, slumping his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Dear, you locked him behind adamantine doors for all eternity. You've got nothing to try and prove. Most sons can never beat their fathers at anything, yet you did it with the help of Poseidon and Hades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....hate to interupt, but umm...why don't you just create a new universe?\" Jill asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, we would. But my parents over there aren't as chipper as they used to be.\" replied Zeus, now calmed down and pointing to a very VERY old looking couple, standing next to each other. The male who was dressed in a toga much like Zeus, and the female seemed to be dressed purely in plants and things.<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I could make you one?\" Jill continued, but Zeus shook that off.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry. You would need to have absorbed at least two universes for that to happen. Or have some sort of incredible ability to go with your own power.\" said Zeus, preparing to leave Jill.<br>\r\n\"Well...I do.\" she responded, pointing to the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus' face lit up with a smile as he remembered the necklace he had recently been disgusted at. He hadn't thought of that before. So now using the combined power of her necklace, along with her new abilities as the Goddess of this universe, Jill created a new spark in a different place, a whole other plain of existance for the Grecian gods to go to. And then she told them that until they got there, she would protect it from anyone else trying to gain another universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they left, and soon after (once again, a relative term since there's no measurement of time) Jill knew they had all gotten there just fine, and were now creating a new universe for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now Jill had that same thing to do. She could make her universe as big, or as small as she wanted. How though? What should it be for? Who should be in it? Does she want a single sentient species, or many different ones? Should she want to be worshipped? Or maybe the universe should be happy and perfect? But that was also boring. Maybe she should live amongst her creations, and have her every whim satisfied by her near-fanatical worshippers? Maybe she would create her own pantheon of minor-gods, to help take some of the stress off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill managed to shrink her choices down into two major ones, since the story can only go in two directions.</span></div></div>",

This new world...it was wrong, Steven had gone crazy, people were worshipping statues, Rachel could shrink people, everything was topsy turvy! Jill felt her body fill with a torrent of emotions, fear in this new world, anger for letting it become such, frustration at everything, and dismay, when she spotted her dearest family and friends worshipping the statues of \"Lord\" Steven. It was a nausiating sight but it was so disgusting it wrenched Jill out of her fear filled state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed this new Rachel with determination. \" Your lord can go to hell! This world, you, all of it is just garbage he created with the necklace! I'll find him and fix this, save you and everyone else including him!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's eyes widened in surprise, still she spoke with no hint of particular emotion. \"You seem to be mistakingly under the impression I am not aware of this. Lord Steven created this world, we are all but copies or alterations of the original beings in the old, obsolete world. All of us...except you. For some reason, he left you as is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fresh memories of Steven suddenly changing flocked back to Jill's mind, and suddenly she knew why she was still herself. \" He kept me like this to stop him! He doesn't want this, that necklace is forcing him to do this!! It's evil!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight-like Rachel shrugged, \"It's irrelevant. Whoever's in control they are in essence God. The necklace, Lord Steven, it doesn't matter. This world is the world now, a perfect utopia without war. Where people are happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill practically roared at Rachel, pointing accusingly at the statues. \"This is happiness!? No this is slavery, communism, dictatorship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel groped her necklace again, \"Like I said, it's irrelevant.

Every muscle felt numb, the world seemed not to exist anymore, all Jill could feel was the pain. She prayed, prayed for it to end...and just as quickly as it came it went away. Jill opened her eyes in relief, only to quickly feel fear once more; before her was a boot, almost like a boot a knight would wear and more importantly...it was a boot Rachel was wearing. Eyes trailing up Jill nearly fainted at the sight of Rachel, she seemed over two hundred feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled and gave a teasing wave, \"Hello there little bug. Like the new perspective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her size Jill's reply was little more than annoying squeeks, but the fear was ever present in them. Smirking Rachel bent over, reaching a gloved hand for Jill.

The necklace bends reality! Time and Space hardly apply anymore. To you five minutes could have been five years. Jill let out a gasp as Rachel clenched her fist, with horror she saw the twelve year old girl she recognized grow older....until she had to at least be sixteen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was hardly recognizable, her originally short hair had evolved into a long wavy mane. Her small pre-teen breasts had to have become D-Cups! The armor outfit that looked kind of kind on Rachel before barely hid her voluptous chest and the skirt barely came mid thigh. The teenage face evolved from the cutesy look of a girl to a beautiful look of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel seemed to barely register it as she looked up to the sky, \"I guess Lord Steven wanted to help prove the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill gasped, \"You mean five years have passed?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now beautiful giantess shook her head, \"For me and no one else.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A dark, almost demonic laugh escaped Rachel as she brought her other hand to Jill, using her fingers to grasp the girl's shrunken arms, She held Jill like a puppet without strings, fingers clenching her arms in a pain filled grasp as Jill felt her bones creak from the pressure. Screaming in despair Jill started violently throbbing about,  desperate to escape the evil giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo further worsen matters Rachel seemed to be enjoying all of it,slowly starting to grind Jill's arms between her fingers. \"How does it feel? Knowing that your bones can be grinded to dust by a couple of mere fingers? That no matter how much you try you are naught but a speck of dirt to me, and not even worth breathing in the air Lord Steven blesses us with. A relic of the old world, deserving to simply die.\" In her anger Rachel started grinding more violently, putting more strength and force into it. Agony was a light term for what Jill felt, the back and forth motions of Rachel's bare fingers felt like someone was slowly sawing her bones away. She could literally hear the grinding of her bones withering down to dust. At least that was what it felt like, but no either by Rachel's own work or by the work of Steven that was not what was happening, in fact Jill's body was barely affected, her pain was just off the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel seemed to chuckle with pleasure, \"Looks like Lord Steven has done it yet again. With the force I'm applying your arms should be nonexistant...but they aren't. It appears milord wants you whole for your ineveitable meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's reply was barely a whisper, a plea or beg to the goddess sized girl. \"Please...Rachel...just... stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard the plea Rachel actually laughed, \"Why would I possibly do that? Lord Steven made you durable! This is barely a microbe compared to the feelings you'll seen experience. I will destroy that pathetic notion of rebellion in your meager mind. Make you realize that the air, the life, everything blessed by Lord Steven is something you aren't deserving of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove the point Jill suddenly felt it, emptiness. Her emotions seemed to vanish, the air seemed nonexistant, life seemed inexistant, even color appeared to fade away to nothingness. Jill knew what it was, Steven, even when he wasn't present Steven was showing her that he could end all she knew in an instant. As if knowing she realized this everything reverted back like Steven had undid the damage. On the virge of tears Jill whimpered, not even registering the numb sensation of her arms getting crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShockingly, again Rachel laughed! \"It appears Lord Steven has taken a keen interest in you. He never interferes in normal affairs yet he has already affected you multiple times. I'm actually jealous.\" She smirked as her lips licked her tongue teasingly, \"If I could I would just swallow my problems whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn pure contradiction Rachel opened her mouth, its open maw appearing like an enormous cavern. Each tooth was massive, capable of crushing Jill into a smear of blood with ease. \"I would if I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill never felt so powerless, she couldn't do anything...Steven had the power to bend reality, she was at best an inch tall, no one was on her side...A couple tears slid down her cheek as the realization sunk in. \"Just...take me to Steven....\" She didn't know if she merely wanted a familiar face, if she was giving up, or something else...Jill just wanted to see Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently amused Rachel chuckled, \"You don't seem near as confident as you were before. It rather takes the fun out of proper torture when there's no reaction.\" After a moment she sighed, \"Very well. I will take you to Lord Steven...but...</span></div></div>",

She shouldn't have been shocked though, Rachel listed her various means of tortures before, when one is an inch tall like Jill the possibilities were nearly endless; this kind of thing was probably natural. Mentally Jill just tried to <i> imagine </i> what being in Rachel's boot would be like, her probably rough sole squishing her beneath the oily skin of her foot....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought awakened near energy for Jill to panic further, \"Don't put me in there Rachel! It'll smell and I might get covered in some sweat! I might even swallow some of that stuff! Yuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess chuckled, \"Swallow my foot sweat? Hun, you'd be lucky to dine on my toejam. That kind of stuff would be a blessing compared to....other possibilities.\" Rachel's face for once showed signs of emotion beyond cruelty, her face was tinted red with embarassment; but she remained silent, making Jill have to draw her own conclusions, which horrified her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll still smell!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel leaned forward so her nose brushed against Jill's chest, wearing a devious smile \"Smell? That sounds kind of like an insult to me. I'll have you know my entire body smells nicer than a meadow of flowers, but by now Lord Steven's already changed it to match your...visualizations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven wouldn't do that...\" Jill sniffled, still heavily upset and crying minorly. \"He's my friend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting with disgust Rachel slapped Jill with her right index finger, \"Wake up fool! You're friend is gone! All that remains is our god,our lord, our ruler, Lord Steven. Accept that or so help me I will kill you myself and face the consequences!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was either fear or submission but Jill weakly muttered, \"I...have to accept it.\" and she went silent, nonresponsive to anything else Rachel did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiring of the mental games with no reaction Rachel sighed in disappointment, \"In my boot you go then.\"Holding Jill by one arm Rachel hovered her hand above the opening of her boot, soon unclenching her fingers and allowing Jill to plummet into the maw that was her boot. A soft thud told Rachel Jill landed and eagerly, she started sliding her barefoot back into the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill fell with horror, thinking the fall would end her life, but no, either through Fate or Steven's cruelty Jill lived relatively unharmed, and looking up with her last moments of light Jill saw Rachel's toes working their way towards her. She reacted as anyone would in the situation, she panicked and tried to run away, but being in a boot Jill was only heading towards the tip where she would probably get pinned beneath a toe where things will be at the worst. The air was stale, like something you'd breathe in deep underground, not to mention the smell....Jill never really believed that feet stunk that bad...(not that she would know) but this was unreal, the girl's nostrils were on fire! She started coughing from the stale air as Jill continued running, only to fall and trip over something. On the soft almost...sweat soaked insole Jill saw why she fell, she tripped into a toe indentation from Rachel! Jill tried to rise back up....but Rachel's foot finally was in all the way, and poor poor Jill...was stuck beneath the horrible girl's horrible big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Rachel felt Jill and just as quick she let out a hearty laugh, \"I've had insoles before runt but I think you're the best so far! Now prepare for a nice...long walk..\"</span></div></div>",

Her mind was hardly comprehending the situation in this environment, all she was aware of was the unpleasant smell and of course the pain; but Jill experienced that for only a second before a blessing occured, she passed out. Unaware of this Rachel proceeded to Lord Steven's castle, taking Jill's limp body as a form of submission and not unconciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even in her dreams Jill was not safe, horrific nightmares of her friends and family torturing her played. Each different from what she knew, each wielding some sort of....power and they used it to harm the poor girl. She wasn't even able to keep track of all the things they did to her through their own specific powers, but Jill was aware that this was much more than a dream, it was more than likely a prophecy of events to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, a couple hours or so and Jill finally reawoke, her feverish feeling and painfilled sensations were gone, she was in what appeared to be a very regal room, in someone's hand...Rachel's to be precise. All around even when half asleep Jill saw them, people...no more like Knights like Rachel, they were on each end of this large red carpet and kneeling, their faces were concealed but Jill knew she would recognize most if not all of them. The building she was in...it looked almost transfixing, intricate designs of silver and black that worked together in some majestic almost magical way, giving the sensation of a dungeon yet somehow at the same time, a loving well built castle. Almost instinctively Jill eyed the red carpet towards its end, and her eyes locked on to a dark azure throne, and she saw him, Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hardly recognizable, his teenage face had evolved into...more of an adult, and a damn near gorgeous one at that. His shortish hair was now flowing long like a womans almost. Any signs of teenage issues such as acne were nonexistant. His clothes....they looked like a modern emperors, extremely fashionable blue,black and red that made Steven almost look like a model. Most noticable of all though were Steven's eyes, they were....different...red irises with a black exterior that made him look possessed. This was Lord Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while Jill...\" He muttered with a soft if not fake smile, his voice seemed to echo like the voice of God itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill didn't know how to respond, \"Um.....hi Steven...\" All around the Knights Jill noticed stiffened like she commited a heinous crime, and Rachel who still held the girl flicked her head roughly. \"That's Lord Steven you twit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven smirked and chuckled under his breath, \"Tis all right Rachel, release her and turn her to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel did so wordlessly and once Jill was her normal size again she joined the Knights at the side in kneeling. Jill wasn't even sure how she grew, she just...blinked and next thing she knew she was gasping on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven smiled benevolently at her, \"I blocked out the painful regrowth process for you. Now Jill, I believe we have much to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill whimpered, \"...Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply came swift and precise, \"Why does the wind blow? The sun shine? The tides move? Because I want it to. In the old world Science ruled, here, I rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill felt her body rise up to its feet of her own accord, Steven was forcefully moving her. Her eyes were shut tight but she opened them a sliver and was face to face with Steven. She would've falled but Steven caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Jill.....join my Knights...I don't want to lose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just force me to join!?\" Jill spat back, obviously furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven backed away with an amused expression, \"For some reason I can't. I can't seem to affect you regardless of what I do. Like one or two of my Knights in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looked up in shock, \"There are people you can't control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was answered with a know-it-all shrug, \"Yes, for some reason a select few are immune. Like my most trusted Knight Haru.\" Steven gestured to one of the Knights closest to his throne, his hair was silver but he didn't budge a muscle. \"You may get to know him better later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill was filled with hope again, if there were people who were unaffected...maybe not all was lost. \"And..you want me to join your Knights?\" A plan was starting to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded, \"Yes.....</span></div></div>",

However, there was still some part of her that wanted to save the day, but her thoughts were getting harder to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven motioned for Jill, and the two began making out passionately, using the katana in ways never thought possible.

Like any normal day, there were no imperfections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played with her shoulder-length, perfectly cut brown hair and blinked her beautiful blue eyes. She even checked herself out, sensually running her fingers along her amazingly perfect curves and touching her Double D's which seemed like they defied gravity. She loved every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should be familiar with herself by now and not have to indulge in this, but somehow, it was like this was the first time seeing herself. It made her happy, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her little sister came and ruined everything. Rachel burst in the room and said, \"Stephanie! You have to get ready for school!\" Stephanie replied, \"Yeah, you're right, sis. Give me just a sec, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a whirlwind, Stephanie got dressed into a skimpy but still fitting school rules outfit, grabbed her backpack, brushed her perfect teeth and finished her everyday morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the necklace called her, and she found it mysteriously lying in front of her front door. She picked it up and started to walk to school, dazzled by it and fiddling with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, she said hello to everyone in the neighbourhood, helped an old lady cross the road and even played a quick game of hopscotch with some kids. Everyone loved her, and not just because she was pretty...but because she was the nicest person ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder Jill, who was also pretty but was a jerk was the second most popular at Stephanie's school, while Stephanie was the most popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Stephanie remembered her weird dream of someone named Steven...but reached school. The necklace still in her hands, she wondered if she should wear it for the day. Or maybe she should put it away in her bag for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

Even the girls were flexing their huge muscles. At first, she was just standing there, looking over the large, indoor basketball arena, in complete shock. But, when she saw how happy all her classmates were with their new, enhanced bodies, she became more confident and pleased with her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could fix everything and put everyone back to the way they were before, but everyone looks so nice\u2026 They\u2019re all so\u2026 Happy!\u201d she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned around and walked out the back door, and strolled across the schoolyard. She realized that none of the students, who were outside of the gym, were affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she approached the street, she decided to cross the street, where the middle school and the elementary school were located. The bell had just rung, and all the kids were streaming out of the main door of the building, and wandering around the playground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stephanie stopped and placed her hands on the top of the tall, chain-linked fence, she focused on a large group of boys who were wandering around the playground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what would happen if they also became muscular, just like the guys in the gym?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the boys all seemed to freeze in the place where they were standing or walking. None of them were able to move. They all looked down at their feet and wondered why they were no longer able to walk. Then, without warning, each and every one of them felt their muscles inflate rapidly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What\u2019s happening to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all shouted, as they stood there and felt their arms, chest, and legs inflate rapidly. Stephanie just grinned. It was so ironic, to see how helpless they were. These boys were becoming much stronger and bigger, but none of them could do anything about it. And, it was all because of her and the necklace. She thought it was very cool, just to watch them grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw every one of them almost burst out of their t-shirts! Then, their biceps increased to the size of melons! Their calves became huge and their shoulders widened considerably! These boys suddenly transformed into junior bodybuilders, right before her very eyes. They grew thick, washboard abdominals and powerful, thick pecs. Finally, when the growth spurts stopped, every one of them just stood there, gawking at their new, muscular bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I\u2019m strong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so heavy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie just grinned. Oh this was so much fun. She couldn\u2019t believe how easy that was, seeing four skinny boys turn into muscle men. It almost gave her the urge to find a few other kids to grow! She just had to try that one a few other guys. That was just too much fun!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stephanie looked on as she took note of the happy couple, who just happened to be walking around the park. The husband and wife were taking their younger son and daughter to go soccer practice at the field, which were just a few yards away, located at the public park. Many other couples were there with their children, so it was no surprise that they were there with their kids that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man and his wife had one son, who was seven years old, and a daughter who was four. The girl was wearing a cute dress and sneakers, so she could run around and enjoy herself on the hot, summer day. The boy was wearing his soccer uniform, which consisted of his back shorts, long red socks covering his shin guards, his cleats, and a red jersey. The man and woman were both just wearing t-shirts and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie just stared at the couple as they walked past her, with a wide grin on her face. At first, all four of them stared at her with a bit of fear and intimidation, which Stephanie didn\u2019t like at all. She sensed this, especially coming from the woman and the little girl, and that bothered her tremendously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want these nice people to be afraid of me just because I\u2019m so muscular\u2026\u201d Stephanie thought to herself. \u201cI wish that couple and their children would also become muscular, just like me\u2026 Then they wouldn\u2019t need to feel afraid of me anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that thought had gone through her mind, the necklace around her neck began to glow, and a similar glow had surrounded the couple and their children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the parents began to notice something odd in their legs. The muscles in their legs tensed up, as their calves and quads began to inflate at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d the boy wondered, as he realized that both parents had stopped walking on the way to the soccer field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, their abdominals grew until they both sported a six-pack, both the man and the woman! The tingling then traveled up to their chests and the man\u2019s pectorals inflated while the woman\u2019s breasts pushed out a little further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, their arms grew thicker as their biceps and triceps inflated with amazing muscle. Both of them, the husband and wife, just stared at each other with complete amazement, wondering where all this muscle had suddenly come from\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy! Your legs and your arms look bigger\u2026\u201d the little girl said, as she looked up to her bigger, buff father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I know, sweetheart\u2026 I have no idea what\u2019s going on\u2026\u201d the man replied, while he was still wondering what had happened to him, before he turned to his wife. \u201cHoney, are you alright? You look\u2026 different!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness! We\u2019re so\u2026 muscular!\u201d the wife replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both kids gasped, as they did double takes the minute their legs began to inflate. Especially the boy, who was a soccer player, noticed incredible gains in muscle as he looked down and saw his calves and his quads growing before his very eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler! Nathalie! Oh my gosh!\u201d the woman shouted, as she watched her children hulk out before her very eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl became like a beautiful little gymnast, as her legs became full and muscular, while her arms bulged out with young biceps and her upper body showed broad shoulders and a six-pack of abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy transformed into a young version of a professional soccer player, who almost resembled a kid with the body of a wrestler who had the legs of a runner who was about to compete in the Summer Olympics. He now sported thick, hard quads and diamond-shaped calves, which were enough to give him the power to kick any soccer ball into the goal from a great distance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace glowed once more, and the muscle couple and their buff children were no longer astonished by their sudden growth spurts. It was completely normal for them and for everyone else that this family consisted of two parents and two children who were incredibly muscular. It was as if they had always been muscular, ever since they had been born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie just smiled as she saw the young, muscular couple with their athletic kids stroll towards the soccer field. The parents headed towards the bleachers, as the two children started running towards the playing field, where they were greeted by the other kids. This gave Stephanie an idea\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was one of the nicest beaches of San Diego, and it was a hot summer day in August when the teenagers got together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was evenly split between boys and girls and they were between the ages of thirteen and seventeen years old. They all knew each other from school, plus they lived in the same neighborhood. They attended the same church as well, and their parents had gotten together and decided to treat themselves and their families to a nice long Saturday at the beach with fun, games, and barbeque.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a faint, light blue band of light approached the beach from the east. It was traveling low over the ground, at a constant speed. It was unseen to the human eye, although most people would just feel it like a cool breeze blowing past them. In reality, the blue wave was the magic, which was emitted from the necklace, and it would alter anyone who would come in contact with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twelve teens were standing on the sand volleyball court, and Liam, one of the tall, muscular teens had just served the white volleyball over the net. Julie had received the ball on the other side by bumping it high into the air, while Barbara used her fingers to set the ball up for Alec. Alec was the skinny but tall soccer player who leaped into the air, with his right arm fully extended above his head, so that he could spike the ball over the net with the palm of his hand. The ball soared over the net and bounced with great force on the other side, just touching the line!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYayyyy!\u201d Rex cheered, as he gave Liam a high-five. They had scored another point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all twelve teens felt a cool breeze passing through. Then, each and every one of them began to hulk out slowly but surely, thanks to the necklace\u2019s magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam felt his pecs tingle. As he looked down, he saw his chest inflate, and he gasped quietly as his chest slowly pushed out further. Next, his quads filled out his shorts and his shoulders widened while his biceps ballooned. When he looked down at his legs, he was astonished to see that his calves had grown into the size of melons and his quads were as wide and as thick as steel pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck\u2026?\u201d he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liam looked up, his mouth dropped wide open. All other teens on the court had experienced the same thing, even the girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only were Rex, Brian, Neill, James and Michael more muscular, but the girls had grown as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy, Cheryl, Cindy, Julie, Barbara and Karen were all admiring their bodies since each and every one of them had experienced similar growth spurts. All six teenage girls had bulging biceps, massive shoulders, thick, powerful quads, round calves, and cobblestone abdominals on their torso. When they spread out their arms, mighty lats would appear, giving them that V-taper. The girls looked as much like bodybuilders as the guys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, what happened to us? We\u2019re huge!\u201d Liam gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan!

Stephanie briefly panicked, but then she saw a flash from her neck, and suddenly felt calmer -- she hadn't made a literal wish, but the necklace had filled her brain with the knowledge needed to ace the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mr. Lombard glared at her, then took the few steps over to her desk and held his hand out.  \"You know the rules, Stephanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up from the paper where she had already started writing her first answer.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is allowed that makes noise or lights up in my classroom.  The necklace, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The necklace?\"  Stephanie's hand went to her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me ask you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie reached back and undid the clasp, removing the necklace and placing it into her teacher's outstretched palm.  He closed it and said, \"See me at the end of the day to get this back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and went back to the test as Mr. Lombard walked back to his desk in the front corner of the room.  As he sat down, he opened his \"confiscated items\" drawer, intending to unceremoniously drop the necklace in.  Something stopped him from doing that, though.  He turned the necklace  over in his hands -- it looked like it was pure metal, without any way it could have lit up.  He eventually shrugged and dismissed it as LEDs, or fiber optics, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the necklace, Daniel Lombard looked down at the still-sealed envelope on his desk, which had been delivered to the school late yesterday  -- yet another communication from his ex-wife's attorneys.  Probably she wanted more alimony.  She was already close to bleeding him dry -- even though that witch <i>knew</i> how much he made as a schoolteacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed quietly, and looked up at the classroom full of students, heads down over their desks, pens scratching on paper.  At least being a teacher had some fringe benefits for a heterosexual male in his early 40s.  The kids thought he was mean for assigning seats, but he did it so he could make sure the most attractive girls in each class were in the front row.  The kids thought he was mean for giving so many tests, but he did it because he found it so much easier to ogle when they were distracted, leaning over, trying to think.  He unconsciously licked his lips a bit looking at Stephanie in her skimpy outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso unconsciously, he had his hands up to his neck, and he was putting the necklace on, compelled by its magic.  Not accustomed to wearing jewelry, he nonetheless managed to fasten the clasp behind him.  As he dropped his arms back to his sides, his first thought involved...</span></div></div>",

He didn't have time to investigate any further as the door to the classroom flew open and in walked a woman in a long black dress and pointed cap, holding a broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up to confront her.  \"Linda, what are you doing here?  This is definitely not the time to discuss anything -- and why are you in a Halloween costume?!\"  It was his ex-wife, dressed as a witch, complete with green skin, dark makeup, and a long and stringy black wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, and it turned into a cackle.  \"Oh, this is no Halloween costume, my dear.  I thought you'd like to see the real me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's just as I've always suspected!\" he exclaimed.  With a wave toward his students, who were all looking up from their papers to watch the show, he said, \"My class is in the middle of a test.  You should have stopped by the office to get a pass.  I haven't even read the letter from your lawyers I got yesterday.  Why don't you just get on your broomstick and --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda waved at something behind Daniel.  The sound of a small explosion and several students gasping made him turn around, in time to see a miniature puff of smoke rise from the now-vacant spot on his desk where the envelope had been.  He turned back to Linda, his mouth gaping a bit.  She said, \"I'm here because I didn't want to get the lawyers involved.  I came to the realization that I'm a witch -- what do I need with alimony?\"  To make her point, she held out her free hand and a wrapped stack of bills appeared in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" said the impressed students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bills disappeared, and Linda turned her head toward the class to explain, \"Actually, it draws attention if you physically create money too often.  Better to just cast a spell on the bank computer system whenever you need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you, Linda -- or I thought I did, anyway,\" said her ex-husband.  He narrowed his eyes.  \"You must want <i>something,</i> though -- what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little fun,\" answered the witch, her black lips parted in a grin.  \"I want this class to choose how to transform you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class looked around excitedly.  Their teacher yelled, \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A minor physical transformation,\" said Linda.  \"Or maybe a major one.  Maybe a mental component, too.  Just depends on what these young men and women want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shook his head.  \"I can't believe this.  In the first place, they're taking a test --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda waved toward the rows of desks, and everyone's test papers disappeared in a puff of smoke, just as the letter had earlier.  Someone in the back of the room whooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch finally let go of her broom, leaning it against the whiteboard at the front of the room as she picked up an eraser and quickly took care of the test questions.  Picking up a dry-erase marker that matched her skin, she turned back toward the class and suggested, \"Let's brainstorm some ideas first, and then we'll vote, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stunned Daniel Lombard just stood there, wondering how he had lost control of the situation.</span></div></div>",

There were also plenty of cute prepubescent girls who looked so innocent, adorable and flawless you could squeeze them until they popped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what I think it is?\" Stephanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAI!\" The blue-haired girl yelp \"Welcome to Anime World!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Stephanie do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sheer coincidence? Maybe...maybe not. Stephanie waved back at her friends as someone passed by her...someone who really grabbed her attention. He was a handsome young man who looked extremely beautiful. Yet, he beared a striking resemblance to Benjamin.

Her forearms snapped the cuffs on her shirt and her biceps started twitching, as super strength started flowing into them.  She ripped the bonds apart as she freed her arms.  The rope still on her wrists, for now, Stephanie flexed her biceps, adding inches with each little movement until, finally, it burst through the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scraps of her school uniform hung on her Amazonian physique as a bright light enveloped the room.  When it subsided, a new Stephanie emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red leotard covered her muscular upper body.  Her breasts, now so spectacular that it would make any model jealous, looked like they could burst through any second but the material held strong.  Gold gauntlets on her wrists accentuated the power she possessed.  Gold knee-high boots covered, but couldn\u2019t hide, her bulging leg muscles and a matching sash was tied around her waist.  A short white cape, trimmed with gold, was draped across her massive shoulders and, cut out from the front of her costume, was a lightning bolt which created a \u201ccleavage window\u201d effect inspired by a certain favorite DC heroine of Steven\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie placed her fists on her hips in a classic superhero power pose as her muscles bulged and twitched.

Unfortunately, Jill was mistakenly thinking about her home from the time before she got the necklace. It was a little different now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dodging bowling ball rain, that turned into lightning and rushed back to the sky upon hitting the ground, and running across town (afraid to take the volcano bus) Jill arrived at her block. A relatively normal house stood where her house was supposed to be. She had hoped that the same old white and brown building would be there to shelter her, but compared to everything else, the new house looked safe. Jill approached the big white door, and took her key from her pocket. It clicked like usual, and Jill felt a wave of relief. She pushed the door open and jumped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a jump. She fell about 6 feet into what might as well have been a lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill thrashed around hoping not to sink into the water, but luckily it was only a few feet deep. She found the solid ground below and managed to stand up. After straining a little water from her ears, she looked around. Home had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer house looked like an underground cave. The walls were all rock, and there were a great number of holes all over the room, leading to who knows what. Jill's sudden comfort was now completely gone. She begged for something or someone familiar to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the echo from her words died out, she heard something in the water. Jill turned in fright and saw something swimming towards her under the surface. She screamed and ran for a corner. However, whatever was in the water was fast. Jill found herself trapped against the wall, she feared the worst of the creature rose from the bouncing waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Jill, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill opened her eyes and was amazed to see herself staring back from the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call me, or was it one of your sisters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill replied in a confused voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer twin below smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else? What's gotten into you? Well since everyone is here, we might as well have dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's twin turned around and Jill clearly saw that she had tentacles for legs The sight made Jill a little light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK everyone, come eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Jill heard movement in all directions. The madness had only begun. A two headed Jill was the next person to arrive, she dropped down from one of the holes in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sis!\" She waved at Jill, who didn't know which head to look out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA winged Jill with a horse head then flew across the room, she neighed at everyone, and then landed near 'mom'. She was followed by a Jill who was really two Jills joined at the waist, there were not legs, just two upper bodies. Then came the crowd, a Jill with feathers, a Jill with hooves, a Jill with wheels, a robo-Jill, a Jill who was bald, a Jill with a monkey body, a Jill 2 feet tall, a Jill with eight arms, a Jill with a 12 foot tongue and lion's legs. Just about every conceivable kind of Jill was in the room. It was a little shocking for poor real Jill, to say to least. She was still leaning back on the wall, hardly able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to come... Oh\" said the 'mom' Jill, as she began to stretch and lose her shape. Jill watched as she warped into a round ball, then began to split in two. It looked like a giant version of a cell splitting. Suddenly, the two halves fell away, and two Jills stood where there had been one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the family has a new sister!\" Said the tentacled Jill, as she held a Jill with a cat's tail and duck bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill felt like she was about to go crazy.</span></div></div>",

The two hours between falling unconscious and waking up had not even registered in Jill's mind, and she awoke to a familiar sight. The very familiar chandelier like light that hung from her room's ceiling was over head. When Jill looked to her side, she saw her very own room, walls, furniture, and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back?\" She said sitting up with enthusiastic cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice startled Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis, didn't mean to scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looked around, her own voice was speaking to her and it was coming from no where. The windows were shut, keeping the bowling ball rain and a Bill Clinton headed, mustached, T-Rex at bay. The door was closed tight, and the TV was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill turned to face the ceiling again, but still saw nothing. Then she looked the other way. There was a giant lizard on the ceiling, only it wasn't a lizard. Jill saw herself, complete with gecko limbs and a regular arm for a tail. The \"tail\" was waving at normal Jill. She was going to scream, but then said to her self \"What's the point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, ... sis?\" Jill said at her lizard counterpart, who then crawled backwards and down the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK, you scared everyone when you fell at dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today hasn't gone as I expected. It's a like a wish gone wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizard Jill now crawled down the wall and crossed the floor to Jill's bedside. This was a little creepy, but Jill did a good job hiding how she felt from her 'sister', who at the very least seemed to have a genuine concern for Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? You've never looked this upset before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill let her body fall back onto the bed, and rested a hand on her forehead above her closed eyes. She thought about Steven, and the necklace, and now regretted meddling. The new world was so unsettling, and she had no idea how she could go about fixing it without the necklace, which she just realized had disappeared some time ago. However, deep down, she also felt something being forged within her. The short time she had spent with her lizard self showed that she wasn't much different from any other person (besides the lizardness and extra arm), and in fact, Jill found her quite caring and comforting. It was almost like she could feel a sisterly bond of sorts. But she was still half lizard, and that would take getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too hard to explain. I think I just need to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizard Jill understood, and quietly backed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill began to fall into a storm of thoughts, wondering what to do. She really did miss the 'real' world, if it could be called that at this point, but she also found herself becoming more and more comfortable with the new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is so enticing about crazyland?\" Jill asked herself out loud. Just then, she was startled by a sound right outside the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill leaped form the bed and looked outside. It was still bowling-balling, so visibility was low. Everything past the bowling balls was shrouded in fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, one just hit the window?\" She turned to lay down again, but she stopped in her tracks when she saw a figure in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA person, dressed in strange black clothes was perfectly balanced on one leg, with hands together under his head. It was a ninja!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure laughed, but the outburst soon turned into a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you OK?\" Jill reached over towards the person, but he quickly threw a pair of shuriken at the ceiling, and then jumped up, using them to hang inverted form the top of the room. His speed was superhuman, and his strength must have been as well given that he had managed to get from the floor to the ceiling with just a single jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not Jill, I am your guardian-wise-senior-citizen ninja, or GWSC-n for short! I have sensed your troubled mind and have come to help you through your rough times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill and her GWSC-n spent the next few minutes just staring at each other - the ninja, using his nearly unlimited discipline and focus, Jill using her new found bewilderment and feelings of insanity.</span></div></div>",

The random flailing of her arms that accompanied every unfinished syllable didn't help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's GWSC-n merely nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith unbelievable speed and yet breeze like softness, he slid across the ceiling, then down the wall, and finally across the floor, until he stood directly in front of Jill. The tall ninja was still in the same stance, arms folded and legs tight together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are seeking something aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the dark figure's imposing stance, Jill did not feel afraid. She somehow sensed a great deal of concern in the ninja's voice, as if he understood exactly what Jill felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill softly stepped forward and put her hands on the GWSC-n's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got mad and did something I shouldn't have, and everything went wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill had much more to say, though it was clear from the ninja's masked face that enough had gotten across. The old man finally did away with his rigid stance, and placed his right hand on Jill's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Jill. I do not need to hear what was done, you've acknowledged your mistakes and are ready to fix them. As your GWSC-n, I must help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GWSC-n jumped back; grabbing the sword on his back and leaning forward, he struck a fierce pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jill! place your hand on the side of this blade. Let your desires leak into it, this cold steel shall mimic your soul and lead us to what is needed to set right that which was defiled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword was drawn so fast that to Jill, it seemed as if the ninja has teleported into his new position. A ringing echoed off the walls, the weapon's silver blade seemed to cry out, calling Jill over. With a quick flick of her wrist, she brushed some hair from her face and approached. Timidly, she raised her arm. The blade was frighteningly sharp, yet it exuded an aura of delicacy, as if made of thin glass. Jill looked at her GWSC-n once more, he only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack of thunder whipped through the room as Jill felt the sword. With every passed instant, the blade gave off more and more light, until it ceased to be physical. The crescent shaped light broke away from the hilt of the sword, and shot to the sky; the roof overhead was split open like a sheet of rock above a volcano. The beam flew higher still, and from horizon to horizon sliced through the thick clouds. In the heavens above, a magnificent symbol appeared. Manifesting itself with great radiance and a size of unimaginable magnitude, the intricately detailed figure could easily overwhelmed any who looked upon it. It began to draw itself inward and formed a great beacon which cast its light directly on the GWSC-n and Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, we will now begin our journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GWSC-n reached behind his back, and took out another object. It shined in the light, and Jill could not make out what it was. The ninja raised his arm into the rays that fell from heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRing, ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Yes, I was the one who made a giant symbol in the sky requesting the answer to all of Jill's problems. Oh, it's over there? Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja put his cell phone away and the world returned to 'normal'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever it is, it's buried at the center of the Earth. We better go get some shovels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looked at the ninja, once again confused, then back up at the sky, only it was now covered by ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a phone call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another couple minutes of awkward silence, the GWSC-n made his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for marveling at modern technology, we must go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thrust his sword into the air and jumped after it, grabbing the hilt in an odd manner. With a loud huff, he suddenly began twirling the weapon, and hovering. He had activated his ninjacopter technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jill grab on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew back down to ground level and scooped Jill up with his free arm. The two shot up into the clouds. For a moment, Jill forgot that she was in an absolutely ludicrous world. The feeling of flying freely through the sky was simply amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GWSC-n looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because there's no traffic, though I don't want it to sneak up on us. Jill, reach into my pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill did as the ninja said and pulled out a white box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box rattled as Jill shook it, she then turned it over and took off the lid. A robotic sounding voice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make a left in 600 feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That GPS has never failed me!\"</span></div></div>",

To do this, they usually perform creepy rituals and such. Some women even have the \"God\" grow in them (which kills them upon birth) because of rituals.

Pyramid Head symbolizes peoples' guilt. And kills them with a giant knife while wearing a pyramid on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do more research, but I recommend playing the games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun with this, but remember if you don't like it, just make up some random plot twist to change the direction of the story.</span></div></div>",

And filled with everything from giant TVs to hot tubs. Jill looked out a window, and saw that they were on a mountain. Inspection of the locks revealed they were trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Jill began to worry again, and even thought about using the necklace. However, the cabin then became stained in blood as a ghost took over Steven's body. The possessed Steven did not use the necklace and had a blank expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill realized something bad was going to happen. She just didn't know how bad. She felt something squirming inside her. Then growing. The pain was unbearable. She was sure was going to die, as she lay on the ground, twitching in a fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill heard a voice say, \"This is your punishment and our salvation.\" Jill screamed, \"I didn't do anything to be punished!\" The voice replied, \"In former and future lives, you have performed many sins. Also, you are taking part in a rip-off of Silent Hill, a beloved video game series. As we speak, you are mocking its horror by making it comedy. That is a crime in itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill rolled her eyes. The pain was too much. To make matters worse, someone burst into the room. Pyramid Head. He wanted the two protagonists to pay for ripping off Silent Hill. But Jill did not do enough to suffer as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyramid Head bumped Jill on the head with the non-bladed part of his knife. Jill then vomited out a fetus. And her pain stopped. Jill said, \"...Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyramid Head then grabbed her and Steven by the necks. And prepared to kill them with his grip. Weird children's voices were heard saying, \"Never copy someone else's ideas or the sin will haunt you awake or in bed...and the Bogeyman of Silent Hill will come separate your neck from the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven, still possessed wasn't scared. Jill, on the other hand was desperatley reaching for the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things got worse. The fetus morphed into Jill's vision of \"God\". Herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new \"God\" attacked Pyramid Head, dropping the protagonists to the floor. Jill pulled Steven out of the cabin, through the hole Pyramid Head made to enter. As they escaped, Pyramid Head and \"God\" fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jill was about to use the necklace, the cultists showed up. Things kept getting worse. When they showed up, they grabbed Jill as she put on the necklace. Blood began to rain down in a light drizzle, accompanied with fog as Jill wished for:</span></div></div>",

For a lot of MGS stuff, even MGS2, MGS3 and MGS4. You've been warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoxhound is a group of the elite. It has six members. They held Shadow Moses. Since they can work for a lot of people, you can have the government hire them, criminals, whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nList of members -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiquid Snake - A clone who was made from Big Boss (\"the world's greatest soldier\"), along with Solid Snake (A badass who defeated most of Foxhound by himself...sort of, FOXDIE was involved). And Solidus Snake later (who was President George Sears). Amazing fighter, pilot and tactician, had plans to put the world in perpetual war. Was leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsycho Mantis - A KGB psychic. Supposedly can read minds, but can definitley control them. And has telekinesis. And is a psycho killer. With humour. Plus, he can break the fourth wall, so use him to talk to the reader if you want. But can he see the future?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniper Wolf - A beautiful sniper. She is one of the best snipers ever. Period. Plus she carries huskies around with her. Those dogs are cute but will bite. So be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecoy Octopus - Master of disguise. Not much to say since he wasn't really in the game a lot (being dead and all...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevovler Ocelot - Master of revolvers, torture, interrogation and a manipulative jerk (though cool). Who manipulates everyone. Ocelot likes to talk to the player (or in this case, reader) in at least torture scenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulcan Raven - Shaman with a giant gatling gun. This guy enjoys the \"hunt\" so to speak. The hunting of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other fun stuff includes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFOXDIE - Inject this into someone and you can choose who'll it kill. The longer the infected is near the person who should die...the less life that person has, until they die of a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Patriots - AI's (Artificial Intelligences) that secretly run the United States of America until the end of MGS4. Seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you go. Use them how you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: Metal Gear Solid breaks the fourth wall. A lot. So don't be surprised if characters \"talk\" to you. Or know other things that don't make sense. I'm looking at you, Revolver Ocelot. If anyone has played his infamous torture scene, you know what I'm talking about. Oh, and Psycho Mantis...he knows stuff like what games you play.</span></div></div>",

Steven fell unconcious as Jill seemed worried. By reading Steven's mind, he knew where the necklace was and took it. He turned to leave...and brainwashed Jill into coming with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill walked in a stilted fashion like a puppet, along with Mantis.

Jill was resisting, but a telekinetic bump to the head, put her out cold. She was locked in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis gave Ocelot the necklace and said, \"Are you and the boss really going to use this to create eternal war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcelot replied, \"Liquid Snake wants what he can't have. With this, we could take over Foxhound. We already took over this school. Imagine what we could accomplish with nations at our control. The world. We could surpass even the Patriots.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis responded, \"La-li-lu-le-lo?\" Ocelot sighed and said, \"Damn Patriots and their stupid nanomachines. Look, Mantis, you like killing?\" Mantis nodded. Ocelot said, \"I'll let you kill more than Liquid ever did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMantis nodded happily and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcelot then woke up Jill. Jill saw Ocelot and said, \"Whatever you want, you're not getting it! Let everyone go!\" Ocelot replied, \"Feisty. I like that in a woman. But I have what I want. This necklace. And on top of that, I have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looked wide-eyed in fear and then composed herself, saying, \"What do you want with me?\" Ocelot responded, \"After much research on this necklace, it seems that one of your ancestors made it, centuries ago. The only way to use it safely is for one of your family to tell me your family motto. One of your family saying it allows me to make one wish, without any random problems. And you're that family member for now. Follow me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill responded, \"This sounds like some pointless story gone wrong.\" Ocelot replied, \"Oh the story may be pointless to the reader, but they're probably enjoying this. Aren't you?\" Jill then said, \"...Who are you talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcelot pulled a lever on the bed and Jill felt electricity surge through her. It wasn't lethal, but it hurt. And she remembered her family motto in desperation, \"Never give up.\" Kind of ironic now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcelot then said, \"For this pointless but amusing story, you get to choose dear reader. Will Jill break from the electric shocks and tell me what I want to know? Or will she take the pain, allowing something to conveniently happen and help her?\"</span></div></div>",

Why did everything have to come back to cheerleading? On top of that, Sally was quickly becoming happy, cheerful and in general, the stereotypical cheerleader. No matter how hard she thought, Steven was fading...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on the necklace, hoping it would help, not realizing it would just bring a character she thought of to life.

That thing is dangerous\" Said Steven in a low tone.<br>\r\n\"But, I think I kinda like being a girl now\" Said Sally. (By this stage, she had regained all her former memories and personality... Like any typical guy whom would somehow get stuck in this situation, she was eyeing herself)<br>\r\n\"Yea, I'm not surprised... Every guy's fantasy, and your... 'we'... are living it\" Said Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is there anything I should be worried about?\" Asked Sally.<br>\r\n\"Just the fact that everything is about to change. Literally. For the better or for the worse, I don't know. Just, flippin well be careful, I'm gonna make sure that you don't lose any of your old memories for now. I can't guarrentee the future, but, we'll see each other again\" Explained Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the most stupidest thing you've ever said, not to mention the fact that it's cliched from so many films\" Said Sally sarcastically.<br>\r\n\"Now that's the Steven we both remember\" Said Steven, and then faded into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back in what Reality has become, Sally stood up, fully in realization of what was going on. She quickly took the necklace off and stashed it in her bag. She then ran to catch up to R.J whom hadn't noticed any of the preceeding events, actually, it seemed that no one had, had the necklace done that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at school, Sally found all her friends waiting outside for her. They all beared resembelences to their former male selves (Except for the females who now looked better than they originally did, especially in their cheerleading outfits)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Sally!\" Cried out Geminia (Formally Benjamin)<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\" Asked Janet (Formally Josh)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, a little late out of the house I guess\" You laughed, trying your best to be a girl.<br>\r\n\"Well come on then! We get Cheerleading History first!\" Said Geminia, dragging you into the large cheerleading school which also oddly resembled your old school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the day, everything seemed familiar, except for a few things.<br>\r\nAll the courses revolved around cheerleading...<br>\r\nCheerleading History<br>\r\nP.E was now Advanced Cheerleading.<br>\r\nCheerleading for the business woman (Formally business studies)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a lot of others. In fact, everything revolved around this subject. Sally pondered over the power of the necklace, it seemed stronger than she had suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't know, was that it was still making adjustments for her to make her feel more comfortable in this new life. One thing that the reader must understand is that the necklace is not evil, nor is it good. But it does what it 'thinks' is what it is supposed to do. And it thought that what it was doing was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, it made Sally have a much better lifestyle. Being the billionare she was, she didn't make do with a locker. Rather, her locker (As well as the two adjacent ones) morphed into a door with her name on it (And a star below it, just for the sake of it). Behind this door was a room a bit smaller where Sally could get changed and do whatever the heck she wanted. The wardrobe was always updated with the latest fashion in cheerleading, and her pom-pom set was now took up a large trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally also, with her knowing, but not to anyone else, became considerably taller, being just over a head taller than other girls. She also became more slender and more fit. Her cheerleading outfits also changed to match her new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, the necklace considered it's job done until someone put it on. This all happened just after lunch break (In which the Council of Cheerleading Committie (COCC) had it's daily meeting) and Sally gasped as she felt herself changing. No one but her noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Sally sat in her oversized bedroom and considered two options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Put the necklace on, and make only specific things happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Put the necklace on, and let anything that can possibly happen, happen.</span></div></div>",

Ater all, she had been turned guy to girl, her school was turned into the worlds most popular girls only cheerleading school, and all her friends were now girls (The friends who were already friends got a few touch ups...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on the necklace, with a clear mind, but knowing what she wanted to.<br>\r\nFirstly, two girls appeared behind Sally. These girls were basically her personal 'maids' and did whatever she asked them to do. However, she didn't get them to look like maids usually did in the whole frilly dress thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first maid was more of a secretary type girl who wore a well ironed set of grey uniform. The other was a girl whom mostly wore leather, and from her back was Dragunov Sniper Rifle. If Sally had a problem with anyone, she 'dealt' with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccidentally though, a thought crept into her head. And it wasnt one that she was actually expecting, but before she could dismiss it, the magic of the necklace had done its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now the most popular girl in the entire world... And not just like, everyone knew her, it meant that everyone LOVED her. Even if she did an almighty great screwup (Heck, if she broke the law, she would be pardoned instantly). Practically everything that was sold had something about her on the cover like her face or something, because otherwise nothing would sell. She wouldnt be able to walk outside without diehard fans screaming for her. Heck, some people were so diehard that they had plastic surgery to look like her, (Some of them looked REALLY bad though)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls wished they were her, the guys wanted to hook up with her. And to top it off, the next day was already starting and Sally was in bed (Fully awake with the necklass around her)<br>\r\nRealising what she had done, she quickly took it off in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly thinking of two options, she put them to the positives and negatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.

Be CAREFUL around her. Her names Sylvia, and she's kinda on a mission to take you out of the picture\" He said grimly.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n\"Her necklace has the exact same power as yours, except it CANT affect anything that YOU have done with YOUR necklace\" Steven explained.<br>\r\n\"How the heck do you know that?\" Asked Sally.<br>\r\n\"Okay, looks like It's time for the explanation time. I'm a Steven from a completely alternative screwed up dimensionally challenged destroyed alternate reality. Everything there has been completely screwed up because I wasnt careful around Syliva. She's crossed dimensions about 40 times and is trying to destory each reality that has a necklace in it. I was the first to go, but before everything went insane, I managed to create a sort of private dimension that she cant enter in which all us stevens reside\" Steven explained.<br>\r\n\"And how do I fit into this?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n\"Your the last in the chain, if she knocks your reality off the existence wall, she literally gets control of time, space, and each dimension, making her the beginning of time and the end of it and she can literally do whatever the heck she wants. Like, even MORE than what the necklace can do!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me get this straight, this life actually has a plot to it? And how can she be the beginning and end of time?\" Sally asked, bemused.<br>\r\n\"Yes, as amazing as it is, it does. She can be the beginning and the end because she can exist before and after time can\" Steven said.<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Said Sally.<br>\r\n\"Look, get away from her, and go to school, find a way to stop her, but remember, whatever you bring against her, she can bring against you. All the Stevens and the Stephanies and the Steves and the Sarahs will be rooting for you!\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Asked Sally \"There are more than just Stevens?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, every decision we make makes an alternate reality in which both options are taken and... yea, whatever, look, your not the only Steven who turned into a girl, and frankly, your not the hottest looking one either sorry\" He smirked.<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Yelled Sally.<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just do what I told you to do!\" Said Steven, and he faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, reality (Or whatever it is now) spun back into focus and Sally saw Jenny walking down the stairs.<br>\r\nAfter this intermission, what did she choose to do?</span></div></div>",

Well, Sally had actually changed the whole flippin world. So, logically, Sylvia could do very little... hopefully. Sally had already formulated a cunning plan to get her away from Sylvia. She put her bag down and opened it. The necklace was sitting on top, almost yearning for her. She picked it up, put it on, and put her plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally had control of the world. So, she made everyone think that Sylvia the anti-Sally, the person who wanted Sally dead.

Just like she counters everything\" He said, unhappy.<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened?\" Sally asked. She was beginning to get used to being here.<br>\r\n\"Well, basically everyone in a 10 mile radius attacked her.

Even Sally made some physical changes to herself.<br>\r\nThey all had long brown hair. They were wearing white T-Shirts with a dark blue lining, the shirt didn't cover their belly button. They all wore white miniskirts and white shoes. They were all the same height that Sally originally was. And the final touch was that every single one of them wore a necklace identical to the one that Sally wore, except without the powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will stop her\" Said Sally.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, due to the fact that this story is based on random changes by the Necklace, thats exactly what will do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace kept going at its work, changing more and more of the world. Every single school in the world was turned into a cheerleading school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfact, every house contained at least a dozen Sally's, who all looked the same, and who all thought the same way (With the exception of the necklace) and who all did the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur Sally was amused at this change, and even kinda liked what the necklace was doing... kinda.<br>\r\nExcept heres were everything changed, not for the better, but for worse. You see, Sylvia truely wasnt expecting this, but made a plan for it. After the almighty wreckage of her own dimension, she decided to go on a sort of dominating rampage. The necklace was now a part of her, it was bonded to her, and was as easy to be taken off as it was safe to do a brain transplant. The only difference was that she could control it's power much more effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia turned herself into a copy of Sally, to blend in much better. She could still tell which Sally was the real one, to an extent, by the power eminating from the real necklace. It was only a matter of time before the 'real' Sally was found and a confrotation began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally walked down the road, still trying to get used to the fact that everyone was now her. Except, this wasnt enough... she wanted... she wanted more. So the necklace did just that, before she had time to expand her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery movie was now about cheerleading, every T.V show was related to cheerleading, every picture was about cheerleading and every magazine and book was about cheerleading. It was insane, yet, somehow, Sally liked it. She then expanded her thoughts into more of what she wanted. She wanted to be a dominating figure over the other Sally's, she wanted to be taller than them, faster than them, stronger than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace did just that. Her height increased so she was now a head taller than every single other girl on the planet. Her bust dramatically increased, not to a rediculously large amount, but certainly bigger. Her hips enlarged and her muscles became stronger. Not only that, but every single Sally on the planet looked up to her. Well, in two ways anyway, not only because she was taller, but they felt like she was their master, their leader, and they loved it to bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Sylvia eventually found Sally, and a final confrontation was about to begin.<br>\r\n\"So, what took you so long?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\nMany other Sallys gathered around to watch the scene unfold, many of them took out their identical looking phones and started taking photos to put on the internet. Sylvia reverted to her original form.<br>\r\n\"Easier than I expected\" Said Sylvia. \"Your necklace gives off energy that I can detect with mine\"<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... Thought something like that might happen. Oh, alright, what do you want?\" Asked Sally.<br>\r\n\"I want the power of this dimension. I need you for it. Specifically, your necklace\" She said, monotone.<br>\r\n\"Well, from what I have heard, you have completely crushed about 40 other dimensions... so, no. From what I have been told, your kind of a slutty jerk\" Sally said mockingly.<br>\r\nMany of the other Sally's whooped and cheered Sally at this.<br>\r\n\"You may have turned a planet against me, but dont think that will work\" Sylvia said. She lowered her head and her eyes darkened.<br>\r\n\"Yea yea yea, whatever\" Said Sally.</span></div></div>",

Having destroyed 40 dimensions, this would probably be a pushover for her.<br>\r\n\"Who says that 'I' am going to be the one who defeats you? What if 'they' defeat you?\" Asked Sally, forming her own innocent, yet evil smile.<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Asked Sylvia. She probably thought that Sally was mad. Who was 'they'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a couple billion friends of mine. Say hi to the grim reaper for me Sylvia!\" Said Sally, tilting her head back laughing maniaclly. You see, she had made preperations for this, and as she laughed, every single Sally in the world pulled a AK-47 out from behind them, pointing it at Sylvia.<br>\r\n\"These bullets have been modified to get through that petty shield of yours.

We wont\" Said Sally.<br>\r\n\"Aww heck yea! Time ta die Sylvia!\" Yelled another Sally.<br>\r\n\"You better say your prayers!\" Cried another, raising her fist in the air.<br>\r\n\"Say hi to the folks in heaven!\" Yelled yet another Sally.<br>\r\n\"You prepared for some serious OWNAGE time Sylvia?\"<br>\r\n\"Because your gonna die!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, alright, calm down, lets just quickly knock her off the living side, and return to cheerleading\" Said Sally. The girls whooped and cheered at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wont get away with this!\" Yelled Sylvia.<br>\r\n\"And why not?\" Asked Sally.<br>\r\n\"Did Steven tell you the whole story?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yea, he told me that you had some sort of lust for power and domination and to become a god and blah blah blah, you destoryed... 40...? Yea, 40 dimensions and now mine is the last in the chain before you become the ultimate god... or, something along those lines\" Sally said.<br>\r\n\"Thats not the whole story. Do you know how I bonded with my necklace?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, normally I hate pre-war speeches, but I'll let you have this one\" Said Sally, mockingly.<br>\r\n\"Just do me one thing, take yours off\" Said Sylvia.<br>\r\nThere was something about Sylvia which made Sally feel unsure about herself. She gave off the feeling that, despite being throughly evil, she fought evenly matched battles and didnt have tricks hidden up her sleeve unless they were completely obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally pulled at the Necklace.<br>\r\nIt refused to budge from her neck, in fact, it almost seemed to be part of her somehow.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Said Sally, looking down at it. \"It wont budge!\"<br>\r\n\"Thats what happened to me\" Said Sylvia.<br>\r\n\"So... what the heck do I do now?\" She yelled.<br>\r\n\"You'll learn to control it. In the mean time, lets get back to the battle, shall we?\" Asked Sylvia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right... Ummm, yea, okay\" Said Sally.<br>\r\n\"Kill me\" Said Sylvia.<br>\r\n\"You make it sound so easy\" Said Sally, mockingly.<br>\r\n\"I assure you it is easier than you think\" Said Sylvia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls took aim, and let rip at least twenty bullets from each gun. Sally was shocked at seeing Sylvia's body get mutilated and fall to the ground, as if she WANTED to die. Wait, her last words, did she mean that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls packed up their stuff, and returned to their cheerleading lives of being exactly the same as everyone else.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally returned home for a good rest, she was tired after the events that had happened during the past day or two.<br>\r\nShe flopped down onto her bed, millions of thoughts racing through her mind. Except, she hadn't quite mastered the power of the necklace yet, and it went with the best thought it could pick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything went black... again... This was becoming a familiar concept. Except, suddenly, Sally found herself in an endlessly large room with many, many computer screens on desks. There were no computer terminals, no keyboards, no mouses, no chairs, just the screen. Each one displayed the sight of someone different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this... this is werid\" Said Sally. She walked around alot of them, but didn't recognize any of the places on the screens. She looked down at one of them, it showed someone at school at cheerleading practice. Sally bent down further for a closer look and put her hand on the top of the monitor. Suddenly, everything faded in an explosion of colours, and Sally found herself in the exact position of what was on the monitor screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, she was a completely different looking girl.<br>\r\nAnd she now lived in England.<br>\r\nAnd she was right at the bottom of a cheerleading Pyramid.<br>\r\nAt the bottom center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally groaned at this, regretting what she had done, there were at least 50 people stacked on top of her and it was infuriatingly difficult to hold her position perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls! That's good!\" Yelled a cheerleader a couple of meters away. \"You can come down now!\"<br>\r\nSally gave a sigh of relief at this. Once most of the girls had either climbed off or fallen off, she stood up, rubbing her sore back.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she freaked out, and felt for the necklace. Oh, it was still there, phew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than completely reverting this sudden change of life, she went into the girls changing room to see what she had become.<br>\r\nShe certainly didn't see her usual self in the mirror. Instead, she saw a 19 year old english girl with short, light blonde hair, a slightly larger than average bust, strong arms, strong legs, and a set of hips to die for. Sally laughed at what she saw, and the girl in the mirror laughed back. Suprisingly, with a few modifications, she might actually consider making herself look like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Veronica! Get over here!\" Yelled a girl from another side of the changing room. Since there were only four other girls in here, and none of them budged, Sally assumed that her new name must be Veronica. Well, thats not a name to die for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica (Possessed by Sally) walked over to the girl who called for her.<br>\r\n\"Yea?\" She asked.<br>\r\nThe girl, who was slightly shorter with dark brown hair, threw a pile of clothes at her.<br>\r\n\"Here's your gear back, make sure you don't lose it again!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the demeaning tone of this girl, Veronica decided that she didn't exactly like being here. So, she 'depossessed' the body, and returned to her mansion in the U.S... with a few adjustments.<br>\r\nShe now phyiscally looked like Veronica, with a slightly larger bust and stronger muscles. The original Veronica now looked like a slightly less attractive Sally, but kept her own memories and personality.<br>\r\nSally, in her new form, actually liked this change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the Necklace was still not fully bonded with her, and it made another random change without her knowledge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION LINE...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sally suddenly turns etheral, and possesses whoever she touches. She can't be seen, but she can depossess anyone she wants at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. All the cheerleaders in the world start to like her too much, and begin fighting over her...</span></div></div>",

She gasped at this, not expecting such a thing to happen. Although, she immediately knew what this could do after having read about possession and stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, might as well try it out\" She said, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\nSally walked... well 'glided' down the stairs and outside. A few cheerleaders were walking by, talking about some upcoming tryouts. Sally decided that the best thing to do, was to try it out on one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glided right in front of them, just to see if they could see her. They could not. Sally stayed in front of them, looking at them and gliding backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne girl was probably about 16, she was wearing a light blue cheerleaders outfit, had a slightly smaller than average bust, dazzling blue eyes and short, well cut, black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl was probably 18. She was wearing the exact same clothes and had an average bust. She had... wait, RED eyes? WHOA! Freaky! She must wear contacts. Her hair was curly and went down to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl was a head taller than the other girls. She had a slightly larger than average bust, had brown eyes and light, short brown hair. She was probably 18 as well but could easily pass off as 20 or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering she still had the mind of a man, A.K.A, the personality traits of Steven, it was obvious who Sally would go for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not at once. If anything, she wanted to get inside the minds of all three, do some rewriting, exit, and watch the fun unfold.<br>\r\nFirst, she went for the girl who was about 16. Within seconds, she was walking alongside the other two girls. She let the girl maintain full control without her knowing, and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped as she looked upon the insides of this girls mind. She was standing in a small black, well lit room. In front of her was a computer. Sitting down at it, she got used to the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at everything that it could do. From what she could deduce, she could literally change anything about this girl, physically and mentally. The changes would take affect immediately, but everyone would not automatically assume that was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell firstly, Sally made a few changes. Firstly, tonight at 5:00 she had to turn up at Sallys house. Then she made her a little stronger in the muscles (Not a noticeable effect, but definately a change). Then, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally then moved to the next girl, the one with the freaky red eyes. She made the exact same changes and left.<br>\r\nLastly, she went to the older girl. This time, she made the changes, but stayed inside and took control. (She also made it so that this girl would happily accept being taken over, and would not have any negative thoughts to the idea)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I got to go now, sorry girls\" Sally said, in possession of the girl.<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, okay, seeya at the tryouts!\" Said the one with red eyes.<br>\r\n\"Yea, dont be late!\" Called the other, and they walked off down the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sally walked off in the opposite direction. She had some plans of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cruising around for a while, seeing stuff through a different perspective and all, Sally was home by 4:00 to prepare for the girls. At exactly 5:00, the doorbell rang and Sally, now depossessed, let them in. The older girl was... errr... unconscious... in Sallys room. She led the girls upstairs and as soon as they entered her room, Sally knocked them out.<br>\r\nThe plan was to combine them. After all, Sally had like all three, why not have  a 3-in-1?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer subject to be altered was the older girl. Firstly, she transferred the eyes from the red eyed girl onto her. Red eyes looked SO awesome. She then pulled off the hair of the other girl and put it on her subject. Sally then made her subject a new name: \"Kelly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was the combination of three girls. The rest of the girls that Sally had ripped bits off were still lying there, looking disfigured because of missing parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, the girl who had red eyes looked like she had nice hands, so she removed them and put them on Kelly. By now, the other two girls were looking more and more disfigured as Sally made a few more changes. Afterwards, she made the other two bodies dissappear, leaving Kelly and her alone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Kelly was beginning to stir, and she probably wasnt prepared for looking a little more different than usual. So, Sally repossessed her, and walked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more cheerleaders were walking along the street, and Sally, now Kelly, had two interesting ideas she wanted to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Turn them into clothing for 'Kelly' to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Turn them into mind slaves. Sally's mind is linked with them and although they will continue acting normally, she could give them orders and they would obey without hesitation.</span></div></div>",

Kelly wanted to scream when she suddenly noticed what had happened to her. All her clothes and the necklace had dissappeared, but she was NOW an item of clothing! The only reason why she couldn't scream was because she didn't exactly have a mouth. Oddly enough, she actually had a full 360 degree perspective of the world, being able to see all the way round her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued walking on, talking about all sorts of things and being oblivious to any changes. Kelly desperately wanted out, like, SERIOUSLY wanted out, but she couldn't do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly sighed. Well, she thought she gave a sigh, it wasn't exactly possible due to not having either a mouth or lungs to breathe with. She hoped that the cheerleader that was wearing her would go somewhere private, and more quiet so she could think alot easier on how to get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of mindless walking, the cheerleader wearing Kelly went off home. During the mindless walking, Kelly had come up with a few ways to get out of this mess...<br>\r\nFirstly, she wondered if she could somehow, like, 'move' the body. Was she still 'connected' to the necklace? Probably not.<br>\r\nShe tried moving an 'arm', but failed.<br>\r\nWait, what the heck? The cheerleaders right arm just randomly moved around! Kelly was suprised as this... was it her? Probably not... But, lets try it again... just in case.<br>\r\nKelly tried again, and funnily enough, it moved. The cheerleader looked at her arm. \"What the heck?\"<br>\r\nKelly suddenly had a way to get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took complete control of the girls body. Somehow, the necklace had almost created a way for her to get out of this. She actually now had full control of the girls body (While still being worn). The girl couldn't even speak, but Kelly was sure that she was panicking. All she had to make sure was that she wasn't taken off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had the cheerleader run back to 'Sally's' house. She climbed up the drain pipe into her 'own' bedroom. There was the necklace, sitting innocently on 'her' bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had the girl put the necklace on.

At this point, she wondered what to do with the cheerleader. She could just remove her from existence, but she felt like compensating her for using her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah, no chance of that. So what to do? Well, she could just keep her as a piece of clothing, making her change to whatever she needed. Now that would work. She put the clothing back on her, and went to bed, the top changing to a night gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up next morning, sunlight streamed through the window. Kelly sat up, yawned and stretched her arms. Getting out of bed, her night gown turned into a red, very skimpy cheerleading outfit that barely covered much of her, it as almost as if the top was a bra. (It wasn't, but it might as well have been that short)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly realised that her wardrobe was considerably useless now, but she went downstairs, helped herself to some toast, and went outside to cheerleading school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the house, she saw two girls walking to school as well...<br>\r\nDid the necklace interfere?</span></div></div>",

It was a bright, sunny land of rainbows, unicorns, castles, princesses, ogres, goblins, dwarfs, yeah you kinda get the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in a land of fairy tales!\" Steven gasps. \"Cool!\" Benjamin shouted. \"No, it's not!\" Jill groans and snatches the necklace \"Take us back home now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace glowed but instead of granting Jill's wish, it changes her clothing and everyone else's clothing. Everyone was now dressed as princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be kidding me...\" Steven shuddered, grabbing the edges of his new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Steven, you look good dressed as a girl!\" Benjamin laughs. \"Yeah, I agree!\" Rachel laughs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is wrong with this thing?!\" Jill groaned, now shaking the necklace around but to no avail as the necklace's glow disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're stuck here for now...\" Emily deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all we can is check out this land...\" Steven said \"Maybe a wizard around here can help us fix the necklace and get home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled!\" Benjamin yells and runs off \"Let's go exploring!\" \"Alright!\" Rachel yells, following behind. \"Ben, wait for me!\" Emily also said, rushing behind the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven and Jill just looked on. \"Um...\" Steven turned over to Jill, who simply scoffs in disgust and walks off \"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what awaits our heroes in this new land?</span></div></div>",

The only physical remnants of Jill was that some of her fur was her previous hair colour, some pieces of clothes and she maintained her large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill howled into the air and decided she was hungry.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As usual, the last girl to arrive was Erika with her twin brother Erik. Not only was she one of 3 new members on this years Varsity cheerleading team she was also new to Eastlake High School (go Tigers). They had moved into a house down the street from Jill over the Labor day weekend. Erika was a fantastic cheerleader and tumbler but Jill was chosen Captain because she was the best Senior on the team. Both kids had skipped the fifth grade because their IQ's were over 175! The Karlsen twins were still 14 year old Juniors because their birthdays wouldn't occur until several days after this year's Homecoming game. Erika was born just before midnight and Erik about a half hour later the next morning. After making the team she insisted that he be allowed to attend every practice and game. She said he was her good luck charm and considering how good she was no one complained. So Jill agreed to allow it because some of the other girls boyfriends would sometime also come by during practice. Funny thing though, Jill had never seen him watch practice. He was always reading something but wouldn't let anyone other than his sister see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now at least, Jill decides to continue being a lone wolf (or rather were-wolf). No one at school really knows anything about the twins but on several occasions Jill has overheard somebody say the reason they are so close is because they sleep together. Something that Jill would've total dismissed if something didn't seem so odd about him. Most of both teams had privately mentioned to Jill, because she was the Captain, that sometimes when they stood close to Erik they would feel a chill for no apparent reason. She had also noticed it but dismissed it as nothing important. So Jill was very  surprised that on her way out to practice from the locker-room he suddenly comes up to her and embraces her in a very tight bear hug. She starts snarling at him which he ignores. Instead he begins saying, \"Nice kitty, oh yes, your such a beautiful tiger.\" Repeating it over half a dozen times the other girls start laughing at Jill's clearly increasing discomfort over the attention he's suddenly giving her. Just before he lets go of her, he gives her a very long kiss full on the mouth that gives her chills all through her body even down to the ends of her waist length hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling Erika over to her, Jill tells her that if he does THAT again (meaning the hug and kiss) she might decide to ban him from practice. Then saying out loud without expecting an answer, \"I wonder why he did that?\" Erika replies, \"Because somehow he knew that you really needed it right now Jill and WHY have you changed your contact lens?\" Upon hearing that, Jill remembers that she didn't even have her contacts in! When she got up this morning her vision seemed perfect. Her astigmatism had disappeared. A surprising and welcome side effect from the necklace. {Jill hadn't realized it yet but her vision has improved to 20/05}. Jill just ignores it wanting to get on with practice, which that day was much quieter than usual. Jill doesn't even shower or change after practice. She wants to make sure that she leaves before Erik gets another chance to embarrass her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe at another time the reason why Jill has an appointment to donate blood will be given. She shows up and the attendant has difficulty in getting the needle into her arm. She grows angry from the pain in her arm and starts snarling (but this time it's more like a cat than wolf) at the poor Nurse called in to help. After 5 tries the needle does go in. The collection bag fills rapidly and Jill turns down the juice they offer when it's over. By now, she just wants to go home and eat. She hits the freezer eating over 20 pounds of raw venison. She can barely stand waiting for it to thaw out! Jill knows that this is all unnatural but she likes it and wishes that it doesn't change. All night, Jill has dreams of roaming the jungle. Next morning shortly after getting up, Jill drinks a gallon and a half of milk before she has her fill. She then surprises herself by purring contently while laying on her bed before dressing for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat 'Cursed' necklace has transformed Jill from a bad and growing more evil were-wolf into a good and protective tigress. The compassion and in a manner of speaking \"love\" that Erik had given her the previous day has saved Jill's soul. At least for now. She doesn't understand why she's no longer a werewolf and she will be totally stunned when the next 'new' moon rises. That will now be her new time for change. What some people would regard as a curse others only see it as a blessing. Jill STILL must decide for herself and maybe others whether or not she has been cursed or blessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing different happens at school that day other then Jill suddenly is more concerned than usual that none of HER girls get hurt doing their routines. Since she's the first one home Jill starts preparing dinner. She still can't get over eating 2 pounds of venison the previous day. She's been a life-long vegetarian like her dead mother. Jill just can't shake how wonderful that meat tasted going down, she feels like she's abandoning her mother's wishes. Over the next 4 days, Jill's sleep is very disturbed until she starts dreaming again about silently walking in that jungle. Each night it becomes more familiar as she seems to be going somewhere in particular. On the fifth day of her second change, Jill can no longer resist eating meat again. This time it's three 1/3 pound hamburgers with all the trimmings at a local burger stand. Again Jill purrs contently when she finishes. The entire varsity cheerleading team was there and they encouraged her to even try eating a fourth burger, but for now she was satisfied. The only thing she pestered them about was their diets or in some cases like thereof. Seeing her put away those burgers encouraged them that now Jill would loosen up on what they ate. Which actually did happen the next day. Out of the blue, Jill decided that as long as a girl could complete her routine unwinded she wouldn't bother them about every single pound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was Friday and another game. This time it was an away game and the school was having homecoming. A very hard fought game that had a lot of penalties and ended in a tie so the school's had to go into what turned out to be a very extended overtime. So it was well past 10 when the game finally was over. Sally Brown, the shortest member of the Varsity team, was sort of dating a boy from the other high school. Their houses were in different cities but only about a quarter mile apart. They hadn't done it yet but she had pretty much promised they would after this game. She was exhausted from cheering during the game and would have preferred going home to bed alone. He, however, charmed her into stopping over at his friends place. That boy's parents were away for the night. One thing led to another and Sally ended up getting raped by her now ex-boyfriend and two others. Since she did put up a fight they beat her so badly she was bleeding badly ending up in the intensive care ward at the hospital. She was lucky a police car found her wandering the streets trying to walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill didn't find out about the attack on Sally until Monday afternoon's practice session when one of the other team members told everyone what had happened. She heard about it late on Sunday from her older brother who worked part-time at the hospital. Jill's reaction to the news terrified the entire team and Erik started crying far more than any of the girls. Erika immediately suggested that they skip practice for the day and go over to visit Sally. Since Sally was in intensive care only Jill and Sally's best friend Martha Williamson were allowed to visit her by Sally's father. Sally's mother had collapsed at the news of her daughter's attack. While there, when no-one was near enough to hear, Jill whispers to Sally that she'll see to it that everything is taken care of. Sally weakly smiled and mouthed a thank you. That night, Jill's starts dreaming about the jungle as soon as she falls asleep. This time it's so intense and real she wakes up the next morning an hour earlier than usual exhausted and ravenous. This time she consumes all the salmon and tuna fish in the cupboard. She washes it down with nearly a gallon of milk. It was the NEW moon that day and her feline side is now at it's strongest point in her cycle. Making her just as skittish as a cat on a hot tin roof.</span></div></div>",

She doesn't recognize him and was just about to blow him off when he mentions (in a low voice so others nearby won't hear) that he knows she can transform herself into a were-wolf because the necklace had decided to do it to her. He didn't know about her again being changed by Erik's kiss. Jill can now transform all or part of herself into a beautiful full-grown Bengal tigress. Of all the species of tigers, both alive or extinct, it's coloring is the one that most closely matched Jill's real hair color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you can be sure that that statement sure got her ears to perk up. Steven then tells Jill to meet him at a secluded spot he knows on campus in a few minutes. At first, her tiger side wanted to kill him and be done with this nuisance but as she was walking over to her prey, her human side overrode that thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jill arrives, Steven immediately tells her that two of Sally's alleged rapists were murdered and torn to ribbons during the night. He tells her that he knows it's true because ever since she had run off with the necklace that had transformed her into a werewolf (and later, were-tiger), he has kept a close eye on her. The previous night after she returned home from visiting Sally, Jill jumped out of her bedroom window and silently went to all 3 boys residences. One is still alive only because he was not home when she visited his parents place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill becomes quite upset hearing this news. She's startled even more by what he next says to her. Gingerly putting his left arm around her waist while he strokes her hair, Steven whispered into her ear, \"I don't blame you one bit for what you did. I dearly adore you and would appreciate it if you would be willing to be my friend.\" Jill is speechless and perplexed about what to do or say next. After more than half a minute of silence. Steven tells Jill, \"To show how serious I am, until you really, REALLY need to do it, I don't want to have sex with you. It's more important that we become friends than two kids sharing a bed somewhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the strength in Jill's legs drains out of her as she slumps further into Steven's embrace. For several minutes Jill just lies in his arms unable to articulate anything. She snaps out of her daze when the warning bell for class rings. He quickly tells her that he'll go over to her house after school only if she agrees and she does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally a very good student Jill is totally out of it for the rest of her classes that day. She doesn't answer anything right. Jill makes dumb errors when asked questions by her teachers. A couple of times the entire class laughs at her for the foolish answer she gives. An action which doesn't endear them to her. Seeing her girls practicing after school finally wakes Jill up and that day's cheerleading practice goes off with no problems. Jill's halfway home before she remembers about Steven and wonders what other surprises he has for her.</span></div></div>",

Trying to decide whether or not to go after them, Jill starts pacing back-and-forth (just like tigers do in their zoo cages). After maybe a quarter hour Jill suddenly realizes what she has been doing and it greatly upsets her. Saying to herself, \"Oh my God, I'm ALREADY turning into a tiger.\" She then starts crying and resolves to NOT go after those boys. Nevertheless, it takes nearly ALL her willpower to resist the increasingly strident CALL of the wild filling her BODY and MIND. By the time the moon sets and her body reverts to its human form Jill is utterly exhausted. Immediately falling asleep she doesn't wake up until late that night back in her were-tiger body. A calmness now fills her mind and Jill decides that even though its after closing-time, she needs to go to the County zoo. She intends to visit the tiger compound. She does and when she sees the 2 adolescent female tigers Jill feels as though they are now are her best friends. Jumping into the compound to stay the night, Jill barely gets out the next morning before the zoo staff starts its early morning feedings. Jill stealthily leaves the zoo without being seen. Jill would surely be in a pickle if someone discovered an extra tigress in the compound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow brimming with more energy than she has ever felt in her life, Jill returns home slipping back into her upstairs bedroom with no trouble. Quickly stripping off her clothes Jill then takes a very luxurious bubble bath, running late for school she decides to skip breakfast. When Jill opened her front door to leave she's surprised to see Martha Williamson standing there crying. Asking her what's wrong Martha said, \"Sally's dead. She died just after the moon rose night before last. In this morning's paper, I read that the D.A. is charging those 3 boys with First degree Murder.\" This news greatly unsettles Jill as she also starts crying up a storm. Jill's step-mother hears the commotion and comes to the front door. Upon hearing the news she tells Martha and Jill that they can stay at Jill's house today. Jill's step-mother then calls the high school and the staff there is very understanding, considering the situation. When it's time for lunch, Jill surprises Martha and her step-mother when she insists on having a couple pounds of hamburger [RAW]. They both chalk it up to this terrible situation and nothing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after finishing her lunch, Jill realizes that she needs to visit the zoo again. It takes some convincing but her step-mother finally agrees to take the 2 girls to the zoo. As soon as they enter she takes off dragging Martha with her to the tiger compound. At the entrance a zoo employee says it's closed because the tigers have been acting very weird and aggressive all day. Jill says, \"Oh that's alright, they won't bother me.\" With a tight grip on Martha's arm Jill easily pushes past the women and enters. Upon seeing Jill, the 2 females immediately start calming down and purring like kittens. Jill then starts purring back. Martha who is totally mystified by what she has just seen asks Jill, \"Why did you come here?\" enigmatically Jill replies, \"this is something that I need to do for Sally.\" Martha then says, \"Alright Jill. Can I just step back a little bit?\" Jill says she can as long as the tigers can still see her. It's over an hour before Jill says it's time to leave so they do. On the ride home, Jill's step-mother drops Martha off at her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they get home Jill immediately goes up to her bedroom saying see needs to be alone tonight. Considering everything that happened that day, Jill's step-mother agrees. Keeping her lingerie on as she undresses Jill now tries summoning her future self. After a short while 'future Jill' appears. She then says thank you Sally. \"Future Jill\" says your welcome and how did you know. Jill says, \"when Martha told me WHEN you had died. I then started to wonder about your warning. Had I gone after those boys, would I have changed like that?\" Sally's spirit said absolutely. Jill as I was dying, \"This absolutely beautiful Bengal tigress spirit told me everything about what has recently happened to you. She is very concerned that you'll misuse the wonderful gift you've been blessed with. I'm deeply touched that you were willing to risk your immortal soul to avenge my attack, Jill. However, you must know, that I now realize what happened to me was my own fault. I should have left the high school with you and the team. The tigress spirit says it's time for me to leave you.\" So she does and Jill falls asleep quite contented. {Sally didn't tell her that the spirit is permitting her to stay and watch over Jill. She is now Jill's guardian angel whenever Jill returns to be a were-tiger. In the future, Jill will come across challenges that Sally's protection will provide choices to help her deal with those situations. Jill will stay safe only as long as she make the correct choice.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

In fact, the only major change to Jill's routine during this time, was returning home after each game and <i>\"VERY\"</i> tired she changed into her pure silk baby-doll top to sleep in. Shortly <i>after</i> falling asleep Jill, now sleepwalking, would easily sneak out of her bedroom and return to the 2 adolescent tigress eagerly awaiting her at the County zoo. She would then spend the remainder of the night playing with them. However unbeknown-est to her, when she entered their caged area, Jill's body would transform into the body of a very healthy and fertile adolescent Bengal tigress <i>(identical in every way, except for size to the one Sally saw when she died)</i>. The next morning, just before sunrise AND before she realized anything had happened, Jill reverted back to her human form and stealthily sleepwalked home unseen. Jill would then be quite annoyed that <u><b>she was so tired</b></u> when she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's now slowly assimilating many feline attributes within her still maturing human form. Growing nearly 2 inches in her <i><b>torso AND legs</b></i> while she gained 4 inches in her bust as it inflated from a healthy and perky B to a much bouncier DD in less than 2 months, was the explanation for Erika's becoming increasingly <u><b>attracted to and needing</b></u> to be near Jill as much as possible. Jill even started looking forward to when Erik would occasionally lovingly stroke her hair. The rest of the Varsity team started playfully teasing Jill about the attention the Karlsen twins were now giving her. In fact, the only worry Jill now had was with football season soon-to-be over <b>HOW</b> could she keep <i>ALL of her \"GIRLS\"</i> safe. Their after-school class schedules would be changing and there was <b><i><u>absolutely NO WAY</u></i></b> that single-handed she could keep an eye on <i>ALL of them</i> anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dedicating the remainder of the season to Sally's memory, the Eastlake High football team went on an incredible tear winning their remaining 3 games by over 35 points each and quite unexpectedly qualifying for the play-offs! After blowing away their first two opponents, Eastlake's third and final opponent turned out to be the very High School those three rapists came from. So while the game would've normally been played at their stadium, considering what had happened the last time the 2 schools met, the State's High School Athletics Board moved the divisional championship game to a 'neutral' junior college stadium over 20 miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game ended up being, by far, the most brutal and bloody game in State history. In fact, during half-time the referees managed to get an emergency conference call of the State Board of Education set up. They wanted to get permission to end the game <u><b>then and there!</b></u> Although sympathizing with the situation, no matter how many more injuries would occur they insisted that the second half HAD to be played. It was, and <u>Three MORE paramedic</u> units ended up helping carry away the carnage to several local hospitals. All the while the game was going on behind her, Jill happily grinned. Returning home nearly an hour and a half later than usual, this time Erika had followed her home. Unfortunately for Erika Jill's parents had already gone to bed so, as usual for a game night, Jill again quickly falls asleep wearing only her favorite sheer silk top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

So Erika arrived at Jill's house <u><b>just in time</b></u> to see Jill slip out of her bedroom window. Following Jill in her brother's car, Erika was stumped when she saw Jill walk into a sizable stand of trees near the Zoo's back wall. After parking her car nearby, Erika took several minutes climbing the same tree she had just seen Jill climb effortlessly. It was nearly an hour later when Erika found Jill. She missed Jill's nightly transformation into a Bengal Tigress and wouldn't have found Erika had she not noticed Erika's silk top causally tossed just inside the main Tiger compound. Fearfully looking inside she was very surprised to see that THREE tigresses were playing there. Deciding to wait there until morning, Erika called her brother filling him in on everything she had seen so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lucky that Erika woke up shortly before Jill transformed back into her human body. Seeing it occur, Erika followed Jill back to her home. Arriving there Erika grabbed Jill's shoulder in her backyard. Startled to be awakened outside her house, Jill didn't have a ready explanation for Erika. Stunned that Erika now knew that she could transform into a tigress, Jill was speechless. Especially when Erika followed Jill back into her bedroom window. With Erika pestering her with questions, it took Jill three times longer than usual to dress that morning. When she was finally finished, Jill peeked downstairs and was relieved to not see anyone there. Quietly pushing Erika towards the front door, Jill was surprised by her father appearing in the hallway just as the front door was open. Seeing Erika standing there he invited her IN for breakfast. Dismayed at her dad's offer Jill silently accepted her fate. After Jill's family finished breakfast her father insisted that Erika spend some time with Jill in her room. [Her father was concerned that her recent, unexpected and enormous growth spurt Jill seemed to be turning into a recluse].<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnsconced back in Jill's bedroom, Erika started again pumping Jill about her newly acquired ability. It didn't take Jill very long to realize the true intent of Erika's questions. <i><b>For some unknown reason, </b></i> Erika wanted to <b>also</b> become a tigress! Which was something Jill wouldn't <u> wish on her WORSE enemy</u> much less than one of her best friends. It took Jill almost the entire morning to finally convince Erika she had absolutely <b><u>NO idea how OR why</u></b> she had become changed into a were-tigress. Jill further said, \"Erika, this is a something I really don't think you would truly want if you knew all the hassles it's caused me lately. I don't even know how to change from girl to tiger or back yet\" Erika replied, \"Oh come on now Jill, do you really think that I or anyone else on the cheer-leading team wouldn't want to have the same fabulous body you have!\" Now realizing Erika's thinking, Jill's at a loss for words. They probably would've spent the whole day arguing about Jill's 'curse' except just then Erik was calling Erika looking for any more news about Jill. Knocking Erika's phone out of her hand when she mentioned who was calling her, before she talked to Erik Jill convinced Erika to not tell <u>ANYONE else</u> about her secret . So Erika left for home and Jill started nervously pacing over how she would handle Erika's questions when they next met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To make sure Erika doesn't follow her to the zoo again, Jill deliberately stayed home that night, which would've greatly disappointed the Zoo's 2 Tigresses, had the Zoo not added a couple more adolescent tigers to their compound that very same morning. The Zoo Manager's original plan had been for the 2 tigresses to only be a temporary exhibit. She was very concerned that they might not like the climate or crowds. However, with them being visited so often by Jill they had become quite settled in at the zoo. So when another pair of Bengal tigresses became available, the County's Zoo manager hadn't hesitated acquiring them as companions for her existing pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at school, Jill's so exhausted she can barely keep her eyes open. All day while she shuffles between classes Jill kept mumbling to herself, \"I must learn how to change into and out of my Tigress body whenever I want to. <i>That's all that matters now.</i>\" Arriving home with nearly 36 hours of no sleep, entering her bedroom Jill is surprised to see her jewelry box glowing. When she had returned home the first time as a were-wolf, Jill had carefully placed the necklace inside. However, when she had transformed into her feline state for the first time she completely forgot about its existence. Opening her jewelry box and picking it up, as soon as she touched it Jill instantly remembered everything about the necklace, including the person who had given it to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping before putting it around her neck, at first Jill was undecided about what to do. First off, she could call Erika and invite her to meet somewhere and then maybe show <b>HER</b> the necklace. Then again, she could go back to her old night-time routine of visiting the 2 tigresses at the zoo. But this time she would be awake and also not stay there all night playing with them. She also could find out where that boy Steven lived and thank him <u>properly</u> for his gift. After pacing back and forth for over half an hour, Jill snapped her fingers saying, \"Of course, I should have thought of doing this right away.\" Collecting her cell-phone and then putting the necklace around her neck, Jill climbs out her bedroom window (still buck naked), she leaves for the most important meeting in her life so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jill silently ran along several brick walls stopping at the Karlsen twins backyard. Focusing on using her enhanced feline sense of smell it took Jill virtually no time at all to find which bedroom Erik was in fast asleep. Quickly opening one of the windows Jill slipped in, covering his mouth with her right fore-paw. After telling him to stay quiet, and nothing about how she intends to reward him for mystically changing her into a tigress from a were-wolf, Jill pulls Erik towards the window where he sees her partially feline body in the glare of a nearby street light. Gasping at its wonderful sleekness, Erik lets Jill carry his 150-pound, 5' 7\" body through the window. Before scrambling down the tree she had climbed, Jill carefully placed a note under Erika's window sill. When Erika read it the next morning, it did not have the desired effect Jill had anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take very much prodding by Jill for Erik to go with her to the zoo. Of course, he didn't know that it was their destination until they had nearly arrived. Easily carrying him over the wall from the tree she normally used Jill dashed over to her friends. Seeing the new occupants in the compound and still wearing the necklace securely around her neck, Jill immediately transformed fully into her Bengal tigress form much to Erik's fascination. After spending several minutes introducing herself to the new neighbors, Jill casually jumped back out of the compound retaining her tigress body. Meowing to the 4 tigresses, \"He's my mate, so let me reward him in my own way first. Once I'm done with him, you gals can take turns caring for him any way you decide.\" When Erik then asked Jill what she had told them she just replied, \"It's a secret for now. One, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really took no effort on Jill's part to coax Erik to enter the tigers compound. As Jill's 'friend' he correctly figured they wouldn't attack him. Instead they approached him from all four sides, taking turns rubbing up against his legs exactly like a house cat often does. Petting them all in turns, Jill tells Erik each of their feline names and when they were born. This second piece of news Erik found a bit odd but didn't mention <i>that</i> to Jill. Seeking to quench the heat building in her loins rather than her heart, after Erik had been petting the tigresses for several minutes and not then facing in her direction, Jill pointed the necklace at Erik giving him some increased strength and musculature of an Bengal tiger. He was having so much fun with the 4 tigresses, he didn't notice the subtle transformation Jill did to him. The assembled tigresses did, loudly yipping their approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that it was getting close to midnight, Jill told Erik it was time for them to return home. Helping him out of the compound, Jill safely returned Erik to his home and several minutes later retired for the night in her own bed. The next morning Erik woke up famished. So much so that in no time flat, he ate 3 times his normal breakfast of sausages and eggs barely waiting for them to cook. Entering the breakfast area just as he finished his dishes, Erika angrily waves Jill's note under his nose. Right then and there, she would've said many choice words to Erik except their uncle was also in the kitchen making his breakfast. Erik quickly gathered together his school-books dashing off to Jill's house. He waited on her front porch for Jill to leave for school. He figured she'd be a good bodyguard from his mad sister for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily avoiding Erika all day at school, Erik anxiously waited for Jill to get out of her last class to walk home with her. He wasn't happy when she said that she had to stay for a cheerleader's practice starting shortly after school let out. His sadness evaporated when 4 girls who are without current boy-friends surrounded him on the practice floor when he arrived there with Jill. It instantly reminded him of the previous night's activities at the zoo. The fuss they were making over him really got to Erika and she almost came to blows with those girls. Yelling at the top of her lungs, \"He's my brother and none of you are allowed to touch him. You hear me!\" Quickly Erik interrupts saying, \"Well, actually Erika if they want to be my friend, I'm not going to stop them and if you do <u><b>anything</b></u> to hurt them, I'll tell our Uncle on you. Since he started raising us 6 years ago, you KNOW he's wanted me to be friendlier with girls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The previous night when Jill used the necklace to physically improve Erik's physique, she neglected to consider what could happen to his TWIN sister Erika. Since she was asleep at the time, her dreams suddenly became quite sensual and erotic waking her up. Still very groggy when she staggered to her bathroom, Erika didn't notice that she had mysteriously acquired a far more buff and flexible body. She didn't realize what had happened to her until the next morning when absolutely <i><u>ALL her bras</u></i> no longer fit her. During her struggles to put one on Erika finally noticed just how much fuller and firmer her bust had become overnight. There was now virtually no bounce when she walked, so after spending 20 minutes fighting a losing battle, Erika gave up and decided to just go to school without a bra. She was lucky a couple of her blouses were still large enough to decently cover her newly enhanced bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Erik was the only person at cheer-leader practice to notice Erika's bra-less state. Undecided about what he should say, if anything, he sat down waiting for the group to finish its practice. He still wanted to talk to Jill about their liaison from the previous night. So once Erika had finished her tirade and without even realizing what he was saying Erik shouted at her, \"I'm the lord of the manor when our Uncle is gone and from now on, <b>YOU'RE wearing a bra</b> when you leave the house.\" Everyone then looked closely at Erika <i>finally</i> noticing just how far her engorged nipples were pointing through her blouse. Looking down to see what the entire team was gasping about, Erika nearly broke into tears and immediately run home in record time. Seeing Erika's new bust, Jill puzzled over how it had occurred. Just like everyone else at school that day who had noticed its <b><u>much greater PROMINENCE.</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden assertive actions Erik had taken with his sister made him even more attractive to the team, Jill most of all. So much so, had they been alone, Jill would've tackled Erik and <b><u>not taken NO</u></b> for an answer. As it was, it took all her mental and animal strength to complete the practice that afternoon. At the end of practice when the team went to the gym lockers to shower and change, Erik left for home. He was feeling quite guilty about being cross with Erika and Erik felt some kind of apology was in order. When he opened the door Erik fell down stumbling over Erika on the floor in the front hall. Once inside their home and the door had shut she had completely broken down into tears and <i>was still crying her eyes out</i> when Erik arrived home. Seeing the state she was in shattered Erik's spirit. Not knowing what to say he kept quiet and softly embraced his sister on his left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the team had finished their showers and changed into their street clothes, Jill took the 4 girls who had earlier surrounded Erik, home with her. She knew that things were quickly spiraling out of control, and her alter-ego was the cause. When they were in front of the twins house, all 5 teens heard the terrible cater-walling coming from the house. Going to the door Jill rang the door-bell but no one answered. Leaning on it again for a second time, through the door Jill asked if there was anything she could do to help. When Erik opened the door several minutes later, the other girls pushed right through Jill. Seeing the terrible shape that Erika was now in, and shocking Erik by their boldness, they all immediately started caressing Erika. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly opened his eyes, hoping to see a normal scene, but it didn't take long for him to become disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one thing had changed, the pack of anime girls had become a pack of Stevens. They were all identical, all wearing the same outfit that Steven had been wearing before everything went awry. Then Steven remembered what he thought about to get out of the crazy situation - everything reversed. Instead of reversing his desire to make the world an anime fantasy, it reversed the types of people in the fantasy. The Earth had gone from a planet of anime girls trying to please Steven to a planet of Stevens trying to please an anime girl. Steven just fell back on the ground in his bikini; laying almost lifeless with his long hair all over his face, he stared up at the sky and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he was made a bit more uncomfortable when he became aware of the fact that he didn't possess the necklace.

They didn't look quite right, and upon inspection, anime girl Steven noticed something a bit shocking. All of the Stevens had their own necklace. The otherwise friendly smiles on their faces looked rather scary to girl Steven now. He began to back away (although it wouldn't do any good as he was surrounded in all directions by Stevens).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey me's, why don't you just put down those necklaces?\" anime girl Steven said slowly in a trembling cute voice, backing up with her arms extended and hands open. The Stevens thought she looked very cute in her blue bikini, and found her shining black hair dazzling. It was very fortunate that the Steven army was relatively quiet, anime girl Steven could speak pretty easily. However, at least one of them was bound to think of something, especially with girl Steven's words entering their otherwise dormant minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnime girl Steven suddenly felt a weight on the back of his neck, and something hanging between his breasts. He looked down and saw a necklace resting on his body, he was about to try and return the world to normal, but he noticed that it wasn't the necklace. It was just an ordinary silver necklace with a pendent. But this was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Steven army saw anime girl Steven standing in her bikini and necklace, to them she looked like she was checking her looks, which were very good. The Stevens decided that they wanted to help and began thinking of ways to do so.</span></div></div>",

I really like them?\" anime girl Steven said, making a poor attempt at sounding mildly seductive. He started walking towards the crowd, intending to get a necklace, but he suddenly tripped. On the ground, he looked back at his feet and saw that he was wearing high heels. Furthermore, he was in a mandarin gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Stop thinking about outfits!\" anime girl Steven cried out. But it was no use. Even if the Stevens around him obeyed, those farther away didn't clearly hear the command. Some began randomly thinking about good outfits for anime girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnime girl Steven found this out soon enough, before he could get up, he found himself in a Japanese school uniform. He panicked, but then noticed the Stevens behind him staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't look!\" He said sitting up and pushing down his skirt. Then his face looked totally confused. \"Why do I even care?\" He thought. \"Oh no, one of me must have thought of me acting girly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnime girl Steven stood up as fast as he could and made his way over to the nearest Steven. \"I need to get a necklace!\" He was foiled again when his outfit changed for the third time. His short skirt was replaced by a hakama and a white haori replaced his shirt. He looked just like a shrine madien, and couldn't sustain running in that guise. He began to lose his balance and stumbled off to the side, where he landed on some dirt. His formerly pristine attire was now brown and dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis instantly led to him being teleported to a new location. Thought it didn't register with him at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" He said with a slight headache. He looked around and found himself indoors. He felt a little warm, but at the same, he didn't feel the clothes that he was just wearing. Looking down, he found that his vision was distorted, by water. He was naked in a spa pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Get me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnime girl Steven got what he wanted, almost. He ended up laying on bad of some kind. Then he felt some hands on his back. He nearly jumped to the ceiling. Looking back, he saw one of the Stevens, with the rest of the army in line behind him, giving him a massage. This instantly freaked anime girl Steven out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too creepy!\" He said, but it was also lucky. The Steven giving the massage had his necklace and he was close buy. Anime girl Steven reacted quickly and managed grabbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, it's time to put all of this to an end.\"</span></div></div>",

Steven was getting tired of being transported all over the place; he knew it had happened again because he felt dizzy and he was suddenly sitting up on the ground and not in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what happened?\" He asked with a weak voice. He saw that he was in a room with a mirror. Just under the mirror was a pair of sinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the mirror rubbing his eyes, when he took a look he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in a bikini again.\" He said somewhat frustrated, in a voice that he would find cute under different circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were disrupted when he heard a bang coming from the corner of the room. He turned in fright and saw a door fly open. A very young girl, perhaps only eight years old walked in wearing a pink skirt and blouse. She was holding a yardstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are Steven! I don't know why you insist on cutting class, mine especially, but it's not happening today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Steven was totally lost. \"Huh?\" He said, without even noticing that the little girl was dragging him out of the bathroom. After a few minutes of walking the girl brought him to a classroom full of anime girls in bikinis and ordered him to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I'll be taking this necklace, it's not part of the uniform.\" The little girl jumped up, rather high, and tossed the necklace off Steven's neck. He would complain, but he was used to things going wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get it back at the end of school. If you don't cut anymore classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sat down and the class began. It was odd to say the least. The eight year old teach was rambling on about spells and whatnot, while the rest of the class, which apparently wore bikinis as uniforms took notes. Steven was merely staring at the ceiling. At least until he was tapped on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped out of his daze and looked over his bear shoulder. Past his silky long hair, he could see a note. He grabbed it and read it to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spacing out even more today? <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> ~Benjamin\" Steven instantly turned around. A girl in an orange bikini and long blond hair styled with two pony tails on each side was waving back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Benjamin?\" Steven said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled wider and replied. \"Who else sits behind you? You're really out of it today. You're lucky that you're the top magical girl in the whole school or you'd be in a lot of trouble. Are we still going to the mall later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven simply wanted to bang his head against some walls. Nothing made sense anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" He said, turning away. He'd just have to get through the very weird school and get the necklace back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How long is 'school' anyway?\" Steven thought to himself, as the class dragged on. He couldn't even see the teacher over the students and desks in front of him. The only indication that she was even there was the unceasing squeaking of her voice. After what felt like an eternity, Steven was startled by a knocking sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's it for today. You can all head to your next class.\" The teach said standing on her desk, tapping the chalkboard with the yardstick which was almost as tall as she was. Steven sagged in his seat as the other bikini clad girls began to get up and chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you outside Steven!\" Benjamin said running to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven realized that he was trapped in this world at least until (and hopefully not long after) the end of class and decided to just play along. As he was getting up to follow the rest of the class to wherever the next room was, he was stopped by the teacher, who had a bit of a worried look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, I know that you're a natural magical girl, but it isn't good for you to miss classes.\" She jumped on an adjacent desk. \"Don't be overconfident. You really do still have things to learn if you want to be a successful sorceress.\" She smiled and reached into one of her pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be a sorceress, not even a sorcerer.\" Steven thought to himself. Then he noticed the girl's hand, she was taking out the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like its important to you, but I can't let you wear it in class. Go put it in your locker, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven beamed, he might just be able to get out quicker than he thought. He was going to thank the teacher, but he realized that he didn't know her name. He glanced around the room quickly, then noticed a little plaque on the teachers desk. 'Master of summoning, Sir Bradley Armstrong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reading that, Steven had to fight an urge to laugh. \"Mr, no Sir! This elementary school kid is named Sir Armstrong!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just produced a wide grin between the happiness of getting the necklace and the little girl's name. \"Thanks Mr. Armstrong!\" He said, and with that he grabbed the necklace and ran outside. He held the necklace up and thought intensely about the familiar world that he longed for. After waiting a bit he opened his eyes and looked around. He saw the same hallway lined with lockers and doors, and a few girls in bikinis were making their way down the hall. Steven checked himself, and surely enough he was still a black haired girl in a blue bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released a silent growl and looked at the necklace. It was shiny and silver and had a long pedant with an embedded gem. It was the non magical one he got when one of the Steven clones thought it onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, where is the real one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and was about to go off somewhere to think, but the sound of bare feet running across the floor came to his ears. Steven turned around and saw the girl from before sprinting down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's Benjamin. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at Steven, she was a little confused. \"Why are you still here? Practical Skills is starting soon, you'll be late! I just forgot a book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steven could answer, Benjamin ran inside the classroom and then jumped out with a notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are!\" She looked at Steven, \"We need to go!\" and grabbed his arm. The two of them ran outside where a bunch of students were standing in front of what looked like a boot camp obstacle course. Steven was so impressed that he almost forgot how uncomfortable he was in this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin chuckled \"I can't wait to see what you do today, you're always the best to watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven had no idea what he was talking about. Benjamin began to slow down and brought Steven to a line of students which they both joined. Everyone was watching a girl on a platform with short silver hair. She seemed pretty confident. In front of her was a pile of metal. Steven merely looked on wondering what would happen. An announcement was heard over some speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erik, you can begin when ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was very similar to the one the belonged to Mr. Armstrong. \"Are all the teachers in this world eight year olds?\" Steven whispered to himself. But he soon found something more interesting to ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl on the platform burst into flames. The swirling fire spun all around her and went into the sky, finally settling as if it were some kind of outfit on her body. She put one foot forward and raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be an A! I can feel it!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showoff\" Benjamin smirked, then turned to Steven \"You'll do way better without trying to be flashy Steven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Steven was too wrapped in astonishment to converse. Erik moved her extended arm over her head, then whipped it back and forth over and over. Each time she released a glowing fire ball, one flew in every direction. Steven assumed that the metal in front of her was the target, but none of the fireballs came anywhere close to hitting them. They just went off into clouds above. However, a couple of seconds later, the fireballs returned, streaking down from the sky at extreme speed. The ground exploded when they struck. Steven began to scream when he saw a wall of fire rushing towards him, and put his hands over his face, but at the last minute he noticed that the fire stopped in front of him. Looking up and down the field, the fire stopped at a line marked on the ground. It was contained by an invisible barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant the fire storm vanished and Steven looked past the barrier. The metal was gone, replaced by a pool of lava. The silver haired girl bowed as the flames on her body leaped into the sky and faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure even you were impressed, Steven.\" She shouted from the platform. Steven hardly noticed. The world was crazier than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother announcement came up. \"Result - 93.7% destruction. Native score peak: 5000 Kelvin. Grade: A-. Next sorceress, Steven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you get to make her eat her words huh?\" Benjamin said, patting his friend on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith many eyes on him, Steven  crept over to the platform. He was a little confused. \"What am I supposed to do? I don't even know what is going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik playfully stuck out her tongue at Steven as he passed by. \"A-, hear that? And I was holding back a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a ladder at the back of platform, Steven climbed. At the top he felt a little chilly in his bikini. The wind was picking up. Downrange, he saw a giant stone wall. The field had been magically repaired and readied for Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have to break that. With my, um, magic?\" He said scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, you can begin when ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just stood still, frozen. He had no idea what to do. He looked back down at the crowd of students watching him. Erik stood out with her silver hair, she made a yawning motion with her hand. Benjamin and a few other girls were making little waves and cheers. Steven decided to just copy Erik and hope for the best. He put his arm out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't steal my pose just because you think it's cool!\" Erik shouted from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven closed his eyes. He began to concentrate. Thoughts about fire filled his mind. He pretended that he was holding fire in his hands. He was so focused, he almost thought that there wan actually a fire ball in his hand, but when he peeked, there was nothing. He dropped his arms to his sides and his shoulders drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blah, I look like a fool! Feh.\" Steven waved his arm in from of him and turned to go back down the ladder. But he began to lose his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this fog?\" He began to slow down, his vision just became more and more obscure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, everything is going white!\" He stumbled around the platform feeling around for something to grab. \"I can't see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he spun around to face the wall. At that moment and indescribably large bolt of light erupted from where he stood. The white-blue beam was so huge, it seemed to fill the barrier that Steven stood in, rather than fly down range. No one could see inside the barrier. There was just a huge glowing cube in the middle of the field. It was continually getting brighter and also distorting. Steven was actually breaking the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven stop at once!\" The announcer said, but Steven was too scared to hear anything. Some of the girls on the sidelines began to run, Erik among them. As the cube began to grow more wild, a ten year old girl jumped out of no where, and summoned lightning storm over the field. The bolts of lightning pierced the cube, and it quickly shrank back into order. As it faded, Steven came into view. He was in a trance looking down at the field that he just destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. It. Works like. That.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten year old jumped up to platform in a single leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, you're not usually one to show off. I thought you lost control for a second. Being sloppy will lower your grade though.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just looked back. \"No, not me.\" When the girl went away he added \"the one who doesn't understand magic. How did I get trapped is some strange anime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin was laughing below \"Hahaha, you sent Erik running!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Result - 84.6% destruction. Native score peak: 10^16 Joules per cubic meter. Grade: B. Next sorceress, Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven climbed down from the ladder and met Benjamin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had a camera to record Erik screaming! Can you do that next time?\" He said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked back, still a little dazed. \"I think it was a fluke, but I'll try.\" He then thought to himself \"Well that was fun, but I need that necklace, I wonder if magical items are common in this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went off.</span></div></div>",

We took plenty of history last year. But OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven lugged the book over to the front desk where he was greeted with a smile by a librarian. Steven could tell that she was a student and not an \"adult\" because she was also a teenager. He hoped that aging was explained in the book somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I see you've picked out a nice travel sized book!\" The librarian said laughing while Steven struggled to lift it up to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just found this particular book interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian stamped the book, and Steven began to lug it off the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dragged it all the way back to Benjamin and signaled that he was ready to go, but Benjamin found it odd that Steven was going to carry that huge book around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you carrying that huge thing around Steven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I didn't think about that when I checked it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant, why don't you just store it?\" Benjamin pointed to another librarian who was putting away books that were on a cart. Instead of actually putting them on shelves or anything, she just put one hand on the top and the other on the bottom of each book, and they vanished. Steven still wasn't sure about magic, but he didn't want to stick out in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, silly me.\" With that he rested the edge of the book on a table. He took his hands and sandwiched the book, and thought about it just disappearing. He didn't know if he was doing it right at all, and he was afraid that he might destroy the book and get in trouble. Fortunately, it seemed to harmlessly poof off. Benjamin didn't say anything about it, so Steven figured he did it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, where are we heading now? Why not the mall since we're already together?\" Benjamin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven thought to himself, \"I don't know how long I'm going to be here, might as well try and fit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Ben!\" He said, in a tone more girly than he expected. The two of them left the school and set out for the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exited the school through the main doors, which were quite large. Steven was impressed with how polished they were, they were almost like two giant bars of silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, these are crazy doors!\" Steven noticed Benjamin looking at him strangely. \"I mean, they just look impressive today for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin smiled and patted Steven on the head. \"I think you've been in class to long Steven!\" She then pushed open the doors, revealing a surprisingly normal looking world. The stairs from the school lead down to a wide street lined with modestly tall buildings and shops. The sky was rough and gray, the rain clouds hanging above were bound to let loose soon, but they were still thin enough to let day light shine through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was almost surprised to see something so normal, he was also grateful for it, it would make things easier if he was stuck here for long. Benjamin, who was leading, noticed Steven's more cheerful expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Being out is already making you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven smiled back, but his brief moment of carefree wandering was quickly broken. It all began with an innocent rain drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Was that rain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin turned toward the sky. \"The clouds do seem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was not rain, not water. Steven caught a drop in his palm. The pellets diving from the clouds were some form of liquid steel, a shapeless mass of restless silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan! She's back again.\" Benjamin jumped away from Steven; as she drifted over the ground, contrails spiraled off her body in vortexes. A powerful gust of wind pushed Steven back. When it weakened and he was able to put his hands down from his face, he saw another girl in front of a transformed Benjamin. Her hand was gliding through her long green hair and her face showed only a mischievous smile as she hovered down onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Steven. I'm not feeling very talkative today, why don't you and your friend sit still for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sighed and bit his lip \"Why couldn't the necklace have made it a love story?\" He got ready to fight, though he still didn't really know how. He concentrated like when he was on the platform at the school, but something distracted him. There was something on his hand, he looked down and saw the metallic glob wrapping around his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was half encased in the pellet before he even knew what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you're really going to listen to my request?\" Alan said laughing in her purple bikini. Benjamin sliced the air with her hand, sending a mini tornado towards Alan. She needed to cover herself to rescue Steven. While Alan avoided the wind, Benjamin quickly turned to face Steven. Wings of air jumped from her back, and coiled over to shred the metallic case growing around her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't loose focus now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just nodded. The tense situation made it more difficult, be he was still able to summon his power.Light radiated all around him, and he became distinctly aware of the sunlight in the atmosphere. It felt good and he couldn't help but think it was a little exciting to be able to do such a thing. He put his hand out, and sent a beam of light speeding towards Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe summoned a horde of metallic spheres, some of which absorbed the attack, the others came after Steven. He was quick to run, as fighting wasn't his strong suit. He couldn't keep it up though, the spheres came after him faster than he could possibly move. Again he relied upon his apparent control of light, a good number of the sphere was swatted by his quick beams, but there was an overwhelming number still closing. Steven became scared and put more force into his attacks, suddenly, beams started to shoot from the sky, and any lights that happened to be on near by. The spheres were completely destroyed. He stopped running and looked back to find Benjamin or his attacker, he didn't see anything until he heard his name called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to see Benjamin dueling with Alan on the rooftops, wind against a flow of metallic liquid. Both fighters were keeping relatively still, launching great attacks at each while trying to deflect those head lunched on them. Steven took careful aim at the girl in purple, and was just about to fire a shot when he heard something behind him. He released the photons gathering in his hands and turned to look behind him. A rail of fire roared by like a red dragon. It was Erik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Steven? Need help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was obviously showing off, but Steven was glad to have any back up he could get. Alan didn't notice Erik's entrance until the fire was right on top of her. She had been preoccupied with Benjamin's wind attacks. When the heat and light became to great to ignore, she turned and saw the trail of fire streaking toward her. She tried to deflect the wind into the fire and escape, but Benjamin sent another whirlwind crashing down. Alan was hit, and fell to ground. Benjamin dived after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't win against these numbers.\" Alan whispered to herself. She tossed a wave of spheres at Benjamin and the others, there were so many that the three could hardly see two feet in front of them. It only lasted a few seconds, when it stopped, Alan was gone. Benjamin sealed her powers and sighed. \"They always pick the worst time. I don't know why all the cities just can't get along.\" Steven took it to mean that Alan was from another city, and that each city's sorceresses battled those from other cities. He made note to look it up in the book later on. As everything was winding down, Erik walked over smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like this place is helpless without me.\" She faced Steven in particular and playfully pointed her finger at him. \" I saw you running Steven, you won't be top in the school for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a rest Erik, she's just not as arrogant as you, who never knows when to run for her own good,\" Benjamin leaned over to Steven \"but you did seem a little shaky out there. You OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just smiled and assured Benjamin that everything was fine. If he tried explaing, Benjamin would probably think the real world was as crazy as Steven found the world that he was stuck in. He was probably the only person on Earth who knew what a boy was. He then noticed that he was a little tired from the fighting, while Benjamin didn't look worn out at all. He still tried asking, a little eager to settle down and find a chance to read more of the book or look for the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Benjamin, are you still up for going to the mall?\"</span></div></div>",

Steven turned and saw her as she twirled a little ball of fire in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She said with a slightly arrogant smile. \"I may have just saved the day, but I can't spend all my time hanging around my fans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven actually found the attempted insult quite relevant. Although he was supposedly a powerful magic girl, he didn't really know how to use his power yet, and random fights seemed to be fairly common in the world he was now in. With Benjamin gone, Steven thought that he might get into trouble if another fighter came looking for him. However he could try to convince Erik to tag along with him. If she went, he'd at least be able to run away from trouble as Erik would probably dive head first into a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven summoned all the acting talent he had (almost none) and tried to look worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Erik, I actually need help with something.

Steven was almost ready to turn and leave when she finally decided to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik crossed her arms and looked away, \"Fine, but it had better not be a waste of time.\"</span></div></div>",

The mall was Benjamin's idea, since she had left, Steven could try to go someplace where he was more likely to find the whereabouts of the necklace. But what place would that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do have the book. I guess I'll just go to the mall and read it there while we look around.\" Steven mumbled to himself. He then felt a strong tug on the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his head and turned around to see Erik pulling on his long strands of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going anywhere?\" She said in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandably, Steven felt like giving her hair a tug, but now was not the time for a cat fight. He hid his anger with a quick laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly me, day dreaming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm ready to go, but\" Steven twiddled his thumbs behind his back, hoping Erik would not get mad \"I lost my bearing during the fight just now. Where is the mall again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was glad that Erik only sighed. She then walked past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that you were this hopeless on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Erik's saying that, Steven thought he heard a quiet giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two set off, but Erik quickly became distracted. As soon as they had rounded the corner of the block, she found a little street vendor selling all kinds of things, in particular, Erik liked the jewelry hanging down from the top of the little stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, let me see if there is anything good over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven tilted his head \"I'm glad I didn't get a girl's mind with this body.\" He decided to just stand in front of the stand and watch Erik try things on. However, he was soon approached by what appeared to be the shop owner; an old woman in a something like a robe came over from behind the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, why don't you take a look? You are very pretty, some jewelry would suit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was aghast at being called 'pretty', but then he noticed something strange. He was talking to an old woman. Yet all the 'adults' he had seen so far had been kids. He became curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, but I'm not a jewelry kind of gu- girl. But, you have a nice stand, have you been doing this for long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman politely chuckled \"Oh yes, I collect and restore lots of old or valuable items. I have for a few years now, quite a few years. It's my hobby, and I make enough to live off of it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven began to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any really special things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, one can find many wondrous things in this world if they look hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's face lit up, \"Maybe she's a witch or something, and can find magic\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds interesting! What kind of things have you found?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled again and reached into her robes, taking out a small box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my favorite, I keep it to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the box and pulled out a dazzling necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven practically fell over, what he was searching for had come right to him. Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame that whatever pendent hung from it has broken, but the remainder is quite nice. It's very well made, I think once I decide on a good jewel, I will use it as a new pendent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the false necklace from when Steven first became an anime girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate that necklace more than the magic one now.\" Steven mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, it's really nice.\" With that, Steven walked away and sat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Erik had decided on what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopkeeper! This necklace looks go good, how much is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only 12 bumbgurkrings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven, who overhead part of the conversion, wondered if they had started speaking another language. \"Is that what they call the money here?\" He said depressed before almost getting knocked over by an overly excited Erik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Steven, don't I look great in this?\" She said shaking Steven by the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you'd look even better if my head wasn't being pushed around into to places at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik jumped back and posed, Steven decided to just humor her, after all, he couldn't afford to be alone, or worse - attacked by Erik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it looks abso...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven knew that necklace. It was THE necklace. Seeing it gave him shivers, and the fact that it was on someone else, who seemed rather impulsive, had him shaking in his bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeah, it does look great. I'm actually jealous, can I wear it? PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik's playful cheeriness was dropped, her haughtiness returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I don't think it will fit your figure, not everyone looks like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven began to think about jumping her for it. If he could just snatch it and change the world, he wouldn't have to worry about being pummeled. But Erik was apparently really excited about the necklace and wouldn't sit still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know there is something about this necklace. It feels so good to just wear it. I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Do not think! Anything but that!\" Steven yelled as he waved his arms at Erik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Steven? That doesn't make any sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven would tell her that the necklace had magical powers, but he feared what Erik would do with such abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, how about we just go to the mall, which is normal. Yeah, let's do normal stuff that fills out mind with normalness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik was no longer enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're acting too weird, I think it's time for...\"</span></div></div>",

He knew the best way to fix this was getting everybody back to normal and going back to his old body, but suddenly he thought if that really was the best choice. Since he was no longer the girls' objective, he could go anywhere he wanted and even take his time to fix things, though his train of thought was cut short by being dropped into the floor by the other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go ahead\" The girl replied, still angry at Steven for not helping<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven figured out that the best choice was to help the poor girl in her only dream, and somehow he even pitied her for just wanting to love Steven. He knew this was illogical since every girl in the world was under a curse (or were they? Maybe the necklace just made them in love with anyone of the opposite sex, and since Steven was the last man in the world, all the girls rushed for him) but that didn't changed the fact that he felt bad for this girl. Not all girls in the world, but this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing girls out of the way, Steven finally found him (er... her) self under his previous body, much to the girl's joy, who seemed lost in thought. Steven wondered why until he realized the girl had no powers of her own and, to reach Steven's body, she needed to get high. Really high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throw me to Steven and i'll get him down\" The girl ordered Steven <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven pondered for a second if that was really a good idea, considering he didn't had enough strength (as seen before) and as anything could happen if any of the flying girls tried to retaliate against the incoming challenger. He seemed to be taking too long in thinking, however, since suddenly he was flying in the air towards his old body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you do it\" Steven heard from behind as the girl probably thought Steven didn't trusted her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, now a flying projectile towards his old body soon discovered the girl he'd allied with wasn't the best of shooters, as his body was flying not towards his old body, but to an already-broken window right behind him. Basically, the girl had aimed too high (or perhaps the flying girls just flied downwards a bit) and he ended up making a semicircle-like trajectory which would ultimately lead him to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven quickly remembered he was in an high floor, and felt scared for whatever harm could the fall cause. Hurriedly, he tried to make a wish to avoid dieing at the fall, but what did he wished for?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Astro is able to fly with rocket boosters in his legs, he has lights in his eyes and he has x-ray vision as well, along with his super-strength and super-speed. Even though the robot is small, he is almost human in many ways. Lastly, he can fire laser beams from his fingers and he even has machine guns in his butt. (This is not a movie spoiler!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Steve and Rachel come out of the movie, they walk past the large display window, where they spot the large, movie poster for the Astroboy movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Astro's so cool! He can do it all!\" Steve cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sees how Steve was totally impressed by the character from the movie. Feeling the necklace around her neck, she longed for a mighty, heroic character like Astro in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh... I wish you were Astro.... and you had all his powers and abilities...\" Rachel sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Oh... Hey!\" Steve gasped, as he began to feel funny. His body started to change into steel, starting from his feet and working its way up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs grew thicker as his skin became thick, hard metal. Inside, muscles, veins, blood and bones quickly converted to wires, metal, plastic, electronics, and engines. A power source replaced his heart, and an electrical system replaced his nerves. A computer replaces his brain, and his memory was suddenly enhanced. Hie sensed increased and his strength increased thousand-fold. Rocket-boosters were installed in his legs and his feet became retractable. His hair became pointy with the spike on top, which was Astro's trademark. Within moments, Steve had morphed into Astroboy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! This is great!\" he cheered, as he blasted off and flew through the wide aisles of the mall, thanks to his rocket-legs. After soaring around the mall twice, he zoomed back to where Rachel was, and took her outside, carrying her with his powerful, metal arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to, sis?\"</span></div></div>",

In fact, women and girls all around Steven were growing animal ears and tails (and some got wings in lieu of ears, and those that got cow ears and tails were also growing udders between their legs in front of their vaginas). \"What's going on?\" Steven wondered in his head. \"I wanted to make the world anime people, and for moment I thought about my sister and what she'd do with the necklace... and this zoo!!\" He looks to Jill, and saw she had donkey ears and a donkey tail, and on said tail (which was threaded out a tail hole in her miniskirt, so she wasn't giving accidental pantyshots to passerby's, although some other girls now dressed like schoolgirls didn't have tail holes in their skirts, and were showing everyone their undies, and didn't care!!) was a green bow that matched her green skirt and necktie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, he saw that men didn't have animal features, but had hair ranging from plain to outright outrageous, some dragging the ground!! Girls however, were all now kemonomimi, and while almost two-thirds of them didn't experience a change in clothes like Jill did, the ones that did change clothes had clothes ranging from modest modern wear to school uniforms (both realistic and provocative) to just outright skimpy, nearly non-existent sci-fi and fantasy garb and armor. A centaur girl in a school uniform just like Jill's, including a bow on her tail matching her tie and skirt, came up. A boy, about 7, was on her horse back, riding her. For some reason, she had a swim cap on her head, hiding her white hair. Jill turned to her and said, \"Hey Rita!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name Rita ran through Steven's mind, before he remembered her. She was Jill's smart but sometimes absent-minded best female friend, and the captain of the school's swim team. \"Swim cap.\" Jill says, pantomiming the removing of said cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita giggles a bit and grabs the cap, unloading luscious white hair that would tickle the back of her horse half if not for her skirt being in the way. It was a mess, having been in her cap for so long, suffering from 'hat hair.' \"I keep forgetting to take this thing off when I think I'm late...\" Rita throws the cap in her book bag and continues, \"Well, I'm here carrying my little brother Archibald to the zoo since my dad is stuck at work at the animation studio and my mom is off fighting alien wizards on Sirius, and they did promise him he could go to the zoo today... So, what are you guys doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven blinked in disbelief. Not only did he make everyone anime people, and accidentally made females into animal-eared lasses, but now people seem to do \"anime stuff.\" This was reinforced when a mugger tried to steal a foxgirl businesswomen's purse, and she turned around, pinned it to thin air, and blew him up to kingdom come with a Giga Drill Break, and got her purse back in the process. Nobody saw this as unusual except for Steven. \"I guess Rachel got her way, and now there are anime superpowers too. Her head will explode.\" He thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, \" Jill asks Rita and her brother, \"you want to hang out with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!!\" Rita glows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there goes our date...\" Steve thought, dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>What comes next?</i></div></span></div></div>",

Her breasts ballooned to DD's (the same as The Vindictive Vixen's) and her butt became firmer and bigger, to emphasize her insane curves. Her hands became encased in black gloves, as black high heel boots encased her feet. The heeled boots had metal spikes coming out of the bottom, and small fingernail metal spikes extended from, well...her fingernails. A whip then magically appeared in her hands. A spiked whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhuman powers of having every physical aspect enhanced to 10,000 times more than the human potential was a nice bonus, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven\" was officially \"The Spiked Seductress\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Tony, he also gained a skintight outfit, this one black. Also, he became a sexy woman, also with DD's. Her butt also grew bigger as her curves became inhuman. The head magically grew sexy red hair that flowed down to her knees as well.

This way, people would know who was in charge of the town. Their powers were more than enough to get the job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked all the way to the bank, making sure their butts wagged back and forth and that they touched themselves in sexually suggestive ways the whole way. Naturally, the public looked and drooled, and it is unknown if The Vindictive Vixen's abilities made everyone fall in love with the three or they were just that hot. Whenever someone tried to ask them out, they just beat them up with ease and tossed them aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they were at the bank. At the bank, one of Jill's fellow cheerleaders was there making a deposit. The cheerleader looked at the three and right away, fell in love. However, she snapped out her trance long enough to look at The Vindictive Vixen and say, \"Jill...is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis enraged The Vindictive Vixen, being called her name from when she was just a pathetic human. She then made the lust her former friend felt into pure fear. The cheerleader cowered in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbing the bank was child's play. The Vindictive Vixen used her abilities of fear and lust to keep everyone occupied, the Birdish Beauty flew around the bank and used her weather controlling abilities to keep the police busy.

The Vindictive Vixen called for the Birdish Beauty, and the three bathed in the money.

Suddenly turning into an Ichigo Kurosaki lookalike was one thing, but he could tell it was much more than a mere costume.  He could feel the high levels of spiritual power flowing through him, and the large sword on his back reflected a bit of the room's light across its edge, proving the circumstances before him to be true.  What didn't help this however was his sister, who was hugging his leg, red faced and  smiling as she squealed with delight, prompting Benjamin to ask what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...call you back man.  Something just came up.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure Steven, but why does your voice sound-\"<br>\r\nAnd before another word was said, he hung up the phone, and looked at his sister, and sighs. He manages to pry her off his leg with a great deal of effort, and following this, Rachel begins to run around in a rather hyper state.<br>\r\n\"ICHIGO IS HERE! HE'S HERE! VISITING ME! EEEEEEEEEE!!\"  <br>\r\nSteven, or rather, Ichigo, takes a breath and exhales, and looks down to the ground.  He was still rather confused about all this, until he saw the necklace from before, still bound around his neck. He blinks, and begins to connect the dots a bit...the necklace he found, he did feel it was rather special...is this what it could do? What else could be done with it? Before he could ponder further, his sister comes up to him, and begins to speak a mile a minute. With this, Ichigo stomps his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, slow down a bit.  Calm down, and ask whatever you want, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay...okay....\"  She takes a breath, before looking up at the Ichigo that stands before her, and asking \"How did you get here? And where did you come from? And...where's my brother, now that I think about it?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" He pauses, searching his mind desperately for anything he could remember about the anime, searching for any excuse he could find to explain everything that just happened, without bringing the necklace into it, because he knew it would be a bad idea to tell Rachel about that.  And after a minute, it comes to him.<br>\r\n\"...I was always a Soul Reaper, from Soul Society. Not only that, but...I am still your brother! Yeah, my normal body...it's just a Gigai.  Sure, they don't look alike, but...that just helps disguise me, you know?\"  <br>\r\nAt this point, he was just praying for her to buy the story, just so he could just go to his room and sort this out, but then she wasn't done with her questions.<br>\r\n\"What about the anime? Why are you named Ichigo there? And where are your friends?\"<br>\r\n\"They're...chilling in Japan, in their Gigai.  And in Soul Society too...the anime is just us making money off our adventures, really...heck, the only reason I'm here is because of the Hollow threat rising here.\"<br>\r\nHe begins to leave the room, hoping that was enough, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...if all that's true...then make me a Soul Reaper, big bro! I wanna help with the hollow stuff! Please please please???\"<br>\r\nShe looks at him, eyes wide and demanding, as he walks up to her and shakes his head.<br>\r\n\"I don't know how, Rachel...hell, I don't know if that's even possible...\"<br>\r\n\"Rukia made you <i>you</i> a soul reaper by sharing some energy with you, and with me seeing you and all, I <i>have</i> to have some spiritual power! So come on, pleeeeaaaaasssssseeee?\"<br>\r\nHe lets out a reluctant sigh, and puts his hand on Rachel's head, with her squealing in delight.<br>\r\n<i>\"What's the worst that can happen with this, anyways?\"</i> <br>\r\nAs he begins to imagine his spiritual energy flowing into her, his necklace begins to faintly glow, as his sister's mortal body quickly falls to the ground and a flash of light envelops the room.  His sister now stands in the room, wearing the iconic black kimono, holding a shining, yet small katana in her hands, as she excitedly quivers with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"OH...MY...GOD...I'M A SOUL REAPER!!!\"<br>\r\nAnd with that shout of joy, she hastily makes her dashing exit out the nearest window, running and jumping with grace and style as she leaves her brother to clean up the mess of both her mortal body, and the mischief the necklace has caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should the story go next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Crescent-shaped scars were protruding all around their bodies. They looked on at their surroundings with intimidating scowls and their smarmy grins also didn't help matters much either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, boys\" one of them said \"The great boss wants one of the prisoners to meet him in the banquet halls so let's make this quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget that, I want to snuggle up with one of those cute girls!\" another one said, wrapping his arms around myself as hearts in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the boss we're talking about, holmes\" yet another one replied \"We'll get our fair share in due time...don't screw anything up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this 'boss' they're speaking of?\" Rachel thinks, overhearing the conversation \"Is he the one who brought me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the henchmen began walking through the prison hallways. There were at least fifty cells, each containing at least two or three teenage girls other than Rachel's cell, which was only beginning to be filled up. The scared young ladies dared to hide themselves in the darkness that their cold, unassuming prisons provided but they could be still seen from outside, their faces displaying true and unfathomable terror as the sinister henchmen pass each cell, grinning evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho were they attempting to get?</span></div></div>",

Shouldn\u2019t I come and get you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel grit her teeth.  \u201cNo!  Just make me really strong.  Or think of one of your comic book heroes.

Even if this works, you don\u2019t know anything about who kidnapped you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rachel fought back tears, she tried to remain brave.  \u201cI will.  Now please do something before they come and get us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven tugged at the necklace.  He would do anything to help his sister.

But this was not Ganon or Ganondorf as most people knew him by. No, this was none other than the Ganon of the terrible Phillips CD-i games, and the only equally bad thing to the Zelda cartoon. While the Link they were following was rather comedic, this version of Ganon was just as weird in his dialogue and other such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly pulling himself taller, Ganon spoke, \"Join me Link, and I will make your face the greatest in Koridai, or else you will DIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink seemed a bit off put by this  but immediately began jumping around and using similar tactics from just a moment ago, and even deflected a couple of attacks back to Ganon.

He was fingering the necklace underneath his shirt. Benjamin noticed this \"What to you have there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing\" Steven quickly said. He dropped his hand to his side, and started walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin didn't buy it. Before Steven could react, Benjamin pulled the necklace out from under Steven's shirt. \"What's this? You never where this kind of stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven figured there was no point hiding the truth from Benjamin anymore. \"I...uh...found this necklace earlier today. I figured I could clean it up and use it as a birthday present for Rachel, but that was before I found out it...could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Could...What?\" Ben encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before it could...make whatever you were thinking come true.\" Steven said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin started laughing. \"Right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true\" Steven defended himself. \"Uh...you see that old lady on the bench. The one feeding the pigeons.\" Benjamin nodded. \"Well look closely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly before his eyes, the old lady was starting to regress. Within a few moments, the lady went from being like 80 to 20. The lady did not seem to notice the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...How did you...\" Benjamin stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the necklace bro. You used to be my best friend, until I imagined us as brothers, and then poof...were brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really...hmmm...can I try something then?\" Steven looked a little hesitant. \"Please...come on, you owe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright.\" Steven gave in. He lifted the necklace over his head and handed it to Benjamin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...well since you only went half way with us...I am going to make it all the way.\" Benjamin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Steven asked. But, he didn't have to wait long. Suddenly, his body felt very warm. He could feel is bones and skin rearrange themselves. He also grew a few inches taller. Steven used his hands to feel his body and face. It felt different. His clothes were even changed. \"Wow! What did you do to me?\" Steven looked up, and was surprised to see someone else looking at him. This person looked like Benjamin...sort of. But he also looked like his old self too. He looked at his friend and then back at himself. He noticed that he and Benjamin were wearing the same exact outfit now. \"Did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. I made us twin brothers.\" Benjamin had a huge smile on his new face. Steven couldn't help but smile back with an identical smile.</span></div></div>",

Every where they looked, they saw doubles. There were identical girls swinging on some swings. Those girls' dads, who were also identical were talking to each other on a bench. Two teenage boys, identical, were making out with their teenage girlfriends, also identical.

Jim grow by almost a foot, and he gained almost one hundred pounds of muscle! It seemed as if all of Allen's body had converted into muscle!

These fields were completely equipped with flags, lights, and goals, so they could even play soccer at night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were hundreds of kids running around, holding, carrying, throwing, or kicking soccer balls around. Steve became curious and began to walk towards one of the fields, where a soccer match had just gotten started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about a dozen kids on the field, half were dressed in blue, and the other half were dressed in red. They were all running after a soccer ball, and trying to score a goal in the opponent's goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve walked around and saw there aside from the parents and the coach, there were a few players who were sitting on the bench. Obviously, they were waiting for their turn to substitute with some of the players, who were on the field, so that they could also get a chance to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve walked past the bench and overheard a conversation between two boys, who had just gotten off the field, and who were now watching the game from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I wish I were able to run faster....\" the first boy, named Conner, sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm pretty fast, but I'm just not very strong...\" the second boy said. His name was Tyler. \"I don't have the endurance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's going, you guys?\" Steve said, as he stood next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're okay...\" Conner replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Tyler and Conner weren't the best players on the team. But they were about the same size and the same age, and they both wore the same uniform, but Conner was skinny and Tyler was a little more chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We each have a good things and our bad things... But if we could put them together, we would be awesome...\" Tyler sighed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the necklace around Steve's neck started to glow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Tyler and Conner were pulled towards each other and as soon as they touched, they bodies were absorbed together until they merged into one boy, who was about six inches taller, and had slightly bigger hands, arms, and feet. He became more muscular, as his chest and arms thickened due to the merge, while his thighs and calves bulged outward at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... what happened?\" the boy said, in Conner's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Whoa! I'm bigger!\" the big boy said next, in Tyler's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! We're together... We're ONE being! COOL!\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the coach came towards the big boy, who was now almost the biggest kid on the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tycon! You're up! Get on the field!\" the coach ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tycon? Cool! That is the combination of Tyler and Conner!\" Conner whispered, as the big, strong boy raced on the field, feeling the new, increased strength in his big, muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve grinned as he watched the new, merged boy rally his teammates to play hard and, eventually, score the next goal of the match, which would lead the team to victory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the other direction came another guy, talking on his cell phone.  He stopped and watched as they started to pass by each other.  Neither one of them even acknowledged each other as they passed by.  The necklace started to glow and Steve watched what was now taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the two guys had passed by in different directions, they were both pulled backwards, and slammed into each other.  Instantly they started to mesh together, and join.  The jogger's body seemed to take dominance over the lower half, with his strong, lean legs, but the upper body was that of the guy on his cell, with a strong looking chest, and pair of arms.  But that's where their joining finished.  Steve looked confused and a bit frightened to see that they had two heads.  One of the jogger, and the other guy, side by side on a new broad strong set of shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth guys looked at each other, and started to laugh, chatting about something Steve couldn't quiet make out.  He got closer so he could over hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, that was a  good jog, but what do you feel like doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know.  We always get kinda hungry after we jog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya I know.  How about we hit the hot-dog stand!  We can even get one of those pretzels you love!\"  They both had huge grins on their faces and nodded.  They started to walk over to the hot-dog stand, right passed Steve.  He couldn't believe his eyes as he watched them walk by with out any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere were two random guys, who wouldn't even look at each other as they walked by one another on the street.  Now, fused together as some two headed man because of the necklace, acting as if they were best friends, and had always been stuck together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve wanted to see how things turned out for them, so he followed a few feet behind them</span></div></div>",

More and more people were becoming just like the two men he was following.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of him, he saw a figure leaving an office building and upon close inspection, it looked like a man and a woman together on one body. The bottom was the male, wearing slacks and dress shoes and the top was the female, who had on a business suit jacket, showing off a bit of her assets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked the other direction, discussing something about the stock market, Steve saw a family rounding the corner of the next street.  It looked like the mother and son fused together, both of their heads on the mothers body. The mother looked in her mid 30's while the son looked about 10-ish.  They stopped for a moment as the mother began to talk to the son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, what time is it?\" The son raised the mothers left arm to meet her vision so she could see the time.<br>\r\n\"Goodness! It's that late! At this rate were going to be late for lunch.\" she then turned around to shout behind her, \"Come on you two, were going to be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, the father and daughter rounded the corner, their heads on the fathers body. \"Sorry honey, Mary was having a look in the new toy store back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Steve watched the weird family walk away, he began to try and figure out why this was happening and if it has spread more than he thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve then.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were already at the hot dog stand talking with... a two-headed girl who was also standing in line. As he jogged forward to catch up with them, he passed a couple on a bench making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... what?\" Steve quickly did a double take. The couple was making out, but they were making out on one unusual body. It was like each had been cut in half and then stitched together. The right side was defiantly female, and the left was male. Steve couldn't help but stare at the two. The only thing that pried his eyes away from the odd sight was the sound of arguing. On the other end of the block, another two-headed guy was arguing with themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike before, this two-headed guy was an uncoordinated wreck. They stumbled down the sidewalk toward Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! You ALWAYS ruin it. We almost had their number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ruined it! I wasn't the one who told that stupid joke. YOU did... even when I told you not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... and I'm sure your talking about... video game stuff really impressed them a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got closer, Steve recognized them from school. The left head was George, the star quarterback, and Jeff, the head of the World of Warcraft club. Staring at them, Steve could have sworn George was taller, and a lot more... buff before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued down the street, and suddenly stopped. They were now arguing about which direction to go in.</span></div></div>",

Opening the door, he saw his mom and dad sitting on the couch with their back towards him. As Steve walked over to see them, his fears were confirmed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's parents were together on one body, but it was different than others he had seen.  The body had four arms, two from each parent.  The top half was his mothers, skinny with decent DD boobs, while the bottom half was his fathers. Steve couldn't quite tell, but they might have had both sets of genitals in his dads pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked at his parents in shock, he couldn't help but wonder what happened to his sister, Rachel.

In the side view mirror, Steve and Grace saw one singular girl, a girl that almost exactly looked like Grace, except traits of Steven were mixed in. Her face was all Grace, but she had heterochromia, the left eye was Steve's brillant blue, and the right eye was a dull green. While Grace had shoulder length auburn hair, and Steven medium length blonde hair, the new girl's hair had hair triple the length of Grace's hairline, drifting to her thighs. From the crown of her head to her waist, it was blonde with auburn streaks, the frequency of which grew the further from the root the hairs got, but below that point it was all auburn. The girl had Grace's small figure, but was as tall as Steven, at roughly 6' 3\". This new girl had Grace's breasts, which were average B-cups, but instead of B's, they were now low C's, and there was a line of chest hair running down the cleavage of a t-shirt made of wool. Her pants were a perfect fusion of the two, now green denim cargo jeans that fit perfectly on a female figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the girl gasped when she saw a noticeable bulge in her pants. Steve was shocked, and wanted to investigate...</span></div></div>",

Quickly, he sprinted to a secluded alley and ducked behind a dumpster. He lifted up the shirt, seeing the line of thick chest hair running down the female torso, possessing mild definition in the abs that Grace never had, and down to the groin, but it seemed other than the chest, and possibly the groin, this body was as smooth as Grace was. \"What do you think you're doing?!\" Steven hears. Quickly, he looks around for the voice, only for it to speak again, this time recognizing it. It was Grace!! She was in their collective head, yelling at him. \"How dare you show off my breasts for the world to see!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still in a bra, Grace!!\" Steve yelled back in their head. \"We have to know the extent of things that happened!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But couldn't we do this at home?! This is embarrassing!!\" Even though Steve was in control, he could feel their face blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!! We have to do this now, while we're alone!! Besides, we'll just argue on where 'home' is.\" Steven blurts, unfastening their belt, unzipping their pants, and looking at their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!! Pervert!! Pull our pants up this instant!!\" Grace yells within the shared cranium. Steven just blows her off as he sees no-frills cotton panties, but they had the front flap typical in men's briefs, brief's like Steve wore, but more importantly was that it was still tented. As Steven reached down, starting to pull down the panties, Grace let out a scream, yelling, \"Ew!! EW!! Don't look!! Oh god, I see it!!\" as Steven looks at their genitals. There was the penis all right, and now it looked slightly longer than he remembered, but instead of a scrotum, he found Grace's vagina laying below. In fact, her clitoris was now a barb that grew off the shaft of his man-meat where the bottom of his penis met the top of her vagina. \"Fine!! You saw 'them,' now get us dressed!!\" Grace cowed in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve...</span></div></div>",

Trust me, you need a cock up your ass!! *giggle*\" Once he got near Grace, he saw what she was tugging on, and where that was coming from. It turned out Grace wasn't left untouched by the necklace's power, but compared to everyone else, she was the most normal person in the neighborhood (Steve notwithstanding).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the base of Grace spine, poking through a tailored hole in her jeans, was a wiry appendage that resembles a tail, nearly nine feet in length, but this tail was conjoined to the coccyx of one Sasha Edwards, the platinum blonde girl everyone in school, no, the whole town, knew as the biggest bimbo slut in your school (and maybe the whole town), a girl dressed in nothing but a red leather micro miniskirt, the rear lifted up by the conjoining tail and showing everyone she was wearing no underwear, a red bikini top that barely held her fake EE-cup breasts her stripper mom bought her when she was 15, and 6\" heels on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha's IQ was below average, was genuinely stupid, and perpetually horny, willing to sleep with anything that breathed (literally). In fact, the only reason she still went to school was to screw as many people, boys and girls, as she could each day, believing any day she got gangbanged by five men at once was a good day (which with her wiles, was almost every day). In short, she was the textbook definition of \"bimbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace heard someone coming up and said, \"Go away!! The slut doesn't have time to hump your brains out today. I got a project on AP biology due at the end of the week, and I'm not going to let her slow me down!!\" As she yanks on the tail, trying to drag the reluctant bimbo with her, she notices Steve, and recognizes him from her homeroom. \"Wait, I know you... but where? You aren't one of her 'regulars,' nor are you even her type, from what I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Steve...\" He starts, before being interrupted by Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you, like, whip your dick out and let me suck it?! I'm, like, so fucking horny, and the nerd here won't let me fuck!!\" she whines, practically in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve blushes wildly before shaking his head no, at which time Grace yells at her, \"Cut that out!!\" She turns to Steve again, saying, \"Now I remember you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he figured Sasha would lose it and try to rape him or something, he asks Grace bluntly, \"Have you noticed anything strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace tells Steve, \"Well, I've been fussing at the queen of the sluts for the last little bit, but to be honest...\"</span></div></div>",

Now let's go back inside and get a snack, okay?\" The boy made the shared body jump for joy a bit, then walked the family inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve then passed the running woman/kid again, who had stopped for a water break.  \"Hey, mom are we done yet? I want to go home, where there's air conditioning.\" \"No, Johnathan, we have to keep our body in shape. We've only got 1 mile to go, then we'll go home.\" They then began to run again in the opposite direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve passed the house with the 3 girls and 2 bodied mother again.

There were also an extra pair of arms, most likely for the extra head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Steve reached his house again.

As Steve began to walk towards them, he could feel some unknown force pulling him towards his parents. He realized that he was about to combine with them, just as Rachel did with Jill. He tried to fight it, but the force was too much. As he made contact with them, he lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up a little bit later, Steve realized he was on the floor. He tried to move his arms to push him up, but they wouldn't budge. In fact, he couldn't move any part of his body.  Looking around the kitchen he saw his mom and dads heads directly next to him on either side. As he looked down, Steve saw that he was now part of his parent's combined body. With a sudden lurch, Steve felt his new body lift itself up and walk to the bathroom.  As the body opened the door and stepped inside, Steve saw the extent of the change in the full length mirror.  His head, as well as his parents heads, were now on a body that had the upper body of his mother and the lower body of his father.  It had four arms, his mom's and dad's respectively.  Once the body closed the door, it started using its four arms to fix Steve's mother's hair and get some dust out of it.  As the arms fixed her hair she began to give instructions on how she wanted her hair to look.  As this is happening, Steve realizes that not him nor his parents controlled the body they now shared.

Once the body sat down to eat, it began to feed each head in succession.  First was Steve's father on the right, then Steve and finally Steve's mother.  It continued this until all the food was gone.  As soon as it finished cleaning up, the body climbed the stairs up to Steve's parents bedroom.  Once inside, it began to strip, using all four arms to take of the blouse and pants the body was wearing.  Looking down at the naked body, Steve saw that it had both sets of genitals.  The body then went to the shower and turned it on, stepping inside while the water was just getting warm.  It then began to wash itself, soaping up the breasts and genitals first, making a shiver go up the body's spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body then...........</span></div></div>",

Stepping out of the shower, Steve felt the cold air hit his naked shared body sending a shiver up the body. Grabbing a towel and robe, the body covered up and went back into the parent's bedroom.  Going to the dresser, it pulled out a nightgown and proceeded to put it on.  The body then got into bed and turned off the light. Steve laid there, staring at the ceiling, wondering if and when things would get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning came quickly for Steve, as the alarm near the bed went off.  Turning his head, he saw it was 7:00 a.m. The body suddenly woke up and turned off the alarm.  Stretching all four arms, it got up and went to the bathroom where the body used both genitals to go to the bathroom. Once it's business was finished, the body washed it's hands and began to help it's heads get ready for the day. Using all four hands, the body got each toothbrush and brushed each heads teeth. Then using Steve's mom's hands, the body helped put on makeup on her face while Steve's dad's hands combed each head's hair.  After 10 minutes, the body went back into the bedroom and into the walk-in closet.  It picked out a customized woman's business suit with four arm holes and a pair of men's slacks, then it grabbed a pair of socks, men's dress shoes, and bra and underwear from the dresser.  Once the body was fully dressed, it grabbed mom's jewelry and watch and put it on her left arm. The body walked over to the mirror back in the bathroom and let Steve and his parents look at their appearance.  The body then held up the watch to Steve's mom, showing her they were running late.  It then walked downstairs, grabbed a granola bar and Steve's mom's purse, then headed to their car.  </span></div></div>",

They looked different from before, however their back was turned to him, so he couldn't tell. As soon as they turned around, however, he knew right away.  Steve's mom and dad had their heads on his mom's body, with her arms, but they had a second pair of boobs just under her original. As they turned to Steve, he could feel some unknown force pulling him towards his parents.  He realized that he was about to combine with them, just as Rachel did with Jill. He tried to fight it, but the force was too much. As he made contact with them, he lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up a little bit later, Steve realized he was on the floor.  He tried to move his arms to push him up, but he couldn't feel them. He could move his legs, however. Looking around the kitchen he saw his mom and dads heads directly next to him.  As he looked down, Steve saw that he was now part of his mother's body.  As his parents woke up, they used their arms to help push them up. Steve decided to head to the bathroom to see his new body.  As he went in and looked into the full length mirror, he saw that his head was in between his parents on his mothers body, just like the family he saw down the street. He did notice that his father's arms had grown under his mothers.  Steve began to worry a bit. He was now stuck to his parents for who knows how long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into the family room, Steve saw that Jill was there. She wasn't conjoined to Sarah anymore though. <br>\r\n\"Hey Stevie, are you okay? What happened when I came over?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, I was just nervous, that's all.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, alright then. Listen I need to run. Apparently my mom needs me for something, so I'll call you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was in the car, Steve's mom whispered, \"She's a nice girl, Stephen. I'm so glad you have a girlfriend that nice. Okay, we need to make dinner now, so get our body to the kitchen!\"<br>\r\n\"Um, actually mom, we kind of, need to, you know............go.\"<br>\r\n\"Honey what do you........oh, you mean bathroom.

Getting to the door, his mom used her arm to open the door. Once he reached the toilet, his mom and dad used their arms to help pull down their pants and underwear.  Looking down, Steve saw his mom's vagina for the first time.  Sitting down, he started to go to the bathroom.  It was quite different than what he was used to. Finishing up, his mom used her hands to wipe up and flush the toilet while his dad pulled up their pants.  Going to the sink, Steve let his parents wash their hands. He looked into the mirror again, still unable to believe what he saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bathroom, Steve's mom checked her watch. \"Oh, goodness! We're running late! We need to start dinner now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we in such a hurry, mom,\" Steve asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Because we have to go back to the office and finish up some work before tomorrow. So lets get our butt moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickening his pace back to the kitchen, Steve began to think what job he now had. Getting into the kitchen, his mom told him where to go and his dad helped get ingredients and prepare them. After an hour of frantic running around, they had successfully made a lasagna. As Steve's mom and dad began to take it out of the oven, he heard the front door open. He heard his sister Rachel's voice, however he didn't know if something happened to her.    </span></div></div>",

She was conjoined with a beautiful woman wearing a tight red dress. She had a big bust, about a DD, and long legs.  Her head had long blond hair and a very pretty face.  Rachel's head was right next to the woman's on her left side.  Steve noticed that the woman was one of his neighbors, Olivia Boone. She lived alone, but had a current boyfriend that she had been seeing for a few years.  Rachel's arms were just below Olivia's, which she was using to talk to someone on the phone.  Olivia was also on her respective phone, talking to someone else.  Once they both hung up, they sat at the table and began to eat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve guided his shared body to sit as well as his parents began to help themselves to the lasagna.  As they fed their respective mouths, he turned to his mom a little and asked her if he could taste it.  She used one of her arms to feed him, which kind of felt weird.  The fact that he had no arms at all was a really weird feeling.  Almost as soon as they began, the food was all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's mom asked Rachel and Olivia to clean up while they went back to their office to finish their work.  As they started to go to the car, his mom grabbed her purse and her keys as Steve led them out the front door. Assisting them get in the car, he helped drive to their office, which was only 10 minutes away. Once they got there, Steve noticed a few cars still there, even though it was 10 at night.  Walking in, Steve saw a few modified people.  The receptionist had 6 arms, each were doing something different.  A man leaving the office had a woman's face on the back of his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve got in the elevator and his dad pushed the 6th floor, a woman stopped the elevator and stepped in.  The woman had an interesting predicament.  Her daughter, who looked Steve's age, had her upper torso jutting out of her mother's waist.  So she was constantly facing her mom.  Once the elevator hit 6, you guided your body out and over to your parents office.</span></div></div>",

After closing the door to their office, his parents locked it and Steve began to head back to the elevator. Once it arrived, Steve saw another modified person.  A fairly young woman, about twenty or so, had two heads on either side of hers. Each head looked exactly like the other, all three smiling as Steve and his parents walked into the elevator. Once they were out of the building and in the parking lot, Steve saw a man who had six arms. Two of those arms had woman's heads on the ends instead of hands.  Steve began to realize that the situation was getting out of hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back home, they noticed all the lights were off.  Quietly heading upstairs, Steve led them to his parents bedroom door.  Once his mom opened it and turned on the lights, they began to undress.  He wanted to look away, not wanting to see his mom naked, however since it was his body technically, he opened his eyes and looked down.  His mom was still in great shape for having two kids. She had a thin waist and nice DD boobs.  Soon their shared body was completely naked.  Steve guided their body over to the dresser to get his moms pajamas. Once they were ready and in bed, Steve's mom turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephen, do you think we can.......... </span></div></div>",

Soon Steve and his parents were fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve woke with a jolt the next morning. Turning to his side, he saw his mom and dad were still fast asleep.  He slowly nudged his moms head with his own, waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sweetie,\" she said groggily, \"What time is it?\"  Looking at the clock, she turned back to Steve.  \"Alright, lets get in the bathroom, shall we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve slid his mom's body off the bed and into the bathroom.  His mom woke his dad on their way. Once in there, his mom reached in the shower to turn it on, while his dad began to take off her pajamas.  Soon they were completely nude.  Stepping in the shower, Steve felt the water run down his feminine figure.  His mom and dad began washing the body, which felt really nice for Steve.  Once his mom reached her breasts, Steve got a shiver down his spine, enjoying the sensation.  Once his parents were finished, Steve helped get out and into their closet.  They got dressed in professional attire and headed downstairs for breakfast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce downstairs, Steve noticed Rachel and Olivia were already eating breakfast.

Since he had no control over the arms, he relaxed while his mom and dad did all the work.  Looking down, Steve saw his mom's naked body, which he now shared.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they continued talking, Steve noticed the clock on the wall turn to 12:00. As soon as it did, it started to ring \"Meeeeerge! Meeeeerge! Time!\" When the tone stopped, everyone in the restaurant stopped what they were doing and stood up. Some of the few who were unmerged stood next to other unmerged people, while those who were merged stood next to other merged folk or non merged.  Looking across the street, he noticed most of the merged/unmerged people must not have heard the clock ring because they were going about their business. Mother-son and Father-daughter family also stood next to each other. They continued on their business. The dad lifted his arm to his face to check his watch. \"Wow, I can't believe its that time already. Guess we'll see what this next merge does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something weird happened. Steve could only explain it as the merge time. The weird family that Steve was following suddenly split up; each had their own body again. However, it did not stop there. Matthew and Marry, the son and daughter, suddenly slid together and merged. They were sharing one body that seemed to be half his and hers, but the mother and father remained separated. Looking around the restaurant, Steve noticed similar things happen. Some merged people split up and either remerged with someone else or remained separated. Across the street, the same thing also happened. Two girls were walking past each other when the merge started. They slid into each other backwards so they shared their back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steve tried to stay out of the way of anyone, but with the restaurant as crowded as it was, that was pretty difficult. A teen girl with her blonde hair tied in a bob, and wearing a midriff-bareing crop top, jeans, and high-heeled boots stood up and walked toward him, not paying attention to where she was going as she texted on her phone. Steve turned to avoid her, but was pushed into her by someone behind him. He heard a loud, \u2018sploosh\u2019, and felt his body being molded anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his eyes again, he couldn\u2019t move any part of his body except his head. He looked downward and saw the girl\u2019s body, and her prominent breasts. He looked to his right and saw her still texting, not phased by his sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, there!\u201d a voice called from behind him, and he turned his head left and saw the girl\u2019s face again! \u201cI\u2019m Kat. She\u2019s also Kat. We\u2019re the same person, if you haven\u2019t guessed. Pleased to be merged with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back and forth between the two girls\u2019 heads, still surprised he was seeing two instances of the same person, and not two different people. And of course, even more surprised that he got involved in the merging process. He heard the same announcer blare, \u201cMerge time! End! Merge time! End!\u201d and people return to what they were doing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can talk, right?\u201d the other Kat head asked this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, yeah, sorry\u2026\u201d he started, trying to act normal in this weird world, \u201cMy name\u2019s Steve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, cute name!\u201d her left head said. \u201cFitting for a cute guy,\u201d her right head continued, \u201cI\u2019d shake your hand, but\u2026\u201d She gestured at their now-shared body. \u201cI gotta go touch up my makeup,\u201d \u201cso you just sit back and\u201d \u201cenjoy the view.\u201d Her heads now alternated speaking so fast it was hard to keep track. One other change Steve noticed as they walked to the restrooms was that Kat had gained a third leg. Her walk seemed to be alternating this middle one and her two outside ones, which was interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed a few new mutants on their way. One lady had her son growing out from between her legs. She had to unzip her jeans to let him out. Another two women, one blonde and the other a redhead, were joined facing each other, sharing everything from the hips down (which made it look like one of them had backwards legs). A man had merged with a waitress, his face growing on the back of her head, and his arms below hers facing backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve and Kat approached the restrooms, her left head whispered, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind us using the ladies\u2019.\u201d As they walked inside, Steve saw a woman coming out of a stall with her legs and arms swapped, trying to get herself oriented to the new body. A second woman came out of the same stall with no head on her shoulders. Instead, two copies replaced her breasts, and her top was modified to expose them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat took some makeup supplies out of her purse, and began applying them to her right head first\u2026</span></div></div>",

Walking towards Steve was another family, however they were incredibly strange.  There were three people in this family, a mother, father and what looked to be a 16 year old daughter.  There were two big oddities with them. First, they were all conjoined.  At first glance it looked like the mother and father were carrying their daughter in between them, however the girl was actually sandwiched in between her parents bodies, with the mother on the left and the father on the right.  Each parent was missing their inner arm and the daughter had no lower body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second big oddity was that it seemed that the girl controlled her parents arms and legs.  As they were walking, the mother and father's arms were holding a pink cell phone up to the girls face, typing on the keypad every so often.  As they were about to pass the restaurant, Steve overheard the mother talk to the daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, don't you think we should get home and do some of your homework?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I want to go hang out with the girls at the mall.\" the daughter said, still texting away.<br>\r\nThe father then spoke up, \"Young lady, you should listen to your parents!\"<br>\r\n\"And if I don't, what are you going to do?\"She turned to her father with a serious face. He turned away, dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter then went back to her phone, but before she did, relieved an itch on her mothers stomach, then her fathers chest.  <br>\r\nSteve decided that following them and studying them might be more fun that staying there with the current family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Steve decided to.........</span></div></div>",

He left the restaurant and caught up with them just as they were entering the mall.  Keeping his distance, Steve followed the family into a woman's clothing store.  The 16 year old began to search the store for clothes for her mom to wear, picking up tops and holding them up to her mom to see if they looked right.  After she picked a few tops, the girl went over to where the bras were kept. The mother had a fairly generous 34 D chest, so the girl picked out a pink frilly bra for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, sweetie, I don't really like those kinds of bras,\" the mother said in a quiet voice.  <br>\r\n\"So what, I like them and I heard this guy at school does too.  Maybe I can show him one time after class.\" the girl wondered, thinking about the possibilities.  While the girl was off thinking, the mother had a terrified look on her face, as did the father.  They then took the clothes and the bra to the changing room to try them on.  After a few minutes, they came out with the clothes and headed to the cashier.  The cashier had four arms and three legs, using her extra arms to put some clothes away.  Once the cashier scanned the last item, she told the family that the total was $325.00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father shouted,\"That's outrageous! I am not paying that kind of money for clothes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that, his daughter used his arm to reach into his pocket and grab his wallet. She then used her mom's arm to reach in and grab his credit cart and hand it to the cashier.  She then looked at her father with a devious face and signed the receipt.  After leaving the store, new clothes in hand, Steve followed them to the food court where they met up with the daughters friends. There were three in all, but they weren't alone.  The first friend,Samantha, had what looked like her brothers head on her body. About 14, his head was to the left of hers and seemed to be able to control her left arm.  The second friend, Bridgette, had three heads on her body, all the same.  She also had four arms and two 32C breasts.  The last friend, Stephanie, had her mother and father's heads replacing her boobs. Both parents heads were coming out of two holes on their daughters shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls said their hello's and began to wander off to more stores throughout the mall.</span></div></div>",

As they walked from shop to shop, Steve noticed how the girl's parents tried to talk to Stephanie's parents, who were in a similar situation as them.  Steve couldn't get close enough to hear their conversation, but he assumed they were talking about what to do with their kids.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes, the group settled down in the food court, ordering some salads from the nearby food kiosk.  As they ate their salads, Steve noticed the girl getting excited about something.  Moving closer, he overheard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Jeff is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two official yet?\" one of Bridgette's heads asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, but we've only been out on one date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, Steve noticed a guy walking over to the group.  He was about  6' 3\" and looked like a model you would find in an Abercrombie and Fitch ad. Walking over to the family, the girl made her parents stand up and meet him.  As they met, Jeff gave the girl a big, long kiss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetie, what are you doing here?\" the girl asked her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were coming here this afternoon and I wanted to meet up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl embraced Jeff, he moved his hand up her mothers body, to her breast.  Her mother's face showed total shock, but the girl's face displayed a sexy grin.  The girl whispered something to Jeff, then turned to her friends and told them that they were headed home.  The girl's father, after hearing what she told Jeff, piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, you are too young to be doing that. You're only 16!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her father, she replied with a smile, \"But I won't be the one doing it, mom will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother look of shock appeared on both parents faces as they all walked out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steve decided to go explore the rest of the mall to see what else had changed.  First, he decided to go to the bookstore in the mall and have a look around.  Walking in the doorway, the changes were plain to see.  To the left of Steve was a couple, snuggled up in a chair reading a book.  Upon closer inspection, Steve saw that the girlfriend's upper body was jutting out of the man's pants, where his penis should have been.  Going further into the store, Steve found more changes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree 13 year old girls shared one body.  The body was a combination of the three girls and the clothes were combined as well.  Their mothers, who stood a few feet away, also shared one combined body.  Each body had two pairs of arms and 1 pair of legs.  Both the girls and their mothers conversed while they looked at books on the shelves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rows down, a father was sharing his 17 year old daughters body.  His head had replaced her original head, so the daughter couldn't talk. She did still have control of her body, however.  It seemed the dad could communicate with his daughter in his head, so they didn't look awkward walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bookstore, Steve headed across the way to the music store.  Walking in the entrance, Steve saw more changed people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA father was shopping with his two 16 year old twin daughters for some music for them.  Both of their heads had replaced their father's head, which had moved down to his chest.  He still controlled his body, which caused the twins to tell him where to go a lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo teenage girls who were looking at some CD's shared a combined body with their heads replacing their boobs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mother was buying a CD for her 12 year old son. His arms were just below his mother's, but his head wasn't visible.  Steve noticed that the son was in control of his mother's body.  The mother's head was still on the shoulders, but the son controlled her entire body, except for her left arm, which she still controlled.  The son began to jump around, listening to a sample of some music, causing the mother's decent D breasts to bounce up and down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of 17 year old kids were in the back corner talking to each other. There were 6 guys and 6 girls and at least 3 of the girls were dating the guys.  The three guys dating were combined into one body with three heads, as were the three girls.  The boyfriends heads were equally opposite from their girlfriends.  The other three guys and girls were merged into two bodies.  Two of the guy's heads were on one of the girls shoulders while two of the girls heads were on the last guy's shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a pregnant woman was looking at some classical music.  She had three heads on her shoulders.  On the left was an Asian, in the middle a Caucasian, and on the left an African American.  The body was a mixture of each head. Steve couldn't imagine what the baby would be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the music store, Steve went......... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaving the music store, Steve went to the department store next door. As he walked in the entrance, Steve went over to the women's clothing section to the left of him.  Over near a rack of dresses, there was a boyfriend and girlfriend looking at some dresses. Upon closer inspection, Steve saw that the boyfriend's upper body was attached to the girlfriend's back, with his lower body completely gone.  Steve also saw that the girlfriend's arms had been replaced by the boyfriend's.  Listening in on what they were saying, Steve got a little bit closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, let me see that one on your left,\" the girlfriend told her boyfriend.  At this point, Steve realized that only the boyfriend could control the arms.  As the guy grabbed the dress, the girlfriend walked over to the full length mirror on the wall.  \"Hold it up, let me see how it looks,\" she told her boyfriend.  As he held it up to her body, she gasped. \"Doesn't it look great! This is perfect for the party next week at Jill's place! Don't you think, sweetie?\" She asked as she looked back down at the dress.  \"It looks great, Kate.\" The boyfriend replied as they walked off to the dressing room to try it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve walked further into the store, he saw another interesting sight.  In the women's section, where they had workout clothes, there were two women sharing a body, each of them with one half of the body.  The woman on the left looked like an athlete in training, strong and skinny with toned abs.  The woman on the right, however, looked like she was out of shape.  Steve could see a bit of fat hanging over the woman's pants. The two women's breasts were also very different, with the bigger woman having a bigger boob than the other.  Walking past them, Steve overheard their discussion.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, we need to start working out some more, your gaining more and more weight each day!\" The fit head said to the other. <br>\r\n\"Don't remind me! It's not that much though, I just need to stop eating so much fast food.\"  <br>\r\n\"Well, at this rate, we won't be ready for the four mile run we have in two weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve kept walking, going through the kid's section.  As he continued, he noticed a family of four shopping for clothes for their two 12 year old kids.  The mother and father were sharing a body which was made up of half of each parent, but their heads were on the opposite sides.  It seemed the dad's head controlled the mom's side of the body and vice versa.  Their two kids, a boy and girl had a similar predicament. They were fighting over what shirt to buy for themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want this one!\" the girl said, holding up a pink shirt with glitter.<br>\r\n\"Well I want this one!\" the boy replied, holding a blue basketball shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore it got out of hand, the parents stepped in. \"Mark, Amy, calm down.  We can get both of them for you, don't worry.\" The mother said, putting her husbands hand on her child's shoulders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve kept walking, he went to................</span></div></div>",

When the door opened, one body stepped inside, but this body had five people on it.  There seemed to be five teenagers heads with long necks on one body. There were three girls and two boys heads on what seemed to be a combined body of all five of them.  It had C breasts, and what seemed to be both genitals, from what Steve could tell from the jeans they were wearing. As they passed Steve, he heard them deep into conversation with each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the men's section, Steve saw a father and son, looking for pants. As Steve got a better look at them, he saw that the son's upper body was jutting out from his dad's waist, facing forwards.  The son had a pair of pants in his hand, showing his dad what they looked like.  The father nodded his head and they walked off to the changing rooms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve then passed the shoe section.  He noticed a mother trying on heels near the back. It seemed that her 11 year-old daughter's head was next to her mothers.  As they stood up, Steve saw the daughter struggling to help her mom walk in the 3\" heals, forcing them to sit down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way back into the mall,  Steve passed the women's section again, this time seeing two women looking at dresses.  Upon closer look, Steve saw that the women in question was only one woman.  The two bodies had two long necks that connected to only one head, giving the woman two separate bodies.  As each body held up a different dress, the woman's head looked at each, deciding which one to buy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back into the mall, Steve.............</span></div></div>",

As they both ordered sandwiches, the son reached up towards his mom and grabbed her purse. He then pulled out her wallet and paid for the food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve walked past them, towards the burger kiosk, he passed two girls and a guy all sharing the same body.  The guy, who looked like he was in his thirties, had his head in between the two girls heads on one of their bodies. Both girls looked to be in their early twenties. The body only had one pair of arms and legs, making it hard to figure out who had control of what.  While they were waiting in line to get a salad, the girls were checking their phone while the guy was looking at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Steve was in line to get food, he saw the person in front of him.  At the front of the line, a woman in her late thirties was ordering a burger.  Once she received her order and turned to walk away, Steve saw that she had a guy's head just above her breasts.

The mother and father, both in their early thirties, shared a body that looked mostly like the mother.  The father's head was on the left side of the body, which had two left arms, his and his wife's.  The same thing was true for his wife on the right side. It seemed that the husband controlled his wife's left arm and his right arm, while his wife was vice versa. The shared body was wearing a full length red dress that came down to their feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids that the couple had were also sharing a body.  The twin sisters, who looked about six, shared a body with two arms and two legs.  They were wearing a frilly pink dress that was puffy on the bottom.  The family posed for a few pictures and smiled at the camera.  After a few pictures, the parents stepped out of the picture and let their daughters pose for a few pictures.  Watching their daughter, the parents began to talk to each other, with Steve eavesdropping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't they look so cute!\" the mother said clasping her and her husbands hands together in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!,\" the father said, \"They get that from their mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, the mother gave the father a long kiss. All four hands were moving around, including the two that the father controlled, going straight to their breasts, a decent CC size.  After a few seconds of kissing and groping, they compose themselves and collect their daughters.  After paying for their pictures, they walked out of the store,  smiles on their faces.  </span></div></div>",

There was a woman in her early thirties that had two heads, exactly the same.  Their long brown hair cascaded down their back, as they got out of line to wait for their drink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext in line was a mother and her two little girls.  Her children's heads sat on their mothers shoulders, on either side of her head.  The strangest thing about them, was that the mother had no legs.  Instead, her children's bodies replaced them.  As the mother ordered, Steve saw the bodies were still controlled by the girls, one of them crossing her arms and the other tapping her foot.  After ordering, the girls stepped out of line to get their drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Steve had ordered from a barista with six arms, he stepped out of line only to notice a teenage couple sitting at the table next to where he was standing. Glancing over, Steve took their changes into account.  The teen boy was now sharing his girlfriends body, with him controlling the right side. He still maintained his original arm, which took the place of his girlfriends.  They were whispering to each other and giggling, before they began to make out.  After disengaging the lip lock, the conjoined couple stood up and walked back into the mall, still giggling.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting his coffee, Steve..........</span></div></div>",

As he walked towards the exit, he began walking next to a strange sight.  Four women, who looked somewhat similar to each other were sharing one body.  All four heads sat on top of a slim, curvy body, wearing a black collared shirt and a beige skirt that came halfway up from the knee.  The body had only one set of arms and legs.  As Steve walked beside them, he saw that their breasts were growing slightly.  Once the women and Steve reached outside, one of the women said, \"Ok, we're outside now.\"   Steve then saw two holes open on the women's shirt, where their breasts would be.  Out of those holes popped two heads, one boy about 15 and a girl about 14.  Steve also saw a boy's arm grow below the women's right arm and the girl's arm grew below the left.  The girls arm somehow had a plastic watch on it, even though it just came out of the body.  The woman's head on the far left then gained control of the girls arm and checked the time. They then continued walking to their car in the parking lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided to catch the bus home, so he went and sat down at the bus station.  Three other people were there as well.  A man and two women were sharing one of the woman's body. The guy's head was in between the women's.  they had only one pair of arms, which belonged to each woman. The legs, belonged to the man. Steve could see the bulge coming from the jeans they were wearing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus arrived after a few minutes. Getting on, Steve........</span></div></div>",

Sitting behind him, a man and woman in their 20's were sharing a body. Both bodies were split down the middle and connected, making up one body. Their head was also the same way. The woman's half had a short skirt and high heels on. She also had a very modest DD breast, hidden by a tight blue shirt.  The man's half was wearing khaki's and a collared shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the bus, was another strange sight.  A woman's body, which looked like a mother's body in her late 30's, had two teenage boy's heads instead of the woman's original. Both heads had headphones in, listening to music while the body had her legs crossed. Watching them, Steve saw that the mother's body was still controlled by the mother and the teenage heads were just passengers. As the bus stopped for the first time, the mother's body stood up and grabbed a purse that was on the ground and stepped off the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the back, Steve saw a woman in her late 20's with a 9 year old girls head next to hers.  The woman's body also had the girls arms instead of her own.  The girl's arms were playing a game on her cell phone, while the woman was trying to get the girl to answer her phone, which was ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a man in his 30's was sitting on the side of the bus. Coming from his stomach, is the upper torso of an 19 year old girl. The girl was texting on her phone while the man was using her back as a desk to write something down in a notebook.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bus reached it's next stop, Steve....</span></div></div>",

The other set had a man's body with a woman and a man's  head on the shoulders. The body had ripped muscles and was taller than the woman.  As they sat together, the two were holding hands, whispering to each other. At one point the pairs each kissed their respective heads on the other body, laughing and smiling as they did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next stop brought two more weird people.  The first was a 10 year old kid who had his mother's head next to his own. The mother's arms had replaced the kids, while everything stayed the same.  They walked to the back of the bus and sat down, with the mom pulling out her cell phone and making some calls.  The second on the bus was two beautiful teenage girls who looked exactly the same. They were wearing a cheerleading outfit, which held 2 CC breasts while the short mini-skirt lead down to two beautiful long tanned legs.

From the looks of it, she has an anatomically correct body, but when she turns her head around, you notice a male head on the back of her head, who is blowing a whistle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see a head on the sand, which is the head of a guy who looks tough. But when he comes out of the sand, it is revealed that he has the body of a six-year-old girl, Dora the Explorer clothes and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, you see a woman's head peeking out of the ocean.

Your mom's head was on the right and your dad's head was on the left. Looking down farther, you saw your sister Rachel's head coming out of your mom's skirt where her vagina would be. Rachel's arms also appeared to be attached to your mother's waist. The skirt even had two holes that seemed to be custom made for her arms. Looking even farther down, you saw that your mother's legs had been replaced by your father's arms and hands. They looked to be ten times as muscular compared to how they were before and had been modified to work just like normal legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched, mouth agape, as they saw you and began to walk over to you. They looked completely natural using your dad's arms to walk with, almost like they had been doing it their whole lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there sweetie,\" Your mom said to you as she and your father gave you a hug. You also felt your legs being squeezed by your younger sister, \"We're just working on dinner. It should be done in 20 minutes or so. Why don't you head upstairs and get cleaned up, then you can come and set the table for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you left the kitchen, you heard your sister ask your parents, \"Can I have a taste of the food?\" You then watched as your mom grabbed a spoonful of whatever they were making and reached down to your sisters head and put it in her mouth.  \"Mmmmm. It's really good mommy!\" Rachel said in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally left the kitchen and headed to your room, still trying to wrap your head around what just happened.</span></div></div>",

You were too distracted by all of the changes you encountered over the day to remember what happened to the damn thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacking your brain, you could only remember bits and pieces of life before all of the changes. You remembered your friend, Benjamin. Who knows what happened to him at this point. You figured that you would see him at school the next day, so you could piece everything together then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you thought to your family.

You were still in confusion and amazement as to what you had just seen in the kitchen.Thinking about it, you remembered that you had changed your sister to a 16 year old before you left the house that day, but from her behavior a few minutes ago, she still seemed to act like a 12 year old. Your parents, meanwhile, didn't think it out of the ordinary that their daughter's head now came out of their skirt. You still weren't sure about their genital situation and you weren't sure you really wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, your train of thought was interrupted by your mother's voice calling you for dinner.

They were busy setting the table and putting all the food out to serve. You saw that the table was modified a bit for your changed family. There was a small table under your parents seat, most likely meant for your sister to use to enjoy her food. As you stood there thinking, you saw your family walk back in carrying two plates of food; one plate in your mother's hands and another in your sister's. You were still in awe how they used your father's arms and hands as legs in order to get around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, go and grab some food before it gets cold! We spent a lot of time preparing tonight and we don't want it to go to waste!\" Your mother scolded you as they all sat down at the table. You watched your sister place her plate on the small table below their seat and begin to eat. Your parents then began to do the same, with your dad using your mom's left arm to eat and your mom using her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back into the kitchen and grabbed some food, bringing it back into the dining room. Sitting down, you realized you didn't have much of an appetite, so you watched your parents and sister interact some more. As they continued to eat, you saw your dad, who happened to have your mom's arm with her watch on it, took a  break from eating to check the time. After glancing at it, he seemed a bit surprised, then put his fork down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart, it's getting late. We need to get to the store before it closes to get that food for the company lunch tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your father showed your mom the time, she put down her fork as well. \"Rach?\" your mom spoke as she looked down at your sister. \"Finish up what you're eating. We have to get to the store before it closes so we can pick up some food for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear an \"okay\" come from your sister, muffled from under the table. As they got up, you witnessed an interesting sight. Your parents and sister walked over to the door and grabbed some shoes that looked custom made for hands. It was a shoe that had slots for each toe, but in this case, they were modified for hands.  After they put them on, your mom used her free arm to grab her purse as they began to walk out of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose you want to come on a family shopping journey, do you Steven?\" your mom asked as she was about to close the door. You shook your head no, trying to think of a reason. \"Alright, well just clean up the dining room and kitchen then. We'll be back in 45 minutes or so.\" With that, they closed the door and you were left alone with your thoughts once again. </span></div></div>",

By the time he finished putting all the food away and washing all the dishes, Steve could hear a car pulling into the driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, the front door opened and Steve's parents and sister came in carrying bags of food. Both his mothers arms and his sisters were carrying one bag each as they came into the kitchen where Steve was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Steven, you did a wonderful job cleaning up. Now, could you help put all this food away for tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not wanting to contemplate the situation, Steve helped out his family and put all the food away. By the time everything was said and done, it was almost 11:00. As Steve's sister stretched her arms and yawned, Steve's father spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we should all be off to bed. Steve, you have school tomorrow, so we'll go ahead and drop you off on our way to work. We're going to need some extra time in the morning to get ready, so it's on you to wake up early and be ready to go by 7:00.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Steve nodded, not saying anything, as he climbed the stairs to his room. Opening his door, his mom came up behind him and gave him a quick 'goodnight' hug, before they headed down the hall to their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door and laying down on his bed, lights off, Steve knew he had to do something to fix everything tomorrow. He needed to find the necklace that caused all of the changes in the first place and finding his friend Benjamin would be a good place to start. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were a few moments of rest but he may have gotten 2 hours total before he decided to get out of bed. The clock on his bedside table read 6:14, so Steve headed to his bathroom. After grabbing a quick shower and doing his usual daily routine, he got dressed and had everything ready by 6:45. As he left his room, he could hear his parents moving around in their room, assuming they were getting dressed. Steve decided to head downstairs and grab a quick breakfast before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter throwing a toaster strudel in the toaster, he saw his family coming down the stairs. They were wearing a modified woman's business suit that had holes in the pants for Rachel's head and arms. Steve also noticed that they were wearing modified heels that could fit his dad's fairly large hands. They came towards Steve and his mother gave him a quick peck on the cheek. \"You all ready to go?\" she asked him as they grabbed all the food from the fridge and headed to the door. Steve grabbed his breakfast and followed them out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his family headed to the car, Steve head a voice coming from his next door neighbors. Again, fearing the worst, he looked to see his neighbors, the Cook's, have changed. The family only consisted of Drew and his wife Maddie, but both of them now shared a very strange body. Drew's right side of his body and Maddie's left side of her body were now combined to make one shared body. They were wearing a merged business suit with Maddie's side of the body wearing a shorter jacket and skirt. Her jacket prominently displayed the one DD cup breast that their combined body now had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weirdest part about their conjoinment, was that Drew and Maddie's heads were on the wrong sides of their shared body. Drew's head was on the left, controlling Maddie's half of the body and Maddie's head was on the right side controlling Drew's half of the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both waved at Steve and his family before he saw them getting in their car and most likely driving to work. Meanwhile, his parents had started their car and Steve quickly jumped in the passenger's seat as they drove him off to school.</span></div></div>",

As the car pulled up to the school, there was no one outside yet and only a few cars parked around the lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sweetie, sorry to drop you off so early, but we really need to run,\" Steve's mom said to him, leaning over to give him a quick kiss goodbye. He hopped out of the car and watched his parents drive off. Steve turned to face the school, took a deep breath as he prepared himself for what was inside, and proceeded to open the main doors to the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was somewhat surprised to see no one roaming the halls. Again, it was still fairly early, but there was not a student in sight. The only person around was the janitor, who now had a woman's head in her 40's replacing his crotch. He continued to clean the hallways as his new crotch head hummed a song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided to head right to his first period class, English Lit, to try and find his friend Benjamin. As he opened the door to the room, he was surprised to see some people already there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the smartest kids in class, Cassidy and Matthew, now seemed to share a body. Their pale bespectacled heads were situated on a very tan pregnant woman's body, which looked to be in her late 20's. The body was about 5 months along, but Steve could tell it was pregnant, thanks to the engorged breasts the two now sported. Both Cassidy and Matthew were busy writing and didn't even bother to look up to see you walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the fatter girls in class, Nikki and Tianna, were now sharing a strong, muscular guys body. Their heads were a bit squished on the guy's shoulders, since their heads were still overweight. Their black skin tone were quite a contrast from the white body they now inhabited. They were both engrossed in a book in the back of the room and continued to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided to head to his seat and sit down, waiting to see everyone who came into the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it got closer to class time, more and more changed students began to come into the room. The first kids after Steve came in were Jasmine and Carly and, just like almost everyone else, they were now conjoined. The left side of Jasmine's black body and the right side of Carly's white body were now merged together, while both girls heads were separate on the now shared shoulders. Both girls were the same height and slim build, so they fit quite well as one body. They both sat down in Carly's normal seat and pulled out their phone to kill time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to come in were three track team members. Mark, Helen and Denise now all shared a strange body. Helen and Denise now shared an upper body, Helen's to be exact. Their shared upper body now jutted out of Mark, just above where his penis was. His shirt looked to be modified to be able to have a female torso jutting out of him, while the rest of his body seemed to be untouched. Steve couldn't tell for sure, but it looked like the girls now had control of Mark's legs, as they seemed to have more of a feminine swing to their hips. They had a seat in Mark's seat close to the front and pulled out a notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to come in was three girls from the swim team. Rachel, Morgan and Nicole's beautiful brunette heads now sat on a very muscular man's body. The body itself was probably of a football players and looked to be normal otherwise. They sat down close to the back and began to play with their phone. Meanwhile, the polar opposite of the girls came sauntering through the door. Conner, Mike and Patrick from the swim team now shared what looked to be one of the cheerleaders bodies, one that had a huge DD rack and a fairly sizable ass to go with it. As soon as the girls saw the guys come in, they waved them down and met them halfway to their desks. They embraced in a quick hug and kiss from all six heads as they went back to sit at their desks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo girls managed to sneak in while Steve was watching the swim team. Amber and Molly sat in the back corner of the room, now conjoined to each other. Amber was a very pale, very quiet girl who usually dressed very conservatively. Molly, on the other hand, was very much into the goth trend and wore lots of black. Their new shared body seemed to be a combination of those styles, as Molly's side of the body wore a large black boot, while Amber's side had a brown loafer on her foot. The rest of the body was dressed in dark colors, but still had a preppy vibe to it, with a knee high skirt and sweater on. Amber checked her watch on her arm and looked at the door, probably looking for the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to come in was Adrian and David, both fraternal twins. They seemed to be sharing their mother's body, which was a sight to behold. Everyone knew how beautiful their mother was when the guys moved from France and their family was shown around the school. Most of the guys always tried to hit on her whenever the brothers had a get together at their house (since she was single), but now the brother's shared her beautiful French body. The body itself was wearing a mini skirt and a dress shirt, pushed to its limit by the EE breasts their mother Jeanette always prided herself for having. The boys took a seat a few rows behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the last people to come in, surprisingly, was the principal of the school, Mrs. Spencer. She wore a grey business skirt and jacket, which accentuated her decent figure. She wasn't gorgeous, but she was still pretty hot. Her daughter Kayla was in Steve's class, but he didn't think anything of it until she started to change. As Mrs. Spencer continued to walk into the room, her head began to sink into her shoulders until it was completely gone. Then, a second later, Kayla's blond, perky head popped out to replace her mom's. She took a seat a row behind you and grabbed a notebook from her mom's briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still a few missing classmates and it was almost time for class to start. Steve was still waiting for Benjamin to come in, so he could figure this whole mess out. Then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steve turned to the doorway and saw his teacher, Mrs. Chang stroll into the room. Although stroll may not be the best word to use in her case. The first thing Steve noticed was that his teacher now sported eight legs, which all wore two inch red heels. She almost looked like a spider as she \"walked\" into the room, her new legs completely encircling her torso. Steve then looked up from the legs and saw even more changes. Mrs. Chang was now sharing her body with two other heads. One head looked to be her husband, since Steve had seen pictures of him on his teacher's desk. The other head was a student from his class. Carol was her name and she had a reputation for being the biggest airhead in school. Last Steve had heard, she was in jeopardy of flunking out of school. Now, however, her cute blonde head was sharing a body with her teacher and, for some reason, had a very similar look on her face that Mrs. Chang had. In fact, her husband's head also looked eerily similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve also noticed that their new shared body had six arms. Two were Mrs. Chang's originals, two were her husbands and the last ones belonged to Carol. Mrs. Chang's torso had also changed dramatically. She used to be very slim and didn't really have any breasts to speak of. Now, she sported four hefty EE breasts, two rows of two. They wore a modified sweater that made her tits look a lot bigger and had six arm holes for their modified form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they put their papers and briefcase down on their desk, Mrs. Chang began to speak. With all three heads. It seemed that Steve's teacher's brain was now being shared with all three heads and, with closer inspection, each head seemed to have the same looking mouth. As Mrs. Chang spoke, each word came from a different head, but the way she spoke, it was like it was coming from one head. There was no pause in between each word and the voice sounded the same coming from each head. Her speaking all flowed smoothly as the new three headed teacher turned to the board to write down some notes from her lecture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost surreal to think about, but Steve realized that Carol and her husband really didn't exist anymore. Their brains were overwritten by Mrs. Chang's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's new conjoined teacher continued to lecture as all the modified students around him took notes. Steve decided to...</span></div></div>",

Two of them, a redhead and a blonde, were joined back-to-back, sharing everything, even their head which had a face on each side. It seemed their arms and legs were double-sided as well, and their clothes seemed to be stitched together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third girl, Steve recognized as part of the cheerleading team. She was the one with dark brown hair that reached all the way to her waist. Only difference now is that that hair had been replaced with a cluster of dark-skinned penises, still long enough to reach her waist. They seemed to have a mind of their own, hiking up her skirt, but she swatted them away before any of them could get into her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the hall were a well-known lesbian couple, Anna and Hailey. They had been merged into a body that looked like somewhere between their old ones, except their breasts were monumentally larger. They had their heads turned toward each other and were making out while groping their new chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Steve happened upon a teacher walking the halls: Ms. Jade. Ms. Jade had six copies of her head on her shoulders, two facing forward, two facing backward, and one facing each side. As Steve walked past them, two began speaking in her commanding voice at once. It was hard to discern their speech, but he was pretty one said, \u201cSteve, what are you doing out of class?\u201d and the other said, \u201cWhy are you in the halls, Steven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked her in one of the heads\u2019 eyes, and told her, \u201cI\u2019m just going to the bathroom, Ms. Jade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heads spoke again. One said, \u201cAlright, just making sure,\u201d and the other, \u201cI hope your teacher knows of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe briefly wondered if it was even possible for her to speak one-head-at-a-time, but didn\u2019t question it and just made his way to the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

Once he hears her turn a corner out of sight, he lifts his head back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sees another girl walk across a hallway intersection about 20 feet away. He doesn't catch much, but it looks like the girl's body is headless. As her body walks behind a wall, a disembodied head floats along behind her. Probably the girl's head, from the match in skin tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced inside one of the classrooms -- the Chemistry lab, known for having a very small class size because few people signed up for it. There were only six students there this period from what Steve remembered, four boys and two girls, plus the female teacher. When he looked inside he saw them all there. All four boys shared the same body, including the head, with each boys face on one side of the head, which was able to rotate 360 degrees. One of the girls had two bodies, her own and one of the other boys' right behind it, both attached to her by their necks. To sit down, her original body sat on the boy body's lap. Her girl body wore a skirt, and it didn't take much to imagine what was making her face appear so flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the second girl and the teacher were now merged. The teacher now had four arms and legs, and each of her hands (not feet, thankfully), was replaced by a copy of the girl's head, and although the teacher seemed to have some way to force their jaws to clench in order to grab things (either that or the student was just very cooperative), each head seemed to share a mind completely separate from the main body's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Steve finally reached the restroom, he saw that instead of a men's and women's, there was just a single bathroom for both. It's sign had the symbol of a two-headed person, with one half straight and rectangular like the men's, and one half with a dress like the women's. He cautiously opened it. one of the stalls was occupied, and a girl was washing her six hands, but otherwise it just looked like a larger version of the restroom he was used to. The girl washing her hands simply finished, dried off, and walked past him out the door, a third eye glaring at Steve, but otherwise no reaction.</span></div></div>",

Steve was just able to get a look at the shoes of the girls without bending too far over.

Mrs. Spenser, the principal, was currently in his own class with her body being used by her daughter, Kayla. So, was she still the principal of the school? Steve decided to head to the principal's office to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rounding a hallway, Steve found himself at the door to the office. There was a big window on the door that enabled him to look inside the office. Steve was able to hide around the corner of the door and peek inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the principal's desk was the vice-principal Ms. Shapiro. She was a fairly big woman in terms of size. Not very tall, but chunky overall. The strange thing about Ms. Shapiro now, is that she shared her body with four other heads, that Steve recognized. Each head shared Ms. Shapiro's enlarged shoulders, which stretched out a bit more in order to fit all the heads. On the far right of the shoulders was one of the substitute teachers, Mr. Hightower. He was in his early 30's and had short dark brown hair. It also looked like his arm took the place of Ms. Shapiro's on the right side of the body. Next to his head was the office secretary, Mrs. Woodward. She just celebrated her 50th birthday a few weeks ago, but still looked in her 40's, with fading brown hair and glasses. Then came Ms. Shapiro's head in the middle of the five, her long brown hair now done up in a bun. To her left was one of the history teachers, Mr. Longwell. He was one of the youngest teachers at the school, just a few years removed from college. His dark blond hair was a bit disheveled from the way his hair normally was. Finally, on the far left of the shoulders, was Gwen, a girl from the local community college working at the school part time. She was incredibly skinny and ran track at high school before she went to college. Now she shared an overweight body with four other people. Like Mr. Hightower on the other side of the body, Gwen's skinny arm replaced Ms. Shapiro's on the left side of the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve watched them from the door, all five heads seemed to be doing different things. The three middle heads were all on the phone, since they had no arms to speak of. Mr. Hightower and Gwen were both filling out different paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching them work for a bit, Steve decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steve really didn't feel like going back to class. He wasn't really going to pay attention anyway if he went back. So instead, he began to roam the halls of his school, finding more changed people and hopefully finding his friend Benjamin along the way. As he turned the corner away from the principles office, Steve took a glance into the teachers lounge, only one door over. A few teachers were still hanging about, getting ready to head off to their first classes of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first teacher, or teachers in this case, that Steve saw were the math teachers. Ms. Jepsen, the 29 year old trigonometry teacher who was very skinny and had brown hair, Ms. Ferrick, the 35 year old Algebra teacher who was a bit overweight and had light brown hair, and Mr. Rush, the 38 year old Geometry teacher, who was fairly muscular with black hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange thing about all these math teachers was that they were all conjoined in a very interesting manner. Both Ms Jepsen and Ms. Ferrick merged into Mr. Rush via his shoulders and waist. The women's lower bodies merged into Mr. Rush's, so only his legs remained. At the shoulders, Ms. Jepsen's left arm and Ms. Ferrick's right arm had merged into Mr. Rush's arms. However, the male teacher's arms had switched sides, so that his left arm was now where his right arm should be and vice versa. This now gave the impression that both female teachers had a female and male arm under their control, facing the correct way for them. The three teachers were sitting at a desk grading papers. The female teachers were grading away, using Mr. Rush's arms to their advantage. Meanwhile Mr. Rush was watching the TV that was turned on in the corner of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the other side of the room was Mrs.Vogel, the music teacher. Her change had caused her to grow 5 extra pairs of arms and her torso to be extended in order to fit those arms. She now sported 12 arms, each identical to her original pair as well as 10 B cup breasts. She sat in the corner texting on her phone, and cleaning a flute, while also filing her nails on her bottom pair of hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast in the room were two of the science teachers, Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Caplan. They were conjoined at the face and shoulder. Mrs. Mueller's darker skin tone now contrasted Mrs. Caplan's as their heads had merged into one, but kept separate sides of their faces. Meanwhile, their bodies merged at the shoulder, but everything else was separate. They only had two arms between them, as well as two eyes and one mouth, but they had four breasts and four legs as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both had gotten up and started to walk over to the door, which Steve saw just in time.He ducked round a corner and hid as he watched the combined teachers walk awkwardly to their classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking the coast was clear, Steve decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After checking the coast was clear, Steve decided to head into the door just next to where he was hiding, which just happened to be the men's bathroom. As he closed the door, he surprisingly heard some female voice coming from one of the stalls, just in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear the door open?\" one of the voices said. Another female voice spoke up, \"Nah, I think you're just hearing things. Lets just finish up in here already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided to quietly sneak into the nearest stall and peer through the crack in the door as he heard the girls stall unlock. As the stall door opened, he saw two female heads with long blond hair, sharing a male body which was a bit pudgy, hairy and looked to be in its 40's. As the girls reached the mirror, Steve realized that it was Ashley and Riley, one of the lesbian couples at the school, now sharing a body. As they stared at their reflection in the mirror and washed their male hands, the began to talk quietly to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Riles, we can't just keep coming in here and jerking it every time we get horny. We gotta find ourselves some good pussy to fuck. I'm tired of just using our hands!\" Ashley said while washing her male hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I know. It's just so hard to find girls that would want to get with us. Sure, we've got the tools, but most of them are straight. For the most part.\" Riley whispered back to her bodymate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's always the internet. Just saying.\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon Ashley, I don't think that'll get us a fuck buddy. We just need to keep scoping out the talent here and see if we can snag us a catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the girls buttoned and zipped up their jeans and left the bathroom, most likely heading back to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve, now leaving the bathroom himself, decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steve, now leaving the bathroom himself, decided to actually go back to class since 1st Period is a few minutes from being over. As Steve opened the door to Mrs. Chang's classroom, the bell rang, releasing students to their next class, which in Steve's case, was Biology. As Steve grabbed his backpack from his desk and left with the rest of his changed peers, he heard Mrs. Chang's three voices calling out to them. \"Make sure you do the assigned reading for tomorrow class. There <i>will </i>be a quiz!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve became inundated with all the changed people around him, he decided to put his head down and make his way down the hall to Mrs.Shields classroom. Steve was in class with only about 12 other students, since it was more advanced that normal Biology classes, so he wasn't expecting too many people to be in class, what with the changes and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Steve opened the door, he was surprised to see six student bodies in the room. The first student, or students, was Natalie, one of the smartest girls in the class. She was now sharing her body with the three other girls in the class, Rachel, Emily and Sarah. Natalie and Sarah's brunette heads were on top of Natalie's extended shoulders while Rachel and Emily's blond heads had taken the place of Natalie's once very small breasts.Natalie's body now wore a customized shirt that allowed Rachel and Emily's heads to come out and be seen. Natalie's body also had eight arms, one pair for each head, as each pair was scribbling down notes before class began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the desk behind the girls sat Zach who was now merged with his girlfriend in a very unusual way. His girlfriend Erin's head now replaced his penis, which was poking out through the zipper in his jeans. Erin's \"neck\" now seemed to be very stretchy as she could extend and mover her head all the way up to her boyfriend's head for a kiss. It also seemed that she could take control of Zach's body whenever she wanted as she used his hands to fix the collar on his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of them, sat Adrian, one of the nerdiest kids in school. His head now sat on a very busty woman's body with tanned skin and long legs. It also seemed that another one of Steve's classmates, Jonathan, was trapped inside the body and was controlling it. Adrian kept talking to his new body and it used sign language to communicate back to his, or her, head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of Adrian and Jonathan sat Jeremy, Teddy and Spencer all three guys heads sharing a muscular male body that was at least 6'4\" tall. Each of their heads looked tiny compared to their now massive frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve took his seat behind Zach and Erin and waited for Mrs. Shields to come in the room. After a few minutes of waiting and studying his changed classmates, she finally came in and, of course, was also changed. The normal 65 year old woman now shared her 40 year old daughter, Carrie's, curvy body. Carrie had occasionally come to substitute when her mom was sick, so Steve had seen her before. What's changed is that now Mrs. Shields old head had changed into a copy of her daughter's, which now sat side by side on her widened shoulders. Carrie's body only had two arms and legs, but seemed to have gotten a bit curvier since Steve had last seen her. Their shared breasts were now easily DD's and their shared legs were a bit longer and shapely than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steve knew it, Mrs. Shields and Carrie had started class and began to pass out an assignment to do for the entirety of the period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided to...</span></div></div>",

Eventually, the bell rang and the rest of the class packed up and moved to their next class. The next class for Steve was history with Mr. Marshall just down the hall. It also happened to be the first class of the day that he had with his best friend, Benjamin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve grabbed his things and quickly made his way over to the History classroom a few doors down, dodging all the changed people along the way. He wasn't focusing on them at all. He just wanted to find Benjamin and figure out how to stop everything from changing. Once Steve reached the classroom, most of the students were already there, but his best friend was not one of them. Instead, just like everyone else, his classmates were all changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he noticed Amanda, who used to be one of the skinniest girls in class. Now, she had a much fuller figure, wider hips, and longer legs. Also added to Amanda, were the heads of Chris and Michael, the two guys she always hung out with. Their heads now replaced her small breasts on her chest. A second pair of arms also grew under Amanda's own pair. The left arm that grew was Chris's and the right arm belonged to Michael. It seemed they were only able to control their own arms as all three of them were on their separate phones, texting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to them was what seemed to be the faces of Marcus and Zachary on the breasts of a woman in her mid 20's. There was no head on the shoulders of the body, just the faces of the two guys replacing the woman's breasts. Their body wore a custom shirt that covered most of their torso, except their DD sized breast faces. Zachary was drinking some water on one side, while Marcus was eating a granola bar, as they waited for class to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of them, five of the girls volleyball team members now shared a gigantic 6'7\" body. All five heads of Ali, Meghan, Melanie, Claire and Taylor now shared the tall body, which sported 6 pairs of arms, 4 EE breasts and 4 muscular legs. They managed to barely fit in their seat, wearing their volleyball uniform, as they all stared at a computer in front of them on their desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of them was the smartest guy in the class, Leo, who now shared a body with the dumbest girl in class, Kendall. They both shared Kendall's body, with Leo's head on her shoulders, just to the right of her head,  and they were currently fighting over a homework assignment. Leo seemed to be helping Kendall understand their most recent assignment, but she was instead getting angry at him for not explaining it to her properly. As she continued to yell, Leo used Kendall's right arm to hold his head in frustration and let out a deep sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one of the star soccer players, Zach, was sitting at the front of the room. He looked completely normal, except coming from where his penis should have been, instead were two of the girls soccer team players, Kyra and Gina. Their heads now poked out of Zach's pants and seemed to control his legs, one leg per head. As they stretched out their legs, they revealed that the girl's hand's had replaced Zach's feet, allowing them to grab their pencils and notebooks for class with their manicured hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve took his seat in the back, with Benjamin's seat still currently vacant just next to him. Mr. Marshall then strode in, sharing his body with his wife and 26 year old daughter. Their heads rested on either side of Steve's teacher's head and, unlike Mrs. Chang, had their original personalities still in tact. As Mr. Marshall began to talk to the class about their homework assignment, the classroom door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late!\" Mr. Marshall's wife said, turning to the student coming in.

The only problem, which Steve should've expected, was that he was attached to someone else. Not just someone, however. It was the head cheerleader and Steve's secret crush, Jill. But those two weren't all. Her body now housed six total heads, all of which came from different backgrounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far left of Jill's body's shoulders sat Nadia, a black girl from the cheerleading squad. Her darker complexion contrasted with Jill's body and her pale skin. Next to Nadia, sat the head of Kayla, a pale redhead that was big into video games. Her hair was done up in a ponytail and her thin glasses sat on the brim of her nose. Next to Kayla, was Benjamin's head. He seemed to look normal, all things considered. To the right of his head was Jill's original head. Her face looked just as she did as usual, but her hair was done up in a bun. To the right of Jill's head was Michael, a kid that was really into acting. He was usually the star of the school plays and was always good at singing and dancing. Finally, on the far right of Jill's body sat the head of Abby. She one of the biggest sports players at the school, but you wouldn't know it looking at her. She played soccer, softball and basketball all while being one of the most attractive girls in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's body was also changed a bit to accommodate all the heads. Her shoulders had widened and thus, she had grown two extra breasts on either side of her originals. She now had three pairs of arms, each below the original pair and each looking exactly the same as the originals. Jill's body had also grown a third leg, right in between her original two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry we're late Mrs. Marshall,\" Jill said as her new body walked to the desk next to Steve. As the body sat down, Steve tried to get Benjamin's attention, without disrupting the whole class. He managed to catch the eye of Abby's head, which was closest to him. As her head looked at Steve questioningly, he whispered to her, \"Hey, can you get Benjamin for me? I gotta ask him something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby's head looked at Steve and said...</span></div></div>",

A flash of light is emitted from where the two would normally collide, and when the dust has settled, all four girls are connected. The new body looks about the same, but Steve can clearly see the torsos of the four girls have merged into one another. Even the clothes are now shared. Their hips and legs, however, are still separate, and anyone can tell that underneath that skirt are two sets of genitals, facing each other, waiting to be used on each other at a moment\u2019s notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s fuckin\u2019 do it, then,\u201d Riley shouts, pushing their new shared body to the wall.

Their body wore a fancy suit and tie, with slacks and dress shoes, a traditional work suit. As Steve watched them walk in, the 8 year-old's head began using the left arm she controlled to mess with the 14 year-old's hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, quit it, Julia! MOM! Julia's messing up my hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue, the parents walked in, sharing the mother's body.  The father's head sat just to the left of the mother's head while the rest of the body seemed to be just made up of the mother.  She was wearing a black dress that dropped down to her knees. She also had fairly decent C-cup breasts that were accentuated by her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia, Rebeca, enough fighting. We're just here to take a nice family picture and I won't have your arguing ruin it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you two, pull your acts together.

Her head was in the middle, her husbands to her right, her 20 year old daughter to her left.  Then her 14 year old was on the far right and her 8 year old was on the far left. Her body had also been altered to fit all of the heads.  Not only had the shoulders expanded, the mother's body had grown 4 more breasts on her torso, making it very wide. In addition, it seemed each head had a pair of arms, even though they were all copies of the mothers, right down to the jewelry and silver watch she was wearing, now appearing on 10 separate arms. Meanwhile, her lower half seemed to be completely normal, still wearing her black heals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the photographer finished up his pictures, the newly conjoined family stood up, very adeptly, and walked over to the main counter to pay.

The drummer and singer, male and female respectively, are sharing a body from the neck down, as their heads are on the male's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd is going wild. One woman takes her shirt off, only to reveal that two other female heads are replacing her breasts. The woman's arms are replaced with arms of the \"head boob\" women, each arm belonging to the woman on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man's and a woman's upper halves are attached to each other. However, the man's left arm is replaced with the woman's right leg, and the woman's right arm is replaced with the man's left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the two four-headed people that you were following dancing and embracing together.

This body, however, looked to belong to an older woman, at least someone in their early 40's.  The body was dressed very conservatively and was wearing black jeans and a collared shirt.  The guy used the left arm he controlled to stroke his girlfriend/body-mate's hair. The hand looked like it had red nail polish and a few wrinkles on it.  The girl returned the favor as they both returned to watching the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the theater, a guy in his 20's was sharing his body with two girls. Both girls looked to be kind of nerdy, with glasses and plain brown hair.  As the three watched the movie, you noticed that the girl's heads controlled the guys arms and legs, which was made apparent when one girl used an arm to fix her glasses on her face. Meanwhile the guy, whose head and body looked to be quite athletic and muscular, looked very unhappy that he was being forced to watch this movie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard noises behind you, you subtly turned and saw a body that housed 4 different heads. A black guy's head who looked in his 30's was making out with a black girl's head, who looked a little bit younger. Meanwhile an Asian guy's head was making out with an Asian woman's head, both of which looked in their 20's.  All of this was happening on a white woman's body which was wearing a black sweater and a short black skirt.  You saw one of the girl's hands rubbing her enormous DD breasts, while the other was slid down their skirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of watching all the other people...... </span></div></div>",

As he looked around for more people to change, he was suddenly met with what seemed to be a mall security guard.  This mall security guards body was male and fairly overweight, with hairy arms as well.  However as Steve looked up, he saw three beautiful women's heads on the body's shoulders.  The left head had red hair tied up in a bun, the middle head was a brunette with wavy flowing hair and the right head was a blond with straight hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, son, but you happen to fit the description of a stalker who has been following people around the mall today. Now that wouldn't happen to be you, would it?\" The middle head asked, as all three heads looked at you menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Steve could answer, the left head interjected. \"Listen kid, we're gonna need you to come with us back to our office for a little while. Just until we can clear all of this up. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain before Steve could protest, the body grabbed your shoulders and began to lead you to their office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bud, but this is just a precaution. No need to worry about anything,\" the right head told Steve, patting his shoulder with her hairy hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they all got to the security office, where there was another officer sitting at the desk.  This officer was actually the complete opposite of the first one.  Three male heads were all placed on a semi overweight woman's body.  The body was fairly tall and had at least C cup breasts, all covered by a uniform and black slacks.  All three heads looked up after the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This the one all the reports were made about?\"  The right male head asked the women.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not sure yet. We need to make some calls and figure it out. Do you guys mind covering the mall for a bit?\"  The middle female head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem ladies.\" The middle male head said as the shared female body stood up from the desk.  After adjusting their shirt, they went out the door that Steve had just come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid. Go have a seat over there and we'll come talk to you in a minute,\" The left head directed at Steve pointing to a chair in the back of the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went to sit down, Steve continued to watch the three female heads on the male body.  As the body sat down, they first adjusted the chair they were sitting in.  Then the right arm reached down to their crotch area, most likely to relieve an itch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of phone calls and computer typing, the ladies......</span></div></div>",

Just sign this waiver and you're all set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really wanting to stick around in an office all day, Steve signed the form and gave it back to the women.

Suddenly he heard yelling from a nearby clothing store. Getting a bit closer, Steve looked inside the glass window and saw an Indian man with what looked to be his wife's head next to his on his body.  She seemed to be yelling at him because he didn't want to buy some of the clothes she wanted to buy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Ronny, our body would look great in this shirt!\" the wife yelled while using the husband's right arm to hold up a frilly white dress shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time Melissa, I don't like frills! Why are you so obsessed with them! Just find another shirt already! You're making a scene!\"  The husband used his left arm to grab the shirt out of his other hand and put it back on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE! If that's how you feel about it! I'll just stay quiet for the rest of the day! Is that what you want!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conjoined couple began to yell again, so Steve decided to move on to somewhere else.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along some more, an interesting group of women caught his eye.  Three women were conjoined in one body, however one woman's legs had merged with the other two women's upper halves. The first woman's legs ended at the knees and went into the back's of each woman's head. The other two women also had their arms replaced with legs and their own legs were no longer there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the women had fairly big breasts, so every time they took a step, they would bounce around a bit. It looked quite weird seeing two women seemingly walking on their hands and supporting their friend attached above them. Steve could see them talking to each other and laughing, as they went into a nearby shoe store.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided to.......</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, the parents heads talked between themselves, something about their dinner plans that night.  The son on the mother's body was having a hard time cutting his chicken, so the mother stepped in and took control of their arms, cutting the chicken in smaller pieces, while still talking with her husband.  The daughter was having an equally hard time, so the father did the same with her fish sticks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched the family enjoy their meal, another sight caught Steve's eye.  Walking along the sidewalk, towards the restaurant, was another family.  This one, however, was changed in a very bizarre way.  It looked like a father, mother  and their what seemed to be 12 year old son, were sharing a very interesting body.  The father's head was in the middle, while the mother's head was on the right and the son's head was on the left.  The body itself looked to be the father's, but sported his wife's generous C cup breasts, which protruded from the red polo shirt they wore.  The body also had 6 arms: The father's right arm and mother's left arm on top, the mother's right arm and father's left arm below that, and the son's arms below them.  It also looked like the lower half was split, with the father's right leg and the mother's left leg supporting the body, hidden a bit by the black slacks they wore.  Steve watched as they entered the restaurant, before they disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust behind them, a group of 4 women sharing a body strode down the street.  Each head had a different hair color: one black, a redhead, a brunette and a blond.  Their torso sported four enormous DD breasts, shown off by the white low cut top they wore.  The body also had six arms, each of which had different nail polish on as well as jewelry and a watch on only one of them. They also had 5 legs under a brown knee high skirt, each of which wore black stiletto heels.  Each head wore expensive sunglasses as they strutted to the entrance of the restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, Steve decided to.......</span></div></div>",

His dress shirt, tie and tweed jacket clashed with the short blue &amp; white skirt and sneakers he now wore.

He managed to glance at her groin and sure enough a bulge was clearly evident in the front of her beige pants, yet her white blouse was still generously filled out by her impressive breasts. \"Clear the corridor people, come on\" Mrs Miles said in a dep voice, even deeper than Jill's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was about to turn back and talk to Jill when suddenly the necklace caused another mass reality shift, and the next thing he knew...he and everyone else had the bodies of Japanese schoolgirls, dressed appropriately. Everyone's hair was jet black and either in ponytails or pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, when he spoke, all that left his mouth was fluent Japanese, yet he knew what he was saying. Jill and Benjamin also spoke to him in their new language, and strangely he understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're alright?\" Jill asked, as she brushed her hair behind her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah, I suppose\" Steven muttered in reply, as people rushed back and forth around him. He couldn't tell who was now a teacher and who was a student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sudden shift then occurred, leaving everyone with abnormally large cocks pushing out their navy-colored, pleated skirts. \"Oh great! Now we're futanari honeys!\" Steven sighed, as he reached down and caressed his new appendage, which was way out of proportion on his petite Asian body. He then grabbed the necklace which was around his neck and wondered what the hell it was going to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babes,\" Jill said in her new dialect, \"Lets head for somewhere private\" she whispered into your ear, as her own massive dick stood to attention, lifting her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...keep in your pants sweetheart\" Steven told Jill, knowing that such a thing wasn't possible considering the size of Jill's new equipment, which put even his 'monster' to shame. The three of them then headed out of the building and into the light of day. The sight of hundreds of 'well-hung' Japanese schoolgirls walking around was certainly peculiar, but only to Steven.</span></div></div>",

He didn't feel like himself because he wasn't himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon you three\" another of the hermaphrodite Japanese schoolgirls said as 'she' walked past Steven, Jill and Benjamin. As it turned out, that 'schoolgirl' was in fact the school principal Mr Peterson (age 49), whose hair was now up in kinky pigtails, and he had a futa cock even larger than Jill's, as well as a gaping pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you stupid thing! Work!\" Steven grumbled to the necklace, as he grabbed hold of it and turned away from Jill and Benjamin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin then spoke out. \"What lesson we got next?\" he asked, in his cute sounding Japanese voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...biology!\" Jill responded, rolling her gorgeous, emerald green, slanted eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, cutting up some frogs! That gets old really quick!\" Steven sighed, as he was briefly distracted by his own large futa cock shifting under his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know, there are some aspects of biology that excite me\" Jill suddenly cooed, as she moved up to Steven and started showing affection, running one hand up and down his cock while caressing her own immense dick with her other one. Meanwhile, Benjamin just looked the other way, feeling like a third wheel, albeit a very cute, well-hung third wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's protests about their very public location seemed to have any effect on a horny Jill, as she continued feeling him up.

And on his large feet were 2-inch heeled leather pumps, his bony, hairy legs were on full display, and Steven almost gagged at the sight.

Bouncing up and down on her bare toes, Rachel tugged at her blue shorts and her oversized \u201cProject A-KO\u201d shirts ruffled across her slight torso.  Waving her thin arms up and down as her long blonde hair bounced everywhere, Rachel looked like she had to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, oh, oh!  I know!  If that necklace can do anything, why don\u2019t you give me super powers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven scoffed.  \u201cYeah, like THAT\u2019S a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel pouted.  \u201cAwe, come on.  You know you can always change me back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sighed.  \u201cUgh.  I would think there would be better things to do with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stared at him.  \u201cLike what?  Make Jill fall in love with you?  You know how those things always turn out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven blushed.  He was thinking about doing just that.  Shaking his head, he grunted.  \u201cWhat type of super power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel giggled and started jumping up and down again.  \u201cOh, oh, oh!  I want to be able to fly.  And have, uh super strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven sniffed.  \u201cIs that all?  You want to be Supergirl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stopped bouncing around for a moment, contemplating her choices.  \u201cWell, sure I guess.\u201d  Her expression changed as she grew excited once more.  \u201cBut Supergirl on steroids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven gave her a confused look.  \u201cSupergirl on steroids?  What does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel waved her arms.  \u201cYou know, steroids.  I want big muscles too.  Bigger muscles than anyone!  So if Supergirl has bigger muscles than anyone, that would make her the strongest super hero around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven started to put the ideas from his sister together.  Give Rachel the powers of Supergirl, but with huge muscles.  Muscles that could expand as big as she wanted.  Grow as strong as she so desired.  Not even finishing his thought, the necklace began to warp reality and soon Rachel could feel her body changing.  She could feel herself grow stronger.  And stronger.  And stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, oh, oh!  Steven, it\u2019s working!  It\u2019s working!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s tiny 4 foot 10 inch body began to throb and grow as she became more and more powerful!  Muscles out of nowhere began to press out across her body in every direction.  And not just any old muscles, but super powered, steroid fueled muscles.  Steven could hardly finish his thoughts as they became reality right in front of him.  Rachel\u2019s super muscles pounded forward and ripped her shirt and pants right off, showcasing the physique of a top level female bodybuilder.  Blushing, Steven quickly thought about a costume and a super flexible string bikini top popped into view across her chest and a thong came into view across her bottom.  The fact that he would offer such minimal clothing seemed odd, but only for a moment.  Rachel\u2019s muscle transformation tore his thoughts back to his wish.  Make his sister a Supergirl.  A Supergirl on steroids.  Give her the ability to flex her muscles as big as she wanted.  As hard as she could imagine.  As strong as she could dream!  And the bigger her muscles became, the stronger she would grow!  And even when her muscles would go back to normal, she would retain all of the strength from her mega flexes.  His breath quickened as Rachel squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, yes!  Make me bigger, Steven!  Make me stronger!  Give me the strength of hundred Super Girl\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s body was soon overflowing with the biggest, strongest muscles Steven could imagine.  Her calves blew out beyond the size of twin soccer balls.  Her thighs crashed forth bigger than bags of cement!  Her abs were an insane cobblestone path of hundreds of black hole proof muscles.  Her super chest blasted forth twin basketball sized spheres of pure muscle power with the strength to bench press 20 air craft carriers!  And when she brought her arms to bare, her biceps exploded upward, knocking Steven off his feet!  The shock wave from the power of her bicep flex blew the walls off their house and sent the ceiling flying into the next neighborhood!  One flex had generated the power of a blockbuster bomb as her bicep detonated up over her fist.  Up over her head and up into the sky to 20 feet high!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven opened his eyes while still on his back and could see Rachel\u2019s biceps reach impossible heights!  Her biceps had to be 500 inches around!  He glanced down toward Rachel\u2019s smiling face that was surrounded by an insane array of muscles across her chest, shoulders and traps!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me more Steven!  Make me stronger!  Make me bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his head as Rachel\u2019s biceps started climbing upward once again, sending out another shock wave that ripped houses out the foundation across the neighborhood!  Steven was pressed hard into the ground as Rachel\u2019s biceps sailed upward to 40 feet high, to 80 feet high to 200 feet high!  And he was no longer wishing for it.  Rachel was!  He had given her this ability!  And Rachel was yelling with glee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, YES!  I\u2019m the biggest!  I\u2019m the strongest!  Nobody can stand in my way!  I can punch comets to dust!  I can lift continents!  I can destroy armies just by flexing my unlimited muscles!  Nuclear bombs won\u2019t even make me blink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steven shook his head, he had to think.  The power had gone to Rachel\u2019s head.  He had to stop this, to make things normal.  But even as he tried to do so, Rachel giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s too late for that big brother.  You gave me these abilities.  Only I can give them up now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her impossible flex, her muscles receded and she walked toward Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice outfit you gave me.  Kind of reveling though for a 12 year old girl.  Even if I am the strongest girl in the galaxy now!  And oh, what fun I\u2019m going to have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling down at Steven, Rachel blinked her dazzling blue eyes.  \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet you could help, hmmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked around.  He didn\u2019t want to help.  He wanted her back to normal.  He wanted all of this back to normal.  But he couldn\u2019t.  At least not yet.  As Rachel was flying loop-de-loops in the air above him, Steven began to think.  The only thing he could do was to try and bring the strongest Super Heroes and villains he could think of to try and defeat her, to make her give up her powers.  Which unfortunately for him, was just what Rachel wanted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Big, bad, earth shaking muscles to put any man on earth to shame!  Now THAT would be cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven handed her the necklace and she put it on, smiling up at Steven.  His 5 foot 10 inch frame carried the 200 pounds of muscle like a football linebacker.  Her 5 foot tall frame was thin and weak.  Her blonde hair fell over her shoulders of the blue t-shirt and her thin legs stuck out of her shorts down to her bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then made her wish.  She\u2019d get the muscle size of her brother to start.  Then she\u2019d really have some fun.  And then she wondered how strong he was.  With the necklace on, she could tell his strength matched his muscle size.  He was strong, but no stronger than any man that size.  Rachel giggled again.  She would have none of that.  Oh no.  She would have massive strength too.  Thinking of the Hulk video game she had playing she figured that she wanted that kind of strength!  Or perhaps that of Wonder Woman from the Justice League game.  But first things first.  She wanted muscles to match her brother.  And by concentrating on that, Rachel\u2019s muscles began to pulse and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs quickly piled on slabs of strong, rippling muscles.  Her calves expanded into softball sized balls of power.  Her thighs ground forward to match those of a world class sprinter.  And along with her muscle filled glutes, her muscle filled lower body ripped her shorts up to the waist.  Her shirt filled with muscles immediately and just like her brother, exploded off her body and fell to the floor.  Rachel was sporting a massive torso to match her brother\u2019s.  Her chest was strong and thick, her back was muscular and wide, her shoulders and traps bulged up and her abs were a six pack of solid muscle.  Rachel smiled as she brought up her right arm and flexed her bicep.  The muscle consolidated and crunched into a ball of muscle 15 inches around.  Stripped of fat, the bicep split was clearly seen, the tricep dipped low to match the large mound of muscle resting on her arm.  Rachel looked up at her brother who nodded his head, admiring the muscles that matched his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s blue eyes flickered mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, big brother, let\u2019s compare biceps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stood in front of her and leaned to the side, flexing his arm so that they could compare.  His arm bunched up and matched that of his little sister, maybe looking a bit bigger on his larger frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad Rachel, you\u2019re bicep is about as big as mine.  Nobody will messing with us at school any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel giggled as she now wished for muscles bigger than Steven.  And just as he was about to release his flex, Rachel\u2019s arm twitched, and began to slowly grow, punctuated with an unearthly throb matching her heartbeat.  And each beat pushed the bicep a little bigger.  Soon her bicep matched his, then it grew bigger, reaching 16 inches around in a few seconds.  Steven\u2019s eyes widened as he could see her bicep peak rise up over his.  A few moments later, the peak rose higher, exposing more of her massive bicep behind his.  At 17 inches around, Rachel\u2019s bicep was clearly larger, at 18 inches there was no doubt as to who had the bigger arm.  Rachel giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm.  It looks like my girl arm larger than your man arm big brother.  But why stop there?  I\u2019m sure there are still people with bigger biceps.  And stronger biceps.  But not for long!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel started pumping her arm, pressing a full inch of girl muscle into her arm each time she reached the apex and clenched her fist.  Steven remained frozen in his spot, watching with fascination at the transformation of his younger sister.  19 inch biceps were soon 20 and then 21 inches.  And with each flex, Rachel wished to double her strength.  By the time her bicep had reached 22 inches she was the strongest human on the planet and her muscles began to crackle as they grew harder and denser.  Soon Rachel\u2019s bicep was rising up higher and higher above Steven\u2019s to 24 inches, to 26 inches!  He had never seen a bicep this big!  And each time she pumped her arm, the bicep grew bigger!  At 28 inches, her arm looked surreal.  At 30 inches it was completely eclipsing his, having now doubled in size!  Steven finally released his flex and turned around.  Rachel stood there, holding her incredible flex.  Steven gasped.  All of her muscles had doubled in size!  She was sporting muscles to put any bodybuilder on earth to shame!  Massive, tree trunk legs curved wickedly into a narrow set of steel belted abs and back out into lats as wide a door and a twin bowling ball sized set of pecs!  Her left arm flexed a massive horseshoe tricep that jutted out six inches and right arm was now flexing up a gigantic 32 inch bicep that peaked up near her wrist!  The muscles were all rippled across her flawless skin and with her small joints looked gigantic.  Her beautiful blue eyes sparkled and her blonde hair shined.  And not only that but these massive muscles carried the strength of over 100,000 men!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we\u2019re talking some REAL muscles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her flex, Rachel grabbed her brother\u2019s arm and quickly pulled him outside.  Reaching down at the corner of their house, Rachel slammed her arms into the ground, gripping the foundation.  She looked over at her stunned brother who was rubbing his sore forearm bruised from her steel grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd not only that, but we\u2019re talking about some REAL strength!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel pulled against the house and with explosive force, ripped the entire house out the ground shooting dirt and rocks all around.  Standing back up, Steven\u2019s eyes went wide and his jaw dropped as his little sister hoisted their house up over her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this isn\u2019t all that heavy either!  Just image what else I can lift Steven!  Tanks!  Trains!  Maybe even skyscrapers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel carefully placed the house back down, not looking to destroy it.  At least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo big brother, now that I\u2019m the strongest, most muscular girl on earth, what ever shall we do next?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tony\u2019s arms grew much thicker and wider. His legs doubled in width as his muscles inflated dramatically, ripping his jeans.

His shoulders widened dramatically while his pectorals pushed out forwards and sideways at the same time, ripping his shirt in half, from the collar to the bottom. Finally, his torso grew wider as rows of abdominals popped up on his flat stomach.

His arms were longer than hers even though hers were bigger around, but she knew that, so she didn't simply try to hold him away from the necklace but shoved him across the room when he grabbed for it. At the same time, her latest wish to the necklace was correcting the reach deficit she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven watched as Rachel grew bigger - but not just more muscular, she was now getting truly bigger. His little twerp of a sister was rapidly growing taller as her muscles seemed to become even more magnificent. By the time he'd picked himself up she had become over 7' tall and now had plenty of reach to keep him outside his arms length and this was just the beginning. The necklace was pouring greater and greater strength into her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so much better - at my old height I might have been able to pick up skyscrapers, but I need to be bigger to have leverage to support them long enough to throw them - I should probably be at least 2 stories tall if I want to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Steven watched as Rachel grew to near 20', the room around them transforming to accommodate the giantess resident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels really good, and look how pretty I've become - but I could still be a lot prettier, I could be so beautiful that men will do anything for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Steven noticed the necklace was not around his sister's neck, but in his hand - he had apparently gotten a grip on it before she threw him across the room. That meant he had been the one to just wish his sister 20' tall - because she was playing against his giantess fantasies. And if he gave her what she'd just asked for he'd be reduced to her little play thing, using the necklace for her so that he was the one taking most of the risk. In fact, he figured having all these transformation happen to his sister would be exactly the type of evil side effect this style of magic necklace always seemed to have in stories.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven looked around the room, at how the entire house had seemed to have changed in order to accommodate Rachel's latest transformation.  The walls stretched for at least 30 feet to give his sister room to walk around.  The couch was more than double the size it was before.  Even a few of the chairs around the house resembled something a giant would sit in.  Only it wasn't for a giant.  It was for his 12 year old sister.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Now this is more like it,\" Rachel said, casually flexing her massive arms as she looked around at the new design of the house.  \"It's like...this house was made just for me.\"  She reached for the necklace, only to find it wasn't around her neck anymore.  She frantically searched on the floor around her, trying to find it, eventually falling to her knees, the quake from her massive body almost causing Steven to fall over.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRachel glanced over at her brother, noticing he was holding something in his hand.  She calmed down, taking a deep breath and stood up to her full height.  \"Oh, Steven?\" she called out to him, in the sweetest voice she could muster.  \"Could you come over here for a moment?  I have to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven knew his sister knew he had the necklace. The last thing he needed to do was to walk over to her.   He contemplated running up the stairs, maybe jumping out of a window in the bathroom and running down the street, hoping his sister would be too slow to keep up with him.  But, against his better judgment, his legs rebelled against him, first one foot reached forward, then another, until, before he knew it, he was halfway across the room.  He tried to stop walking, tried to convince his brain that this was a bad idea, but it was no use.  It was as if he had no control over his body anymore.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen Steven thought about the last thing Rachel said before he yanked the necklace off of her.  \"I could be so beautiful that men will do anything for me.\"   He glanced up at his sister's face, as it practically radiated a beauty he had never seen before.  But her beauty wasn't the reason why he was still walking over to her.  It was the way she worded the last part of the sentence;  \"..men will do anything for me,\"  that filled him with fear. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe started to panic, knowing he was already under his sister's control and, probably every other guy the world over was as well, he reasoned.  He tried to think of another wish:  to be 100 feet tall, to be twice as muscular as his sister.  He even tried to teleport himself to the other side of the world, just to keep the necklace out of his sister's reach, but his brain wouldn't cooperate.  Steven knew the only way he could make another wish now was if Rachel allowed him to.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn another three steps, Steven was standing in front of Rachel, her angelic-looking face peering down at him.  He looked straight ahead, suddenly realizing he barely reached his sister's gigantic calf now, a calf that was bigger than he was at this point.  He felt like a toddler standing next to her and felt just as helpless.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRachel bent down and extended a huge hand towards him.  \"Give me the necklace,\" she demanded, in a deeper, though still prepubescent-sounding voice.  His arm instinctively responding to her command, Steven watched as he reached up and put the magic piece of jewelry in her massive palm.  \"Good boy,\" she replied, before standing up and putting the necklace around her neck again, a longer chain appearing out of nowhere.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Now, time for some bigger clothes,\" Rachel said, before a simple t-shirt and a pair of shorts covered her body, though they did nothing to hide the massive amounts of muscle hiding underneath the fabric.  She sat down in one of the humongous recliners made especially for her and began rocking back and forth, contemplating her next move.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So, what should I wish for now?\" she asked her brother, who meekly looked up at her, unsure of what to say.  Not that it mattered, anyway.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, you could always wish everything back to normal,\" Steven offered, taking a handful of steps back, just to be able to see all of his sister's face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Rachel replied, finally deciding on something.  \"I wish...\"</span></div></div>",

Steven watched as the entire house morphed around him.  The walls grew even further, turning from a drab off-white color made of wood to an immaculate place made primarily from ivory and adorned with gold.  Steven watched as the room stretched for half a mile, it seemed, as various paintings of his relatives, both living and dead, hung on the wall, each one dressed in only the most expensive clothing.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe recliner Rachel was sitting in morphed into a throne, the seat made with red velvet, while the four legs and the base was made entirely of silver, with emeralds of various colors dotted all around it.  Steven looked up into his sister's face, as it appeared to become even more beautiful than before, if that were possible, while her clothes turned from an ordinary t-shirt and shorts to a pair of pajamas, made only of the finest silks, with her initials etched into the top, near her left breast.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA few steps grew around the throne Rachel was sitting in, causing her to rise even higher from Steven's perspective and making her even more of an intimidating presence.  A crown was adorned on her head, and a royal scepter was leaning against her throne.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven felt something on his naked body and looked down, as a pair of pants and a shirt suddenly formed on him.  They weren't as expensive-looking as his sister's clothes, but at least they covered up the naughty parts.  In fact, they looked more like the clothes of a servant than the clothes of a budding prince...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Rachel, what have you done?\" Steven asked, cautiously taking a few steps towards his sister.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What?\" she replied, shrugging her shoulders. \"I always wanted to be a princess.  Now I am.\"  She casually began twirling the necklace around, looking down at her brother with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"But...what about mom and dad?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about them,\" Rachel said, pointing to the back of the room, where two large golden doors were starting to open.  \"They're coming.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven turned around to see his mom and dad walking towards them, their business trip into the city over.  Both were dressed as a king and queen should be, with crowns sitting on their heads and long robes draped over their shoulders as they walked.  But Steven noticed something different about them.  The ground began shaking as they came closer, every footstep rattling the room and almost causing a few paintings to fall off the wall.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was then that Steven knew what was going on, what Rachel had done with her wish when she used the necklace...</span></div></div>",

He realized that staying in the house probably wasn't a good idea with his substantial size disadvantage, at least right now, and suddenly he found himself outside, across the moat from a castle, which he assumed was his family's.  He decided to take a walk through the rest of the neighborhood, which, aside from the sudden presence of a medieval castle, seemed as he remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he strolled along the sidewalk, he thought of the massive size of his family.  It wasn't something he had gotten used to yet, but he began to imagine himself their size too.  After a short time thinking these thoughts, he felt the necklace warm up.  The power that began flowing from it was very subtle, but as he walked, he noticed his head growing further from the sidewalk, and his steps began to have more bounce and force to them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped by a store window and looked at his reflection, and was stunned to see that he was now an incredible nine feet tall!  Not only that, but his muscles had swelled up to a rather impressive size, maybe not as impressive as his parents', but still mighty nice.  His shoulders had widened to be over four feet wide, and his biceps were much more defined than before.  His clothes had grown somewhat with him, but were still straining to keep his hulk covered.  Just for fun, he flexed his muscles, which bulged even further, ripping his shirt to shreds just like The Hulk.  His pants began to burst at the seams too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of mercy for his clothing, he relaxed, and smiled at himself.  He was very happy with the results, and as he continued to stare at his reflection, he felt that this was a good size to stay.  Not wanting to appear too vain, however, he continued to walk, and wondered what else he could do with this necklace.</span></div></div>",

They had been friends since elementary school, and the three of them were hardly ever seen apart from each other. People who didn't know them would often confuse them for brothers, because they acted and even looked so much alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Steven?\" Dustin asked, raising his hand high above his head to slap a high five. Steven was slightly amused at his friend, who all used to be pretty close to him in height and stature, now struggling to reach up to his chest-level. He slapped Dustin's hand back, but not used to his new strength yet, he hit him pretty hard, nearly knocking Dustin down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy there big guy,\" Dylan said, chuckling. \"Not all of us can be goliaths like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Steven said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, just what I get for being friends with a muscle god,\" Dustin said as he rubbed his now-sore arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it does have it's benefits,\" Derrick piped in as he lightly smacked Steven in the backside.  \"Like--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two boys chimed in: \"--Never getting picked on at school!\" they all finished simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven chuckled lightly to himself. This was nothing unusual for his three friends; they always were finishing each others' sentences, and they would often speak in unison as if they were reading off of a script. In fact, sometimes he imagined that the three of them were one person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what seemed like a blink of an eye, the necklace warmed up, and when Steven looked back to his friends, he was shocked to see that they had merged into one!  They were the same height as before, and from the chest down, they looked like any normal teenage boy. Their shoulders had gotten a little wider, and it was to accommodate the most stunning thing of all: all three of the boys' heads were together on the same set of shoulders! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Dylan, who was now the leftmost head, said. \"And that was something that definitely would have happened otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most kids have acne or voice cracks to deal with,\" Dustin, the middle head, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had all that, times three!\" Derrick, the right head, exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was stunned. He didn't know what was more unbelievable: that his friends were now a character straight out of Monty Python, or that they still seemed to act exactly the same. In fact, if he closed his eyes, he wouldn't be able to tell any difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was broken by a loud growling sound emanating from the stomach of his friend(s). \"Boy, we sure are hungry!\" Dylan, turning to the other two heads, said. \"Let's go get something to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Derrick exclaimed. \"Why don't we go over to Pizza Garden? They've got that all-you-can-eat buffet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Dustin said, \"but this time, can I get a slice or two of the BBQ-Chicken? You two hogged it all last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, Steven,\" all three heads said in unison, as they walked off towards the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven smiled to himself. Some very interesting things had happened so far today, and he got the feeling that they were only just beginning.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven continued walking through the square, not heading in any particular direction.  As he was thinking to himself, he wasn't really paying attention to where he was going, and he found himself in front of an elementary school.  He realized that this was the school where his little sister had gone...at least he thought it was, though all the transformation and changing that had happened that day left his mind a little fuzzy.  He decided to explore this school a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked closer, he saw that one of the classroom windows were open, and inside, a class of first graders were practicing math problems at the chalkboard.  \"Fifty-seven plus eleven, Jessica,\" the teacher said to a girl standing at the chalkboard.  \"C'mon, you can do this.  I know you can!\"  Steven watched as the girl wrote the numbers on the board, then added them together by counting, coming up with the right answer.  \"Good job, Jessica!  Sixty-eight is correct!\"  The rest of the class clapped quietly, and Jessica returned to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Steven thought to himself as he watched this unfold before him.  \"The teacher is trying to make math fun, but it's not that easy.  Perhaps I can help, by giving the kids something to work with.\"  The necklace warmed up again, and Steven knew that he had control over the situation.  He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, next up is Max,\" the teacher said, as an energetic brown-haired boy jumped out of his seat and ran to the board.  \"Alright, Max, now the problem I want you to do is forty-two plus eighteen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax wrote the problem on the board, then stared at it for a second as he tried to figure it out.  Finally, he turned around and said, \"I just can't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher shook her head and smiled.  \"Yes you can, Max.  Just picture it this way.  You're forty-two inches tall right now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax shrugged.  \"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the teacher said.  \"Now let's see what happens when we add eighteen inches.  Let's all count together.  Ready, class? One, two, three...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class was counting, Max began to increase in height, gaining an inch for every number that was said.  \"...Four, five, six...\" Steven smirked, and realized that, just like his other imaginings that became real, no one else noticed what was happening; they all took it for reality.  \"...Nine, ten, eleven...\" The boy was now a full foot taller than he had been, and still going.  He was now getting to be almost as tall as the teacher.  Steven could see that Max was smiling and enjoying the lesson.  \"...Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen!\" The class stopped counting, and Max stopped growing, standing tall and proud at an even five feet tall, the size of a boy twice his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, class, let's get out the measuring tape,\" the teacher said as she pulled it out of her purse, and quickly stretched it from Max's feet to the top of Max's head.  \"Aaaand, seventy inches exactly!\"  The teacher slid shut the measuring tape, and turned Max back around to the board.  \"So you see, Max, when you add the eight to the two, it becomes ten, and so it adds one to the next set of numbers, the tens place.\"  Max seemed to be understanding it now, and he wrote \"70\" on the board as the answer to the problem.  Beaming, both from getting the answer right and from gaining the eighteen inches in height, he returned to his desk, which was now too little for him, causing him to have to squeeze in and bend over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who wants to go next?\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me! Me! Me!\"  Almost the whole class raised their hand, begging to do the next problem.  Steven smiled.  He had succeeded in making math fun and enjoyable for this group., and knew it was time to move on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Steven was still getting used to his new body, he realized that his wandering had taken him to the local city park.  It was one of his favorite places to hang out, as he loved to people watch.  And today being a weekend, he had plenty of people to watch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park was on the waterfront, and the river bank was one of the most beautiful parts of the city, where everyone loved to assemble and spend time on nice days.  People were playing Ultimate Frisbee on the lawn, a group of kids were chasing each other in what Steven assumed was a game of tag, and some teenagers had stripped down to their underwear and dove into the river, splashing around and having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat caught Steven's eye, however, was a couple that was sitting down on a blanket, having a picnic.  The couple couldn't be more than fifteen or sixteen, and the way the guy acted so shy and nervous, he guessed this was one of their first dates.  Sitting down on a bench a couple dozen yards away, Steven watched as the boy talked nervously.  He thought back to some of his first dates, and remembered how nerve-wracking they were, but how rewarding that feeling could be.  While reminiscing, he thought to himself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if they could skip the first date nerves and already be comfortable with each other?'  Because he was deep in thought, he didn't notice when the necklace warmed up and began its magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout realizing what he had done, Steven turned his attention back to the couple, but noticed that something was different.  Now, instead, the couple was in each others' arms, with the girl lying her head down in the guy's lap.  'That was fast,' Steven thought to himself.  He then put two and two together and realized what had happened.  After an initial hesitation, he then felt rather pleased with himself, having caused something good to happen to the two strangers.  'It's always nice to see two love birds rather than two people being awkward around each other.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the necklace began to warm up.  'Uh oh,' Steven said.  'What did I wish for this time?'  As he looked on, stunned, he saw that the two lovers began to transform.  Their heads shrank a little, and their necks receded and grew more stiff.  Their bodies began to grow plump, but their legs began to thin out rapidly.  Their hair began to thicken all over their body, and changed into what Steven soon recognized as feathers.  After a few crazy moments, Steven realized that he was looking at two giant doves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Steven said aloud.  He didn't know what was weirder: that two five-foot-tall birds were now picking the ground for worms and bugs around the park, or that the other people there didn't seem to notice and/or care!  He quickly pictured the original couple back in his mind, and focused his energy on changing them back.  When he opened his eyes again, he was relieved to see the couple back to their old selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew,\" Steven said, and he decided he needed to go somewhere else before his thoughts affected the world again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Neither Rachel or his parents seemed to mind, since they were already incredibly big and strong as it is, and all they cared about at that moment, was to prepare something to eat for dinner. Having those huge muscles just increased their appetite, and they quickly went into the kitchen and started looking for something to eat. Since they were all very muscular, they decided to create a huge salad, consisting of a large variety of spinach, carrots, broccoli, peas, green beans, and a wide selection of herbs and spices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Steve went outside, hoping to meet more muscular people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish other guys would grow big and muscular whenever they would look at me or talk to me\" he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he was wearing the necklace around his neck. Right away, the cursed necklace began to glow around him. Whoever would glance at Steve from now on, as long as he were a male, he would grow big and muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Steve was walking down the street, a kid approached him while riding his skateboard. The boy was wearing his kneepads, his elbow pads, and his wrist guards, along with a black helmet on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was riding on the street and he just briefly glanced towards the sidewalk where he spotted Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the kid was overcome by an intense tingling feeling, which caused him to jump off his board and remain standing on the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the heck...?\" the boy wondered, as every muscle in his body tensed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of the blue, every muscle in the kid's body started to expand rapidly! His chest ballooned out forward and sideways, practically ripping the front of his t-shirt in half! His arms thickened at an alarming rate, as his biceps turned into bowling balls of power and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh! Crap! What is happening? AAAAAHHH!!!\" the boy gasped, as his muscles continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's abdominals popped up over his flat stomach, while his entire torso practically widened by a foot. His legs grew thick and muscled, and his calves inflated like helium balloons, which were pumped up with air, until they were bigger than soccer balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growth stopped, the boy was as muscular as a junior bodybuilder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow! I... I... What happened?\" the boy wondered, as he looked down at his amazing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor kid had to bend down just to see his feet, because his chest was so big, it was blocking his view. His shoulders were so wide, that his arms were hanging from his sides at a 45-degree angle. His shoulders were almost 4 feet wide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this growth happened, just because the kid had glanced at Steven! And, to make matters even more fun, everybody else would think that the kid had always been this muscular, from this point forward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle-boy slowly walked over to his skateboard and stepped on it again. As he rolled forward, he finally passed Steven and turned the corner. He met up with another boy, who had considered it perfectly normal, that the kid was so muscular...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Steve continued to walk through the neighborhood, until he reached a busy intersection. And then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven decided to have some fun with the necklace and decided to go to the shopping mall that afternoon. After all, it was the week before Christmas, and the mall was going to be crowded with all the holiday shoppers, who were there to take advantage of the many deals and bargains that were being offered by the retailers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Steven had parked his car and had gotten out, he was approached by three teenage boys, who were wandering around the parking lot. These boys were probably about thirteen or fourteen years old, and they looked like they were all in middle school. They seemed skinny and lanky, and none of them looked overly muscular at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the three boys glanced at Steven, they were overcome by a powerful, tingling sensation. The necklace began to glow bright blue, as the boys\u2019 muscles began to inflate rapidly while Steven looked on and grinned as the three teens hulked out before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! This is so cool\u2026\u201d Steven grinned. \u201cSo much fun to watch kids become muscular\u2026 I just hope each kid grows in a different way, so they don\u2019t all look alike\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace sensed Steven\u2019s wish, and immediately acted upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first boy, named Harry, started to grow slightly taller. His arms bulged out bigger than the rest, while his legs and chest still grew to become very muscular. His biceps became almost freakish, to the point where they were as big and as hard as bowling balls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second boy, named Isaac, found that his legs grew thicker and bigger than the others. His quads and his calves were just enormous, sticking out and growing to amazing sizes! His calves inflated to the size of soccer balls, and his quads thickened and widened to twice as wide as before, covered with thick layers of muscles and with layers of veins running over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third boy, named James, also grew bigger. But, in his case, his pectorals shot out and kept on growing. His pecs pushed out further and further, until they were sticking out as if he was walking around with two bricks in his chest. They had become as big as two mighty beach balls, thick and hard, making his shoulders wide and broader than those of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d James gasped, when the odd growth spurt was all over. Of course, the boy had completely ripped out of his t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap!\u201d Isaac shouted, as he looked down and noticed how his calves and quads had ripped out of his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Harry wondered, as he flexed his huge biceps. He had ripped through the sleeves of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Steven just smiled, as he turned around and walked into the mall through the glass door. Who knows how many other guys he would run into, when he was there? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All it took was just one glance at Steven, and all three of them turned into junior bodybuilders. Now, they were walking around the mall, and everyone had accepted it as being perfectly normal for these three boys to be that muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Steven walked through the glass doors, leading into the mall, he walked past several ladies until he finally came across a couple with two kids. Right away, the husband and his teenage son froze, as they began to hulk out the minute they glanced at him! The man became bigger and wider, with huge pecs and thick, powerful arms. The boy, on the other hand, grew amazing legs, as wide as columns of steel, with layers of muscle and veins, while his calves exploded until they were as big and as round as soccer balls. When the growth spurt was over, the father and the son just grinned, as they went along as if nothing had happened and everyone seemed to accept the fact that they were so muscular!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just laughed as he passed the food court. Every male, which looked up and saw him, would hulk out and grow more muscular. No matter if he was a grown man, a teen, or a young kid, every male who was there would become more muscular if they looked up and glanced at Steven! Eventually, all the man in the food court ended up being ripped and muscular! Steven loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven got in line in front of the pizza place and ordered a sweet tea and a slice of pizza. He sat down and enjoyed his lunch, before he cleaned up his lunch and went into the bathroom to freshen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Steven walked into the men\u2019s bathroom, he found himself being all alone. He used the toilet and then he washed his hands. He was just rinsing the soap off his hands when he heard the door open. As he looked up, he noticed that somebody had walked into the men\u2019s bathroom. Steven smiled, because he knew it had to be another male. If this guy would just glance at him, he would hulk out in the bathroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven dried his hands and tossed the paper towel in the trash when he saw who the other person was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A boy named Jared walked into the men's bathroom carrying a plastic bag containing some wrapped gifts for Christmas. Steven was standing on the far side of the bathroom, where the sinks were, washing his hands, when the teenager walked in. The boy didn't notice him at first, for he went to the urinal and did his thing, before walking over to the other side of the building, where Steve was standing. Steve was still wiping the water from his hands, when the boy walked up to the sink, located right next to him, and started washing his hands with soap and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" Steve said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared finally looked over and noticed Steven. Instantly, the necklace began to glow, and the powers began to take control of the boy's body. Steven's mind was flooded with the boy's thoughts and desires, and he knew right away that Jared just loved muscular guys, and he had always dreamed of becoming big and muscular. The necklace was made for this kind of transformation, and it quickly shot out a light blue ray of light which engulfed Jared's body from head to toe, causing his muscles to stiffen before they started to inflate rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What.... What's happening to me?\" Jared shouted, as he stumbled backwards and almost bumped with his back into the tiled wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wishes are about to come true, Jared!\" Steven grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh.... My muscles hurt.... They're burning... all over me....\" Jared squealed, as he dropped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared's chest began to inflate rapidly, pushing up against his shirt and filling out his collar and his sleeves to the point of tearing it to shreds. Within moments, Jared had hulked out as his pectorals burst out of his shirt, ripping the fabric from the collar all the way down the middle to the bottom of the shirt. His arms thickened as well, and his biceps grew so big, that his sleeves tore as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRIIIIIPPPPPPP!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHHHHHH!\" he screamed, as his body continued to grow. \"Help me! HELP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, his legs continued to bulge, growing thicker, longer and wider at the same time, filling his shorts with outrageous muscle! Thick layers of muscles covered his quads, while his calves filled up like mighty balloons in the back of his legs. The boy was becoming STRONG, as his muscles continued to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man.... I'm getting BIG... and heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just grinned as he watched the boy's muscles grow even bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared's torso widened and grew longer at the same time, as his chest pushed out further while huge abdominals covered his flat stomach. The boy no longer looked like a scrawny kid anymore, but a junior bodybuilder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growth spurt stopped, Jared let out a loud gasp. He panted for a minute, before he slowly got up and walked over to Steven, wearing his torn shirt and shorts on his massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... Your clothes! I wish your clothes would grow to fit your new body!\" Steven murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, the necklace glowed, and Jared's clothes repaired themselves and grew to his new size. Now, the shirt and shorts were much bigger, and fit him perfectly. In fact, all his clothes in his wardrobe fit him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya later, mister... I gotta finish my Christmas shopping!\" Jared said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas, dude!\" Steven grinned, as he watched the muscle boy walk out of the boy's bathroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How've you been?\" Steve asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, man!

I think I deserve a hug, too!\" Julie chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven playfully hugged the short, skinny girl. Again, the necklace glowed, and even Julie began to grow a little more muscular! Her arms thickened, her legs grew a little wider, and her shoulders became wider as well, but nobody noticed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's walk to the restaurant together!\" Andy suggested. \"I'll buy you a drink...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the three of them walked to the restaurant, Steven's necklace was glowing the whole time...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the three made their way to the restaurant, both Andy and Julie were growing bigger and more muscular.  It started out slowly at first, with the muscles in their arms and legs filling out their clothes at, maybe, an inch a minute.  At the five minute mark, however, their bodies were swelling thicker and becoming more defined with each step they took.  Andy was already 6 and a half feet tall and larger than any male bodybuilder on the planet.  And Julie wasn't far behind, with 25\" arms and breasts larger than volleyballs and was quickly approaching her boyfriend in the height department.  And of course, everyone around them, Steven included, were oblivious to the changes, with reality shifting to reflect the growth happening at that exact moment.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd as their growth continued, their clothes morphed with them.  At first, Andy was wearing just a plain t shirt and jeans, but by now, his shirt was a sleeveless top, his immense chest and back muscles pressed tightly against the shirt's material.  His pants had been replaced by a pair of workout shorts, to allow his legs room to breathe.  As for Julie, she had always been a little risque in her attire, so even when Steven had first caught up with them, she was wearing a half shirt and a pair of Daisy Duke shorts.  Now, she only had on a sports bra, proudly showing off her large upper body and her shorts had changed into a pair of micro shorts, with the majority of her massive quads on display.  In fact the shorts were so tiny, that if you were close enough to her, you would probably be able to see the bottom portion of her panties hiding underneath.  For any other girl, the outfit would be considered nothing more than rape bait, but for a woman as powerfully built as Julie, it was no problem.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBy the time the trio made it to the restaurant, a Logan's Roadhouse located at the far end of the food court, Steven was literally dwarfed by his friends, who now stood well over seven feet tall and sported muscles thicker than his entire body.  Andy closely resembled the Incredible Hulk, except for the green skin, of course, with arms measuring close to 38 inches around, while Julie was close behind, with very wide shoulders and biceps 34 inches in circumference.  They looked like they belonged in a comic book, battling a super villain to the death, but instead, they were living, breathing specimens, closer to resembling gods than mere mortals.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe waiter came around and stopped, looking up at the two behemoths, eyes wide, before gathering his composure and seating the three at a table made especially for Andy and Julie.  Steven sat across from his friends, in a chair large enough to reach the table, making him feel a little like a small child sitting in his father's seat.  The three ordered drinks and waited for their food to arrive.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So, Andy,\" Steven asked, taking a sip of his drink.  \"What have you been up to nowadays?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well,\" his friend replied, as he inched closer to 8 feet.  \"We just moved into our first apartment a few months ago.  Thanks to the endorsement contracts the both of us had when we were younger, it was incredibly easy for us to get a place in the swankiest neighborhood in town.  You should see the place; we have three bedrooms, two kitchens.  A great view of the city.  Think of Kelsey Grammer's place from 'Frasier,' then double the size.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Steven replied, looking up at his friend.  He had always been good friends with Andy and Julie, ever since the three had met in second grade.  Even back then, they towered over everyone else, always the strongest and biggest kids in class.  They didn't know it, but Steven was always jealous of them, secretly wanting a body like Andy's, ever since the girls started paying attention to Andy's massive physique and forgetting about him.  Sure, he was invited to a few parties in school, but usually the invitations came because he was good friends with Andy and some girl wanted to get to know the football stud better.  Steven had always lived in his friend's shadow and, frankly, he was getting a little tired of it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd let's not forget about their after school jobs.  Andy and Julie were sports stars, Andy a football player who had offers from every college coming in and Julie a world champion powerlifter and Olympic athlete.  Both of them had multi-million dollar contracts from high profile companies pouring in, in addition to all of the attention they both received.  Andy had been on the cover of GQ a few times and Julie even appeared on the cover of a Playboy magazine last year!  Both were international sex symbols that everyone wanted to emulate. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Steven worked at a supermarket for twenty hours a week, barely making minimum wage and trying to save money to buy his first car.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven took another sip of his drink, then excused himself from the table, going to the bathroom again.  As he approached the door, the necklace around his neck flickered for a more times, then stopped glowing, causing his school friends to stop their transformation.  They were each a little over 8 feet tall now, weighing close to 650 pounds of solid muscle.  Steven glanced back at the pair for a moment, who were busy sharing a passionate kiss, before grumbling to himself and walked into the bathroom, to give himself a few minutes of solitude.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe went over to the sink, splashing a few handfuls of water on his face, before looking at his reflection.  He was skinny, pale.  Sure, he stayed in shape, but he was nothing like Andy.  Then he noticed the necklace gleaming, thanks to the overhead lights.  Maybe he COULD be like Andy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven remembered what had happened with his sister, who was now a 20 foot tall muscular behemoth and living in a castle, thanks to the necklace.  Why couldn't he use it to change his own life?  He certainly deserved it, right?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSeven closed his eyes and imagined himself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven thought for a moment about how large Rachael had made herself, that she was able to create a reality where she had always been a princess, with a very powerful body to go along with it.  Maybe he could create something similar for himself.  What if...what if everyone in his family were descended from a race of giants, that they had came from royalty and that every person, both male and female, had massive physiques, larger and more powerful than anyone else on earth?  Far bigger than his friend Andy's, anyway.  That would show him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes, that will do nicely,\" Steven said outloud, as he thought about such a world and, pretty soon, felt his body transform.  He opened his eyes and watched his body grow, as he quickly inched upward in height, his frame filling out with muscle at an incredible rate.  As he changed, Steven looked around and noticed that the bathroom he was in was changing along with him.  The rows of stalls and urinals were soon gone and in their place stood a single, though immaculate, toilet that was made from ivory, with gold trim adorning the walls.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven's clothes had changed, as well.  He was now wearing what looked like a very expensive suit, probably made from some of the finest silks in the world, if he had used the necklace correctly.  He twisted his ever expanding frame a few times, liking the way the material felt against his skin.  He smiled.  He could get used to this.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the minutes passed, he stared at himself in the mirror, watching as he grew.  \"I'm getting pretty big,\" Steven thought, as he brought an arm up and flexed.  A bicep that looked at least 23 inches around (from his perspective, anyway) erupted from his arm, threatening to rip through the suit he had on.  He soon lowered it and watched as his physique continued to swell out in all directions, wondering when it would stop.  Not that he was complaining, mind you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBefore he knew it, the process was over and he stopped growing.  Steven had no idea how large he was now.  All that he really cared about that he was bigger than Andy.  And, hopefully, bigger than Rachael, too.  But he would cross that bridge when he came to it, if need be.  He looked at himself once more, admiring how massive his muscles were.  But would it be enough?  Had he passed Andy in the popularity department?  There was only one way to find out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven opened the door to the bathroom and stepped out, surprised at how much smaller everything was now.  He took one step forward and nearly squashed a woman trying to walk past him.  She had to dive out of the way to prevent from being killed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" he said, bending down to see if she was okay.  She stood up, brushing her clothes a few times.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I should be the one who apologizes to you, sir,\" the woman meekly replied.  \"I was the one who got in the way of the great Prince Steven.\"  She quickly shuffled past him and made her way back to her seat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Prince Steven?\" he thought to himself, as he stood up to his full height.  \"Hmm.  I like the sound of that.\"  He looked down at the doors that led into the men's and women's bathrooms and noticed that the top of the door barely reached past the midway point of his giant calves.  \"Just how big am I?\" he thought, as he made his way back to his seat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he walked into the dining area of the restaurant, Steven noticed that the room had changed.  Now, most of the tables were on either side of the room, as if a path had been cleared for him to walk around, if necessary.  As he passed the other patrons, most of them looked up in awe at him, shocked to see the Prince eating lunch with them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, my God.  That's Prince Steven,\" one whispered as he walked by.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"He's so cute,\" a young woman remarked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I wonder if he's single?\" the teenage girl next to her asked.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteven sat down in his seat, in a chair that was more than double the size of Andy and Julie's.  He was surprised at how small they were compared to him.  He must of been close to 30 feet tall now.

Secretly, all the girls had a crush on Steven, due to his changed status in this reality. Though he was dating Julie, virtually every girl crushed on him...partly due to his good looks and muscle, but he didn't know he was also secreting pheromones which attracted any woman who caught his scent, or was even near him.

We should head to the gym and bulk up more.\" The gang decided this was probably for the best, as Jenny secretly looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny clearly was longing for Steven, more so than any other girl.

People started to greet them and to stare at them, as they walked by. People would look at them and wave at each and every one of them, as soon as their eyes would fall on them.

They were already incredibly tall, handsome, and muscular, but the necklace continued to push the limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, who was the brunette, grew even taller than before.

In fact, Steven noticed, that several people, who were just walking around in the mall, now started to follow them from behind, and they started to ask them questions and taking their pictures and requesting their autographs, like they had become celebrities!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more people started to follow Steven and the four others, and the crowd quickly grew larger.

The necklace had sensed his thoughts, and it first acted on the part of the wish, which had to do with Julie. Her muscles began to shrink back just a little bit, leaving her with a very athletic look, but not as big as before. She still looked like a muscular girl, but a bit smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, a blue \"wave\" of light got emitted from the necklace, which was hanging from Steven's neck, and it quickly pulsed around Steven as it traveled away from him like a ripple following a stone that had been dropped in a pond of water. The light traveled and struck a pair of teenage boys, who were walking along, holding small video games in their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the blue wave of light struck them, their muscles began to inflate right away. The boys, who were nine years old, felt their calves and thighs expand rapidly. Their shoulders widened and their biceps grew bigger.

The change could be slow or fast, no one would know. But everyone would be surprised as they became vastly muscular...though shortly afterwards, reality would alter so everyone believed they had always been that way. This meant that inevitably, the entire world would be buff soon enough, and eventually, no one would even remember their original sizes.

Suddenly, all three of them were struck by the wave, and they instantly began to grow more muscular!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady's arms and legs bulged from the added muscle. Her thighs and her calves grew until they almost burst out of her dress and her boots. Her arms grew thick and muscular, while her torso expanded in every direction, making her look like a female bodybuilder! The young girl also started to grow, as every muscle in her body started to grow, but she didn't become as big as her mother. Her arms were still very defined, her legs were like small tree trunks, and her calves inflated to the size of softballs. Lastly, even the baby boy hulked out a little bit! The little tyke just giggled as he witnessed his little leg muscles pop out and inflate. His chest expanded and pushed out of his shirt, while his arms almost ripped out of his t-shirt! The poor, little kid practically ripped out of his clothes, since he had now morphed into a muscle baby! The lady, the girl, and the baby stared at each other, before their clothes morphed and magically adjusted to their new bodies. Then, they went about their business, since it was completely normal for them to be so buff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the wave struck and elderly couple, that was walking near the center of the mall, where the food court was. Both the man and the woman hulked out, with every ounce of fat melting away from their bodies as their arms and legs thickened and widened due to their increased muscle. They both gained more muscle in their chest and in their torso, while neat rows of abdominals covered their stomachs. Filled with renewed strength and energy, the elderly muscle-couple continued walking down the mall, but with a spring in their step and much quicker than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the mall, three little boys were walking around the video game store when the wave struck them. They were the only ones in the store, at the time. All three of them hulked out, at the same time! Their legs thickened and lengthened, while their chests bulged out. Their pecs grew bigger and bigger, pushing outward and sideways. All three stared at each other as their legs filled out and became massive pillars of rock-solid muscle, with calves the size of soccer balls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys finally looked on and smiled. They realized that they had always been muscle boys, and they were normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey happily went about their business, enjoying the fact that they were young and super-muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wave continued on, transforming more people as they came into contact with it.  A few kids, a brother and sister, were running around in front of a jewelry counter while their mother stood a few feet away, trying to talk to the salesperson.  The wave struck the kids and the mother and the salesperson both watched as the siblings began to grow, their muscles soon pressing against their clothing.  Pretty soon, their shirts and pants burst, leaving their wardrobe in tatters, before they were covered up in new clothes.  The two women just stared at each other, wondering what was going on, before the same wave struck them and a similar transformation took place. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n **************************<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt a table near the food court, a group of girls that went to the same high school as Steven and Julie were struck by the wave.  The girls were gossiping and eating their food, when they began changing.  One girl was about to take a bite of her salad, when she noticed her bicep was swelling larger by the second.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe put her fork down and stared at her arm.  \"What the hell?!\" she exclaimed, as everyone else at the table was experiencing something similar.  Their frames became wider, as their muscles expanded out in all directions.  They began to panic, wondering how this could happen.  They were helpless to stop it and the only thing they could do was sit there, as their bodies eventually became a little bit larger than a professional bodybuilder's.  Moments later, they had calmed down, believing their bodies had always been this big.  They went back to their food, which had grown from a simple salad and Diet Coke.  Now, each girl had a huge steak and a baked potato on their trays and watched as a cute guy, who was even bigger than they were, passed their table.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n*******************************<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn the time it had taken for their food to arrive at the restaurant, Andy had transformed into a huge guy, sporting 25\" arms and a thick chest, with cannonball-sized delts.  Both Steven and Julie had watched as he slowly grew, as the shirt he was wearing had eventually morphed into a tank top, to allow him to show off his impressive physique.  Now, he was busy digging into his grilled chicken, his arms tensing up as the knife he was holding sliced through the meat.  Julie looked around at some of the other people in the restaurant as they, too, were as large as Andy.  Or bigger.  Men, women, it didn't matter.  Even the children looked like serious competitors now, with their wider frames and muscles proportional to an Olympia competitor.  Some kids stayed and ate their steaks, while others were busy playing in the children's area in the back. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJulie looked down at the necklace that still rested in her hand, wondering if she should change everything back.  After all, the only people that was aware of anything was her and Steven.  Then again, she didn't want to use the necklace and make everything worse, either<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGrabbing Steven's hand, she pulled him from his chair, telling Andy she would be back in a minute.  \"Okay, babe,\" he said, his mouth full of food, not even bothering to look up as the two left the table.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJulie led Steven to a quiet corner of the restaurant and held the necklace in her hand, letting it dangle from its chain.  \"What the hell is going on with this thing?\" she asked, in a loud whisper.  \"Is this necklace cursed or something?  I mean, there has to be a reason why everyone else in the mall looks like a professional bodybuilder.\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Okay, look,\" he began.  \"That necklace can do some pretty freaky things.  For instance--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust then, a waitress, with muscles that would make any bodybuilder--male or female--jealous, carried a tray full of empty plates back into the kitchen area.  They both waited until she passed.  As she walked by, Steven caught a glimpse of the waitress's muscular thighs and calves.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJulie caught him staring and slapped him on the top of the head, breaking him from his trance.  \"Pay attention, stupid,\" she chided him.  \"You have to try to fix this.\"  She put the necklace back in his hands, happy to be free of it.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Right, sorry,\" he replied, putting the necklace around his neck.  He then closed his eyes and concentrated, trying to return everything back to normal...</span></div></div>",

How about this. We flip a coin. Heads, you can make all the women giant muscular hulks again. However, tails, and I get to use the necklace to make the men larger, just to make you squirm, seeing as you seem more interested in muscled ladies. Besides, I think I'd enjoy muscle men more than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" He pulls out a quarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Put the necklace down. Seeing as you can give and take muscles at will to the whole world, altering a coin toss should be nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright...\" Steve puts the necklace down on the ground between him and Julie. \"How did you know I'd cheat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya need to ask?\" Julie cackles with a grin. \"Now, are we going to do this?\" Steve flips the coin, sending it hurtling through the air, cascading down and landing on the necklace, striking it and rolling to Julie's feet, falling tails down. \"Ha, I win!!\" Julie picks up the necklace and it immediately glows. The muscles of men began to ripple and bulge once more, achieving the massive proportions they had just been at mere moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you won. Now hand it back...\" Before Steve could finish that statement, three guys at the food court surrounded a petite, spindly girl with a modest figure and cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, little lady... How about a kiss?\" a tall blond guy with biceps bigger than his head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N... No...\" she sheepishly uttered, \"Get away!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one says no to me!!\" the blond swings at her, but then everyone gasps when, reflexively the girl put her hand out to catch his fist, a fist four times bigger than her hand, and she stopped it with zero effort at all. Her fear causes her to clench his fist so tight the sounds of breaking bones could be heard across the food court. \"Wh... What the hell!! Let go, you little bitch!!\" In a panic, she lifts her arm, gripping the fist still ever so tightly, and flings him, a man that weighs more than five times more than her, one-handed over her head and into the wall fifty feet behind her, leaving him indented deep in a massive crater in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dirty...\" the blonde's two friends exclaim, before one is met with a reactionary right jab that shatters all his ribs and sends him flying through three pillars and plasters him right next the Old Navy of the other end of the mall, and the other gets a downward spinning kick that blasts him down through the floor so fast the air crackled with a sonic boom, shooting the last attacker from the fourth floor where they were clean down to the lowest sub-basement of the mall, the man spewing blood out his mouth as he bounced in the crater he made. The frightened girl seemed to flash forward away from the gaping hole she made, reappearing near a woman who was apparently her mother, unnerved by her attack. However, the food court stood and applauded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad someone dealt with those jerks!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's jaw was still on the floor. \"What did I just see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I made guy's muscles bigger, but then I realized guys could beat up on girls, so I made girls superpowered. Basically, I gave them all the strength of those ginormous muscles you wanted to give them, without the need for giant muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, you made muscles pointless.\" Steven sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Julie jested. \"Now, why don't you stop sulking and figure out something else we can do with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright... In a way, regular sized women with super strength...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and speed...\" Julie adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...is in itself kinda hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're weird.

Let\u2019s do something totally different! I say, let\u2019s make all the women in the mall grow muscular, like female bodybuilders!\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly, the necklace began to glow and shot out a bright wave of light, which flashed through the entire shopping mall! The light affected every female, who was inside of the mall at that very moment in time, and every female began to feel the effects of Steven\u2019s wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven! What did you just\u2026. Ohhhh!\u201d Julie moaned, as she was overcome by an intense, prickling feeling in every muscle of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as Steven has said, every muscle in her body began to inflate! Julie\u2019s arms bulged out; her biceps grew into bowling balls of power, while her breasts stuck out further due to her widening shoulders. Her torso now sported awesome, powerful abs while her legs inflated to massive thighs, which resembled pillars of strength, and her calves grew into footballs of strength and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA!\u201d Julie gasped out loud, as she flexed both arms and looked down at her hugely muscled body in complete amazement. \u201cWhat did you do???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just stared at her with a wide grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like the way you look\u2026\u201d he said, as he turned around. \u201cAnd I REALLY like what I\u2019m seeing around the REST of the mall!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a few yards away from where Steven and Julie were standing, a ten-year-old girl named Kim was trying on her new outfit for her gymnastics class in the CHAMPS sports store. She had just tried on her new tights, when she felt an odd, tingling sensation. It struck her everywhere, but especially in her muscles. But, it didn\u2019t hurt. In fact, it felt like something she had felt earlier, the first time she had become muscular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her thighs became hard and stiff\u2026 But strong. VERY strong! Her legs grew thicker and thicker, and she felt them bursting with fresh, thick, bulging muscle. In fact, thick veins, as large as ropes, began to cover the new layers of muscle that were forming over her powerful legs! Her calves then blew up like balloons, inflating bigger and bigger, as if air was being pumped into them. She felt as if, with every passing second, she could jump higher and higher\u2026 The increasing strength felt GOOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow! My big muscles are coming BACK!\u201d Kim cheered, as she looked down while her body was going through the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, as soon as her legs had finished growing big and muscular, her arms were the next to grow. Her chest expanded as well. No longer was she flat-chested, for her chest now pushed out and grew wider at the same time, due to her increased muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh! I feel so strong\u2026. This is great!\u201d she groaned softly, as her strength continued to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms grew thick and wide, with big, bulging biceps, covered with thick veins and flowing with great strength!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, gymnastics is going to be a breeze, now!\u201d the young, muscular girl giggled, as she flexed her powerful arms before the mirror of the sporting goods store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then turned around and flexed her massive calves, which resembled two large oranges, which were fused together, side-by-side, on each leg. She felt so much strength and so much power, going through her body that she just had no clue to how strong she really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d better let mommy pay for these tights!\u201d she chuckled, as she walked out of the dressing room. She noticed that her shoulders were so wide, that her arms were hanging at an angle from the sides of her body. She looked like a junior female bodybuilder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swaggered of to the cashier, and she met with her mother, who had also just grown more muscular. Her mother then paid for the tights, and they both walked out of the store and out to the vast corridor of the large shopping mall, where they witnessed several other women as they were going through their muscular transformations\u2026<br>\r\nJust then, Kim\u2019s mother burst with muscle! Her arms became massive pythons of 25\u201d proportions, as her calves exploded with rippling muscle! Veins covered her body as her muscles shredded her clothes, being magically replaced by a skimpy sports bra and daisy dukes.<br>\r\nEvery other woman was both shocked and turned on as they all became buff enough to make any bodybuilder jealous. Every female was now extremely inhumanly buff and loving it. Of course, they were all in skimpy outfits and had a sudden \u201cattraction\u201d to Steven\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Julie, who thought Steven had taken this out of hand. She grabbed the necklace and wished for something ironic to happen and that would give her what she wanted: buff guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe probably shouldn\u2019t have wished this. Or\u2026 at least worded it carefully. Her body became even more buff, probably the buffest in the mall. But\u2026her hair also became a pretty yet masculine style, her breasts disappeared and her clothes became a tank top with gym shorts. She also felt\u2026some kind of protruding\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God! I\u2019m\u2026I have a\u2026hard\u2026I\u2026 I\u2019m a GUY?!?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie attempted to get the necklace back but in the ensuing struggle it went off again, further enhancing the irony. The women could now make the men buff,  Steven was now \u201cStacy\u201d, an also inhumanly buff woman (and basically still himself; just female, buff and with the ability to command everyone in the mall) and to top it off, everyone in the mall was now attracted, to you guessed it: muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Julie fawned over Steven, she realized she needed the necklace. She tried to grab it and:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Kim and her Mom were walking by the clothing store, Kim heard the shriek and stepped into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim, already buffed up, was still wearing her new tights, a tight t-shirt and a longer sleeved t-shirt over the first shirt.  Her muscles were large, but not as large as the three men giving the other girl a hard time.  Only Kim once again felt a strange tingling as Julie\u2019s wish was now doubling her strength.  Kim smiled, thinking that the tingling feeling from before had made her this muscular.  What would this tingling feeling do?  With a sense of purpose and bravado partially given to her by Julie\u2019s wish and partially from her own personality, Kim spoke with as much authority as her 10 year old girl voice could command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!  Leave her alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim, the largest boy at 6 foot 4 and filled with gigantic muscles, laughed.  He flexed up his biceps and twin towers of muscle 24 inches around formed on his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook here little girl.  This is none of your business.  Now run back to your mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim growled softly as the tingling increased and she felt her strength seemingly double once again, giving her even greater confidence to take on these large boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the muscles became denser and denser, her clothes, already tight around her muscular body, began to rip and tear as threads popped against her growing, hardening, bulging muscles.  Sniffing as Kim could feel herself morph toward a super girl, she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need my mommy to take care of three stupid bullies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys now all turned to face this 4 foot 6 inch girl with the smart mouth.  Kim\u2019s sneer turned into a knowing grin as she felt her muscles pulse and ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you were trying to impress me with THOSE muscles, let me show you some real GIRL muscles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking off her flip flops, Kim stood on her toes and with one flex, large holes began to form in her tights as her leg muscles grew harder, larger and more defined.  Her calves expanded into twin balls of fury to the size of volleyballs, disintegrating the legging!  Her thighs expanded wickedly, crackled with strength and flowed with power.  Flexing her growing thighs, the legging tore down the center of each quad as the material shredded and disappeared, exposing the throbbing, mega muscled thighs pressed out bigger than any man had ever flexed before!  Her tops were ripping against a torrent of stronger and stronger muscles that surged forward, pressing out barn door wide lats and basketball sized pectorals that tensed and pounded with the power to bench press a fully loaded school bus!  As her upper body surged, the top became rags around her upper torso, hanging from her massive shoulders, exposing her narrow, incredibly muscled up abs with a 10 pack of pure muscle and detailed feathered muscles along her obliques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men all paused, losing their bravado for a moment as they watched this young girl grow muscles that none of them ever imagined could grow on a pre-teen girl.  Kim smirked as their smiles dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you thought those sorry looking biceps were going to scare ME, let me show you something REALLY scary!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up her arms in her own double bicep flex, Kim tensed down and the sleeves ripped off her arms in so many places that the fabric shredded and floated to the ground around her, showcasing her bare, mega muscled arms.  Her biceps had flexed up to match those of the big man and were pulsing with dominating strength and vitality.  Kim snickered as she then flexed down harder and the muscles exploded with so much power that her tense shook the floor and her muscles let out a small boom!  The 24 inch biceps DOUBLED in size with only one flex to 48 inch monsters that bristled with the strength to easily curl a Hummer.  With one arm!  The bicep was 18 inches tall from her deep tricep belly to the top of her inhuman bicep peak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow these are some REAL muscles, punks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men looked at the young girl and then back at each other.  Sure, she had just flexed up muscles bigger than any of them, but there were still 3 of them.  And she was still just a young girl after all.  As the men frowned, Kim released her incredible flex and looked up at the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo boys.  It looks like you still want a piece of me, huh?  Well let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the meantime, on the other side of the large shopping mall, Eric and Suzy were walking with their mother out of the candy store. Their mother had just purchased a few candy bars, and she had given the kids a few of them to share. She left the two children at a wooden bench in the center of the wide corridor as she strolled into a clothing store to check the price of a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me your candy!\u201d Eric said to Suzy, at the first opportunity that he was left alone with his little sister. Eric was 12 years old, and Suzy was only 8, and Eric loved to bully her any chance he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! That\u2019s MY candy! You got your own! Leave me alone!\u201d Suzy shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said GIMME!\u201d Eric growled, as he grabbed hold of Suzy\u2019s arm, and tried to wrestle the candy bar out of her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at that moment, the necklace\u2019s magic had struck the little girl, and her strength began to increase while her muscles inflated rapidly. She was the only one who noticed anything unusual, at first, while Eric just held her arm by the wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy\u2019s little arm quickly thickened as her biceps inflated to the point that they became thick and hard, like softballs! Veins began to cover them as well! Her torso widened in order to allow for her mighty lats to form under her shoulders, while her flat stomach now changed into a landscape of big, powerful abdominals. Two big pectorals filled out her chest, since she was too young to have breasts, and her thighs grew wider and thicker at the same time as well. Lastly, her calves ballooned out, practically pushing a hole in her stockings, as she felt an amazing amount of muscular strength in her arms and in her legs, like anything she had ever felt before. The cute, young girl still maintained her youth and her cute face, with her short, blonde hair and her big blue eyes, but she now had fantastic muscles to go along with her cuteness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you saying, bro?\u201d Suzy sneered, as she easily pulled her arm away from her brother\u2019s grip. She quickly realized that she was now the strongest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Nothing, little sis\u2026 Nothing at all\u2026\u201d Eric stuttered, as he looked down at his muscular sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got your own candy, so leave me alone, or ELSE!\u201d Suzy shouted, while making a fist and flexing her arm, and making a big ball of muscle rise up on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-s-sure, Suzy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy grinned. She just loved being the strongest in the house\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, a 6 year old girl name Lisa had been surrounded by three larger boys off in a corner away from their parents, who were pre-occupied with their own muscle growth.  She had been lording over the older boys when she grew stronger while they didn\u2019t.  But once they grew muscles bigger than hers, they pulled her away from the crowd and pushed her against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first boy didn\u2019t wait for Lisa to plead her case and punched her hard on the shoulder.  Lisa had bloomed athletic muscles on her 4 foot tall frame from the initial growth.  Her dress bulged a bit, pulling tighter around her slightly muscled up frame.  The jells on her feet were off back in the play area.  The dress covered her body down to her knees and covered her arms up to her wrists.  Her angelic face with sparkling green eyes and light brown hair winced with the first punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!  That hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second boy sneered and punched her in the chest with a thud.  Lisa yelped as the second boy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that hurt too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third boy punched her in the stomach hard and Lisa bent over as she let out a small woof.  If she didn\u2019t have her recently acquired muscles, she would have been on the ground.  Unfortunately, staying up only emboldened the boys to keep up the punching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a second barrage of punches were lined up by the boys, Julie\u2019s wish swept across the mall and took hold of Lisa.  The thought of making girls bigger and stronger wasn\u2019t terribly focused.  In fact, her random thought of making younger girls stronger to address the dominating boys at a very young age created a power surge that flowed back with age to those girls entering school.  So while an 18 year old girl would grow a bit stronger, a 17 year old girl would be stronger still, and so on.  By the time the age progressed down toward the 6 year old Lisa, the strength and muscle expansion would be super human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as the boys started hitting Lisa again, the initial surge in strength and power flowed quickly into Lisa, bolting her back upright.  The stinging blows hurt less and less.  By the time the boys were delivering a third round of punches, Lisa\u2019s body had grown rock hard and the punches felt like finger taps.  The initial damage was quickly repaired and Lisa now smiled wickedly at the realization that she was once again growing stronger.  Only the surge of power didn\u2019t stop.  As the boys backed up, rubbing their sore fists, Lisa looked up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you boys thought you could beat me up, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the power in Lisa\u2019s body started multiplying, and her muscles responded by tearing and growing at an incredible rate, blasting across her slight frame like a volcanic eruption.  Every muscle on her body doubled in size in an instant, ripping and popping threads and material across her dress.  Lisa chucked now as the might pounding into her muscles increased in intensity as her strength continued to ramp upward.  Lisa pulled up her arms in anticipation and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThought you were stronger, bigger and tougher?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one tense, Lisa\u2019s muscles exploded across her body, shredding her dress and pressing muscles forward with far greater size than the boys!  Standing on her toes, her calves expanded to gigantic masses of pulsing pink girl muscles, jutting out toward the size of canned hams.  Her thighs and hamstrings pressed outward in every direction in a frenzy of super muscle expansion, growing until her inner thighs touched and the outer thighs pushed out a foot thick and then grew thicker.  And harder.  And stronger!  Much, much stronger.  The density of her muscles were now greater than the hardest steel and were still becoming denser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s legs were so muscular it was a wonder any more muscle could fit.  And the strength rippling through those calves and quads could squat a tank for reps!  The muscles crackled as she held her mighty flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell these legs should convince you that I\u2019m now stronger, but I\u2019m not done flexing.  But when I am, it\u2019s my turn to punch you boys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dress fell and flittered to the ground, her steel abs were exposed, showcasing an array of shifting muscle blocks across her narrow stomach.  Her back widened dramatically away from her stomach into a terrible T shape while her chest was a humongous rippling mass of pure muscle with pectorals bigger than twin basketballs covered with criss crossing veins and striations.  The thick undershirt was straining against her powerful chest and was ripping down the center to expose the mega muscled cleavage.  And with one hard breath, Lisa pulled the 18 inch thick pectoral masses up to her narrow little chin, expanding the muscles further to complete the destruction of her top against a torrent of mega girl muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can try and hit me in the chest again, but you\u2019ll only hurt your hands against my big, bulging super girl muscles!  And if you like these big muscles, let me show you my arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled up her biceps, the muscles expanded with such power and velocity, that the ground shook around the boys as the strength to curl a 737 detonated inside her young super muscles.  Lisa paused for a moment as the boys stared with wonder at her bowling ball sized biceps that now glowed with still growing strength and power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd these biceps are now big enough to pound you three into the ground!  But if I flex them a bit harder, let\u2019s see how big and strong they\u2019ll become.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with another flex the mighty mounds of muscle began to stack bowling balls on top of each other!  The 40 inch circumference biceps doubled in size to 80 inches around, then became 120 inches around, and finally with one final ground shaking boom, up to 160 impossible inches around with enough strength to curl a millions of pounds with one arm!  Lisa was now laughing as she stared up at her 6 foot tall biceps with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!  My mighty muscles are taller than any of YOU!  And there\u2019s more strength in my muscles than every boy in school!  Times like a million!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before the stunned boys could react, Lisa released her flex and delivered a punch to the closest boy in the chest, sending him flying off her fist like he was shot out of cannon!  He sailed away down toward the center of the mall, rolling to a stop 100 feet away, moaning with pain.  Two more quick punches sent the other boys sailing in different directions.  If not for their own muscled up physiques, they too would have been seriously hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sniffed.  \u201cThat was just too easy!  I wonder what I can really do?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a bright flash from the necklace, as it spread throughout the mall, then beyond.  Momentarily blinded, Steven shielded his eyes, until the bright light passed.  When he opened them again, he watched, as every guy\u2019s Olympia sized muscles deflated, returning to their normal proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the men became smaller, their clothes changed as well, going from sleeveless shirts and tank tops, to simple t-shirts, which showed only the slightest hint of muscle tone hidden underneath.  By the time it was over, their bodies resembled long distance marathon runners more than anything else, their championship bodybuilding physiques long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the men finished up their transformations, the women received a vastly different one.  Spurred on by Julie\u2019s imagination, every woman in the mall\u2014adults as well as children\u2014continued to grow.  Their legs swelled out in all directions, quickly filling their shorts with thick quad and hamstring muscles.  The material in their shorts showed signs of strain, but held together, instead growing longer to accommodate each woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir shoulders went from healthy-looking deltoids to the size of cannonballs in no time, causing their frames to become wider as well.  Their breasts grew larger, pushed further out by their continually growing pectorals underneath, while their lats became wider and thicker, giving them an upper body bigger than anything Steven had ever seen before in his entire life.  He watched as one woman walked past him, her growing physique already dwarfing any Mr. Olympia contestant in history.  And still they grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped as their arms were next.  Going up from a starting point of 19\u201d, Steven watched as Julie added more mass.  Inch by inch were added to their growing pythons, as their biceps went from baseball-sized to softball-sized and showed no signs of slowing down.  Their triceps inflated to incredible size, with the slightest movement causing the giant, horseshoe shaped muscle to flex wildly.  Even as they hung relaxed by their sides, their arms were a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir tops became smaller as their transformations continued, until the vast majority of women were either wearing a tube top, which struggled to contain their volleyball-sized breasts as they walked or an athletic top of some sort, which showed off every curve in their massive upper bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their arms surged a little past 33 inches, Julie stopped.  Looking around the mall, Steven was shocked at the vast differences between the sexes now.  The women were all walking around like miniature versions of The Hulk, their massive physiques rippling with huge muscles, though they still retained their femininity.  They strode confidently through the mall, walking quicker\u2014perhaps due to the immense strength their legs possessed\u2014while their boyfriends or husbands struggled to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was in stark contrast to the men, whose arms and legs were like twigs now, while their bone structure was as light and thin as possible.  They still had a little bit of muscle tone, but just enough, Steven guessed, to walk around without difficulty or to drive a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only similarity that he could find was that everyone had remained their original height throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at his own body, Steven realized he had suffered a similar fate as all the other guys.  Flexing one of his arms, he was a bit upset to see a pitiful-looking bicep barely reveal itself to him.  Taking his other hand, he easily wrapped it around his small bicep, feeling the muscle give as he squeezed it softly a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what I\u2019ve done, Steven?\u201d he heard a voice ask him.  Turning around, he saw Julie, standing proudly before him, as she casually toyed with the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to change things back,\u201d he told her, almost pleading, as he stared in unbelief at Julie\u2019s gargantuan arms.  \u201cThis is too extreme!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the mall, shrugging her wide shoulders as everybody went about their business as if nothing had happened.  \u201cThese people don\u2019t seem to mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve changed reality somehow.  To everyone here, it\u2019s as if men and women have always been this way!\u201d  Steven was becoming flustered, afraid this was going to be his life, unless he could take the necklace back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie giggled a bit at his reaction, as another muscle bound woman walked by, this time a 15 year old girl talking on her cellphone.  \u201cThat\u2019s what is so great about it!  Nobody\u2019s aware of anything except us.  It\u2019s perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect for the guys,\u201d Steven replied.  \u201cThey\u2019re too skinny.  They\u2019re\u2026They\u2019re too weak!  You\u2019ve turned us all into helpless little babies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t that what you\u2019ve always wanted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was taken aback.  \u201cWhat I\u2019VE wanted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.  I\u2019ve been on your computer before.  I\u2019ve seen some of the stuff you\u2019re into.  Girls with muscle.  Bodybuilders.  Women my size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen were you ever on my computer?\u201d His face registered an expression of shock, as he realized, too late, what was going on.  And why Julie wanted to use the necklace so bad.  \u201cOh, my God.  You\u2019ve been stalking me, haven\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to know what you were into, what your fetishes were.  It was the only way I could get you to love me.  I had to turn myself into your dream girl.\u201d  She started walking seductively over to Steven.  \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you for the longest time; I\u2019ve just been too shy to approach you.  Why do you think I started dating Andy?  Sooner or later, I knew the two of you would cross paths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Julie,\u201d Steven replied, backing up slowly.  \u201cYou\u2019re starting to scare me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now nothing stands between us.  I know you\u2019re not dating anyone at the moment.  And as soon as I dump Andy, the two of us can finally be together.  Just think of it:  You and me.  Together forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulie, you\u2019re clearly obsessed with me.  You need help.\u201d  Backing into something hard, Steven looked behind him, only to realize he had backed himself into a corner.  He was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got all the help I need around my neck, little man,\u201d Julie replied, as she closed the gap between them.  With nowhere else to go, Steven was helpless as Julie grabbed him by the arms and playfully pulled him toward her.  He plowed into her breasts with a grunt, as her massive arms wrapped themselves around his smaller body, pinning him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled ineffectually to escape, using every last ounce of strength he had left, but it was no use.  She let it continue for a while, giggling as he tried to squirm away.  Eventually giving up, Steven sighed, looking down slightly into Julie\u2019s beaming face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?  You can\u2019t run away from me now,\u201d she said, lovingly squeezing Steven a few times, causing him to groan in pain.  \u201cOops.  I\u2019m going to have to be careful with you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d  She kissed him, loving every second as Steven\u2019s struggles began anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel his attempts to escape, but it felt like a 3 year old trying to escape from an adult.  It was nothing more than an annoyance to her.  Julie grinned.  She finally had the man of her dreams, the man she had pined over for years, all to herself.  This was the best day of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking off the kiss, Julie looked up at him, a little breathless.  \u201cYou have no idea how long I\u2019ve waited to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulie, you can\u2019t be serious.  This is crazy!  Just return everyone to normal and give me the necklace, so I can destroy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDestroy it?  Oh, come on.  Don\u2019t be silly.\u201d  She kissed him again.  \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting this necklace out of my sight, not after I know what it can do.  Now, follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led Steven by the hand, as they made their way through the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d he asked, struggling to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll see,\u201d Julie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liam had just left the video game store, when the invisible wave hit him. He was 12 years old, he wore tennis shoes, shorts, and a polo shirt. He was about 5 foot 4 inches tall, and he was skinny. He wasn't very muscular at all, but he definitely wasn't fat either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Liam felt an odd, tingling feeling, which spread all over his body, and affected his muscles in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn... I hope I'm not coming down with the chills...\" he thought, as his muscles tensed up, just as he stepped outside of the video game store, after playing several rounds of HALO3 on one of the machines. \"Mom's gonna kill me if I get a cold now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened. First, his calves ballooned outward from the back of his legs. His leg muscles just magically grew on their own, until they became big, round and hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is going on?\" he wondered, as he reached down and scratched his thick, hard calves with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, his quads began to swell in every direction. They expanded sideways and forward, with layers of muscle adding to his upper-legs. Liam now began to look like a professional soccer player, a wrestler, or a track star, with his incredibly muscled legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there! How... What...???\" he gasped, as the growth continued to crawl up his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Liam's abdominals began to pop up and rise to the surface of his flat stomach while his entire torso began to push outward in both directions at the same time. It was as if his body was being pulled outwards, so it became wider. Mighty lats formed under his arms as his upper-torso, where his pectorals were, began to fill out while his pectorals started to swell as well. His shoulders and arms grew wider in the process, as his biceps, triceps, and forearms continued to fill out with rock-hard muscles at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! What is going on with my body????\" the boy cried as he surveyed the magical changes to his frame. He had grown wider, bigger and heavier in a matter of seconds! Not just that, but Liam felt the amazing surge of physical strength, which came paired with the increased muscles at the same time as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as his shoulders continued to widen, his arms spread out a little, and were no longer hanging straight down from his shoulders, but at a slight angle, just like a bodybuilder. The young muscle boy felt powerful and strong, as he ripped his shirt down the middle and tore his short at the seams as he took his first step. His glutes had become so big, and his muscles were so hard, that his clothing could no longer contain his expanding body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap.... I just burst out of my clothes!\" Liam sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are! I've been looking all over for you!\" a lady said, as she walked out of a store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! I... Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liam! Did you have another growth spurt? Oh my goodness!\" the lady said, as she turned to face her friend, who was walking next to her. \"My son has been growing like crazy these days... I can't keep up with him... He outgrows everything I buy for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... especially boys... They tend to be so big and so muscular these days...\" the other lady added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Liam... Follow me to the store... We have to get you some new clothes... Again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam followed his mother and her friend into the store, looking forward to trying on some new shorts and shirts. He was used to it, because he knew that he would outgrow them soon enough...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, she soon began moving so fast and elegantly the coach had trouble keeping up with her, and began to do flips and tumbles that seemed too complex for any mere human as she flexed her spine in ways she couldn't do before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I witness to some kind of gymnastic goddess?\" the coach said in broken English, his thick Ukranian accent coming through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Karen leapt nearly 35' in the air straight up spinning in her dismount. As she rapidly spun in midair, a pop and light tearing could be heard. Karen set down next to the beam perfectly on both feet, a dismount worthy of nothing less than a 10, when she belts out an odd sound. \"Nyaa!! How did I do?\" The coach does a double take and has to rub his eyes, but determines he wasn't hallucinating when he saw grey cat ears on her head and a swishing 4' cat tail behind her poking out a hole in her leotard, which must have been the source of the popping and tearing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses for a moment, but then responds, \"You will go down in Olympic history, darling!!\" deciding to look past the this girl just turned into a nekomimi before his eyes.

Julie quickly made a wish that the people forgot about what had happened and by the time they hit the exit, everything was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was still intrigued.  What if she made others more muscular and stronger?  But who?  As they walked along, Julie focused on a girl and her father.  The man was large, wearing a muscle shirt that showed off his huge muscles.  The girl was young, looking to be around 10.  Julie crossed the street in order to get closer and listen to their conversation.  Steven could only wonder what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, Andrea, was complaining about their destination.  \u201cCome on Dad.  Why do I have to go to the gym with you?  It\u2019s so boring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father, Ted, grunted.  \u201cYou can watch TV for a while.  I\u2019m not missing another work out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie began to think about what she was seeing.  What if girls were bigger and stronger than anyone else, just like her idea in the mall?  Or at least for a start, what about this girl?  Rubbing the necklace, Julie smiled at the thought.  What if the roles were reversed.  Sure, the man could still be as big, but what if his daughter were even bigger and stronger?  Or better yet, what if the girl joined him in his work out and grew huge, super strong muscles, eclipsing his size and strength?  What if she became even stronger compared to him than he currently was to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last thought in her head, Julie made her wish and smiled.  Steven looked at Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie chuckled.  \u201cWant to find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging his shoulders, he watched as the father and daughter walked into the gym.  Julie stopped in front of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie walked into the gym, and with another quick wish, she and Steven had membership cards.  They then watched as Ted headed toward the free weights and began to lift a few weights to warm up.  Cindy watched with little interest until she felt a tingling across her body.  By the time she walked up to her Dad, he was already bench pressing 300 pounds.  Another big man, Rich, was spotting him.  Andrea walked up to Rich and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I spot my Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRich laughed and Ted sat up, clearly annoyed.  \u201cI thought I told you to stay in the other room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea frowned, but moved closer to the weight, reaching out with both hands to curl her small fingers around the thick bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did.  But I\u2019m feeling pretty good today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Andrea tightened her grip around the bar, she tensed her body and her once non-existent muscles started to pulse and throb and grow all across her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with surging confidence, Andrea pulled the 300 pound bar off the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel REALLY good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea brought the bar down to her thighs that had doubled in size over the last few moments.  In fact, all of her muscles had doubled in size.  And they were still growing, stacking muscles on top of muscles.  Rips and tears could be heard as her shorts tore up the sides against thickening thighs as the four distinct muscles of her quads burst forward, crackling and pulsing with intimidating muscle fibers and powerful striations.  Her calves flared out into twin softball sized masses of muscle that leapt outward when she stood on her bare toes, showcasing the fact that the weight was barely taxing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Rich had backed away, unsure of what to make of what he was witnessing.  Ted had now stood up, looking down at his 4 foot 6 inch blonde haired daughter with surprise and awe.  As her once stick frame continued to build with muscle, Andrea became more aware of her ramped up power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact, Daddy, I\u2019m sure that this weight is more than you can curl.  Am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed nodded weakly, still trying to comprehend what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Andrea took a measure of the weight, she tensed her upper body and the already expanding muscles surged further, ripping her top up the sides and down the middle as her back thickened and widened and her chest surged forward with pectorals deep enough to challenge her father.  As the destruction of her shirt continued, her abs were exposed, now writhing with muscle blocks and insane separation.  Her waist was barely any thicker, but was sporting dense muscles and seemingly impossible separation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne final breath pushed her massive pectorals a full foot away from her torso, shredding the remainder of her top into a pile of rags, most of which fluttered to the ground.  Andrea smiled as she looked down to see her pectoral shelf and the inch thick slabs of muscles separate with striations that ran the length of her chest and became lost in her deep muscle cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms were now a menagerie of bumps, grooves and muscles to put her father to shame.  Muscles strong enough to hold 300 pounds with now minimal strain.  And muscles strong enough to do something she had always wanted to do.  To put her father to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if I curl this weight Daddy, does that make me stronger than you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Ted nodded his head weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a nasty grin now formed on her angelic face, Andrea did the impossible and pulled the weight upward with controlled force.  And as soon as she touched the bar to her pulsing chest, she pulled the bar down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, Daddy.  I guess I\u2019m stronger than you.  In fact\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing her hands together in the center of the bar, Andrea released one hand and brought her arm up into a front bicep pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m much stronger than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as her father turned white, Andrea began to curl the 300 pound bar.  With one arm!  And as she did so with ridiculous ease, she started pumping her other arm, pushing more and more muscle into her bicep with every pump.  Pressing her triceps thicker.  Punching her forearm wider.  Within moments Andrea had flexed up a bicep bigger than her father.  And not just bigger, but better shaped and more defined.  Holding her now 22 inch bicep pose for a moment, Andrea stared at her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd my muscles are now bigger than yours too!  I\u2019m bigger, stronger and tougher than you already Daddy.  A LOT stronger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the weight to the ground with loud clang, Andrea pulled her left arm up into a bicep pose, quickly matching the mass of right.  She then tensed down hard and the muscles across her entire body expanded!  Her biceps pushed out wider, pressing up against her thick shoulders and Popeye sized forearms.  Her biceps pushed out thicker, spilling forward like some 3-D movie, inflating across her arm beyond the size of cantaloupes.  And her biceps pushed up taller, with her peak rising up over her shoulders and riding up her forearm!  Inch after inch of rippling, super strong, steel hard girl muscles slammed into her mighty biceps, pushing the circumference upward to until they were 32 world record breaking inches around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd my biceps are a LOT bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked on and smiled.  Was Andrea done?  Had her wish come to pass?  Or was Andrea capable of more?  And what about the other girls she saw in the waiting area?  Should she make them stronger too?  Reaching up to rub the necklace, Julie\u2026..</span></div></div>",

Where a shinigami could leave a \"Death Note\", a weird notebook, on Earth. And whoever writes someone's name in it, can kill them just by writing their name and thinking of their face (author's note: \"shinigami\" is Japanese for \"Personification of Death\"). That could be dangerous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Fullmetal Alchemist. That had an awesome world where instead of science, they had alchemy. You could turn lead to gold or get limbs that turn into blades and so much more! You were really only limited by your imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both would be so dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Rachel knew she had to think of something safe.

This list, however, mostly consisted of people she knew from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she had wrote the name of her first victim in the Death Note, Whitney Ironside, a snobbish girl at school who often mades fun of poor Rachel and criticizes her fashion sense.

The power that I gave you is none other than a seed, to grow in proportion to the love you feel for your children! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words, Trisha felt in seventh heaven!

But then again, they had the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, reality was rewritten that there were two Jills.

Yet the necklace remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in case one of them realized something bad would happen because of the necklace, the necklace was made into two necklaces, one for each of them. And they took them everywhere, scared of what could happen if someone else got their hands on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen school started the next day, Jill and Jillian were the two most popular girls in school. Jill was still a cheerleader (the head cheerleader, no less), where Jillian decided to take up gymnastics and excelled at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone wanted them and both enjoyed this. In fact, even though their lives were so...changed...they become quickly like best friends and then eerily, just like sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were inseperable until they started feeling some \"side effects\" of what the necklace did to them. Steven's previous lust for Jill came up, as both started developing some lesbian tendencies to each other...and they loved it. But they had to hide it, since they were \"sisters\" now. Soon though, they pushed aside their \"feelings\" for each other. Or so they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, them being \"together\" took a toll too. Sometimes they would talk at the same time, move at the same time and do everything in unison briefly. It was like their minds were sometimes one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklaces somehow decided to do something to the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happened to them the next day?</span></div></div>",

Everything was so much easier, and so much more peaceful. Jill and Jillian broke off individually to explore their newfound lesbian love for each other and had sex much of the morning...both individually and \"together\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also found a new \"ability\" they could use, individually or together, but kept it a secret.

But when did they become triplets?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the school pondered this, the three Jills secretly and methodically found a way to lock every door in the school. They wanted more Jills. They wanted more than an army. Every person in the world must become a Jill. It was the only thing they could think of, other than how much prettier and better they were than mere humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the announcements speakers, the three Jills announced in unison to the whole school: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd like to share the truth we know about you humans. All humans ever do is argue, commit crimes, have war, spread disease and overall kill each other. The whole world will die off unless someone does something about it. There has always been one person who transcended humanity. Jill, your favourite cheerleader. She was not only perfect but beautiful too. If everyone was like her, the world would be safe, beautiful and perfect. That was never to be a reality...until recently. Another Jill appeared. And another one. We can make all of you into Jills with a mere touch. The world will be better off for it. And then we can continue, until the world is perfect. Humans are nothing more than a disease. A cancer that will kill this planet unless a cure is found. And Jill is the cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people understood the Matrix references in that speech. Some thought Jill, Jillian and whoever else was the third one had gone crazy. Some were scared. However, all three were proven right when the Jills burst into the halls, turning people into Jills left, right and center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there were dozens of Jills, all one being, hunting down those hiding in the school. Then there was a hundred. Then everyone was one except four students; a cheerleader named Karen, a nerd named George, a new student named Ryan and a tomboy named Charlene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis unlikely gang was hiding in a boy's bathroom, hoping no Jill would come in. They had to find a way out of the school. And warn the world. And somehow, apparently, save it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the odds were against them. Hundreds of Jills. They couldn't touch a single one. And on top of that, unbeknownst to them, each Jill had a necklace. Each capable of everything that has happened so far and more. Just like the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hallway nearby. And a door to get out. It was locked, but they could ram it open. A hard push should open it. But the Jills were going through the whole school, looking for them. And who knows where they were in the massive school? Should they run for the door?</span></div></div>",

There really was a galaxy far far away!...Well, not that far. It was in fact just the Andromeda Galaxy that had everything from Star Wars in it. Though he saw no Empire and Rebels duking it out, but he did see planets like Coruscant and Naboo with the various SW species on them.<br>\r\n3. Outside of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies...the unverse was pretty empty and dull. There was life, yes, but nothing really special.<br>\r\n4. He saw none other than Mario flying around galaxies as well. Which weirded Robert out more. And poor Mario ended up hitting Robert unknowingly and flying off towards a much more difficult galaxy than the one he was heading towards originally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking more at the Star Wars galaxy, Robert found a mostly empty galaxy (as in, no life). Then he flew through a random and nearby star, causing it to supernova! He did it to a few more stars, and simply moved faster than the nova shockwave to escape. This was pretty fun, but ever since he had gotten so fast, Robert constantly felt like he was seeing double, then triple, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't shake it. He kept having visions of other places in the universe, even though he might not be near that place. He soon got an answer, when he ran into himself.

With her looks, she could be a supermodel or something. Why did she become a con artist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question bothered her. It always had. But she did what she had to. She always got by somehow. Still, she felt like she didn't have any real friends. Like she was some sort of alienated...alien.

And when she opened them she found herself in a forest.  A strange, seemingly animated forest.  She looked around and saw a small cottage behind her.  She looked down and noticed that she was near a stream.  And in that stream was her reflection.  She was beautiful, in fact she could sense she was the most beautiful, or the fairest in the land.  April blinked.  She had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow White!  Holy cow.  And that must be the house where the 7 dwarfs live!  Touching the necklace, she suddenly realized that she must have wished this and the necklace granted it.  Taking stock for a moment, she figured she was in the middle of the movie.  Already chased away from her home, but not yet fooled by the wicked witch.  And then her thoughts shifted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could thinking about being a super model do this?  Standing back up she touched her clothes.  Very outdated.  She had the beauty of a model, but not the super part.  Her random thoughts shifted again.  This about more than wishing for her prince to come.  This was about more than being the fairest in the land.  This was about\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the most \u201csuper\u201d in the land.  And at that point she began to feel waves of energy pore over her.  Her dainty body hardened as she became incredibly powerful.  Blinking as reality continued to warp around her with random thoughts, her mind rested on who would be challenging her to the most super in the land.  The only one that made sense was Superman himself.  He would be the only one who could challenge her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winds whipped around her and reaching her arms out, she felt even more energy blast into her body!  Incredible strength and ability washed across her body.  Within moments her feet were no longer touching the ground!  She was floating!  No, she was flying.  Just flying in a hover mode.  Dizzy from the incredible power now pounding throughout her body, April allowed herself to drop back to the ground.  If she were now strong enough to challenge Superman, these clothes had to go.  Now smiling as if this were all predestined, she slipped off the long skirt to reveal a spandex bottom of the same color, barely covering her behind.  She wore modest ankle high boots that were the same color as Snow White\u2019s shoes.  Giggling now, she unclasped the top from behind and pulling her arms out, let the top fall to the ground at her feet, sporting a crop top spandex top with the Superman S on the chest and W superimposed behind it.  Was it for Snow White or Super White?  If it was Super Snow White she needed another S.  The spandex showed off her midriff and the sleeves barely covered her shoulders.  The color scheme matched the top lying at her feet.  She was still Snow White.  But a Super Snow White!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrinkling her nose, she started verbalizing her thoughts to try and keep things straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK!  I really am a super model now!  I\u2019m guessing I have super powers.  I already know I can fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking toward a large tree, April reached out and ripped it out the ground with ease, holding the 50 foot tree above her head!  Smiling, she tossed the tree into the air and it sailed up and out of sight!  Holy cow, just how strong was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, super strong apparently!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her chin, she looked around, smiling as she could now see for miles, and through solid rock.  She could see the dwarfs hard at work in the mine.  And as she looked in another direction, the landscape changed.  Far away was the city.  Metropolis apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where Superman must be.\u201d</span></div></div>",

So if that\u2019s the case, Superman must want me out the way because\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, April finished her thought.  \u201cI\u2019m the most Super in the land, not him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, April licked her lips.  \u201cWell if that\u2019s the case, and I\u2019m the most Super in the land, then I should sport a body more super than his too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, April\u2019s silky white body began to pulse.  And her muscles began to grow.  Laughing, April could sense what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was already stronger than him with the body of Snow White.  Only now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscles began to expand across April\u2019s body, but not just any muscle, but super muscles!  Her thin legs pressed out with slabs of unreal muscles, first big enough to match Superman and then just as quickly to surpass him!  Her calves expanded to 14 inches and then to 16 and then to the size of cantaloupes, literally pulsing with super strength!  Her thighs thickened and pressed forth waves of muscle fibers that multiplied into twin pillars of strength 18 inches wide and 12 inches thick!  Her midsection remained narrow, but her stomach soon sported a solid six pack that quickly became an 8 pack and then a 10 pack!  Soon muscles ran up the sides as her obliques pressed forward more muscles than April had previously even know existed!  Her back widened and her chest pushed forward, stretching the spandex out.  Soon her modest chest had morphed into a set of super powered double D\u2019s backed up with a set of pectorals strong enough to bench press the entire city of Metropolis!  Her nipples tented the material as the insignia warped outward.  Smiling, April reached her arms out and pulled her rippling forearms up.  Giggling she could hardly believe what she was seeing as her biceps consolidated into twin spheres the size of softballs, with two deep bowed triceps.  And then they began to grow, expanding out in every direction as the peaks crept up her forearms.  And the bigger her biceps grew, the stronger she became!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!  Superman?  I\u2019ll show him who had the right to use the word Super!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer biceps soon reached 20 inches around, matching those of Superman!  But she was hardly done!  Continuing to flex her mega powered arms, April\u2019s strength roared passed Superman\u2019s as her muscles expanded beyond his wildest dreams!  Within moments, April was sporting 30 inch biceps, then 40 inch bicep!  Then with one final earth shaking flex, her gigantic, mountainous biceps rocked the world at 50 inches each!  Her peaks pushed up to the top of her fists!  She wasn\u2019t just stronger than Superman!  April, code name Super Snow White was eclipsing his strength!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look at these muscles!  There isn\u2019t an ounce of fat of them!  I can see every super powered muscle fiber on my mighty biceps right up to the deep split and enormous peak!  I\u2019m not just the most super in the land!  I\u2019m the most super in the entire galaxy!  Superman had better be worried!  He had better be scared shitless!  Because Super Snow White is about to kick his sorry super ass across this planet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her flex, Snow White floated off the ground and aiming for Metropolis, blasted forward, breaking the sound barrier in a flash and sending hurricane force winds in her wake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the legend goes, once upon a time there was a man of unsurpassed power - a true Superman. Amongst a world of mortals his power and might were unchallenged. And he remained unchallenged in power until another infant arrived rocketed from the stars. Feeling a kinship for the infant, he adopted her as his own and raised her. He used the advanced science of his fortress to confirm that this child was in fact Kryptonian, her rapidly growing strength providing further evidence of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as this child, who he called April, grew, she changed. She did not adopt her adoptive father's morality. Nor did her strength grow at the pace his had when he was growing up - instead it grew FASTER. One day he took her to his friend Dr. Hamilton to test her limits and afterwards he asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emil, Emil of Star Labs, who's the most Super in the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, these were not his exact words, but legend tends to change things. Similarly altered by legend, his friends response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Superman you are strong by far, but April's might is without par.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hamilton had discovered that April's Kryptonian DNA had been modified by the science of Darkseid to make her far more powerful than Superman - she had been a trap sent by the despot as part of his longest term gambit against the Man of Steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing what his adoptive daughter might do with her power, Superman turned to a trusted friend to help him dispose of this child. The Dark Knight would take the girl into the woods and there slay her using the myriad of tools he had acquired over the years for protection against Kryptonians - a kryptonite ring, a kryptonite bullet, a red sun cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, when Batman led her into the woods in the guise of training her, he could not bring himself to kill her. Though the combination of Kryptonite and Red Sun energies weakened her enough to be killed (against Superman they would have done the job with no additional help needed), he could not bring himself to kill a woman of such beauty as April possessed - especially once April grew wise to his plans and used that intense beauty to seduce and do him into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Batman returned to Superman, after leaving April at a small community of dwarves, claiming to have slain her - and Superman would have thought no more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with her 7 new servants - all quickly falling subservient to her will, April used the Kryptonite and Red Sun Cannon to hone her abilities further - practicing under their influence - growing strong enough even under their influence to match the powers of her Adoptive Father even when he was free of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that is the history of April as Superman, Batman and the Seven Dwarves remember it thanks to the necklace, though for April this world is brand new. And with the power coursing through her veins she has decided not to wait for Superman to come for her (not, of course, that he yet had any plans to) - and goes to him instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes very little effort to find him, even in his civilian identity he is easily picked out from a crowd by a woman capable of looking at people down to their very DNA with a slight glimpse - though she did not understand it's complexities she had no problem recognizing the man with the absurdly different DNA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to give her prey little time to react and simply scooped him up off the street at Superspeed - he cried out in pain, but that was not surprising as she was travelling at speeds he could not match and easily hit him with a force like a punch from Doomsday even just picking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Superman.\", she said, favoring him with a sexy grin that elicited a massive hard on from him as he drank in the body of his captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April...?\", he started to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided to get this out of the way right now so that you know how pitiful any attempt to stop me would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Superman could speak again he and April were out of the atmosphere and their voices would no longer carry - they were passed the orbital distance of the moon before he could even begin to think of his fate - and moments later he was being hurtled at the planet from that distance at a speed that his own flight powers could not substantially reduce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis impact with Antarctica created a crater in the subcontinent hundreds of feet deep, kicking dirt and ice enough into the atmosphere that it would have killed all life on the planet, had April not followed behind and used her super lungs to inhale the deadly sun blocking cloud and cough it out as a highly compressed object with density greater than diamond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she flew to the bottom of the crater to find her battered, broken target...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is true that Clark Kent, Superman, had been the strongest man on planet Earth, but April was the strongest woman and had destroyed him.  The man of steel was still recognizable, for his hard body did not break as a human's body would have, but the impact was more than he could take.<br>\r\nDrunk with power, April hoisted Superman up, careful not to destroy the corpse.  This was her trophy, after all.  With great speed she flew off to Metropolis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crash April landed in City Hall, her beautiful face beaming with pride.  The crowds were beginning to gather.<br>\r\n\"I am Super Snow White\" she boomed aloud.  Her voice shook the city.  \"I am Super Snow White, much more powerful the Superman ever was, and I will now be your protectress.\"  But the townspeople did not know her.  They began to murmur.  The Murmur turned into a roar as people began to shout.  Most did not believe it for, to them, Superman was invincible, but those that saw the scene were afraid.  By this point Superman's body was oozing blood.  His blue and red clothing was ripped in many places.  He looked deformed.  Seeing the people's displeasure, April began to become angry.<br>\r\n\"Did the people not want a more powerful protector?\" she thought.<br>\r\nAcross the square was a highly reflective building, and in the building's mirror-like surface she saw her image.  Her once beautiful body appeared distorted.  Her face shone with its former beauty, but was filled with horror at the sight of her enormous muscles.  They contributed to her power, but their sheer size made her look grotesquely masculine.  In anger she took Superman's body and began to rip it apart, throwing limbs and organs about aimlessly, striking and killing many citizens.  <br>\r\nSirens blared.<br>\r\nGunshots echoed through the streets.<br>\r\nBut these people had no weapon to defeat this arch-villainess, except for one boy.  His weapon lay unrealized, unknown, and wholly of the enemy.  <br>\r\nYou see, in her greed for size and strength, April's magical necklace had become too tight to span her enormous neck.  In her zeal to snatch up Superman, she dropped the necklace from her hand (for she had no pockets.)  Young Samuel Kent had been walking with his father when he was forced aside, necklace in hand.  He awoke from a stupor to hear the horrors at city hall. and 10-year-old Samuel ran very fast towards the din, (for he was half Kryptonian his mother being Lois Lane Kent and father Clark Kent), putting on the necklace as he ran.  As he watched the monstrosity of a woman defile his father's body, he made straight for her, running at full speed, imagining her strength matchless to his own.  He imagined that as he struck her he would pass right through her abdomen, pulling her life fully out of her.<br>\r\nApril looked towards him and laughed.  She laughed haughtily and with spite, too proud of her strength and power to move.  How could a little boy be a threat to her?  At the last moment, too late to react, she noticed, to her horror, the neckless upon the boy's neck.  Just as Samuel had imagined, he dove for her, hands outstretched and clasped together before him.  As he struck her, between the navel and the sternum, his hands pierced her and he passed on through, leaving in his wake a gaping hole of mangled flesh.  An ungodly profusion of blood poured from her gory mass, covering the city hall steps in a red river.<br>\r\nSamuel was beside himself with his newfound power.<br>\r\n\"Where did it come from?\" he thought.  He next imagined her diced into a thousand pieces.  When he gestured towards her, it happened.  As if invisible knives were cutting her, she was slowly severed into death.  She stared up at him, incredulous, desperate.  But in due time, she expired.<br>\r\nBy this point Samuel had an inkling of how these incredible things were happening.  Townspeople were cheering him left and right, reporters asking him what happened and how.  Jimmy, from the Daily Planet, stood in front of him, taking pictures without ceasing.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sammy, how'd ya like my new digital camera?  You're father helped me pick it out!\"  But Samual was devastated.  His father's remains were strewn all about, and no one knew that Superman had in fact been Clark Kent, his father.  He imagined with all his might that Clark was alive again, but nothing worked.  He could not bring him back to life.<br>\r\nSam's mind was racing.  He was scatterbrained.  He thought of his homework, his reading, his math problems for school; all were fleeting thoughts.  Then he remembered vividly the book his father was reading to him just the night before: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  How Samuel loved it when his father would read him stories!<br>\r\nJust then a woman screamed in a high pitch: \"AHHHHHHHHH!!!\"  Samuel wheeled around to see an enormous snake strangling a woman's husband.  All those that looked upon the beasts eyes collapsed to the ground.  \"I'm not ready for this,\" whimpered Samuel subtly.<br>\r\n\"Ready or not, here we come!\" yelled a young British voice from behind.  Just then, three figures came flying in, all riding what appeared to be brooms!  One held a sword, and, dangling from the end of the sword, was a shining silver necklace.  The 3 were hurtling towards the snake while one of the 3 blinded it with a burning ball of fire.  Yet again, young Samuel was beside himself.<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's MY necklace!\" he yelled aloud.<br>\r\n\"Finders keepers!\" Screamed the red-haired boy.<br>\r\n\"That's not nice, Ron!\" Screamed the girl flying with them.  \"We'll give it back to you,\" she yelled back.<br>\r\n\"Hell, we won't!\" said the dark-haired one.  \"Blimey, Hermione, why would I give something back which I've rightfully stolen?  It's not as if HE's gonna chase after us.\"<br>\r\nThere was a pregnant pause.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"Er, Harry?\" said Ron.<br>\r\nSamuel had never fully learned how to fly.  He had only jumped very high, but his father had been coaching him for a long time, confident that with proper effort he could, in fact, learn.  Now was the time, for when the three broom riders looked back, Samuel was hurtling towards them, arms outstretched.<br>\r\n\"Oy!\" said Harry.<br>\r\n\"Yikes!\" said Ron.<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" screamed Hermione.<br>\r\n\"FLY!\" they all said aloud.  As quickly as they could, they flew towards the sky.  They forgot about the Basilisk, the giant, now-blinded snake currently feasting on the citizens of Metropolis.  They had been aiming to destroy it, but now that they were fleeing for their lives they had little choice but to leave.  Their brooms were fast, especially Harry's, but Samuel was steadily gaining.<br>\r\nTurning around and pointing his wand directly at the boy, Harry yelled: STUPEFY!  Samuel fell like a sack of rice, crashing through a stained-glass skylight of the Cathedral down below  \"This is weird\" thought Harry.  They were soaring along, heading back to Hogwarts Castle, when Harry got to thinking.  He had put the necklace on by now to avoid losing it.  He had thought, up to this point, that it was a mere trinket, no more than a precious heirloom.  What does Harry conjure up?</span></div></div>",

Jacob was expecting the other students to stare at her as she passed, treating her like a freak because of her massive body, but the exact opposite was happening.  In fact, everyone seemed to treat her as one of the most popular kids in school and didn't appear to be put off by her body at all.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, my God,\" Jacob thought to himself.  \"I haven't turned her into a pariah.

And my squat and deadlift was close to 900.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jacob replied, truly amazed at the reality he had created for her.  \"I guess there's not a lot of guys here that can keep up with you, are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" she said, adjusting her jersey.  \"Even the biggest guy on the team, Evan Smith, can only bench around 300.  And he's, like, a foot taller than I am.  Plus, he outweighs me by 30 pounds.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob thought about Evan for a moment, one of the outside linebackers for the team.  He was 6'6\" and a little over 300 pounds, most of it muscle.  To think that he wasn't even able to lift half of what Jill was able to do was a little scary, though in a good way, he had to admit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever had a boyfriend?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jill replied.  \"It's not that I don't want one.  It's just that most of the guys here are just...well, they're not my type.  No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Jacob replied.  He thought about what type of guy would be able to satisfy a woman like Jill, how large he'd have to be.  Jacob always wanted to be able to date a woman like her, even before he had changed her into the massively muscled woman sitting beside him.  Sure, she had always treated him and his friends badly growing up, but he was still attracted to her.  Even now, for some strange reason.  And besides that, after he had been able to talk to her, he found out that she wasn't a bad person.

And it wanted to show itself through the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudddenly, her hand and forearm start to swell as if burned.Jill then fell to the ground in pleasure.<br>\r\nWith bone-cracking agony, Jill's hand and arm start lengthening grotesquely, veins pumping through her new flesh to feed sudden hard cords of muscle. She grits her teeth as the process spreads to her foot, bursting out of its sandal and sprouting cruel claws. The skin over her transforming flesh roughens to a pebbly texture while deepening in color to a dark crimson shade. \"What am I turning into?\" She asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles continued growing exponentially, huge dense lobes pumping up her legs and arm. Gasping in exertion, Jill struggles to stand, her heart beating a mile a minute to lift the weight of her ponderous limbs. Her mind reels from a maelstrom of mixed feelings as she stares at her monstrous hand. She feels fright, yes, but also... anticipation?<br>\r\nThe muscles of Jill's upper arm continue to swell with each thundering heartbeat, every pulse bringing more and more ludicrous size. She wedges the massive juggernaut of her arm between the wall and the rest of her body, finally succeeding in standing upright by cradling her side in the irregular surfaces between her biceps and triceps. But her body does not stop there. The changes are becoming systemic now, barely even noticed against the background energy circulating through her and overloading her senses, locks of hair growing below her shoulders, breasts straining against her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnxiously, she looks in the shop window to comprehend her altering form, but finds the top of the window at the level of her chest! She twists around to look down at her towering legs, but instead her view is filled with the sanity-breaking sight of the advancing transformation ripping through her hips and previously nonexistent ass. With barely a fight, her pants explode into cloth confetti, revealing gigantic hard buttocks that put her friends' asses to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien thoughts start to invade her mind, vengeful and aggressive, while the fiendish metamorphosis continues up her body. Jill's hips widen, rebuilding themselves on a stupendous new scale, while twinges of pain like a thousand small balloons popping force its way into her stomach. She throws her head back, mind staggering, eyes rolling up, as the pervasive tsunami of bodily sensation washes over her. The veins and arteries in her abdomen and chest pulse and pump larger, solid plates of muscle violently inflating into being while her shirt stretches and finally bursts open over her expanding breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill felt the changes as they ripped through the center of her being, rebuilding her mind as monstrously and completely as her body. Threads of emotion and her entire fabric of motivation are pulled apart and put together again, reconstructed into a new mentality without social restraint or the ability to feel remorse. Moaning as she feels her conscience disappearing, Jill barely notices as her hair spurts out in progressively longer hanks of wavy locks, falling over the furrowing landscape of her back as mutant muscle and beastly skin continue to spread across it. Her right arm finally succumbs to the change, injecting hard muscle that quickly swells to bodybuilder sizes and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stands in a daze, her moans turned into heavy panting, like she has just run a mile at a full clip. Her mind races through a frenzied cycle of grief at her dwindling capacity for empathy, slowly replaced by primitive joy in being able to exercise her brutish desires without caring for the consequences, and happiness at her shrinking ability to feel grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's burgeoning upper body continues to writhe and develop while she is caught in this trance. As her right arm continues its explosive race to become the twin of her colossally muscled left, the sharp tips of two of her blackened nails catch and dig into the wall. With a sudden savage impulse, she flexes her fingers and they rip a long slash with their 5-inch claws. A spike of pleasure and an ever-fading amount of dismay run through her at how easy it was to split the wall open. It was just like shredding tissue paper....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire body below the neck completes its dreadful metamorphosis, leaving her head sitting atop a body twice the width and height of a linebacker. Each inch of her ogre-like frame is covered in rough red skin and packed to overflowing with dense, vascular muscle. Her hair, having continued its riotous growth, now buries her head and shoulders in a heavy mane of black rings. The only intact piece of clothing she has now is the choker around her neck, but even that is showing signs of strain, the underlying tendons tightened with painful intensity under reddening skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaws slack, eyes glazed and wild, Jill fights a losing battle against the inner forces running rampant through her head. As the remaining vestiges of her morality are stamped out, the horrified girl feels the last part of the change start to contort her face. Bones and flesh thicken, mouth widening, nose lengthening, cheeks and chin distend, transforming her features into cruel caricatures of themselves. With a jaw-cracking jolt, a pair of horns like a longhorn bull's drive out of her expanding skull, and her teeth sharpen and multiply, filling her mouth even faster than it can grow. She opens her mouth to scream--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill feels a faint whimper of regret as the last of her humanity vanishes, and then she doesn't feel regret at all. She closes her freakishly wide mouth over frightful fangs. In a final grotesque surge of growth, her trapezius muscles explode into being, engulfing her neck and snapping her choker like a rubber band. Their immense bulges wrap around her head and part her falls of hair like mountains rising out of a black sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's body finally stills, the only movement the rising and falling of her awesome GG chest. Slitted amber eyes regard her brand-new form with satisfaction. She twitches the ends of her mouth up in a malice-filled grin. Jill the girl is gone. In her place is JilHantkopek, looking forward with diabolic glee to the mayhem she can inflict on the pathetic humans who had dared to cross her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExulting in her formidable new body, Jill crashes her way out of the alleyway as she</span></div></div>",

The laughter at Jill's expense died down as students turned to get books and other supplies out of their lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the necklace flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone but Jill suddenly felt strange sensations coming from their bodies, as if they were growing and stretching.  A look around showed that to be true -- people were obviously getting taller and muscular, without exception.  Girls looked down at their chests, amazed as their breasts swelled; simultaneously, their waists were shrinking and their hips and butts were enlarging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guy exclaimed, \"Holy shit!\" as his skin darkened to a reddish hue.  Within seconds, most everyone had become that color, although a few people now had ebony-dark bodies, and a few others were nearly white as ghosts.  Meanwhile, those who didn't already have black hair had the hair on their heads change to that color, except for some who had their hair recede entirely into their scalps, leaving them bald -- even some girls, who screamed, seeing it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorns grew out of everyone's head, with some getting two small protrusions from the forehead, some getting long, curving horns coming from the side of their heads, and a few of the now-bald students having a line of horns grow  down the middle of their heads, looking like a bizarre Mohawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEars grew larger, their tips becoming pointed.  Canine teeth grew into fangs.  Fingernails darkened and pushed outward into inches-long talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing that was already straining against everyone's height and musculature increases began to rip as spines lengthened into tails and wings grew out of almost everyone's backs -- some dark and leathery, like a bat, some made of black feathers, befitting a fallen angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the guys suddenly sprouted fur below their waists, as their thighs thickened, shoes disappearing as their feet shrank, toes merging, flesh becoming dark-colored keratin.  They now appeared to have cloven-hoofed goat legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls's shoes also disappeared, but their feet remained human-looking, save for the long black talons that their toenails expanded into.  Suddenly, though, they found themselves up on tiptoes as bone grew out of their heels, forming into natural stilettos, about 6 inches high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill saw a girl near her, with a trembling red, taloned hand, grasp the silver cross that hung on a chain around her neck -- only to drop it like a hot potato when it transformed into a pentagram.  It wasn't just accessories -- everyone's ruined clothing was morphing or disappearing.  Most of the girls found themselves clad only in short leather skirts, their large breasts on full display, the nipples pierced with barbells or rings.  Most of the guys were fully nude, their sheathed equipment hidden reasonably well beneath their fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the hallway suddenly changed.  They no longer appeared to have been constructed out of plaster, but instead, it was as if they had been carved out of rock.  The classroom doors were now made out of some kind of dark, rough wood, with iron handles.  Flaming torches appeared high on the walls, the overhead fluorescent lights disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been a banner hanging from the ceiling in the distance that read \"PROM APRIL 17TH - GET YOUR TICKETS NOW!\"  It was the same, except that the first word now read \"ORGY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill tried to catch her breath.  It wasn't just having seen these bizarre transformations; it was also the fact that it was a bit smoky and dim in the hallway now that the light came from torches, and that combined with the fact that everyone else was now at least a foot taller than her -- well, she could feel a panic attack coming on.  She practically lunged toward the nearby fountain, attached to the rock wall.  Leaning over, she turned the handle -- and promptly spit out the thick, warm red liquid that had filled her mouth.  It was no water fountain; it was a blood fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere hadn't been much noise while the physical transformations were in progress -- almost everyone had seemed stunned as they watched their own and their classmates' bodies change -- but now the volume level was increasing.</span></div></div>",

About half of the student body and most of the teachers, whom all seemed just as young as the student body now, were flooding the halls, fleeing for their lives, unsure what to do. It seemed they became demons only in form, not in spirit. However, some of the more delinquent students, about a pack of 235, seemed to be embracing their demonic forms, seemingly becoming demons in both mind and body, as they tormented the panicked masses, some leaving out the windows to reek havoc, while many began fornicating right there in the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a small pocket of students, roughly 80 or so, while they appeared scared, stayed calmed, and many of them were trying to protect the fleeing masses from the evil demons. All of these students were girls, still had clothes over their larger breasts, were missing the bony stilettos, still had normal human skin tones, and had black feathery wings, but also seemed to have something the other demons lacked; black halos. Jill judged by some facial features she could still recognize, these girls were all the other \"ugly girls\" and \"outcasts\" in school that got picked on, but were also considered the \"geeky\" girls and the \"nice\" girls, it seems they were too pure to be turned into full demons. A rather shy girl who still had blonde hair somehow, who was shyly holding one arm over her tiny tube top covered massive jugs in an attempt to hide them a she told people in a high meek voice amidst the chaos, \"Please remain calm. We will stop the dangerous students from hurting you.\" appeared to be these \"good\" demons' leader. Jill recognized her polite voice as 17 year old Hilda Jenkins, a very shy bookworm that never had many friends, but seemed to have managed to get all the good souls together to help the uncorrupted to flee the school. This girl just radiated an aura that screamed \"devoid of any and all sin &amp; evil thought,\" Jill thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda saw Jill, yanked her aside with her tail, and batted down an evil demon that had been ready to pounce on Jill from behind with a large wooden cross, then struck him again, somehow reverting him to his mortal form. \"It is dangerous in here. We must flee.\" She takes Jill's hand as the good demons fall back for the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they make it out, Jill sees only the school changed; it was now a Hell-Mouth; a gateway to Hell. Cops had come out of the woodwork, surrounding the vortex and scratching their heads at the people that looked like demons but didn't act like demons fleeing from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill wondered, \"What about Steven?\"</span></div></div>",

He was about to stuff it back into the backpack, but, the strange piece of jewelry seemed to almost call out to him, with its weird, magical, bright blue glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, that strange glow is kinda\u2026 weird\u2026\u201d he sighed. \u201cOh, I guess I might as well wear it around my neck\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin unclipped the necklace and placed it around his neck. Then, he fastened the clips. Instantly, the necklace seemed to shrink, tightening around his neck. It still fit snug; however, it almost fit tight enough, as if nobody would ever be able to remove it from around his neck, except him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange\u2026 I thought the necklace was looser than this\u2026\u201d he shrugged. \u201cOh well\u2026 It\u2019s mine, now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, one of the football players from school came walking towards him, carrying a big notebook binder under his right arm. The big, muscular boy recognized Benjamin and he signaled for Benjamin to come towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ben! Did you go to that Creative Writing class this morning?\u201d the big and tall boy asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Mitch! Yes, I was there. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed class this morning, bud! Listen, dude! Lemme have your notes!\u201d Mitch replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way! I need those notes for the test! Go get them from somebody else! That\u2019s what you get for skipping class all the time!\u201d Benjamin replied angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch became angry and extended his big, muscular arm, and grabbed Benjamin by the shirt collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, twerp! Gimme your notes NOW! Or else I\u2019ll rip your head off, GOT IT?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can bully me just because you got big biceps, you big LUG!??\u201d Benjamin protested. \u201cPick on someone your own size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch then pushed Benjamin off and hurled him to the ground.  Benjamin fell hard with his back on the ground. Luckily, he landed on a patch of grass, so he wasn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhhhhh\u2026 You big bully\u2026. I wish I had big biceps so you\u2019d leave me alone\u2026\u201d Benjamin mumbled in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, the necklace around Benjamin\u2019s neck began to glow again. A second later, Benjamin felt an odd, powerful tingling feeling in his arms. Within seconds, his biceps inflated to the size of bowling balls, becoming big, round and hard, forming large, genuine peaks of muscle the minute Benjamin made a fist and flexed his arms, even if he flexed them just a little bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Where did those muscles come from?\u201d Mitch gasped, when he saw Benjamin slowly stand up, sporting two enormous biceps on his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026 My arms have gotten bigger!\u201d Benjamin chuckles, as he took turns flexing each one in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 Uhhmm\u2026 Forget about the notes, man\u2026.\u201d Mitch said to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, Benjamin\u2019s biceps were bigger than Mitch\u2019s, and Mitch quickly turned around and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! What happened? Did that necklace do this to me?\u201d Benjamin wondered, as he flexed his right arm and admired his huge, bulging bicep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought, \u201cWhat if I were Supergirl, but with Superman\u2019s muscles?  Or better yet, what if Superman were here and I grew stronger than him as my muscles grew bigger and bigger?\u201d  So as she looked at Ben, she giggled out her silly wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish Superman were here to see me transform into Super Mega Emily so I could put him to shame!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin\u2019s eyes widened with surprise, but as soon as she finished her statement, the ceiling rumbled and Superman tore through the roof and landed with an earth shaking thud next to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this I hear about some teen age girl thinking she\u2019s stronger than me?  I\u2019m tired of every so called super strong person challenging me.  Time to put this worthless girl down quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to see Emily go from wide eyed to confident as she now felt the power to lift mountains surge into her lithe body.  Playing it cool, Emily eyed Superman up and down.  At 6 foot 4, he\u2019s got enough muscle to win a bodybuilding championship.  His broad chest sports that legendary S and his arms are very well muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell before you show me whose boss, how about you flex up your big muscles to demonstrate what a superman you really are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman grumbled.  \u201cGreat, tricked here by a stupid cheerleader.  What\u2019s with the glasses anyway?  You\u2019ll never make head cheerleader with glasses.  But since you asked, I\u2019ll be glad to show you some real man muscle before I crush whatever spirit you think you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman moved closer to the 5 foot 4 inch Emily and leaning down slightly, he flexed up a 22 inch ball of Superman muscle, stretching his uniform tight around the manly mound of might!  Emily took her glasses off and pulled off the band holding her pony tail, allowing her long blonde hair to flow around her shoulders.  She handed both of them to Brad and gave him a wink.  Brad gulped with both surprise and desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back toward Superman, Emily reached out with her hands and caressed the muscle like any cheerleader would a football player.  But Emily was no longer just another cheerleader.  Pulling her hands away, she smiled into Superman\u2019s confident eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad.  Not bad.  But let\u2019s see what this worthless girl can do.  Hold that pose and let me see what I can flex up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pushed her right arm out and slowly brought her forearm up, tensing her fist.  The short, thin, but firm arm began to rumble as comet crushing strength, power and size began to roar into her waiting muscles.  Half way into her flex Emily\u2019s bicep was the size of a grapefruit and rising like a ball of dough with too much yeast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Superman, my muscles are filled with mega girl power, not puny Kryptonion power.  And you\u2019re soon going to find out which power is greater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman\u2019s eyes widened as he watched Emily\u2019s bicep rise upward next to his.  And as her forearm reached vertical and moved toward her shoulder, her bicep had blown up to the size of a cantaloupe at nearly 20 inches around of rippling, vein engorged might.  With a tight squeeze to her fist, Emily then popped her bicep up bigger, harder and tougher, matching the size of the now sweating Man of Steel.  Chuckling at both her building power and Superman\u2019s expression, Emily licked her lips and purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Mega Girl Power has given me the strength and muscle to match the bicep size of the mighty Superman with just one flex.  But sorry to say, Superman, I really haven\u2019t flexed all that hard yet.  Want to see me flex harder Superman?  Want to see what this stupid cheerleader can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman cleared his throat, worried about what this girl was truly capable of.  He also noticed that rips and tears were occurring on the rest of her clothes as it wasn\u2019t just her biceps adding mounds of pumped up muscle, but the rest of her body as well.  Her athletic legs were now bulging out as big as his too, and her calves were actually bigger!  Her skirt hid some of her legs, but a quick glance with his x-ray vision indicated that those thighs were thick, strongly muscled but still curved with feminine lines.  Her crop top sweater was pulled up higher as threads were being popped against her enlarged chest and back, exposing her rock hard defined, yet still narrow 8 pack abs.  Emily giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you do!  You want to see what all the fuss was about.  Well hold onto to your cape, because I\u2019ll show you what a REAL bicep flex looks like, so called Superman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulled her forearm back slightly as another, louder and harder rumble of power emanated from her bicep as the power to lift planets exploded into her muscles.  Giggling at the feeling of nearly overwhelming power coursing through her body, Emily tensed her fist, pulled her forearm forward and flexed down hard with an earth shaking boom that sent her bicep blasting upward at an alarming rate!  Muscle built upon muscle as her bicep expanded to 28 inches around in moments and continued to grow rapidly.  Superman was really sweating now as he watched this young cheerleader\u2019s bicep expand to over 30 inches around as her arm added an inch of muscle ever second with micro booms indicating the ever growing strength accompanying her increase in muscle size.  Emily smiled knowingly as her eyes began to glow brighter with her power continued to ramp upward.  Her bicep was now totally eclipsing Superman\u2019s once proud bicep, expanding beyond 36 incredible inches around.  And worse yet for Superman, Emily\u2019s bicep was not only much larger, but it was harder, stronger and better defined!  Emily smiled at the worried look on Superman\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooops!  It looks like my bicep is now bigger than yours Superman.  But guess what.  I\u2019m not done yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily flexed her mighty arm a few more times with a louder boom accompanying each flex, shaking the walls of the school with earthquake force.  Seconds later, her mountainous bicep had expanded to 44 world record breaking inches around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm, it looks this puny girl has flexed a bicep that is MUCH bigger than yours, Superboy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more earth shaking flexes sent her incredible, star smashing bicep peak up over her fist as her bowling ball bicep ground up to 50 impossible inches of pure fem super muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s now over TWICE your size, you pathetic little man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrible rips soon indicated that all of Emily\u2019s muscles had pounded bigger, outclassing Superman in every department and any male bodybuilder on earth too!  Her sweater now hung on her massive shoulders like rags and her skirt was pushed out against raging thighs of doom.  And showcased below the ruined sweater was a pink spandex bikini top with the word Super on her left breast and Mega on her right.  And tattooed in the center of her massive, bulging super hard pectorals was a picture of Superman\u2019s shield with an E in the center.  And what a chest!  Massive, basketball sized pecs of pure power rocked up and down, bristling with might and flexing up with titanic power.  Striations ripped up across her mighty pecs as she giggled with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now it seems that ALL of my muscles are much bigger than yours Superman.  But we need to find out something else.  Reach out and squeeze my girl bicep, Superman.  She how hard it is.  How defined it is.  How ripped it is.  See if you can make a dent in my mighty muscle Superman.  See if you have what it takes to be called Super.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman growled, tired or taking Emily\u2019s taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve flexed up muscles so big, but I\u2019m still Superman and you\u2019re just a puny cheerleader.  I\u2019m going to crush your muscles to paste!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily held her gigantic bicep flex and her smile as Superman scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell go ahead and try.  Do I need to ask you twice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman grunted and reaching out with both hands, slapped them on Emily\u2019s mountain of muscle and squeezed down with all of his might.  His grunting grew louder and his knuckles turned white, but he was unable to make the slightest indentation in Emily\u2019s beyond super hard muscle.  Emily chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Super Wimp?  Can\u2019t you even make a tiny dent in my mega girl muscles?  I thought you were going to crush my muscles to paste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman pulled his hands off, took a step back and growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what kind of trick you\u2019re playing, but I\u2019ve had enough of your lip!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his right arm up into a fist, Superman pulled his arm back and putting everything he had into it, sending his fist at Emily\u2019s head, looking to knock her into next week.  But Emily reached out with blinding speed and grabbed his wrist before his could connect, shocking the Man of Steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that wasn\u2019t very nice.

WHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman let out a surprised yelp and blinked his eyes as he looked up into the beautiful face of this teen-age supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t think I\u2019m done.  You\u2019ve got quite a lesson coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulled him back up and over her head, slamming him into the ground on her other side.  WHAM!  She barely paused as she pulled him back over her head again with another earth shaking thud.  WHAM!  Emily continued to slam Superman into the ground, deeper and deeper with each blow.  WHAM!  WHAM!  WHAM!  WHAM!  With Superman stunned to near unconsciousness, Emily pulled him around her and began spinning Superman over her head until he was nothing but a red and blue blur.  Looking at Brad, Emily smirked and winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRound and round he goes, where he stops, nobody knows!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pushed up, letting go of Superman and he smashed through the ceiling and shot high into the air.  Emily looked over at Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Brad, that was fun.  What do you think?  Should I bring Superman back here and continue to humiliate him with my girl power, or would you like to see me challenge some other comic book heroes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gulped, taken back by given the choice.  He cleared his throat.  Well, why don\u2019t you\u2026..</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately, he begins to form some very nostalgic memories in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the mid-1980s, the video game industry prospered and proved to be a lucrative market once more thanks to the successes of Nintendo. James, a then young twenty-something, was a reviewer, whose job was to play and review video games, providing informative insight and criticism. This was done in the comfort of his own home, where he spent time with wife Linda and newborn son Steven. As cool as it seemed, it was a challenge completing the toughest of games for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on!\" young James yelled, as playing a platform game only to have died \"Argh!

Third, the place is clean and tidy, and while i could clean up things by myself with my magic, i would've certainly not replaced everything back in the closets, if only to ease up travelling without having to jump at all time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to investigate the furnitures of the house, going from room to room, starting up with the living room. The only details worth noting are th\u00e9 glass and bottles, available at both normal and micro size, implying guests, potentially, and an unmagnifying lens, setted up on the couch, facing a wide television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go to the kitchen, where, unsurprisingly, i find sets of dishes in the same size fashions as the bottles and glasses in the living room. What i was interested into the most is the fridge. An opening meant for me is standing on the bottom of it, but, weirdly enough, up ahead stands a freezer that isn't reachable without jumping and climbing upward. I decide to go inside to see what to see what's about. I see pretty much what i'd expect: Eggs, juices, meat and such, as well as a few bottles of blood. All with an image of an animal. Being oversized only compared to my size, they contain, seemingly, sheep, cow, chicken and other farm animals' blood, except for one, which would contain dragon blood. On the left, i see a freezer, represented with a snowflake, and ahead of me is similarly filled with what i saw, excluding the blood vials. I exit the fridge and notices three sinks, with one for my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking good progress so far, and needing to go to the restroom, i head toward the bathroom. Two baths are in the room, but only one shower, with a compartiment for me. This makes me thinking that i'm not living alone in this house,  when i remember why i was here to begin with, rushing to the toilets. Nothing special, aside from a passage. I step in it and notice another restroom in the toilet, at my size, causing me to laugh and facepalms, given i do my needs in a toilet, <i>*inside a toilet*</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up, i head up to the bedroom. Inside, my attention get caught by a sweet smell, coming from a marsh. I wonder why, until i step in it and see it's furnished like a bedroom of its own, expect that of a traditional bed, there is waterbed on a pool. For some reasons, it represents anthropomorphic brown leech, nude, lean and bolstering a pair of C-cup breasts. The representation of the leech is roughly an inch tall, and same for her tail. My mind inadvertly drifts off, causing me to say, 'Oh dear..'. The necklace glows up, causing the waterbed to become more like the leech, rather being a mere image. <br>\r\nI scurry off my bed, not wanting to have more problems than i already have, toward the 'main' bedroom. I see nothing special again, given what i've seen so far. The only oddity being ladders onto the bed. Curious of why, i climb onto it and see that the pillows are in different sizes. Not understanding why, i seek hints around, when i hear someone entering the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jump off the bed, getting near a door, and spot a shadow. Waiting for an opportunity, i wait to flee, when i notice the shadow had disappear. Suddenly, a chill run through my spine, as i hear a 'boo'. Mechanically, i fearfully turn on myself, to notice a giggling dragoness. She speaks again, 'How's leechy's doing?'. With a mix of fear and anger, i yell, 'Leechy!?'. She giggles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness had an odd look. It looked like an hybrid between the blue eyes white dragon from Yu-gi-oh, and a snake. Her lean naga bottom support a lean chest, bolstering two exoskeletic arms, reinforced on the shoulders with plates. Two I-cup breasts stands onto her chest, holding with a tight band of cotton, acting as a bra. I couldn't be helped but saying, 'Oh dear..'. Causing the necklace to shine again. But, this time, only the dragoness' nipples becomes perky, now showing through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Here's an image if you want: {x-link:http://www.furaffinity.net/view/20581741/}Image{x-link})<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI..</span></div></div>",

Basically, a pretty 16 year old and amnesiac named Sylvia finds a necklace in a dumpster (sound familiar?). Sylvia doesn't remember her past, but it was heavily tied to this necklace...and she will wear the necklace, as she feels compelled to for some reason. And random things will happen as she embarks on a journey to discover her past and the necklace's past (both of which you can make as random as you want).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the necklace on, her every random thought becomes true and chaos ensues. Anything can happen and will happen. Just like the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this isn't the first one. This is the prequel. So, in this one, none of the events of The Necklace's Curse and it's questionable canon have happened yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia can meet characters from the first one (in fact a character list is below), but they don't know of the necklace or events from the first one (unless the necklace informs them or something like that). Also, they can get the necklace as well, but please remember to keep focused on Sylvia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say that, because this story is based around her using the necklace as she discovers the twisted and crazy pasts you make up for her and the necklace. Also, this may or may not explain her behaviour in the normal story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Necklace's Beginning Character List:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia - A pretty 16 year old who happens to go to the same school as Steven, Benjamin and Jill from the first one. Technically, they'd be 16 as well in this one and in the same school. And she's an amnesiac with little knowledge of her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver - An annoying 11 year old who happens to be both a prankster and Sylvia's foster brother. And he's a jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad - Sylvia's foster parents. Sylvia doesn't know her real parents (though you can make them up in the story for her). They're usually really kind, but maybe that's all an act...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther characters from The Necklace's Curse (a year younger due to this story taking place a year earlier):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven - 16 year old high school student. Has a stash of comic books. He's a fan, I suppose. Also, he's in love with Jill (though she doesn't care much about him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel - 11 year old sister of Steven. Loves anime and video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's Mom and Dad seem to never be around (doesn't mean you can't bring them in).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin - 15 year old best friend of Steven. Loves TV and books. Didn't appear much in original, feel free to use him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill - 16 year old cheerleader, ambitious, wants to be head cheerleader (in The Necklace's Curse, she is). Popular, pretty and probably evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha - A little girl who likes animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert - A school jock, wants to be strong(er) and fast(er) and has a girlfriend named Betty in The Necklace's Curse. Betty's status currently is unknown, feel free to do what you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril - A beautiful con artist, who became a student at Steven's school at some points in The Necklace's Curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob - A video game lover and school geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's...most of them, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Feel free to add anyone from the original not here, but remember, they don't know about the necklace...yet. You could make them learn about the necklace and even use it. Somehow, things revert back to normal and they forget until next year in The Necklace's Curse. You can even explain this weird event if you want.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe World Of Necklaces -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar to the normal story, except EVERYONE has a necklace. Everyone in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege of Craziness -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it's similar to the normal story, except all the underage and teenage characters have been survived the events of the \"main story\". They're now college age students and in college, but the necklace shows up again...and makes them all the same age (20).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: In this story, go crazy. As long as there is no underage stuff, do what you want. Due to the nature of this, there may be more \"mature content\" so you've been warned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at his own body, he felt comfortable.  He was big, but not too big.  The question was, just what could he do to others?  He hadn\u2019t tried yet, but with so many people to choose from he figured he could experiment quite a lot.  His mind wandered a bit as he caught site of his friend Sue.  She was a year younger at 15, but was smart enough to be in some of his classes.  At only 5 foot 2, she was quite geeky with mousy brown shoulder length hair and Wal-Mart clothes.  The jeans and pink sweatshirt both looked too big.  She was wandering the mall on her own and was currently looking at a display in the Video Game store.  The DC Universe game was on display and as Jake neared he glanced at the display he thought about what it be like if they were in such a universe, or better yet, what if Sue were as powerful as all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached her his mind started to picture Sue growing stronger and more powerful with big, bulging, earth shaking muscles.  The necklace began to glow in anticipation as Jake moved up next to Sue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Sue, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue looked up at Jake and smiled.  \u201cOh nothing, just checking out the latest games.  Do you have the DC Universe game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shook his head but returned her smile.  \u201cEver think about being a superhero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue blushed and giggled.  \u201cMe?  Well sure I guess.  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake licked his lips.  \u201cWell today is your lucky day.  I have the power to grant those wishes, or at least I think I do.  Want to find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue looked around to see if Jake were playing some kind of trick.  Seemingly ensured that it was just the two of them paying attention, Sue nodded her head.  Jake tried to remain calm as he pictured Sue growing muscles and gaining strength.  And as he did he watched Sue\u2019s face light up as she now sensed the power build within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue\u2019s clothes began to shift as her once out of shape body began to tighten with feminine curves, the fat melted away and the muscles began to grow larger.  Sue moaned with pleasure at the experience and grunted softly as the pace picked up.  The muscles surged through Jake\u2019s will and those once oversized clothes began to strain as her legs now pushed out with muscles to compete with the best sprinters in school and her upper body filled with more and more muscle across her back, shoulders, arms and chest.  Sue\u2019s once flat chest surged forward as Jake thought about not just female superheroes, but male one\u2019s as well, giving Sue mounting mounds of pectorals that quickly surpassed any boy in school, any man in town and on to those only drawn in comics.  The threads soon began ripping across both her jeans and her sweater as throbbing, super strong muscles continued to expand across her once frail frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue smiled knowingly as she felt her muscles grow harder and stronger as they pressed bigger.  Her thighs and calves burst through the thick denim, reducing the once oversized jeans to rags hanging along her narrow waist.  Those growing leg muscles danced and surged as more of her skin was exposed, causing Jake to gasp at the size and definition.  Her sweater was splitting in several areas and now pulled taught against her thickening shelf of pectorals, exposing her narrow, muscled up abs of steel.  Snickering, Sue reached down and tore off her jeans with ridiculous ease, exposing every inch of her mega muscled legs, leaving her in just her pink panties that seemed to be shrinking as her legs and glutes flexed into mounds of muscle.  By reaching down the once oversized sweater tore in several more places and quickly became more rags across her massive chest.  Sue smiled and brought her arms up and with a quick flex disintegrated the sleeves as twin balls of muscle the size of soccer balls exploded across her arms!  Jake\u2019s imagination had been going wild as movies of mushroom clouds were tattooed on her biceps, and the sound and fury of twin explosions rumbled from her muscles!  Untold, uncompromising strength consolidated in those same girl muscles, sending out a shock wave that shattered the windows of the nearby stores and caused Sue\u2019s hair to flitter and the rest of her sweater to sizzle off her 5 foot 2 inch teen-age girl body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake gasped, Sue\u2019s entire body glowed with might as her biceps pressed upward, doubling in strength with every inch of new muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue was staring at Jake, having tapped into his thoughts and driving her power upward.  Jake had thought about Sue becoming the strongest girl in the world with muscles to put any man to shame, but Sue was now exceeding those thoughts, becoming as strong as 10 men, 100 men, a thousand men, stronger!  Her biceps were now 36 inches around, gobs bigger than any man had ever flexed and still growing in strength and power!  Her naked, palpitating chest was a massive, striated muscular mound of angular, super strong fright bigger than two basketballs with the strength to bench press a battle ship!  Arcs of power danced between her nipples as Sue flexed those massive pectorals larger, pushing her chest out over two feet in front of her!  As the shock wave of power subsided and Jake finally blinked, Sue\u2019s expansion stopped and the glow of power dimmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue released her flex and stood there for a moment, breathing heavily as everyone nearby stared on in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness Jake, what did you do to me?  I\u2019m more muscular than any man alive, hell, most comic book heroes would look puny next to me!  Just how strong am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake swallowed.  \u201cI\u2019m uh, not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue pushed out her hip and smiled.  \u201cWell do you want to find out, or would you rather use your powers on my little sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded absently and Sue chuckled and looked at the DCU poster.  \u201cWell I know one person who we could test my new strength on.  But if you want to wait a moment and help me out, my younger sister has bully problems.  She\u2019s only 10 and is over at the toy store.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake gulped, enjoying Sue\u2019s bulging muscles, but also wishing to help her out.  \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The damage she had caused was also repaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue smiled, walked over to Jake and reaching around his comparably slender upper body, gave him a hug, pulled him up until his feet were off the floor.  Jake blushed and grunted from the pressure, enjoying the feeling of her rock hard chest against his chest.  Sue whispered in his ear before she let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for making me so strong.  This could be fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue giggled as Jake tried to compose himself and as people still stared with awe.  Jake and Sue then walked toward the toy store.  They soon found Sue\u2019s sister Mindy outside the Toy store sitting on a bench looking sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy looked up when she saw Sue and her eyes widened.  \u201cSue!  What happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue smiled and explained what Jake could do.  Mindy\u2019s mood changed immediately.  \u201cCould you make me strong too?  Those bullies are so mean.  They kicked me out of the toy store.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake smiled, happy to help out another girl.  \u201cSure thing, what did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to big muscles too!  Big, strong muscles to protect me and everyone at school from bullies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked at Mindy.  The small, 4 foot 7 inch girl had long blonde hair and sparkling blue eyes.  She was thin and was wearing a yellow tank top and blue shorts and yellow flip flops.  But she wouldn\u2019t have a thin body for long.  With a thought, muscles started popping all over Mindy\u2019s body.  Her legs, abs and upper body soon looked like she were a top level gymnast with thick thighs and calves, a wicked eight pack set of abs, a wide muscular back, thick meaty pecs, and strong shoulders and arms.  But even these impressive muscles didn\u2019t represent the strength Jake had given her, which was now as great as two strong men!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy tittered with excitement, flexing up a strong bicep the size of pool ball that was nearly as hard.  \u201cWow!  Thanks Jake!  I\u2019m sure to be able to take care of those boys now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy rushed up to Jake and nearly knocked him over as she gave him a waist level high hug that pushed the air out of him.  He reached down with his arms and returned the hug lightly on her back, trying not to show that she was hurting him a bit.  Fortunately she released the hug and turned back to the store front just in time to see two of the boys that had bullied her come out.  They were older boys and looked pretty tough.  But now that Jake had amped Mindy up, she no longer felt afraid and was ready to take them on.  Walking up to the boys she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two boys are going to stop bullying me from now on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys looked at each other and laughed.  Both boys walked closer as one looked down at her, not paying attention to her new physique.  \u201cOh yeah?  Says who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy smiled and reaching out with her small hands, gripped hands full of shirt on the two surprised boys.  \u201cSays me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy then shocked the two as she pulled her arms up, and the boys with them!  Their feet dangled above the ground and Mindy smiled with satisfaction.  \u201cIn fact, if I catch either of you two bullying anyone again, I\u2019m going to do more than just toss you away like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy then spun around once and tossed the two boys toward the nearby fountain.  They skidded along the floor and hit the base of the fountain and slumped against the concrete, shaken up, but not hurt too bad.  Mindy smiled and placed her fists on her hips, clearly satisfied with what she was now able to do.  But as she stared at the downed boys, the leader of the group, Tom, snuck up behind her and pulling his large up back, he balled his hand into a fist and turned to Mindy\u2019s side.  His arm swung quickly toward her exposed abs and he smiled cruelly with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, Jake saw what was happening and not wanting to see Mindy get hurt, wished for her muscles to be much harder with greater strength to match.  This simple thought pushed incredible amounts of power into Mindy and she let out a surprised yelp just as Tom connected with her abs.  Unfortunately for him, Mindy\u2019s abs were much harder than anything he could hope to penetrate and his fist connected with a snap and bounced off her mid-section.  Tom let out his yelp as he broke two fingers and his wrist.  Mindy shook her head from both the feeling of new power coursing her body and the fact that Tom had hit her hard in the stomach and she barely felt it.  She then smiled as Tom held his broken hand and winced with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Tom, that wasn\u2019t very nice sneaking up on a girl.  You\u2019re going to have to be taught a lesson.\u201d  She looked at his hand and chuckled.  \u201cWell a second lesson besides that fact that you now know that I\u2019ve got abs of steel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom\u2019s eyes widened with surprise and fear, Mindy reached out to his good arm and gripping his forearm pulled him toward her, down to the ground and with a yank, up into the air and with amped up strength that came with her hardened muscles, began to spin Tom around above her head.  Mindy smiled as Tom\u2019s form became a blur above her and his yelling became louder.  She looked over toward the fountain just as the two other boys were making it to their feet and with perfect aim, released Tom and he sailed toward the two boys, knocking all three into the fountain with loud splashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy jumped up and down with excitement.  \u201cBulls eye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned toward Tom and smiled, flexing her arms up into twin baseball sized biceps that glistened with the strength of ten men!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her flex she cocked her head to the side.  \u201cBut you know what?  Maybe you could\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To make matters worse, your behaviour is so poor...and you've treated me badly for too long. All those pranks. Maybe I should play a prank on you. But what to do? Maybe I could make you think you're me and I'm you, for all the times you've insulted me. Or maybe I could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia then thought she was being too cruel. This was due to the necklace corrupting her. Maybe she should just wish for her foster brother to be kind to her. However, the necklace wanted to play a prank of its own and:</span></div></div>",

It was as if he'd been engaged in foreplay for hours with the sexiest woman imaginable, and yet he hadn't climaxed -- no release, no chance to relax.  He wanted to laugh, he wanted to scream, he wanted to moan with ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment still able to focus on something beyond his own pleasure, he saw that he wasn't the only one so affected.

There were many other college students, who Steven didn't know.  Completely unaffected, most hurried on, trying to ignore their ridiculously excited fellow scholars.

I hope others still add :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, Dutch91<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What you should read)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's 18+, but there are some rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) DON'T write something like an underage sex orgy, sexual things with kids, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) NO bashing other authors or something drastically inappropiate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Also, remember the focus of the story is basically random events. So, be as crazy as you want. Preferrably do not do the same type of thing over and over. Growth, age regression, whatever is fine, but if you add multiple chapters, please add all kinds of random chapters not just the same thing over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Sex is allowed, just don't be too descriptive (as in, don't dedicate a whole chapter to description of it...at least have crazy choices that affect the whole story or something). (Except when noted otherwise)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: In \"College Craziness\" (See Option 5 on the main page, follow to Option 3), you can be as descriptive as you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Please refrain from lots of swearing and usage of the word f*** or anything overly offensive (just use discretion, if not, I may lightly edit).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, with those out of the way, below is stuff about the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, the story may get kind of crazy so you have been warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story, you start off as a 17 year old student named Steven. You find a necklace in a dumpster and try it on. When you put it on, you find that you can change anyone and anything. Fun, right? Well, maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause anything you even remotely think about happens. Let's say you're watching a cartoon. Then you think about a character from it. The character becomes REAL. Anything can change or become real. Anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, to top that off, if someone else gets the necklace...then they become the one changing everything. And if the necklace is broken, the world stays crazy (until it's fixed, if you want).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, the more the necklace is used, the more it uses itself. In other words, things will go crazy by themselves as time goes on (the changes will still be based off the character wearing it, but they can't control them if they are wearing the necklace).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the craziness the necklace makes, some characters may be scared to use it, since it may change things in ways they don't want. For example, if someone uses the necklace to save a puppy...but somewhere in their mind they're thinking of snakes, you could make it rain snakes. Or have the puppy become a snake. You can screw over the characters as much as you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, deaths/end of story chapters are allowed (ANYTHING is allowed) but, if the person with the necklace dies or loses it, just continue the story from whoever now has the necklace (or in some cases, it may be more interesting to continue the story from points of view of those trying to avoid things that happened because of the necklace...or something along those lines). Of course, if something so horrible happens that the story will end, then please leave at least one choice that can continue the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, if you write in this, be as crazy as you want to be. If you want to make your favourite anime become part of the real world, go ahead. If you want your favourite comic book supervillain to go on a rampage, do it. Whatever fiction you can think of, you can incorporate. Also, feel free to allow whoever is wearing the necklace to change anything and anyone, including themselves (transformation fun!). And if you want, give the necklace to a fictional character...see what fun you can have there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you use fictional characters that you think not everyone may know, leave BRIEF descriptions of them in the chapter you first have them in. That way, people who don't know much about the character can still write about them. When I say brief, you can incorporate some need-to-know details into your writing. Just don't copy and paste wikipedia or something. (On the other hand, if you want to write about a character you don't know much about, just pull up wikipedia first. Sure, they aren't the most reliable source, but anything goes here, right? Or just find out about these characters in a different way, I'm only suggesting wikipedia)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a list of the initial characters (remember, the cast can and will change vastly):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven is a 17 year old high school student. He has a stash of comics from when he was a kid (and maybe still likes them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel is a 12 year old, and Steven's little sister who highly enjoys anime and video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's mom and dad never seem to be around, but feel free to include them (even in changed capacity...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill is the 17 year old school head cheerleader and Steven really, REALLY likes her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin is Steven's 16 year old best friend, though maybe he watches too much TV and reads too many books (even though some people think that is contradictory).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia is the protagonist from The Necklace's Beginning, the prequel. She's now 17. However, it seem in her appearances in these stories...she's different. Something has changed about her...be it good or bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, you can and probably will change the cast. There are no limits in story terms (other than the aforementioned \"If the story has to end, leave one option to continue it\" and \"If someone else gets the necklace, continue from their point of view\").  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have to put something crazy though, go ahead, just think before you write. Check the rules at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it is 18+, I don't want anything that could offend many people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll be checking these updates, so if someone goes too far I may either a) edit/delete them or b) mail them or c) both. But I really don't want to, just go nuts but at least have some decency when you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I can say now is go crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Below are updates, contest winners, etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"> <br>\r\nUPDATES:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpdate - I previously said I would not add anymore.
