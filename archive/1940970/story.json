Cody opened a box of Oreos and began stuffing them down his throat. Zack then opened a bag of chips and started to stick his hand in the bag and put the chips in his mouth. When they were both done, they would move on to the next item on the menu. Cody grabbed two boxes of twinkies and started sucking them down one by one. He didn't even keep track of how much he ate. Meanwhile, Zack began to munch on some ice cream and continued to until the box was empty. Both twins kept on doing this with multiple snacks until it was finally midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a great day,\" Zack said to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it. I like being able to relax,\" Cody said while he grinned with food around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know you can do that more,\" Zack mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely will this summer. I just want to take it easy,\" Cody said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will! Don't worry. Man, we ate a ton,\" Zack said and looked around the room to see multiple wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.

His face was a bit fuller, and he looked pudgy, with a tiny belly forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack had clearly gained more though, and he was becoming quite a pig. He was already gaining a second chin, and he had a tiny pair of moobs already. His stomach was quite large, and his ass was even bigger, as big as two overfilled basketballs, nearly splitting his boxers, which were loose before. His arms and legs were now past pudgy, and were close to being downright fat. Overall, Zack had gained quite a bit for one week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is great!\" Zack said, releasing a belch afterwards. \"I actually like this new weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody responded, \"It's definitely worth it for all the relaxing we're doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody thought about it, and he decided to completely let go, given Zack's current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were playing video games, Zack had an idea.

Cody had got dressed in Zack's clothing which is strange that his own would not fit anymore, but fits perfectly on Zack's clothing range as far as size is concerned.  He knew he was getting a head start and he would go from his brother's advice and head out while he can.  It was weird to think he's going to get fatter, rather than try and stay in weight as he could.  But the enjoyment of food and fatness meant that he could try and outrun Zack as much food as possible and the time starts now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Cody decided to go out with some of the candies he bought from Maddie's candy stall in the lobby from earlier and instead of walking towards the place Zack recommended him to go, he decides to take a taxi, so that he doesn't want to burn off the fat while walking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I know there are tons of fattening foods around here, but I'm not sure which one's the best option?  But whatever I choose, I can find another to get myself fat as quickly as possible.\"  Cody thought of himself while he had some reflection time while being seating at the cab to drive through the streets of Boston.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had time to have a look at his belly which he was the same weight as Zack started things off, and no matter how long it took his brother to gain weight, he could catch him and maybe outrun him as challenging as it sounds clear.  Soon, Cody reached his destination and hopped off the cab to enter the first place to eat, but which one was it though?</span></div></div>",

The thought of chicken tenders, cheeseburgers, french fries, apple pie, and all made his stomach growling. He started to daydream of the food just entering his mouth and going right to his stomach. As he was thinking about this, an employee came to him to wake him up from his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir are you ready to order?\" The employee said a little annoyed. Cody barley waking up responded with a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I will have three Big Mac's, two orders of fries, five apple pies, and an extra large drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" For here or to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It'll be for here.\" As he finished his sentence, the employee's eyes widened. It was one little boy who would eat all this food and not share it with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That will cost fifty dollars and seventy five cents.\" Luckily Cody came plenty prepared. He brought five hundred dollars just to spend it on food and maybe some video games. He gave the waiter some money filled his drink to the brim with Mnt. Dew, and then sat down at the nearest table to where he was standing. It took about five minutes before the food was ready, but it was worth the wait. As soon as he smelt the food infront of him, he couldn't help but dig in right away. He started of with the fries and finished surprisingly quickly. He shoved in ten at a time. Then he ate the Big Macs without hesitation. He did have some straining from doing so, but he had to ignore it if he wanted to beat Zack at fatness. His stomach started to expand and expand more. It started to hurt because of too much food. Nevertheless, Cody kept eating away at the food before him. Cody eventually finished the burgers and the the apple pies. When finished, Cody chugged down the soda with no stop. He sucked on the straw with no straining and tried to get as much of the drink into his gut as possible. He finished the drink and by then everyone could notice his body had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was really fat, maybe even fatter than Zack. His face was definitely more squishy and he had two chins, if he looked down three. His moobs were now plump and jiggly. His arms along with his legs were now really fat. He had a visibly fat ass and horribly so. His stomach as now the size of three fully blown basketballs. He thought he had done a great job. Cody decided that he would leave his trash on the table and just leave. As he was standing up, he heard so many tears in his shirt, pants, and even his underwear. Earlier today the boxers were loose around his former state, but now there was a hole right in butt crack. He left there as soon as possible. He called another taxi and hopped in. He went back to his suite, and by now, his shirt and pants had ripped right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody is now home and now what will happen to him?</span></div></div>",

This gain was nothing however, compared to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Cody had devoted himself to the contest, and because of this, he had practically inflated outwards. He matched Zack's size, and then some. His stomach and moobs were now quite noticeable, and his rear end had filled out. His limbs were now quite pudgy, and a slight double chin formed under his rounding face. When the two weighed in, Cody was, in fact, four pounds heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was fine with it, though, as he was very confident in himself, having been the fatter twin. He knew it would be easier for him anyway, and was ready to begin the concert. The two had just refilled their stock of food, and they had even created a massive pile of non-perishable food to last them a while.

Of course, Zack's happiness at his constant indulging might have been dented if he'd been worried - or even knew - about his figure and health. The countless meals, snacks, dinner parties with interviews by his mother who was now becoming quite famous, buffets, takeouts and midnight feasts which he sneaked from the fridge at night after his mother had gone out to sing, had taken their toll in added inches and pounds. Fresh blubber surged from his already overstuffed, overblown and obese body. Fat piled upon fat that rested on fat. Every inch of his soft, pampered body seemed to be drowning in the flabby flesh that piled on and on as he ate and ate and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was like a ball, bulging out from the front, the back, and the sides with his thick flab. His long haircut emphasized his moon-shaped face. Years of gorging had swollen him to impressive proportions and consuming enough food to feed a small African nation barely dented his raging hunger. The previous day's dinner had been the culmination of a week's worth of unrivalled gluttony for him, and it would take more than bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffles, and sausages to satisfy the bloated boy's greed. Enabled by his oblivious mother and plumpening brother, Zack had unleashed his hedonistic appetites, surrendering himself completely to his lust for overindulgence and excess. Every whim of his ravenous belly had been satisfied, every desire of his overfed body attended to; in fact, this was the first day that Zack had been out of bed for the entire week as he and Cody had stayed in bed playing video games all week and Cody, being the best chef, had only left to make them food. Days spent eating with wild abandon had left Zack almost beyond self-control \u2013 he was a slave to the demands of the gluttonous daemon that dwelt within the depths of his monstrously swollen stomach and he had clearly reached a new level of obesity whilst under the influence of his brother's constant onslaught of food. Sure, he was used to overeating every day, there was no denying it, but recent experiences had heightened his gluttonous tastes to a new peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks were bulging, his chins were swollen and he wore a blue World of Warcraft t-shirt that his spreading, jiggly belly - which was a pale roll of jelly that flopped down onto his lap - was practically bursting out of. He'd grown a plump set of man-boobs that stretched the shirt around the neck; the sweat pants he wore were equally strained and Cody knew, without a doubt, that the prodigious expansion of Zack's gut meant that even his largest pair of jeans could no longer hope to button; he'd wrestled with them for an hour that morning and had only succeeded in covering himself in sweat and getting the jeans wedged halfway up his thighs; being unable to squeeze into them was the reason Zack was in a pair of sweat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody, despite having started the week as someone barely avoiding anorexia, had swollen like his brother; just as huge, flabby and wide, he sat at the table, shirtless and in sweat pants, shovelling Yorkshire Puddings into his mouth. Carey had, at the beginning of the week, left for six months to do a tour in France, trusting her two sons to look after themselves and not ever imagining that they would expand in weight by so much in so short a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody burped and Zack followed seconds later; both reclined in their chairs, their hands on their bellies, stuffed, glutted and sated - or at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Zack was definitely the more laid back twin when one compared the two. He was the one that always got the ladies, the one who didn't listen to the rules, and the one who did whatever he wanted to do, especially when it came to eating. That was definitely going to be the case for this break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince winter break just started off for him and his brother the day before, it was time for them to have a few weeks to relax without any schoolwork whatsoever. Earlier in the week, Zack ha already been thinking about what he wanted to do over break: nothing. He wanted to just lay around the hotel, play some video games, watch television, and eat whatever he wanted. He knew he could get away with all of it too since Carrie was busy around this time of year performing Christmas shows for a mini hotel tour in a couple of states. Zack's only obstacle would be Cody, but that wasn't much of an intimidation for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack walked out of his room in boxers while he scratched his stomach. Zack had always been a little bigger than Cody, but only by fifteen pounds. As he did this, he went over to the refrigerator and began to think about what he wanted to eat. Without much debate, he came up with an idea. He grabbed a big bowl, got some Oreo ice cream out of the refrigerator, and then filled the bowl with ice cream, chocolate sauce, chocolate chips, and even added cookies to it to make it more sweet. After that, Zack sat down and watched some television. He looked at his ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice cream for breakfast? I could do this,\" Zack said as he sweet talked his way into eating the calorie monster that was his breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack began eating until all that was left in the bowl were remains of chocolate sauce which he began to lick up.</span></div></div>",

Ever since he was younger, Cody would bake a bunch of delicious treats that everyone around would munch down on. This break, he wanted to bake as much as possible since not only did he enjoy it, but he wanted to become even better at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack slowly came out of the bedroom looking crabby as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you dork?\" Zack said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't call me that!

He came back and grabbed another slice. Cody only smiled as he baked some more delicious goodies.

They wobbled as Zack jumped up and down, but they wouldn't go up any further. Zack grabbed his belly again and noticed it felt a little softer than a few weeks ago, it also seemed bigger. It just covered the rim of his underwear. Zack, amazed that he was gaining weight, waddled over to the bathroom mirror and looked at his reflection<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely noticeable to the untrained eye, but Zack's belly definately looked bigger and pudgier.

Although all of that happened, Zack still didn't feel right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Zack was a key player, but he wasn't feeling satisfied out of sports. He didn't feel like he had the same drive as he used to. This was the time for kids to sign up for sports again, but this time, Zack came to a conclusion: he was done with sports. He wanted to find out what made him really happy. One of those things was eating, which made him think even more. He could eat a lot, but would he really be okay if he started to fatten up? He knew how his family would react, but he didn't really care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he and his brother walked out of their first day of school, Cody began to ask Zack some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to do the same sports again this year?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, no. I'm not doing sports anymore,\" Zack said in a positive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Cody said sounding very shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I said it. I'm done.

Eating two of the cakes from the bakery every day, even on school days, was now a norm for him, and occasionally, he would even eat three or four a day. The people at the bakery noticed, but they didn't mind, as long as they were getting paid. When Zack was not at school, he was in only his boxers, often with stains on his face and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as his physique, his originally chubby self paled in comparison to what he looked like now. To begin with, his arms and legs were now beginning to look fat, and they jiggled slightly with every movement. His hands and feet were just a bit poofed out, and his face was fuller and rounder, with a double chin that was visible all the time unless Zack looked up. His moobs were now quite sizable, and they rested on the main attraction, his belly. Now, instead of sticking out a bit, Zack's belly hung over, obscuring the front part of the waistband of his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the sudden influx of weight, most of Zack's old clothes didn't fit well, but he still was able to fit them on. As time went by, more and more of Zack's belly was showing up between his shirt and pants. Cody had basically given up at this point, as he knew that there was no getting to Zack now. As for Zack, he had miraculously remained oblivious to his weight gain, and he seemed happier, albeit quite a bit lazier. Around school, he was still quite popular. Cody was expecting Zack's teammates and his old coach to get mad at him, but he was able to charm his way out of any negative repercussions. Much to Cody's annoyance, Zack was enjoying his life more than ever. Cody thought about telling Zack that he was getting fatter, trying to show him what was happening, and he decided...</span></div></div>",

If anything, he was supportive of his brother's new lifestyle, as Zack had really focused more in school, and his grades were starting to improve. Amazingly, with his charms, he was still the cool kid in school, and his friends didn't mind that he was getting fatter. They didn't want to let him know, though, because they were worried that he might get mad if they point it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week went on, Zack only ballooned out more, switching to three cakes per day most of the time. He did still spend most of his time at home in his boxers though, as most of his other clothes were getting tighter and tighter. Cody realized that Zack was finally fully aware of his gain, as he had brought new sweatpants and t-shirt. For the most part, that's all he wore when he wasn't home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have the foresight to buy new boxers, however, and now they struggled to hold in Zack's larger bottom. Over the week, Zack's second chin became even more prominent, with a third starting to develop when he looked down. His arms and legs jiggled with most movements, and his hands and feet were now quite puffy. His moobs were now even larger, each the size of a large orange, and his caboose had widened and filled out. Finally, his belly was disproportionately large, even for fat people, because he had eaten to his limits each time he ate, and it stuck out quite far in front of him, more than a foot, in fact, and it hung about halfway down to his knees. He didn't mind this, in fact, it was fairly clear that he was enjoying it, as sometimes, he would play with his belly, giggling a bit as it wobbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack had been thinking about it for a while, and he decided to tell Cody that __.

In all honesty, Cody was stressed with life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was such a smart, academic student. All of his classes were advanced, which made things very hard for him as he struggled to keep all A's for the semester. That, and he was frustrated with not being as great at things like his twin brother Zack. Cody was frustrated that Zack was the better athlete, the one that always got the girls, and the more popular one. Now that break just started, Cody finally knew that he had had enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody wanted to actually enjoy himself for once. He didn't want to think about his grades, his brother, or anything for that matter. This break, he was going to let loose with everything and enjoy the finer things in life. The main thing Cody wanted to do was eat. Everyday, he was so concerned about keeping a healthy body that he never got to enjoy food like his brother did. Now, it was going to be his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked home, he stopped when he was about to pass by a bakery, as he began to feel hungry, he walked inside. He looked at all of the food available as his eyes immediately looked towards the donuts. There were at least twenty different types of donuts. Cody wanted them all for his enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I help you with, kid?\" The baker asked Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me one of every kind of donut!\" Cody said as he handed the baker his money with a pleasured smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was not kidding when he said he wanted to let loose.</span></div></div>",

The first couple went down with extreme ease as Cody enjoyed the savory taste of sugar that was going down his throat. Usually, Cody never really had such a sweet tooth, but because of the donuts, he felt that his sweet tooth had been awaken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I eat these for so long?\" Cody said as he grabbed a donut with each hand and took a bite out of each one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was lucky that he was still skinny because at this moment, he really did look like a pig with how messy his eating was. But, no matter what, Cody didn't really care since this was his chance to finally let loose. This was the one time that Cody did not care about the results from his mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an hour of eating and over a thousand calories later, Cody put the twentieth donut in his mouth and began to chew. Part of him felt very full, but for the most part, Cody felt very accomplished with how much he had eaten. He put his hands on his belly, which he noticed was more swollen out than usual. He then realized that this was the start of a pot belly, which was something that Zack had had for years. Cody wondered what he should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is break. Why can't I let loose some more? I can always work out,\" Cody said with confidence as he pulled his hat down more on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sometimes, things are easier said than done.</span></div></div>",

He kept on making trips to donut shops, McDonalds, and even some places in the local mall. The workers would see him a decent amount, but only knew him as the kid wearing a brown puffy tasseled winter hat, and as the customer who liked to eat food. After a little while, Cody's body began to feel the effect, especially one morning when he got out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing like normal, Cody stretched his arms out and let out a big, loud yawn. Then, he moved his legs to the side of his bed. He then began to scratch at his head, but then realized he had his hat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. Zack probably put it on me last night since I left it on the floor,\" Cody said with a sly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rolled out of bed, he felt a gentle breeze as he only had his underwear and hat on. Before he went into his closet, he passed by a mirror. As soon as he looked at it, he stopped and began to observe himself: Cody looked fatter. His arms puffed out a little bit more than usual while his hands did not look as boney. He looked and saw that he was beginning to develop a second chin even when he didn't move his neck. He then looked down at his belly to see that it was noticeable as it stuck out more than ever. Overall, Cody has definitely gained some weight. If anything, he was probably the same weight as Zack.</span></div></div>",

It was warm, soft and jiggly, and for some reason, Cody found it quite pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess letting myself go isn't so bad after all!\" Cody exclaimed, summarizing his new outlook on his weight gain. Either way, once he said that, Zack burst into the room, shirtless, slapped his twin brother's belly playfully with his own, then he said, \"I knew you were gaining weight!

He had a feeling that Cody was liking his gain, given that Cody wasn't stopping, and he finally decided to stuff Cody himself. He wanted to make sure that Cody would be hooked on fattening foods, so while Cody was asleep, he bought a whole bunch of foods: cakes, doughnuts, fried chicken, and all sorts of fattening foods, mostly fried, were spread across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought Cody into the dining room, and as soon as Cody smelled the food, his stomach betrayed him, growling loudly for Zack to hear.

Now, the two didn't really do the blindfolded stuffing anymore, as Cody was now perfectly willing to submit. Zack just stuffed Cody to his heart's content, and Cody really enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, their mother Carey was concerned about this, but, seeing that the two were bonding through it instead of bickering was a welcome relief, so she just kept an eye on them occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was massive, though. Now, his belly stuck out a lot, and was the dominant feature of his new body. It was topped with a pair of shapely moobs, and a double chin that was approaching a triple chin. His rear-end was huge, and more or less matched his belly. Finally, his arms and legs were stocky and thick, and his thighs rubbed together, turning walking into a slow waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult for Cody to keep up in terms of clothes, so a little over a week ago, he got a pair of massive sweatpants that nearly fell off of him, and a massive white t-shirt, and now, he filled the sweatpants up, and his shirt rode up just enough to show his now cavernous belly-button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, which just started this week, Zack was much more protective of his brother, especially due to his weight.

Could you eat this for me?\" Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck no!\" Cody snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Zack mimicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it is unhealthy and sugary,\" Cody said as he sounded like he was going to lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's made with sugar free and fat free products. Plus what if it wasn't? You are the skinnier twin and you wouldn't gain a pound eating it at all. In fact, I lost a few eating this,\" Zack said as he lied about everything in that sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is it a product from a weight loss company,\" Cody asked intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! It's.... Um...... Weight Watchers!\" Zack lied again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Cody said as he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it,\" Zack tempted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later with nervous eyes, Cody took the plate, grabbed the thousand calorie sandwich, and took a crispy bite from it. He chewed it for a minute until his face lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is delicious!\" He said as he continued to eat it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you!\" Zack said as he was dying on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Cody finished eating the whole thing as he swallowed it down. He still felt hungry and Zack could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you make me another?\" Cody asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course,\" Zack said in a cheesy tone as he went up to the counter and prepared another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Hey, I like this healthy food. You should start making this stuff more for me. I'll eat it,\" Cody said with a very happy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Zack's face lit up with his scheme in full action. After preparing the sugary sandwich, he gave the second sandwich to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, consider me your chef,\" Zack said with an evil grin while Cody took another bite. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a whole week, Zack played his role as Cody's \"healthy\" chef. He kept on giving him food that Cody stupidly thought was healthy, but was just the opposite. Zack planted a seed in Cody's head by saying that a lot of weight watcher food looks and tastes like it is unhealthy but it really is healthy. Of course, Zack was lying every time he made this statement or similar ones. Even though Cody was smart, he just kept on believing his brother over and over again. Cody ate foods such as ice cream with sauces snide he was told it was skinny ice cream, he ate chicken that he was told came out of a box, but was actually deep fried, and other foods that were unhealthy also slipped by Cody's mouth. The funniest one to Zack was when he told Cody that he had made a healthy weight loss shake for him that was chocolate flavored. What it really was made out of was vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce and chips, whole milk, weight gain powder, and a pack of double stuffed Oreos. Each night, Zack would laugh crazily to himself as he saw his brother's figure slowly begin to morph. His flat stomach that indented was now sticking out to form a pot belly. Zack also noticed how he was starting to get a fuller face as a second chin was already developing and his cheeks looked more stuffed. Zack also saw how his brother's butt looked more rotund than usual as it looked more prominent through his tighter pants. All in all, he had at least gained fifteen pounds after a week of \"dieting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, on the other hand, was making great progress in his weight loss regression. He looked more skinny in his stomach. His back side looked like it was shrinking as his pants looked baggier on him. Not to mention the fact also that his face looked smaller, it seemed Zack was doing well so far and was proud that he was finally losing weight. At the moment, he and his brother were the same size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if Zack chose to have it his way, it would be the last time that it would ever be that way. He wanted to stuff Cody like a fat sausage into childhood obesity. By then, it would be too late as he would eat himself to a point where he would be sustainable to glut on his own. Then someday, he would be immobile and stuck forever to eat his sorrows away. Zack knew that this could be a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, he needed Cody to not realize what is happening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luckily for Zack, he got just what he wanted, and Cody remained oblivious to both his filling out frame and the unhealthiness of the food that caused the filling out. Because of this, Cody gladly accepted all of Zack's fattening cooking. In fact, every time Cody ate, he didn't bother to hold back. He enjoyed the unhealthy food so much that he ate until he was full, and then some. Because of that, his appetite would grow slowly day by day, to Zack's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next week, the stuffing on Cody's part would continue, and by the end of the week, he had four \"weight loss\" shakes a day. This was a pain for Zack, who had to keep buying food to satisfy his brother, but it was well worth it to see his brother balloon out. Cody's pot belly was now large enough to lift his shirt slightly, and he was beginning to develop moobs. His pants now barely fit, especially around his growing bubble-butt, and his face was now filled out, a small second chin resting under his rounder face. Because his appetite was getting bigger, Zack guessed that Cody may have gained as much as twenty-five pounds or even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, on the other hand, could be considered barely more than skinny, and because of this, he decided to finish his weight loss regiment. He was clearly the lighter brother now, and he was very surprised that Cody didn't catch on. Either way, he was so proud of his own progress that he even considered building muscle mass, just to rub it in his brother's face even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last night of the week, Zack was making his way to his bedroom when he saw the bathroom door cracked open, and the bathroom light was on, with Cody mumbling something. Curious, Zack crept up to the door, gently pushing it open as to minimize any noise. He then saw his brother clad only in boxers, which were skin-tight, and could see the full impact of his fattening regiment. Cody could see this too, and he was now aware of what had happened to him. Zack couldn't hear what his brother was mumbling, but it was clear that...</span></div></div>",

His face still flashed a beet red, though, as his slightly-hard parts were completely exposed, his belly hanging down a bit, but not far enough to cover them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the dilemma, Zack comforted his brother, saying, \"It's alright. It's not like I don't have one myself!\" as he caught a glimpse, and was slightly jealous of his brother, who was more well-hung than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat remark comforted Cody, who said, \"It looks like there's already no turning back!\" Zack, even though he wasn't quite sabotaging his brother, was still eager to fatten up his brother. There was just something about it that Zack liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Cody's stomach growled, and Zack said, \"You want something to eat?\" with a grin.

I've been playing along since I realized that fattening food was so good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was somewhat surprised about this, but then he asked, \"What about the health concerns that you keep preaching about?\" Cody answered, \"There's always medicine, and besides, you could take care of me if things get bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was surprised by that answer, as he showed Cody how he made the fattening food. \"That's surprisingly clever, for you!\" Cody remarked, excited to have more of Zack's food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Cody was handed his food, he devoured everything in sight.

That food hit the spot,\" Cody said while he continued to rub his bare belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody began to burp and let out slight hiccups from eating so quickly.

I mean at this rate, you will be bigger, but I can help in the mean time,\" Zack said as he walked to his room while Cody followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take a look,\" Cody said as he looked in Zack's closet. He looked as his brother had varieties of jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, and other clothing. He also saw how Zack had a ton of hats. One of them was a black beanie with a ball attached to it. He took it and wore it as he stood naked otherwise. Zack watched and was surprised to see all this. He liked to see it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like Cody was turning into who Zack used to be.</span></div></div>",

No turning back,\" Cody said to himself as he left the bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, he began to walk to the food court to see what he could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what food could make me the fattest,\" Cody wondered as he waddled and people looked at him with more mixed emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then arrived at the food court and looked around. He saw McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, and KFC. His mind began racing as he liked them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm here, I might as well go all out,\" Cody grinned as his chins scrunched up together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to order from each place. From McDonalds, he bought a Big Mac meal. He then went to Burger King and purchase a double whopper meal. After that, he went to Wendy's and ordered a Baconator and a frosty. Finally, he went to KFC and ordered a six piece bucket of fried chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat down, he began to eat. He forgot to take off his jacket and noticed it when he got hot. He took it off. To him, he was himself. To others, he was a fat boy in small clothing and a winter hat pigging out into gluttony. </span></div></div>",

He was going from chubby to obese very fast as the days went on. Zack looked at himself and noticed that he was getting very muscular. He grew out his hair a tiny bit since he wanted to look more like a skateboarder, but his body looked very toned. Maybe he would go out for football or wrestling. He wanted to do something.

I'm going to the sports store,\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come? Need a new skate board with your millions of dollars?\" Cody mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny. No. I'm actually going to find weight loss supplements,\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack had always been the bigger twin. He was probably twenty pounds heavier than his brother. He wanted to finally be as thin, if not thinner, as Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess call me when you are done. Or I could just meet you at the suite,\" Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go with the second one,\" Zack said as he began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked around the mall and into the windows of the shops. So far, there were no helped wanted signs. Cody was about to give up fifteen minutes in until finally, he struck gold.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, after a while of looking, Cody saw a sign in a window of a place that read the infamous words: \"Help Wanted.\" He looked above the establishment to see what kind of business it was. To his avail, the sign read \"Larry's Bakery: Cakes, ice cream, and specialties.\" Cody had felt dreary at the fact that the establishment was a bakery because desserts are very unhealthy. However, he knew being the smart kid that he is, he could avoid temptation if it was for the benefit with money. Quickly, he walked into the parlor to find a man cleaning up the front counter. Another person was behind the counter. She looked to be about Cody's age as well. She was in street clothes herself with a pink and blue mixed hat with a puff on top, a light blue jacket, and gloves. Her brown hair fell down to her shoulders which matched her tan skin. As Cody got out of his daze, he walked up to the man while the girl headed into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you? Our special today is a slice of our lemon tart,\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody observed his name tag and found his name was Larry, which meant he was the owner of the parlor. He was in his early forties with combed back brown hair, small bits of wrinkles, and a masculine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. My name is Cody Martin. I saw that you had a help wanted sign in the window,\" Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do! You see, I usually run the place along with my bakers, but we like to put out as many eccentric things as possible. Would you be up for the experience?\" Larry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! What possible job would this involve?\" Cody asked intelligently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to get out those unique products, we need people to taste test our food. It's many different kinds, but well worth it. What would you think?\" Larry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's definitely sweet,\" Cody said as he deep down felt concerned about gaining weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could continue to speak, the girl walked out of the bathroom and back to Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody, this is Shea. She is our newest employee and she would be working with you as a tester,\" Larry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Shea said with a wave and a grin to Cody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody got lost in her beautiful brown eyes and her pearly while smile. He would work beside her? He only had one answer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the job!\" Cody said immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll get you the paperwork and then we can get you both started today,\" Larry said as he went to the back and grabbed job applications for both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, it was quiet since they were both filling out their paperwork. But Cody knew that they would have plenty of time to talk as they taste tested food.</span></div></div>",

But, he was hoping, maybe this time would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you from?\" Cody asked nonchalantly. Then he thought of how stupid he sounded since of course they are both from Boston.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have always lived around here. I live in the Ritz plaza just by the Tipton.

I went to Saint Patrick's private academy. But, I am transferring this next semester to Boston High,\" Shea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was amazed. Saint Patricks was the best private school around, which meant she was really smart. But another fact amazed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boston High? You'll be going to the same school as me!\" Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I will have one friend,\" Shea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will I,\" Cody smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of conversation, Larry called them in to the back.

But the only way he would make that happen if he could at least give himself a try by eating junk food and see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo recently, Cody was down at the basement when no one else was around when he had to make some inventions to make it happening for him eating more.  When more was in his mind though, that's what he was thinking of making a clone machine out of food he can multiply any amount of junk food whatever he likes.  Even if he was full that he would still eat anything like his brother, Zack does nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt him days to make a invention which is all but a remote controller he could easily use.  But he finished it just as his stomach was starting to get hungry since he didn't have anything for breakfast this morning.  The good news was Zack was away to skateboarding with friends and his mother Carey was out to do some shopping and usual rehearsals which could take a while for her to get back to the room.  Cody is now on his own when he would be back, and it got him a better idea to actually go back to his room and test it out for himself to see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Cody five minutes to get back to his room, from basement to floor 23 is a long wait for get through.  He looked around just to make sure everyone's out for now by checking out the rooms, but no sign and Cody gives himself a sigh of relief and gets on with the breakfast.

Heck, he'd even told Maddie to take a few boxes of each to try so she knew what she was recommending to guests!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maddie munched away on the cookies n creme flavor mindlessly on this particularly slow day on the counter, she was trying to figure out how much money she'd need for a new dress to the Christmas party in a few months that she could hopefully then tweak slightly for prom, that way she could spend a little more on the dress rather than buying two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she could probably ask London for one of her designer rejects and make something out of it, but she always loved that feeling of buying something special with her own money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree bars eventually turned into four as she ran the numbers, figuring out that if she started saving now at the start of the semester she'd be able to get her dream dress by Thanksgiving. Little did she know the impact those bars would have on her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne her shift was over, she was surprised she'd managed to munch on one of each bar in total without even realizing. She shrugged it off and told herself that her pretty figure would be fine, the bars were called Nutri-barz after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie grabbed a box of each bar flavor and headed home, still munching. By the time she got home, her family had settled in front of the television to watch some late night soap opera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the refrigerator, she saw a small and large portion of meatloaf casserole. Instinctively, her hand went for the small portion before her stomach grumbled <i>huh</i> Maddie thought <i>I didn't realize i was so hungry!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Maddie shrugged it off thinking nothing of it as she went for the large portion, heating it up in the microwave and pouring herself a large glass of milk. Once it was all heated up she sat down at the worn kitchen table and dug in as her parents' attention was on her brothers fighting over who was the strongest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie managed to clear the plate and finish her milk, cleaning up after herself before heading up to her room with the candy bars. That night as she fantasized about her dress, she munched on another two bars before falling to sleep, her very full and bloated belly sticking out ever so slightly.</span></div></div>",

She had been playing basketball months prior. She went for a jump shot, and someone else ran into her making her fall wrong on her foot. This shattered her ankle to pieces and created a huge problem. After months of physical therapy, and even surgery, progress was coming along, but it was still certain that Max had to hang up her shoes and not play basketball anymore. She had a feeling about that from the start, but this didn't change her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was still the same old tomboy with her loose fitting clothing, a black beanie, tan skin, and a slick attitude. However, over the last few months, since Max wasn't exercising like she used to, she had put on a few pounds. By a few, it was no more than ten. You could see a tiny hint of a double chin that was as minuscule as an ant in a kitchen. Some other parts of her body had gotten bigger from this, for example, her boobs, stomach, and arms. However, she was still in considerably decent shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much better does it look?\" Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, you are to the point where you can now walk on it with no cautions of hurting your ankle any further. However, it is not the same as before,\" the doctor told her flat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can she play any sports? I know that winter basketball is starting up soon,\" her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone can no matter what. However, if she does, she will be in major amounts of pain. She wouldn't be able to handle it,\" the doctor continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..... It's over?\" Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so. I can't sign you off to compete in these sports. It's for your own safety and health,\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Max looked down and cried a tear, but she quickly acted strong and held herself together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Doctor. We will see you soon,\" her mother said soon enough as the appointment ended and they both walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sweetie,\" Max's Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I just need to find a new hobby,\" Max said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know you will,\" she said as she hugged her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom, I am going to go to the mall if that's okay. Can you please drop me off there?\" Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" her mother smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of driving, they arrived at the mall as Max's Mom dropped her off and drove away.

She hardly felt her ankle but knew for sure she wasn't going to play basketball for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Max. Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax looked up and saw Tapeworm, Zack and Cody. All three seemed happy to see her. She decided she might as well tell them. They would find out sooner or later she stopped the team so she might as well tell people now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you again Max. Then our team is finally ready again to win. Cody is hopeless.\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurtful.\" Cody said. \"Do you know there are some basketball players that use their high intellect to score?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but you're surely not one of them.\" Zack said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I need to tell you guys something.\" Max said. \"I... I... I stopped playing basketball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You can't stop. You're one of our best players. Without you we're stuck with Cody.\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I don't want to stop but the doctor warned me that I will be in serious pain if I do play. It won't be good for me. Believe me I love to play basketball and I don't want to let you down but I just can't play. I'm really sorry you guys. I really want to help you and I will be there but this time like audience. I will cheer for you but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax slowly bent over and the others heard some soft crying. That was kind of rare since Max was pretty tough and they never saw her cry before. Cody did her best to comfort her. After about a minute or two Max got herself back under control and sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry you guys. But who knows. Perhaps you will find a better player than me. Who knows! Cody might get better.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Cody? Get's better? Not a chance. We have a bigger chance with London becoming smart.\" Zack said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Again, hurtful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can still hang out with you guys, right? I must say I'm hungry. Who wants to grab a bite to eat?\" Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do!\" Tapeworm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Why not?\" Zack said looking at Max. \"Talking about eating Max, did you gain a little?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, you really don't know what to say to girls, do you?\" Max said but at the same time thinking that her clothes did feel a bit tighter. At home she might check her weight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's cheap and tasty,\" Tapeworm said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just like your attitude,\" Cody mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Cody quickly said back as they walked in McDonalds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapeworm approached the register first and ordered a cheeseburger with a large fry. Everyone else laughed at how little he got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can even eat more than that,\" Cody laughed as he began to order. He got three dollar menu mcdoubles, a large fry, and a snack wrap. Quite content with what he ordered, Zack came over with bigger ideas in mind. Zack ordered up one quarter pounder with a large fry, four mcdoubles, and a snack wrap, trying to show his dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you getting, Max?\" Cody wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than Zack is getting,\" Max said with a grin as she went up to the register. \"I'll take a double quarter pounder, a large fry, five mcdoubles, and two snack wraps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys looked at her in awe as she ordered and had a tab close to fifteen dollars. Zack went over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope that stomach of yours can hold it down,\" Zack taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Someone upset that I can eat more than them?\" Max mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not the one getting fatter,\" Zack said sharply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Zack, shut the hell up and lay off of her. You don't say that to a girl, especially such a great person like Max. Lay off,\" Cody yelled. Everyone got quiet and Max was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Max,\" Zack said as they all grabbed their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax would have replied, but she was so happy with Cody. Yes, she was tough, but no one rarely stuck up for her. She used to have a thing for Zack, but they went on a date and he turned out to be terrible. Maybe Cody would be different. Max sat down at their booth next to Cody. Max took off Cody's tassel hat to get his attention. She whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. No one has ever stuck up for me,\" she said and then slammed his hat back on. He smiled in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all began to be quiet as they ate in peace. Tapeworm and Cody ate a little slower, but Max and Zack did not let up. Cody kept on glancing over at Max as she got grease and mustard on her face. Mac noticed him glancing over, but kept on eating her over two thousand calorie meal. But the one thing that was satisfying her most of all was the fact that she was eating more than Zack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody and Tapeworm were done while Zack ate his last mcdouble. Max was now finishing her snack wraps. She stuffed them both in her mouth and let out a small moan as she was beginning to feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You ate more than us,\" Tapeworm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was great,\" Cody said with a grin to Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Zack said nothing as he was feeling bitter from earlier. Max felt satisfied as she was stuffed to the brim with food. She needed to weigh herself. And hopefully, she could figure something out and try dating Cody.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps there's nothing to worry about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at home in the bathroom. She was just in her bra and panties. She planned to weigh herself but was a bit worried. She was never worried about her weight before. There was't a reason for. All her clothes fitted her perfectly and she played basketball and was in great shape. But now everything was different. Her clothes felt tight, she did't played basketball for some time thanks to her ankle and she would't play basketball for a long time, She thought she was still in good shape. But would she stay in good shape now she stopped basketball.  She planned to weigh herself but was already staring at the scale for a minute like if it was a monster that would attack if you came near it.<br>\r\nMax slowly went over too the scale and stand on it and closed her eyes. She waited a few seconds and opened her eyes and looked at the number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5 pounds! I gained 5 pounds! I can't believe it. No wonder my clothes felt tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her head hung. She must admit that Zack had been right. She was getting fat. Normally she would't worry about it since she could work it of by playing basketball but now she stopped. Thinking about her huge meal at Mc Donalds she realized she might gain even more weight. All because of that stupid ankle. <br>\r\nShe got dressed and walked to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine now I can't play basketball, while I like that, and I'm getting fat and I can't work it of since I can't play basketball. I can't think of anything what can make this day worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she of course could do a different kind of exercise but for her it was playing basketball or no sport at all. She also dod't want to give the rest of the team the impression she left them for a other sport. But even if she did do something else like football or cheer leading would she still be able to do that?  She was't allowed to jump with her ankle and she knew cheerleader did do that a lot. If jumping was already bad for her ankle kicking a ball would be even worse.So playing a different sport was't a option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I really let my team down. But I would so much rather go on the field with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized feeling bad about it did't help. Perhaps she could better start thinking about something else. Like Cody. Did she really like him. She knew the twins for some time now and became good friends with both of them. All right she hang out more with Zack because He did't care about rules, was kind of cool, and pretty sportive. But Cody was never far away. But what kind of feelings did she have for Cody. He used to be.... just a friend. But after what happened in Mc Donalds she was't so sure any more. Did she really liked Cody. Also important was the question did he like her. If he did and she did to what did that mean. What did he and she have to do then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life is complicated when your in school. Parents think it's easy. That being a kid is a great Paradise. Well it's not. Everyone who say's that forget how it was to be a kid.\" She said to herself and sighed deeply. \"Why could't Zack hold his thought to his self. If he had't said anything I maybe would't even have weighed myself. At the other hand now I at least know I gained weight. Well it are just a few pounds. That can't be too bad right. But perhaps sitting here without playing and training basketball I gain more weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to image herself a lot fatter and went sitting up straight.      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Maxclosed her eyes, she tried to think to herself what being fat would look like and if she would look good with it. To start off with, Max envisioned what a bigger gut would look like on her. She imagined it as if she looked pregnant, making her look like she had a pot belly. Then, she tried to envision what herself with bigger boobs would be like. She tried to imagine herself with double D boobs instead of B. Then, she tried to add everything else into her vision by adding fat in her arms, a bigger but, a huge muffin top, and stuffed cheeks. After a good minute, Max had a clear vision in her head about a fatter version of herself. She was wearing the same clothes as now with her beanie and loose fitting clothing, except her clothes looked super tight. For fun, she imagined herself inflating as her whole body got bigger and fatter until finally, her clothes ripped. After a little bit, Max snapped out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That was done a little too well,\" Max analyzed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax thought about how she could picture every detail of her body getting bigger. Somehow, after all of the imagining, she kind of liked it. She liked the curiosity that came with being fat which involved not knowing how it would really turn out. Suddenly, her stomach began to growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some food,\" Max said as she went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked in the kitchen, she looked to the kitchen table and saw what she could munch on right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cupcakes!\" Max yelled as she saw the chocolate icing catch her eye. Slowly, she reached out with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, am I really going through with this?\" Max asked. At this point, she felt that if she ate the cupcakes, it would be the kiss of death and fattening up would be a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, her answer was revealed as she grabbed a cupcake, put it to her mouth, and ate it. Quickly, she shoved it down her throat and burped with triumph. She then took the nine other cupcakes and ate them one by one getting frosting in her face. When they were gone, she rubbed her more swollen gut in bliss and tried wiping the messy icing off her face. She grinned a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to become fat!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later Max was lying on her bed munching on donuts. She put  her plan to become ft really into action. She did't tell anyone about it. She did't want anyone to know. At least not yet. She was careful. She did eat more at breakfast and dinner but most what she did eat were snacks between like pretzels, cupcakes, cookies, chocolate and the donuts who she was eating now. She also went two times to the snack bar. She learned that gaining weight was't just how much you ate but what you ate. Of course that lesson was meant for losing weight but if it worked one way it would also work the other way around. Every day when her parents were out she ate a lot of high fat food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on belly. You need to grow. Get big and round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softly pat her belly. Since she always used to be thin it could take some time before she really would become fat or even chubby, but she felt her belly and noticed a bugle in it. So she did gain. She wanted to wait some more time before she weighed herself to see some real result.<br>\r\nA few pounds did't appeared in just a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it. Why is it so hard to gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned knowing that most other people screamed why it was so hard to lose weight. She felt like she was in a upside down world where everybody wanted to be thin but she wanted to be fat. <br>\r\nShe did't cared. She always was a outsider. She was a bit of a tomboy and was never really into make-up, dolls or dresses like most other girls and rather hang out with boys playing sports like basketball or doing crazy things with Zack and Cody. For some reason living around them was never boring. There was always going something on in their hotel. Of course it was mostly their fault and it drove Mr. Mosbey crazy.  <br>\r\n She rolled on her belly and started thinking of Cody. She did that a lot the past days. For some strange reason she started to like him. While she normally was second in line to tease him after Zack. Mostly because she liked the things he did. She sighed. Life was complicated for a tomboy, 12 year old girl, that was gaining and thinking about getting a boyfriend. <br>\r\nShe wolfed down the last donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men I'm still hungry.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her belly. It seemed like eating so much everyday did made her able to eat more each day. With this thought in her head she planned to eat a bit more after being full. If she kept that up she would be able to each day eat a bit more.<br>\r\nShe went down stairs and looked through the cupboards and found two bags of pretzels. She took both up to her room ans started eating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going so slowly.\" She mumbled with full mouth. \"There must be a easier way to gain weight. There has to be else there would't be so many fat people. Fat seems to be a world wide epidemic so there has to be a easier way to gain weight fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her sealing while she pushed pretzels in her mouth. She did notice her shirt seemed a bit tighter so she did gain weight but not near as much if she wanted. How was she able to gain more weight?   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Immediately, Max thought of a very smart idea. She went to her computer nearby and powered it on. She then went on to the internet and immediately typed in \"how to get fatter.\" Max knew this would be the easiest way to gain weight since other people would know more about the topic than she did overall. After looking, Max clicked on an article and began to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Here are some surefire ways to avoid a healthy lifestyle and pack on some extra blubber while you\u2019re at it. Each tip here has been proven effective at ridding you of a sexy lean body while simultaneously raising your BMI. Enjoy!</i> Well this sounds like it could help,\" Max said as she began to read on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sleep less. This is a trick which works for a number of reasons. Sleeping less will give your body less rest which will increase your stress throughout the day. Stress is not only a great motivator for eating, but it also increases levels of certain hormones that trigger weight gain. Another reason that sleeping less is great is that now you\u2019ll have more time to eat! For an extra pound or two, try gorging yourself with high calorie foods right before bed. These calories are more likely to be stored as fat!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax then continued on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Snack constantly. Who says that there are only 3 meal times in a day? Five or six meals a day are much better. However, if you can\u2019t get away 6 times a day for a meal, try munching on candy bars and sodas while you wait. A good rule of thumb is to always have some food in or on its way to your mouth.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, Max was very surprised with all the information, but she wanted to know more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Increase your meal portions. You simply aren\u2019t going to get fat eating small girly portions of food. A surefire way to pack on the pounds is to eat double of whatever you think you need. If you need help in this area, try ordering anything in a restaurant. It\u2019s almost certain that they will provide you with more than one serving of everything. Also, always remember to \u2019supersize it\u2019 any time you can. The average person can usually process about 700 calories per meal. Anything over that gets stored as fat almost immediately. That\u2019s just what you need to get your body to super-sized proportions quickly.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax continued on with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eat fried foods. French fries, fried chicken, fried onion rings, etc. are all good. When something is fried, it is literally soaked in oil which means lots of saturated fats. Saturated fats are not only great for gaining weight, but they are also great at giving you all kinds of health problems \u2013 particularly with your heart. If you can up your daily intake of fried potatoes, then you\u2019ll definitely have no trouble upping your weight.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax couldn't stop reading, but took a whole bunch of notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stop drinking water. Like the veggies, water just takes up precious space in the real estate of your gut. If you really want to get as fat as possible, you should stop drinking water all together. Some even speculate that drinking water can cause you to lose weight in and of itself. If there\u2019s no Coke around, reach for a sweet tea. If there\u2019s no sweet tea, reach for the maple syrup. Water must be avoided at all costs!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fact made Max really curious since maple syrup sounded really good at the moment. But, the next fact made her mouth water just from the wording. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eat fast food more often. Fast food restaurants are like the embassies of weight gain. These places not only serve the most fattening foods, they also genuinely want to help you in your commitment to put on fat. They provide cheap, fast, and extraordinarily fattening additions to the weight gain diet. Would you like fries with that? Heck Yes! How about a 64oz soft drink with your 1,000 calorie meal? Brilliant!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Max closed her computer and tried to think of what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carries capacity to eat and be satisfied has been on a steady rise and it wasn't the only thing that was on the rise her weight has been going up. When she first started singing at the hotel she weighed in at a small 120lbs now after five years of being able to have easy access to the kitchen and the all you can eat buffet, being friends with the head chef can have its advantages which later led to carrie being able to over indulge when e we she wanted and as a result her weight now dialed in at a nice 146lbs (for now). Carries body looked good with the new weight, fuller, rounder, more...womanly and thaks to her height the new weight made her even more popular among the guests, she had acquired a nice pair of newly plumbed up boobs going up a whole cup size going from a c to d and filling that cup to the max, moving down to her stomach with had lost all of its once strong definition,toneless and starting to round she had faint red lines that ran a cross her stomach from where her belly folded makeing small rolls of fat that spill over the waist of her jeans whenever she sat down,  her hips and butt weren't speard any of her new weight putting a few more inches any more inches and her thighs would be getting to know one another, up close and personal, all this giving her a nice hour glass look.<br>\r\n\"Man I can't believe I ate them all ready jeez I don't even remember eating them\"  her face went blank void from any emotion as she tried to remember......... nothing she couldn't remember eating them and yet she still wanted more. More and more she tried to remember the hungrier she got the room soon filled with the sound of Carries belly calling for more. Just as one of those calls sounded Cody walked through the front door allowing for the low rumble of his mothers hunger enter his ear. <br>\r\n\" wow Jesus mum you sound like you haven't eaten a thing in days\"  Cody walks over to the chair and takes the seat next to her and gives her a warm smile.<br>\r\n\" yeah I ....er.... Skipped breakfast\" the lie carrie told her son was better than the truth, that she had just ate a big bag of food and couldn't rember eating it the thourght alone filled her with embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"We'll then let me make you a nice bug lunch I've got a few things I'd like to try \" </span></div></div>",
